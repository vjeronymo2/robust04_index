			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The men are for turning: Major's government will continue to run scared until the recession begins to end The part-moratorium on pit closures announced in the Commons by Mr Michael Heseltine yesterday is a cry for help from a government that is running scared. The fear in the eyes of ministers reflects the fear in the hearts of many ordinary people: it is a fear of unemployment. Mr John Major and his colleagues are behaving like politicians on the run. On Sunday night those closest to the prime minister were summoned to an emergency gathering. This was followed by an emergency cabinet meeting yesterday morning. The foreign secretary, who should have accompanied the Queen on her visit to Germany, stayed behind until yesterday afternoon. The chancellor missed his appointment with European ministers of finance. They have all clearly had the fright of their lives. What remains open to question is whether they are afraid for the right reasons. Consider what has happened. A week ago Mr Heseltine, who has taken the title of president of the Board of Trade, said that 31 pits would close over the next five months, with the direct loss of 30,000 jobs. To the apparent surprise of the prime minister, and those of his cabinet colleagues who knew of the decision, that single announcement set off an explosion of public outrage that has yet to subside, in spite of yesterday's huge climbdown. Such was the force of this explosion that the talk over the weekend was of whether the Conservative government will survive (it will) and, more directly, whether Mr John Major will stay in office (he almost certainly will). The prime minister lost much of his authority when Britain was forced out of the exchange rate mechanism on September 16. His reputation has since been further damaged, first by the lack of preparation of public opinion for the coal closures, and then by yesterday's retreat. The question is - how damaged? To answer this we must establish why public disapproval of the government's initial decision was so intense. It had little to do with a national desire to preserve the coal mines. The dismissal of miners does arouse a sentiment in the middle classes that does not apply to other workers, many more of whom have been made redundant over the past decade than the number of pit-workers now under threat. The abrupt manner of Mr Heseltine's announcement, and the apparent intention to impose the first redundancies within a few days, added to the national sense of injustice. But I do not recall any march of the gentry of Cheltenham over the sacking of British Telecom employees, or the decimation of the steel industry's workforce. The real reason why Mr Major is in trouble is that he fought an election on the promise of an end to the recession, which he has failed to deliver. In the early summer, basking in the afterglow of his victory, he noted the happy stock markets and Treasury forecasts and mused about it being the best of all possible times in which to be prime minister. Confidence had been restored. The economy was on the move. The Maastricht treaty was in the bag. He would soon assume the responsibilities of Britain's presidency of the European Community. Later in the summer he even wondered whether the pound might overtake the D-Mark as the anchor currency of Europe. Being prime minister must have seemed almost as enjoyable an activity as watching Chelsea play football. Then everything began to go wrong. The Danes rejected the Maastricht treaty. That unleashed the dark forces within the Conservtive party - the diehard Thatcherites, the anti-Europeans, the lifetime members of the Bruges Group. The markets turned downwards again. Unemployment began to touch southern families, Conservative families, and the professional classes. House prices fell further. Television comedians began to tell jokes like, 'shop now while shops last'. The recession seemed endless. Mr Major, favoured by fortune until April 10, turned into that most doleful of all creatures, an unlucky prime minister. He stood firm against assaults on his close friend and heritage secretary Mr David Mellor, but Mr Mellor was driven out of office. He identified his personal authority with the defence of the D-Mark parity within the ERM, only to find sterling blown out of the water a week later. He has since seemed to manacle himself to a chancellor whose own credibility has been squandered. This sad tale has been accompanied by an extraordinary outburst of vituperation from the Conservative press, the very same gang that helped Mr Major win the election. I put this down only partly to the idiosyncracies of particular editors; the more significant factor may be that readers, gulled in April into a belief in economic good times under the Tories, have been expressing their disappointment. The tabloids have turned their fury onto the prime minister. So Mr Major is on the run. Nothing he has tried so far has worked. A dogged and super-patriotic speech at the Conservative conference was derided for its absence of passages on the economy. A one-point cut in interest rates last Friday was quickly seen for what it was: an attempt to buy off Tory backbenchers who were supporting the miners. An emergency meeting of heads of EC governments in Birmingham on the same day was thus overshadowed. It was subsequently exposed as a mere PR exercise. Now the prime minister is discovering, in a most painful and dramatic way, the true meaning of a parliamentary majority of 21. This is the second lowest Conservative majority since the war - only Churchill's 16 in 1951 was lower. Labour governments have struggled and nearly died on majorities of four (October 1974), five (1964), and six (1950) but Mrs Margaret Thatcher's great strength was bolstered by a majority of 44 in 1979, 144 in 1983 and 101 in 1987 - although the latter did not save her. A low majority gives strength to dissident backbenchers; only a prime minister willing to dare them to precipitate an election can hope to outface them. Dissidence spreads when the voters are unhappy, as they certainly are at present. Yet there is no threat of an election, let alone a Labour victory. The Labour party is caught between hypocritical outrage at the closures (Labour governments have been champion pit-closers) and a dangerous complacency about its continuing need to reform even now, while the Tories are in turmoil. As to Mr Major's hold on office - well, just for a while yesterday he had the 1922 Committee of backbenchers eating out of his hands. Only a backbench revolt greater than anything seen in the past few weeks could oblige him to resign. None is yet in sight. What is much more likely to happen is that the government will continue to be harassed by events. Mr Heseltine was made to sweat in the Commons yesterday. He is not yet out of danger. Neither he nor Mr Major can be certain that throwing in a few hundred million pounds extra and imposing a moratorium on 21 pit closures will quell the unrest. Even putting in Lord Peter Walker to supervise may not be enough. The disquiet over the coal mines will rumble on, possibly as destructively for the government as the poll tax was for Mrs Thatcher. The cabinet will keep running from crisis to crisis. There will be no respite until, by accident or design, the recession begins to end.</p>

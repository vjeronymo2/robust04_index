			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Elmar </F> Oberhauser; Vranitzky in the television studio in New York --  live]    [Text] [Oberhauser] Mr. Chancellor, what concrete and  specific possibilities does the UN secretary general see for  putting an end to the war in Bosnia?    [Vranitzky] The UN secretary general can only view the issue  in terms of possibilities, because he himself does not have any  armed forces, he himself does not have any other hierarchies.  What must be demanded now -- and this has been discussed very  intensively here over the past 48 hours -- is that the  individual NATO governments -- that is, the governments of the  United States and Canada, the governments of the West European  countries, and, in addition to NATO, also the government of  Russia, which means, all those countries that are able and  willing to follow a common course -- do indeed follow such a  common course. If the United Nations does not have the support  of its largest and most important members, the United Nations  will not become stronger, either. One must accept this, this is  reality.    Therefore, it is not so important now whether the UN  secretary general does or says this or that, but whether his  members give him a clear indication of what they are willing to  do.    [Oberhauser] Well, in Europe at least there is massive  criticism that the United Nations and the United States do not  know at all what is going on in Bosnia and assess the situation  completely incorrectly. Do you also have this impression?    [Vranitzky] I cannot confirm this impression here, but I  think that this impression is irrelevant. In the talks with  Butrus-Ghali and his associates I have noted that they know very  well what is going on. After all, they constantly have their  observers and their people there. They have also sent people  there, who are occasionally right in the middle of hails of  bullets. If they do not know what is going on, I wonder how  others claim to know that, when they are 600 km away.    [Oberhauser] Do people in New York, at the UN headquarters,  still believe in a negotiated solution?    [Vranitzky] One must believe that, because so many terrible  things are happening there, so much injustice and so many acts  of violence, that neither in New York nor, I think, anywhere  else in the world -- in Washington or in Vienna -- can one  simply accept it and say: Unfortunately, no solution can be  found and, therefore, we will not do anything. I think, in  particular since things have become as difficult as they are  now, one needs renewed efforts.    Just let me repeat: The big powers, which are, after all,  the determining factors, must first work out a common line and  second, make it absolutely clear that they will implement this  common line, regardless of what it is. If they leave the  slightest doubt that they do not mean seriously what they say --  be it together or individually -- it is easy for the aggressors  in Bosnia -- for the Serbs and for everybody else -- to say:  Those guys in the West are not serious anyway and, therefore,  we can just go on shooting as we like. Unfortunately, this is  what has happened so far.    Today, in all these talks here, it became clear that if this  continues, no solution will be found. Therefore, a clear,  common, and cohesive attitude is important. I hope that such an  attitude can now be found.    [Oberhauser] Let us come to a specific matter regarding  Bosnia and Austria: Today you presented a proposal to hold a  conference on the reconstruction of Bosnia in Vienna. What was  Butrus-Ghali's response?    [Vranitzky] His response was quite positive, because it is  precisely one of the points that the issue is not just about  holding a conference. There are a lot of conferences. The  issue is to give the people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the  embattled areas, in the fringe areas, in the border areas hope  that, if the fighting is stopped, the international community  will be ready immediately to contribute to and help with the  reconstruction of hospitals, means of transportation, houses,  schools, and everything needed by people who want to reconstruct  their homeland again after a war.    [Oberhauser] What does this mean for this conference, Mr.  Chancellor? When would this conference have to start work?    [Vranitzky] I will start preparing for it immediately.    [Oberhauser] And who is supposed to participate in it?    [Vranitzky] I believe that we will find an appropriate  framework with the OECD states. The OECD, the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development, is, as its name indicates,  the appropriate organization for this purpose. It also has the  necessary expertise. Then, of course, we have to negotiate with  the individual countries about how much money each is willing to  provide -- because there is no question that this will cost  money -- and what kind of expertise will be made available for  the reconstruction an area destroyed by war, as has happened  many times in history before.    [Oberhauser] According to news agency reports, one subject  of your talks was Vienna's role as a UN city and the concern in  Vienna that the city might lose importance in this respect  because again and again there is a danger of UN institutions  being removed from Vienna. What about that?    [Vranitzky] First of all, we have to cope with one  contradiction into which some Austrians slide again and again.  They constantly criticize the United Nations for not being able  to achieve anything and, in the same breath, they complain if  one or another UN department is removed from Vienna.    Thus, we must come to a decision -- do we want it or don't  we. I think we want it because otherwise we would not have  built the Vienna International Center, and it also has many  important tasks. In particular in connection with the  reconstruction of East Europe -- this will apply not only to  Yugoslavia; in the future we will have to cooperate with many  others -- it is sensible for Austria to work on having Vienna as  a UN location also play a role in the future. This will be the  issue.    I told Secretary General Butrus-Ghali precisely what I told  you just now and I persuaded him to personally advocate this  politically and within the UN framework, because if the top  official, the head of this organization does not move ahead in  this issue, it will be more difficult for us. However, this was  a very good talk. I invited him to Vienna. At the 50th  anniversary of the United Nations next spring in Vienna we will  be able to say something more specific about this issue.    [Oberhauser] Mr. Chancellor, one question in conclusion --  and I refer again to news agency reports. Reportedly  Butrus-Ghali asked you for more Austrian UN missions. Will  Austria be able to fulfill this wish?    [Vranitzky] He did not voice this desire today, but this  would not have been necessary anyway, because, in cooperation  with the National Defense Council, the Austrian Government began  some time ago to work out how we can better prepare ourselves  for future demands on Austrian soldiers in peacekeeping  missions. First of all, it is necessary to make preparations  during training for areas that are not altogether usual for  Austrians. Then, precautions also need to be taken regarding  equipment and everything that is needed for such a mission.  Today I told him that we have started this work and that it  will take quite a while yet to conclude it. Then we will brief  him on the results.    [Oberhauser] Mr. Chancellor, thank you very much for being  our guest, and I wish you a good flight home.    [Vranitzky] Thank you very much.</p>

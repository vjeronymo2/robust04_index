			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / VW accused of luring away Opel senior staff VOLKSWAGEN, Germany's struggling car giant, was yesterday accused of undermining Opel, its main domestic rival, by luring away senior executives with offers of doubled salaries. In the past two weeks more than 40 top purchasing, logistics and production managers had been offered up to DM400,000 (Pounds 164,000) a year to leave General Motors' German subsidiary for VW, Mr Horst Borghs, an Opel director alleged yesterday. Attempts to attract others, including main board directors, could not be excluded, Mr Borghs added. A VW spokesman said he could not explain the 'massive attack'. A full statement would not be issued until the accusations had been legally assessed. Mr Borghs said that some of VW's targets, after rebuffing initial courtship, had been telephoned by their former boss, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, until recently head of worldwide purchasing at GM in Detroit. He joined VW after a tussle in mid-March. He quit GM one day after saying in a statement he intended to continue working for GM - 'for the company I love and for the people I love'. He is reputed to have been tempted away with a five-year contract worth Dollars 20m. Mr Lopez was followed almost immediately to VW in Wolfsburg by six top members of his Detroit buying team. In a bitter letter sent yesterday to Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's new chairman, Mr David Herman, Opel's chairman, warned that the conflict would ultimately lead to 'counter-measures'. These could include possible legal action if Mr Lopez failed to confirm in writing that he had respected secrecy obligations in his GM contract and that he had not taken any documents to VW relating to the US group's corporate plans. Mr Lopez, by virtue of his key role at GM, would have had access to highly sensitive, top-secret information. According to the letter, employees had the right to take advantage of career opportunities. However, Mr Herman added, it set a new style in German industry when a competitor systematically undermined another company, and to attain that goal made excessive financial offers. VW, which earlier this week reported a crash into an unprecedented DM1.25bn loss in the first three months of this year, was 'creating the impression of wanting to solve its problems through a massive head-hunting campaign at Opel', said Opel.</p>

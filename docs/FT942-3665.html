			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Beckett speech received without great enthusiasm The speech from Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's acting leader, was the longest and dullest of the three, and had more to offer the party's traditionalists than its modernisers, David Goodhart writes. Speaking before the other two candidates, in the slot that would have been filled by John Smith, Mrs Beckett was received attentively but without great enthusiasm. Her only direct appeal to the delegates to vote for her took the form of a joke: 'I will make only one point in my own cause. After the next general election we could look forward to hearing militant Tories chanting 'Maggie Maggie Maggie - out out out]' ' After a triumphant assessment of the European election results - 'a turning point in British history' - Mrs Beckett talked of the need for a better balance between individual and community, but also had some meat for the left, stressing the importance of the links between unions and the party. 'Our relationship brings reality to what can otherwise become the unreal world of politics. And it is vital to the political problems that we as a party must address,' she said. She also talked of government taking a lead in industries of the future. Modernisers would have been happier with her comments on the need to modernise the welfare state.</p>

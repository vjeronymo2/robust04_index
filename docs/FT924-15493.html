			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Funds for care reform win support MRS Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, announced funding arrangements yesterday for next year's community care reforms which social services directors and political opponents acknowledged were reasonable in the present state of public expenditure. She surprised delegates to the local authorities social services conference on the Isle of Wight with an announcement that, in the early years of the reforms, part of the finance will be subject to 'ring fence' protection to ensure that it is spent on community care rather than on other purposes. Next April, local authorities will become responsible for co-ordinating a policy designed to help elderly and handicapped people to remain in the community rather than have to enter institutions. Spending on keeping people in private residential and nursing homes has soared from Pounds 10m in 1979 to about Pounds 2.5bn now. Although the position of people already living in residential homes will be unaffected, money that would have been spent on accommodating further people will be transferred from the social security budget to local authorities. Under the proposals, English local authorities will receive Pounds 539m in community care grants in 1993-94 - Pounds 399m transferred from the social security budget and a further Pounds 140m towards the start-up costs of the new system. Sums transferred in lieu of social security expenditure that would have been incurred under the existing system will rise to a cumulative Pounds 1.050bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 1.568bn in 1995-96. Mr Toby Harris, Labour chairman of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities' social services committee, acknowledged that Mrs Bottomley had fought 'a substantial battle to get the figure she has announced'. The AMA, however, differs from the government over AMA calculations of growth in people needing residential care.</p>

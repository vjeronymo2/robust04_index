			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 115 U-T WORKERS GET CONTRACT  </P> <P> Members of a union that represents about 115 newspaper employees ended four  years of labor negotiations Monday by ratifying a three-year contract with the  Union-Tribune Publishing Co.  </P> <P> The contract vote came Monday night at a meeting of the Communications Workers  of America, Local 9400, which represents Union and Tribune employees who work  at the newspapers' loading dock.  </P> <P> Members had worked without a contract since Aug. 3, 1986. The labor agreement  calls for pay raises of $67.50 per week in the first year, $25.10 in the second  and $26.10 in the third. The pact also includes a no-strike clause, a  management-rights clause and an open shop.  </P> <P> With the mailers agreement, the company has settled disputes with three of the  five labor unions representing its employees. Negotiations are still under way  between the company and the San Diego Newspaper Guild, Local 95, and the San  Diego Typographical Union, Local 221.  </P> <P> Representatives of the company and the guild will meet Jan. 19.  </P> <P> "The pressmen, the (International Brotherhood of) Teamsters and the mailers now  have three-year contracts, but with the (Guild) . . . the best offer they've  made is 16 months," said local guild President Ed Jahn. "They're playing a game  with us."  </P> <P> Jahn expressed pessimism about the upcoming negotiating session, which was  arranged by a federal mediator who has been involved in the labor dispute for  more than a year. Jahn described the company's most recent labor contract offer  as one designed to "push us to sign a weak contract or to strike on their  terms."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese entrepreneurs  have condemned the U.S. for its unilateral action of sharply  reducing its import quota for Chinese textiles.    Many people here believe that it is irresponsible for the  U.S. to slash its imports of textiles from China by 25 percent  to 35 percent in 1994, just at a time when the two countries are  set to start their fourth round of negotiations on bilateral  textile trade.    The U.S. action will seriously damage Sino-U.S. trade, they  said.    A senior manager with the China National Textiles Import and  Export Corporation told XINHUA that the U.S. action goes against  the doctrine of free trade espoused worldwide, as well as the  Multilateral Fibers Agreement.    "It creates new obstacles for Chinese textiles as far as  access to the U.S. market is concerned, and will inevitably hurt  the interests of American consumers," he said.    During the first 11 months of last year the volume of  China's  textile exports to the U.S. through normal channels accounted  for 13.1 percent of the country's total textile exports during  the same period.    Zhao Guohua, deputy general manager of the Sanhuan Woolen  and  Knitwear Corporation, based in Beijing, said China has adopted a  series of measures to halt the illicit transshipment of  textiles. Five Chinese companies were punished last December for  illegal shipment of textiles, he noted.    "The U.S. action, in disregard of China's efforts to curb  the  illegal transfer of textile products, will not weed out such a  practice; instead it will only harm lawful textile exporters,"  he said.    An official of the China National Textile Council said China  is promoting a large-scale technological transformation of its  textile industry, involving some U.S. interests.    "The Sino-American textile trade, as well as imports of  textile technologies from the U.S. and other Sino-American  co-operation projects are bound to be affected by the headstrong  action taken by the U.S. as regards the textile import quota  from China," he said.    He added that the obstinacy on the part of the U.S. in this  regard is in fact a kind of power politics, "coercing the Third  World countries with its economic supremacy."    All the people interviewed by XINHUA said they hoped that a  way out of the impasse in the interests of both countries could  be found through negotiations so as to guarantee a healthy  development of bilateral trade, especially the textile trade.</p>

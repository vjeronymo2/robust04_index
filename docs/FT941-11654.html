			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Essential for prayers Sir, Tardily, but enthusiastically, I congratulate your paper on the inspired article, 'Back to front basics' (January 15), by the Rt Rev Hugh Dickinson, Dean of Salisbury. The brilliant summation of the 'systemic malaise' of the Thatcher years and his call for the 'moral reconstruction' of our society should be essential memoranda in the evening prayers of our fallible political masters, especially of my fellow Catholic, Mr John Patten, who is striving so hard to destabilise the democratic checks and balances in the education service. William Sullivan, 12 Bolsover Grove, Merstham, Redhill, Surrey RH1 3NU</p>

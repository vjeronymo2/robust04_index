			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 9 KYODO -- The Japanese Embassy on  Thursday issued a rebuttal of an article published in the NEW  YORK TIMES the same day claiming Japan was reluctant to levy  sanctions against North Korea over its alleged nuclear weapons  program. "The article is not accurate," the embassy said in a  rebuttal statement.    The Seoul-datelined dispatch reported that despite its  public  agreement with the United States on "any sanctions imposed,"  Tokyo, according to officials, has been arguing in private  against Washington's plan. The report quoted a senior Japanese  official as saying, "stopping the remittances of funds is a very  heavy sanction. Our differences are over the weight of the  sanctions and the timing."    The TIMES quoted another senior Japanese official as saying  that Japan and the U.S. have a different view of the money  transmitted by Koreans in Japan to North Korea. "They  (Americans) see this money as something that props up the North  Korean Government. We see it as largely something from Koreans  in Japan who want to help their families," the Japanese official  was quoted as saying.    The TIMES story also said: "Combined with China's reluctance  to exert greater pressure on North Korea, the sharp debate  between Tokyo and Washington threatens to greatly reduce the  pain inflicted on the government of (North Korean President) Kim  Il-song."    The embassy said in its rebuttal it was "the shared view"  among Japan, the U.S. and South Korea is that "the international  community should, through the UN Security Council, urgently  consider an appropriate response, including sanctions. There  are no differences between the U.S. and Japan on this matter."  The embassy statement also said, "Japan will respond in a  responsible manner within its constitution, should the UN  Security Council adopt measures, including sanctions."    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, appearing  before a hearing in a House panel, dismissed the reported rift  between Tokyo and Washington.</p>

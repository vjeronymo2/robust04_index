The conferees of the Second Session of the  Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] and the Second Session  of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] believe today it is  more imperative for the government to change its functions  during the accelerated shift from the old to the new economic  structure. Government departments at all levels should do a good  job in making the change with a greater sense of urgency.    In fact, changing the government functions means readjusting  the government's functional powers so the administrative  authority plays a more effective role. Presently some  localities are not putting their efforts on changing government  functions. Instead, they are making superficial organizational  changes. An NPC deputy from Hebei said: Over the last two  years, some county-level organizations have become even more  overstaffed after so-called streamlining. Instead of reducing  the number of departments, they have set up additional ones,  which means an increase of personnel. So all the additional  financial burdens created by the additional departments are put  on the shoulder of the people.    Some deputies cited the procedures for examining and  approving new projects submitted by enterprises as an example.  It is a matter of course that an enterprise should assume full  responsibility for its own projects, respective of whether they  are feasible or profitable. However, our government departments  are minding the business of enterprises, holding many meetings,  and affixing many seals. Hainan deputy Ruan Chongwu likened the  examining and approving procedures to theater entrance and  ticket collectors. He said: Enterprises do not need to go  repeatedly through many theater doors and one ticket collector  after another. What they actually need is a better environment.  The government's business is to improve its social management  function and investment environment. Last year Hainan began the  system of enterprise registration which has greatly simplified  the formalities for establishing a new enterprise.    Similar reforms have been successfully carried out in  Liaoning's Anshan and Fujian's Shishi. In the words of deputy  Zeng Haorong, a common characteristic of these reforms is that  the government has become very small and no longer minds other  people's business, while the non-governmental sector has become  very large and whatever problem should be solved by the market  is being solved by the market. Premier Li Peng has explained  very clearly in his government work report: The government's  main function is to do a good job in macroeconomic regulation  and control, overall coordination, and social management. For  instance, planning and industrial policies which embody the  macroeconomic regulation and control function must be formulated  by the government. The government's responsibilities also  include key construction projects which have a bearing on the  national economy and the people's livelihood; protection and  exploitation of natural resources; cultivation of the market  system; maintenance of market order; improvement of social  security; development of education, national defense, and public  security; and combating corruption and promoting ethical  integrity.    Deputy Huang Baozhang has worked in the Planning Department  for many years. When asked whether he felt he had lost  something after the change of government functions, he replied:  I feel my job has become even more substantial because the  Planning Department is taking on an even more important  task--macroeconomic regulation and control. Now I can put more  efforts on using industrial policies to readjust the economic  structure and plan key construction projects; in the past, my  job included examination and approval of trivial matters, such  as the construction of a toilet.    Deputy Chen Shiwei said: In exercising macroeconomic  regulation and control, the government must follow the law of  the market economy; it must not interfere with economic  development according to its subjective wish as it did in the  past under the system of a planned economy.    Many NPC deputies and CPPCC members suggested the government  should ensure social stability and development by means of  administrative regulations, policies, planning, coordination,  balancing, and sanctions. At the same time, the government's  powers should be standardized. They earnestly hope government  departments at all levels will make greater efforts to change  their functions and improve their work efficiency, and will  achieve greater success in this regard this year.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Car sales only slightly dented April's tax increases had only a slightly damping effect on the upsurge in both new and used car sales, according to statistics from HPI, the vehicle finance information agency. Sales of new cars bought on hire purchase or other forms of instalment finance were 11.2 per cent higher in April than in the corresponding month last year, and finance sales of used cars 10 per cent higher, according to HPI. However, both represented a slowdown compared with first-quarter growth of 28.8 per cent year-on-year for sales of new cars bought on instalments and 15.1 per cent for used-car sales. The instalment purchase figures compare with a 4.8 per cent year-on-year increase in total new-car sales in April. 'It seems that the market for cars bought on finance terms has withstood the effect of April's tax increases better than cash purchases,' said Dr Brian Bailey, HPI chairman.</p>

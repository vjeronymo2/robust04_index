			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Simex offers option contract on Nikkei futures THE SINGAPORE Interna-tional Monetary Exchange (Simex) said yesterday it would launch an option contract on Nikkei stock index futures on March 19, Reuter reports from Singapore. Simex said the new contract would be based on the Simex Nikkei 225 futures contract launched in 1986. 'The sheer size of the underlying Nikkei futures clearly suggests the market has a good appetite for an options contract written on futures,' said Mr Pierre Essig, chief executive officer of Fimat Futures Asia. Simex statistics show that over the past two months the Simex Nikkei futures contract traded an average daily volume of 6,000 contracts, or an underlying average value of Y66bn of Japanese stocks. The Simex Nikkei options contract will be US-style options and may be exercised by the buyer on any day when the options are traded.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Former minister faces inquiry over alleged misuse of funds Mr Alain Carignon, former communications minister, was yesterday formally placed under investigation for complicity in the misuse of corporate funds, a week after he resigned his portfolio to contest the charges, writes David Buchan. The allegations against Mr Carignon, an RPR Gaullist mayor of Grenoble, concern a possible link between his decision in 1989 to privatise the city's water services and give them to Lyonnaise des Eaux to run, and the latter's subsequent move to take over and wipe out the FFr5.4m (Pounds 650,000) debt of a moribund newspaper that had supported his re-election campaign. Mr Carignon denies any connection. He is one of the very few ministers in recent French political history to stand down in the face of legal problems. He said it would be 'unfair for the prime minister (Balladur), whose actions are beginning to bear fruit, to suffer from the media hype' of his case. In the recent rash of corruption investigations, Mr Carignon was the only ministerial target, though Mr Francois Leotard underwent a similar investigation before becoming defence minister and Mr Gerard Longuet, the trade and industry minister, is still the subject of preliminary inquiries regarding a commission given to a member of his party. The prime minister is nominally keeping his job open for him, if he can clear his name, by giving the post temporarily to Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget minister. But Mr Carignon seems unlikely to return to a government in which he had a series of territorial disputes with Mr Jacques Toubon, the culture minister. Mr Carignon was yesterday freed by the Lyons investigating magistrate without bail or condition. Senator Maurice Arreckx, from the Riviera department of the Var, may not escape so lightly. The government prosecutor in Aix-en-Provence is asking the Senate to allow him to detain Mr Arreckx while he investigates corruption charges against him.</p>

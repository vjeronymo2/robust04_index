The South Korean Government noted the March 21 resolution  adopted by an absolute majority and saw it as a reflection of  the international community's will, Chang Ki-ho, Foreign  Ministry spokesman, said in a statement.    "It's a reflection of the suspicion and concern of the  international community regarding North Korea's nuclear  development caused by North Korea's refusal to fulfill its  responsibilities and obligations despite global efforts over the  past year," the statement said.    "The government urges that North Korea completely implement  all its safeguards obligations and clear up global suspicion  about its nuclear development," it said.</p>

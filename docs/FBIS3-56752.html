What has had most effect  here is the voluntary resignation of Yegor Gaydar, who has  personified the policy of tough financial stabilization. In  this situation banks and other money market players have started  actively buying up currency, simultaneously stretching the  deadlines for the compulsory sale of 50 percent of their  currency earnings in the hope of making a huge amount of money  from an increase in the dollar rate. There is information that  considerable resources are now also being transferred from the  short-term state bond market to the currency market.    It is important to note another aspect. Since the beginning  of the year nine auctions have already taken place at the Moscow  exchange, at which over $1 billion has been sold. Around 1.5  trillion rubles was needed in order to pay for it. The latter  figure throws doubt on the argument of advocates of state  support for enterprises that the Russian economy needs  additional injections of credit. As we can see, enterprises and  banks do have money. How these resources are utilized is  another question.    I think the current situation in the currency market is  giving monetarists some points in their long-standing dispute  with supporters of state regulation. This situation  unambiguously says that money will not be channeled into a  structural reorganization of industry until it becomes possible  to achieve financial stabilization,.    At any rate, it is not clear how those who are fighting for  additional injections of credit and those who are now acquiring  decisive influence in the Russian Government can respond. It  would be a great pity if they bank on tight control over the  exchange rate and on abandoning market mechanisms of regulating  the currency market. This would be not just a step back but  effectively the abandonment of reforms.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURY AWARD AGAINST CHIEF GATES UPHELD  </P> <P> A federal judge has upheld the $170,014 jury award against Los Angeles Police  Chief Daryl F. Gates in the case of an East Los Angeles man whose nose was  broken by police officers.  </P> <P> Attorneys for both Gates and the plaintiffs said the verdict was the first in  the nation to hold liable the active police chief of a major city for excessive  force committed by his officers.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi rejected the city's request to set aside  the verdict reached by a six-member federal court jury last fall in favor of  Jessie Larez, his wife and five children over a June 13, 1986, raid on their  home.  </P> <P> Six members of the police anti-gang unit allegedly ransacked the house, broke  Larez's nose and roughed up his children while looking for a gun used in a gang  killing. No gun was found.  </P> <P> Jurors initially assessed $90,503 in damages against the officers. After a  second phase, the jury assessed $170,000 in punitive damages against Gates. The  Larez family's attorneys, Stephen and Marian Yagman, vowed to reject a check  from the city, insisting that the $170,000 come out of Gates' pocket.  </P> <P> Asst. City Atty. Richard Helgeson said Gates will appeal and that if he loses,  the city will pay.  </P></p>

			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Berlusconi forced to retreat over judiciary decree: Legislation withdrawn after split in Italian coalition Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, suffered his first serious reverse yesterday when he was forced to redraft legislation restricting the judiciary's powers of arrest. The legislation, approved in cabinet last Thursday as a decree, split Italy's right-wing coalition and threatened to bring down the two month-old government. The decree will now be formally blocked in parliament and the government will introduce new legislation. This will be in the form of a draft law that addresses the most criticised aspects of the decree that provoked last week the resignations of the Milan anti-corruption magistrates responsible for exposing the corrupt practices of Italy's political and business elite. 'A crisis of the government at this stage would have caused serious damage to the country, especially when important economic decision have to be taken,' said Mr Giuliano Ferrara, the minister for relations with parliament. The lira weakened during the day, falling to L1,006 against the D-mark, but recovered slightly on the news of the deal between Mr Berlusconi and his rebel coalition partners. Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League and one of the main critics of the decree, said yesterday he had no wish to bring down the government. However, Mr Bossi has taken advantage of Mr Berlusconi's difficulties to undermine the prime minister's authority. Yesterday Mr Bossi reportedly blocked plans by Mr Berlusconi to make a nationwide televised address on the issue. Mr Bossi, who was in Strasbourg for the European parliament, co-ordinated his position with Mr Gianfranco Fini, the leader of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. These two partners in the coalition, who have both campaigned hard against corruption, became increasingly critical of the decree as the public outcry grew. The draft will restore the discretionary powers of magistrates to use preventive detention in cases of bribery, corruption and extortion that involve the public administration. It was the exclusion of these cases from preventive detention that caused much of the public outcry and allowed nearly 1,800 people to be released from jail. Of these, only 167 had been held on corruption charges. The government did not clarify whether those just released would be obliged to go back to jail. But the new law will not probably be passed by parliament until mid-August. The new draft allows magistrates to keep secret beyond three months their investigations of persons suspected of belonging to the mafia. The decree obliged magistrates to inform anyone immediately they were the subject of investigations. Restrictions have also been lifted on the press, which the decree forbid from publishing details of the names of those under investigation - restrictions that were ignored anyway. But Mr Berlusconi insisted the broad lines of the decree would be retained and he reaffirmed the need to prevent people's basic freedoms being abused by over-zealous use of arrest and imprisonment. Berlusconi weakened by an own-goal, Page 2</p>

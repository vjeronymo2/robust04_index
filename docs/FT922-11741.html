			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Chernobyl death toll put as high as 8,000 THE UKRAINIAN government has officially estimated that between 6,000 and 8,000 people died as a direct result of the meltdown of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, which occurred six years ago this Sunday, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. Environmental activists put the figure at 7,000 as early as September 1990 but the former communist authorities and the International Atomic Energy Commission played down the effects of the fallout.

One of Ukraine's leading environmental activists, Mr Yuri Shcherbak, has been named as environment minister.</p>

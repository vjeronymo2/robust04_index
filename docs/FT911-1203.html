			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Letter: Balance sheet strength should be priority over short-term earnings Sir, The recent proposals by the Accounting Standards Board are to be welcomed in seeking to narrow the range of profit and loss items appearing as extraordinary. Far too many companies have been trying to uphold earnings per share by treating abnormal losses as extraordinary. In particular many companies have for years been taking profits above the line on activities only then to treat costs of closure as below the line. On the other hand, ASB proposals are going severely to limit the usefulness of earnings per share in valuing companies. Large distortions will arise from profits or losses on disposal of big assets or termination of operations. Valuations based on balance sheets and brand names will be given added significance. In this context, I am surprised it has not been suggested that companies should give figures for assets per share (excluding goodwill) when revealing earnings per share. A concentration on balance sheet strength rather than short term earnings could, incidentally, be very beneficial to industry and might help to avoid further collapses such as have been seen in service-based businesses in the past few years.

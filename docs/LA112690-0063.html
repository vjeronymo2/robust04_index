			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCA BOARD APPROVES KEY TERMS OF BUYOUT;  </P> <P> STUDIO: AGREEMENT ON PURCHASE OF UP TO $6.85 BILLION BY JAPAN'S MATSUSHITA  ELECTRIC MAY COME TODAY.  </P> <P> MCA Inc.'s board of directors Sunday night approved the key terms of a buyout  offer from Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. An agreement to purchase the  Hollywood studio for up to $6.85 billion is expected to be announced as early  as today.  </P> <P> Negotiations in the deal, which would be the largest purchase of an American  company by a Japanese firm, remained cloaked in secrecy. But sources familiar  with the talks said MCA's board approved a price acceptable to Matsushita's  bargaining team. MCA also is said to have accepted an offer mostly in cash,  rather than in stock. MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman had long sought a stock  merger to avoid heavy tax payments for shareholders.  </P> <P> The approval of terms by MCA's board was reached during a marathon meeting that  began early Sunday morning in New York and ran late into the night. The  11-member board wasn't presentedwith a tentative agreement, but was apparently  asked instead to consider specific terms that were still being weighed as  bargaining continued between the companies.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment on their talks.  </P> <P> Osaka-based Matsushita's acquisition of MCA's Universal film and television  units would put a fourth major film studio in foreign hands. Columbia Pictures,  MGM/UA Communications Co. and 20th Century Fox are already owned by  foreign-based corporations.  </P> <P> One person close to MCA put the price at $72 a share, or $6.58 billion. Several  sources have said the offer would pay MCA shareholders between $70 and $75 for  each of the company's 91.3 million shares. About $5 of the per-share price  would be paid in stock of a spinoff company that will own MCA's New York-area  television station, WWOR-TV.  </P> <P> Individuals familiar with the weeks of difficult bargaining over MCA's sale  have said that Wasserman, who is 77 years old, initially expected to get  between $75 and $90 a share, or as much as $8.2 billion for MCA. But Matsushita  offered less, and it became clear that softening world financial markets  weren't likely to support a richer offer.  </P> <P> Wasserman and MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg would remain in place with  long-term employment contracts under the agreement. One person said Sheinberg  would be specifically designated MCA's next chief executive officer, but that  Wasserman would choose the appointment's timing. Individuals close to Creative  Artists Agency Chairman Michael Ovitz, Matsushita's chief U.S. consultant, have  consistently said he was unlikely to take any position at MCA, despite  widespread speculation in Hollywood that Ovitz would use the deal to make  himself Wasserman's eventual successor.  </P> <P> One source close to the talks said the key issue of management was resolved  months ago. "Matsushita's goal was the same as MCA's goal -- stability,  continuity and independence," said a knowledgeable person.  </P> <P> For Wasserman, the transaction would finally end persistent market pressure to  find a corporate parent or merger partner for MCA, which has discussed possible  combinations with Sony Corp., Paramount Communications Co., Walt Disney Co.,  RCA Corp. and others over the years.  </P> <P> Wasserman, who controls 15.3% of MCA Inc. stock directly and through various  trusts, is said to have feared that no successor could hold MCA together. He  also believes that media companies will need vast financial resources to  survive in the future.  </P> <P> For Matsushita, which has been rebounding from a slowdown in the sales growth  of its mainstay videocassette recorders, the MCA acquisition would provide a  prime ticket into the entertainment business. MCA is Hollywood's most  diversified entertainment company, with interests in film and TV production,  records, theaters, books, theme parks and other areas.  </P> <P> The MCA-Matsushita combination would create a corporate behemoth with 1990  sales in excess of $51 billion, according to estimates compiled by the Value  Line investment service. In terms of sales, that's nearly as large as all the  other major studios and their corporate parents combined, and nearly twice as  big as Sony Corp. and its Columbia Pictures unit, which will post total 1990  sales of about $27 billion, according to Value Line.  </P> <P> Time Warner Inc., the biggest American-owned studio conglomerate, will have  1990 sales in the area of $11 billion, according to Value Line, while Walt  Disney Co. is expected to have sales of about $5.7 billion. Among American  industrial concerns, only General Motors, Ford, Exxon, International Business  Machines and General Electric had 1989 sales of more than $50 billion,  according to figures compiled by Fortune magazine.  </P> <P> People close to the talks said Wasserman went into the board session with some  reservations, but formed a clear position in favor of the deal during the  meeting. Another source said the two sides were "wrapping up the final details"  late Sunday. As talks wound down, tensions reportedly had eased considerably  from last Wednesday, when the deal nearly collapsed because of a disagreement  over price. "MCA got premium price for the company and Matsushita got a great  deal," said one source. "So both sides won."  </P> <P> A longtime student of Japanese culture and managerial techniques, Ovitz had  helped Sony in its $3.5-billion purchase last year of Columbia Pictures -- the  biggest previous purchase by a Japanese company of an American firm -- and  spent more than a year advising Matsushita in its search for a Hollywood  partner. MCA, meanwhile, had scoured the globe for years, largely under the  auspices of Lazard Freres &amp; Co. Lazard Freres' partner Felix Rohatyn is on  MCA's board, and has been a key adviser to Wasserman for years.  </P> <P> Ovitz first brought the plan for a Matsushita purchase to MCA last August, and  word of contact between the companies surfaced in an American press report on  Sept. 25, after weeks of rumors in Hollywood and on Wall Street of a pending  marriage between the two.  </P> <P> Wasserman, Sheinberg, and Masahiko Hirata -- Matsushita's executive vice  president and chief negotiator -- met in Los Angeles in early October, then  began serious negotiations with dinner in New York eight days ago. Hirata's  advisers included Keiya Toyonaga Sr., a managing director and member of  Matsushita's board, Ovitz and investment banker Herbert Allen Jr. Wasserman  relied heavily on Sheinberg, executive vice president Charles (Skip) Paul, and  attorneys Martin Lipton and Robert S. Strauss.  </P> <P> The talks became severely strained at times, as the two sides positioned over  price and bickered about press leaks. Discussions were nearly terminated late  Wednesday night, before last minute changes in bargaining positions allowed  them to continue.  </P> <P> Wasserman's bargaining position was clearly hurt by the severe weakness of MCA  stock, which traded as low as $34.125 before the acquisition was announced, but  quickly rose to over $60 a share. The stock dropped $3.125 last Friday to close  at $65.375, as investors realized that any buyout would be at a price well  below MCA's original expectations.  </P> <P> One of the biggest winners in the deal would apparently be David Geffen, the  music mogul who sold his record company to MCA earlier this year for the  equivalent of about 10 million MCA shares, then valued at $54.50 each. Geffen  is likely to show a profit of some $180 million if the sale is completed.  </P> <P> By spinning off WWOR-TV into a separate company, Matsushita can avoid  government regulations that prohibit foreign companies from owning more than  20% of a broadcast license. MCA paid $387 million for WWOR-TV in 1986, and  could almost certainly have found a ready buyer for the station, but wanted to  avoid the lengthy license transfer process that would accompany a sale. Despite  a soft TV station market, VHF outlets in major cities become available  infrequently and are still coveted media properties.  </P> <P> Another MCA holding, Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., was not expected to be part  of the sale to Matsushita, sources close to the negotiations said. The Curry  Co. operates tourist facilities at Yosemite.  </P> <P> If the purchase price for MCA dropped in the last year, it was partly because  the company suffered disappointments both in its Florida theme park, which has  been plagued by severe problems in key attractions, and in its powerhouse TV  operation.  </P> <P> Times staff writer John Lippman contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MCA AND MATSUSHITA  </P> <P> MCA Inc. and Matsushita would combine to form one of the world's largest media  conglomerates. Here is a look at the two companies:  </P> <P> Matsushita  </P> <P> Produces such major electronics brand names as Panasonic, Technics, Quasar,  National and JVC.  </P> <P> The Osaka-based company, which makes everything from clothes irons to  televisions and electric pencil sharpeners, is expected to earn revenues of  $43.5 billion this year. That compares to $39 billion a year ago and $41.7  billion in 1988.  </P> <P> MCA  </P> <P> Assets include Universal Pictures; the Universal Studios tours in Los Angeles  and Orlando, Fla.; the 420-acre Universal City grounds, which include the  studio, two hotels, several restaurants and the Universal Amphitheater; the  Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co.; 49% of Cineplex Odeon; Geffen Records; Putnam  Publishing, and New Jersey-based WWOR-TV, which serves the New York market.  (The television station would be spun off into a separate company because  federal regulations prohibit a foreign company from owning more than 20% of a  broadcast license.)  </P> <P> MCA is expected to earn revenues of about $3.5 billion this year. That compares  to $3.4 billion a year ago and $3 billion in 1988.  </P></p>

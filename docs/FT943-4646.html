			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / France-China trade deal France and China yesterday signed contracts and letters of intention on promised orders for FFr2.6bn worth of business for French companies in China, effectively ending the commercial chill that followed the 1992 sale of French jets and missiles to Taiwan. The deals signed yesterday by Mr Gerard Longuet, France's trade minister, and his Chinese counterpart, Mrs Wu Yi, are expected to be followed by agreements on some FFr15bn worth of French sales to China, to be signed on Saturday when President Jiang Zemin is received by President Francois Mitterrand in Paris. These will include one on the construction by Elf-Aquitaine, the French oil company, of a new refinery in Shanghai. David Buchan, Paris</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> ARBITER TO DECIDE WHO MUST PAY FEES  </P> <P> City officials have signed an agreement to enter into arbitration over who will  pay $145,000 in legal fees accumulated by former Councilman John Kelly and  Councilman Earl J. Prescott during a battle over Tustin election dates.  </P> <P> Under the accord, Prescott and Kelly are dropping their pending lawsuit and a  retired judge from outside Orange County will decide who should pay their legal  fees.  </P> <P> The fees resulted from two lawsuits Prescott and Kelly filed against the city  hoping to block the election date change as well as a lawsuit filed against  them by the city clerk. About $126,000 in fees accumulated by the city already  have been paid.  </P></p>

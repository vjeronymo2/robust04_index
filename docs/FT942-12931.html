			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz car sales ahead in first quarter Sales of Mercedes-Benz cars rose more than 30 per cent in the first quarter of this year in all the marque's most important markets, Mr Helmut Werner, chairman, said yesterday. Deliveries of the bottom-of-the-range C-Class model had exceeded expectations by reaching almost 200,000 since the launch last summer, he said. Total turnover at Mercedes, which is the vehicles arm of the Daimler-Benz group, rose 28 per cent to DM16.1bn (Dollars 9.4bn) in the period, with passenger vehicles contributing DM9.5bn of this. Sales for the full year were likely to rise 7 per cent to exceed DM69bn, and the company was now confident of returning a positive result for 1994. Losses in 1993 totalled DM1.2bn, Mr Werner said. Saying that Mercedes' performance was running counter to the continuing down-trend in the rest of the car industry, Mr Werner said even the loss-making commercial vehicles business was gaining market share in some sectors. Car registrations in Germany had risen 41 per cent to 67,300 in the three months ended March, pushing up market share 2.2 points to 8.2 per cent. Full-year registrations were expected to top 200,000. Elsewhere in western Europe numbers rose 46 per cent to 45,000 vehicles. Japan and the US both showed increases of more than 30 per cent, he added. Mr Werner said factory capacity utilisation had been stepped up to 70 per cent from 65 per cent last year, and boasted that the gap between Mercedes' and Japanese manufacturers' productivity was closing rapidly. Meanwhile, the truck, van and bus business was still 'somewhat strained' by large numbers of relatively new vehicles taken off the road and mothballed by their owners during the recession. Foreign heavy truck operations, notably Freightliner in the US and Mercedes do Brasil, increased output 17 per cent to 26,500 units.</p>

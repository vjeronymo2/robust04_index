			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM fails to calm fears of Bosnia action MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday joined Nato military leaders in saying clear political objectives had to be set before military action was taken in Bosnia - but did little to calm speculation that Britain would reluctantly back air strikes if pressed by the US. Amid continuing concerns within Whitehall and Westminster of the US triggering precipitate action that would jeopardise western humanitarian efforts, the prime minister's office said military operations had to be regarded as a means to a political end. A postponement by the US of a decision on military action until next week will be greeted with relief in Whitehall. Downing Street expects President Bill Clinton to consult with European allies first. It said the best political objective would be to implement the peace plan which had been drawn up by United Nations' peace negotiators Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance. Concern about US intentions and the consequences of Britain becoming embroiled in an escalated military conflict will surface among Tory and Labour MPs when the Commons debates Bosnia today. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, is likely to stress the importance of humanitarian aid and the perils of various options for military action when he opens the debate. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Tory chairman of the all-party Commons defence committee, said the government faced, 'a series of unattractive options. We have to decide which is the least unattractive'. However, the prime minister's office indicated that Britain could back the threat of air strikes if the government believed it would achieve a political objective. Separately, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said: 'There can be military action which will help and, clearly, one will be very unwise to rule it out completely. 'Specific kinds of military action, particularly from the air, can sometimes eliminate sources of aggression and can deal with particular threats.' The option of air strikes 'has to be looked at extraordinarily carefully to make sure that it would indeed achieve the result that is being advocated', he added. Mr Major was responding to a warning by Sir Richard Vincent, chairman of Nato's military committee, that western leaders had to be precise about what they wanted to achieve in Bosnia. Meanwhile, Labour leaders headed off an attempt by Mr Tony Benn, leftwing Labour MP for Chesterfield, to win backing from the party's ruling national executive committee for a policy of no military intervention. The NEC backed overwhelmingly a call from Mr John Smith, Labour leader, for further Serb advances to be checked by the threat of air strikes on Serb communication and supply lines in Bosnia.</p>

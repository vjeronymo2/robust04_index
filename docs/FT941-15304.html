			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US markets move back to record levels Wall Street The US stock market bounced back from three losing sessions yesterday as share prices, buoyed by heavy programme trading, moved back into record territory, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 24.77 at 3,867.20, past its previous record close of 3,865.51, set on Monday. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 2.40 at 474.87, while the Amex composite finished up 0.82 at 480.88, and the Nasdaq composite 4.49 closed higher at 792.31, also a new record high. Trading volume on the NYSE was 305m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1,238 to 857. Three days of modest declines on profit-taking have done nothing to dampen investors' enthusiasm for equities. The market bounced back strongly yesterday from the losses of earlier in the week, and within 90 minutes of the opening the Dow was back above Monday's record close. Market sentiment was aided by good economic news in the form of a 0.7 per cent increase in December industrial output, which was bigger than analysts had expected. The production figures, coming on the heels of good news on inflation and retail sales, bolstered optimism about the outlook for the economy in 1994, and prompted fresh buying of equities. Banks remained in demand in anticipation of a strong fourth quarter from the industry. Citicorp rose another Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 42 1/8 , JP Morgan climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 71 1/2 , BankAmerica firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 48 7/8 and Chase Manhattan put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 35 7/8 . Kaufman &amp; Broad fell Dollars 3 to Dollars 21 1/2 in early trading after the home construction company reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. The stock later recovered, however, and it finished down only Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 23 5/8 . Among Dow stocks that were higher in the wake of buy pro grammes were Walt Disney, up Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 47 5/8 , General Electric, up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 106 7/8 and American Express, up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 32. On the Nasdaq market, Ask Group fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 10 1/8 after the computer company announced job cuts and reported a fiscal second-quarter loss. Canada Toronto stocks posted a small gain in active trading yesterday to close at another record high. The TSE composite index added 9.24 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 4,489.14. Volume was 86.7m shares compared with Thursday's 84.7m.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Arts: The Washington Ballet - Dance Enter, blowing its own trumpet rather too loudly - 'twenty-two beautifully trained dancers; one of the most exciting and imaginative repertories of any ballet company performing today' - the Washington Ballet. What I saw at its London debut on Tuesday night was a small ensemble, whose women have a decent academic style, trapped in ballets which leave no cliche unexplored and are an invitation to immediate flight from the theatre. The evening began with a new work by Graham Lustig, the troupe's resident choreographer. Hearts of Light is set to Tippett's Corelli fantasy, music which I find claustrophobically busy, as if one were trapped in a small room with an over-vivacious companion. Lustig, always sensitive to his scores, has produced dances of a kind generally called 'lyrical' - the girls wear drifting skirts - and has sought to match every convolution of the music. The result is carefully crafted but relentlessly active, and nothing is helped by imprisoning the dance in a black surround. Six girls dash and drift. Three men are in attendance, lifting and being earnest, like well-mannered furniture removers. It lasts forever. Things thereafter rushed into Gadarene decline. There was no point, because no illustrative vitality, in Christopher Doyle's Ne me quitte pas, where Doyle, in shirt and trousers, gloomed after Francoise Thouveny in a little black dress, while a tiresome song by Jacques Brel took its course. It was followed by Quartet No. 2 in which Nils Christe nailed some angst on to Shostakovich's second string quartet. This is music too serious to be maltreated as a guide to despair from Mittel-Europa. Christe is a follower of Jiri Kylian, and the piece is another of those 'Bad news from the Old Country' exercises in which girls in dull dresses have hell with their men friends. At the end, the four members of the cast, having suffered all over the stage, stand in a blaze of light as if awaiting a firing-squad. The marksmen would do better to draw a bead on Christe. Last, and by every means least, In the Glow of the Night by Choo San Goh. I have reported over the years on Choo's creations, which never struck me as being choreography. Like the ten dollar Patek Philippe watches you find in the Orient, they bear a slight resemblance to the real thing, but they don't work. Choo was for some years the creative force for the Washington Ballet - which explains a thing or two - and In the Glow of the Night is dreadful on all counts. Three movements from Martinu's first symphony, pink and blue leotards, pointless activity, are the ingredients. The lighting changes on an amorphous backdrop, but nothing changes in the trumpery steppings and emotings that occupy the cast: rodomontade and witless posturings are their lot. Worse, the dance makes its performers look inept: seven men slog through academic steps; the women seem prissy. It is no advertisement for the company's hopes or attainments. Sadler's Wells until June 14</p>

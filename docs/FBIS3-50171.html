President Walesa expressed hope that, in spite of many  internal problems, both countries "will draw closer and closer."  According to the president, the future lies in a Europe of  "open borders" and regional cooperation. "We would like no  decisions concerning us to be made in our absence," Walesa  underscored.    According to the president, politicians of both countries  are  facing the task of opening up to greater economic cooperation.  "I believe that we will manage to begin doing good and honest  business, as it should be between neighbors."    President Kovac said that the Slovak Republic considers  friendship with Poland to be one of the main pillars for  building its international position. Kovac underscored that,  although every state in the Visegrad Group will conclude  individual agreements with NATO on the Partnership for Peace  program, a "group is the best instrument to contribute to our  admission to NATO."    To improve security in Europe, Kovac suggested regular  contacts between the defense and internal affairs ministries of  both countries.</p>

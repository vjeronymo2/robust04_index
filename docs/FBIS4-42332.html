			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Carlsson I and II Did Not Exist"] </F>   [Text] In five months Ingvar Carlsson could be prime  minister. And in six months his ability to convince could  determine the issue of Sweden's place in Europe. The Social  Democratic Party [SDP] chairman occupies a strategic position.  His May Day speech in Sundbyberg and Stockholm should say  something about how he intends to play it.    In contrast to LO [Federation of Trade Unions] chairman  Bertil Jonsson, Ingvar Carlsson did not evade the European Union  [EU] issue. Swedish Social Democracy cannot stay outside a  European cooperation for peace, against unemployment, and for  the environment, the party chairman explained.    The day Ingvar Carlsson has the party executive committee  and  the party convention backing him as well, on that day he can  appear with even greater authority in his argumentation for  Swedish EU membership. The risk is that he nevertheless  continues more or less like this up to the election, that is to  say just mentions his EU position in passing at appearances  whose temperament and overtones -- what the Social Democrats  remember from the meetings -- are devoted to the fight against  Bildt. After that, it could take a valuable month to form a  government and get it under way. If so, there will not be much  time for Ingvar Carlsson to speak earnestly with his people  about what is at stake in the referendum.    With the strong support the Social Democrats have now had  for  20 months in the party strength polls, the party leadership  should be able to take a few risks before the election so that  it will increase its chances of winning in the referendum.  Getting 43 or 45 percent in the parliamentary election cannot be  totally decisive for the party, particularly since Ingvar  Carlsson has said that he is looking for coalition partners  rather than a single majority, but 48 or 50 percent yes in the  EU referendum in November will make a crucial difference for  Sweden.    The nightmare for the Social Democratic party leadership is  to get sole responsibility for leading Sweden and right  afterward to see confidence in the country collapse. That is  precisely what could happen if the national election is won  largely by keeping quiet about the EU position, but the  referendum is narrowly lost because there is not enough time to  convince one's own ranks.    A yes in the referendum does not solve Sweden's economic  problems. What is self-inflicted must be self-cured. But a  majority in favor of rejection could halt the recovery in a  sensitive phase. Investors become more cautious. Buyers avoid  Swedish Government obligations, with falling prices (equals  higher interest rates) as a result.    The concern that under all circumstances exists, that a  Social Democratic government will result in resumed inflationary  policies, will be reinforced in such a situation. And in the  event a Carlsson government is forced, as a result of a no vote,  to compensate for both inflationary concerns and this  uncertainty, it will be faced with major demands for economies  in the January 1995 budget -- without in addition being able to  afford to alienate big capital by means of reintroduced double  taxation and personal property tax.    In his May Day speech Ingvar Carlsson did not make the  smallest attempt at informing the audience about the complex  international conditions that exist for the Swedish economy, the  one economy in the world that is most dependent on a few big,  global enterprises. "How could it go so wrong so quickly?" asked  the former prime minister. His only reply seemed to be "Carl  Bildt," possibly reinforced with "Anne Wibble." The course of  events behind the crisis was forgotten. The prescription for the  future was given as higher marginal taxes, no child-care  subsidy, keeping every service in the public sector, and another  90,000 taxpayer-funded jobs.    One should not simply accuse Ingvar Carlsson of playing with  false cards regarding the economy. He actually seems to think  that a return to Erlander is possible in the 1990's (although it  is in curious contrast to his own observation in his European  speech at the party convention in the fall of 1993: "If today we  try to apply Keynes and Wigforss to a country, that country will  ruin its economy directly").    The deregulations, the tax reform, the municipal tax freeze,  the major decrease in housing subsidies, and other elements from  the Carlsson administration's last years in power are completely  gone, erased from the history of Social Democracy. It is like  the other day when KOMMUNAL arranged a "tribunal against  neoliberalism"; the accused were primarily Bengt K. A.  Johansson's municipal law, Kjell-Olof Feldt's tax reform, and  Allan Larsson's hard currency policy, all pursued under Ingvar  Carlsson as prime minister. Someone has pushed the "erase  everything" button to a sensitive part of the CD-ROM disk  containing the history of Social Democracy in government.    Perhaps this will bear fruit for the party in five months.  But those who are knowledgeable should fear a backlash within a  year.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Israel economy set to grow by 5%, says bank Israel's central bank yesterday predicted the economy would grow at 5 per cent this year despite concern about high inflation and interest rates, a slowdown in Jewish immigration, and a continuing stock market downward trend. The Bank of Israel, which published its annual state of the economy report yesterday, said stable economic policy and exploitation of sound infrastructure and potential human resources would fuel fast growth in the coming years. Growth of 3.5 per cent for 1993 was low, against 6.7 per cent growth in 1992, but was temporary. The low growth masked significant rises in exports, investment and employment. The central bank also said the unfolding Arab-Israeli peace process would have positive effects on the Israeli economy in opening new markets, increasing exports, investments and consumption. 'We have the potential, the technology, the manpower and the new markets .the general direction is positive,' Mr Jacob Frenkel, central bank governor, said. 'Despite the stock exchange crisis, growth will remain as expected.' Analysts said the bank was seeking to deflect criticism from industrialists and finance ministry officials that recent rises in interest rates would curb economic growth. But Mr Frenkel warned that the government would have to urgently tackle a runaway inflation rate, which is about 13.5 per cent, well ahead of the government's 1994 target of 8 per cent. The central bank said inflation was the product of rocketing housing prices, now climbing at an annual rate of 35 per cent. The governor urged the government to release more state-owned land, press contractors to build in a fixed time, and increase permits for foreign construction workers to fill jobs of Palestinians unable to come to work after Israel sealed off the occupied territories. The cabinet is due to finalise plans to combat the housing crisis on Sunday. Mr Frenkel said the government should press ahead with privatisation despite the crisis on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange where shares have fallen 18 per cent in the past three weeks. The Mishtanim index of the top 100 blue chip shares fell by 1.5 per cent again yesterday, closing below the level of August 1993. Further reforms in economic policy, including lower taxation, faster liberalisation, and increased investment in infrastructure, were necessary to ensure greater stability, the bank noted. 'Once carried out, the reforms will only increase certainty and stability. Israel today has the potential to continue fast growth, while integrating into the world's business community and exploiting the new possibilities opened by the peace process.'</p>

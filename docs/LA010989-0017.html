			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS BUMMED  </P> <P> I have always voted Democratic . . . sometimes with enthusiasm and sometimes  not. Had I known that Vice President George Bush would choose his team on the  strength of their tennis prowess ("Tennis, Everyone?" by Paul Dean, Dec. 19), I  might have made an exception in this last election. Who can fault men who like  a game that is played on a court where service is a vital part of the game? The  only problem is, it is also a game where love means nothing. Maybe I voted the  right way after all! Time will tell.  </P> <P> MARJORIE L. SCHWARTZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

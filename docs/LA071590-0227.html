			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE UNORTHODOX RABBI;  </P> <P> BY INVOKING THE HOLOCAUST AND BULLYING THE ESTABLISHMENT, MARVIN HIER HAS MADE  THE SIMON WIESENTHAL CENTER THE MOST VISIBLE JEWISH ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD  </P> <P> LAST YEAR, WHEN the Berlin Wall fell and the word reunification was murmured in  the halls of power, the American Jewish community held its breath. Nobody had  to be reminded of what happened to European Jewry the last time Germany was  one. Reluctant to risk sparking world ire by opposing reunification while  television transmitted dramatic pictures of the decimated Berlin Wall, most  American Jews were content to let the British, French, Poles and Soviets  express concern on their own behalf. Not so Rabbi Marvin Hier. The 51-year-old  dean and founder of The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles quickly fired  off a missive to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl articulating his own fears,  and those of the Jewish community.  </P> <P> "I must tell you I am not among those in the cheering section applauding the  rush towards German reunification. . . . You are undoubtedly aware, Mr.  Chancellor, the great fear that German reunification brings to the community of  victims of Nazism. . . ."  </P> <P> Kohl responded, albeit coolly. "The vast majority of young people in Germany  are fully aware of the inestimable value of a free democracy. . . . Relentless  political measures to combat right-wing extremism will continue in a united  Germany. . . ."  </P> <P> Hier wasted no time offering the exchange of letters to the New York Times,  turning Kohl's response into a public statement of political policy, putting  The Wiesenthal Center on the front page once again and, not incidentally,  making Hier himself look like the leader of American Jewry.  </P> <P> Which he may well be. By concentrating on the Holocaust and hyping the threat  of anti-Semitism, Hier has, in the span of 13 years, turned his brainchild, The  Wiesenthal Center, into the fastest growing, highest-profile Jewish activist  organization in the world today. He has certainly become America's most  fearless public enemy of aging Nazis, youthful neo-Nazi skinheads and those  Jewish soft-headed naifs who don't perceive anti-Semitism an as imminent  danger.  </P> <P> Through the center's offices in Toronto, Paris and Jerusalem, Hier keeps an  endless vigil against anti-Semitism in world politics, international business  and even rap lyrics: It was Hier's second-in-command, Rabbi Abraham Cooper, who  last year condemned Professor Griff of the rap group Public Enemy for its  pronounced anti-Semitism and gave its leader Chuck D. a much-publicized tour of  the center's Holocaust Museum. This year, The Wiesenthal Center forced various  European airlines, including Air France and British Air, to stop omitting  Israel from the maps they had printed for their Middle East in-flight  publications.  </P> <P> Even more celebrated is the center's pursuit of former Nazis. Last year, it was  instrumental in the capture of former S.S. officer Josef Schwammberger in  Argentina. Hier was credited with bringing world attention to Raoul Wallenberg,  the Swedish diplomat who had selflessly rescued thousands of Hungarian Jews  during World War II. Hier and his center were also key figures in last year's  protest against the location of a Carmelite convent at Auschwitz.  </P> <P> Most recently, Hier's attentions have been focused on the increasing incidents  of anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe; the center has people in various countries  working to separate fact from rumor. After a trip to Poland a few weeks ago,  Hier met with Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel to discuss Jewish  concerns. Havel assured Hier that he considered the apparent resurrection of  anti-Semitism "a plague and a scourge" and pledged to do what he could to quell  it.  </P> <P> In the process of gaining such influence and prestige, Hier has stepped on more  than a few toes. An Orthodox rabbi from New York's Lower East Side, he came to  Los Angeles in 1977, by way of Vancouver, to build a yeshiva. What this city  got instead was a world-renowned Jewish-defense agency. And, whether it likes  it or not, Los Angeles also got Hier, a shrewd and canny operator who, in his  subsequent pursuit of success and power, has managed to alienate many of the  city's established Jewish organizations, including the Jewish Federation  Council, the umbrella organization for the city's Jewish agencies, and the  B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League.  </P> <P> Hier is an anomaly within the Los Angeles Jewish scene. He is Orthodox where  most leaders are assimilated. He is confrontational where they are loath to  publicly acknowledge discord; Hier will speak out against his own in the  mainstream press while other Jewish leaders prefer to voice their differences  only within the community. He is cantankerous and blunt where most are  polished, street-wise and suspicious where many are reserved.  </P> <P> "We are very naively optimistic," says Hier of his fellow Jews. "We're always  looking for the sunshine. Jews say they feel so secure in America. This is such  a wonderful country -- and it is. But they have lost all touch with reality.  Things could change."  </P> <P> Most important, Hier remains unfettered by the bureaucracies that keep the  others hidebound; he plays by his own rules. And his marked Lower East Side  accent, his Orthodox regalia and his refusal to bow to secular trends make him  a constant reminder of exactly what many local Jewish leaders, with their tans  and Southern California cadence, wanted to escape when they, or their  predecessors, moved west.  </P> <P> "Marvin Hier and the center will always cry anti-Semitism," says a renowned  scholar whose previous criticism of Hier's use of the Holocaust drew Hier's  wrath. "And they always make sure their name is spelled right."  </P> <P> Yet he has apparently become something of a folk-hero among the city's 700,000  Jews; the center is perpetually deluged by $10 donations from even the most  non-observant. Last year, when many other Jewish organizations had to cut  corners and go begging, the center pulled in $9.7 million in contributions, and  another $5.3 million for its new Museum of Tolerance (scheduled to open next  year adjacent to the center on Pico Boulevard). And Hier has powerful friends  who might withhold their significant contributions to many of the city's other  Jewish organizations if they felt it would benefit, or avenge, him. Hier knows  this. In all these ways, he has used his muscle to become one of the most  imposing figures in world Jewry.  </P> <P> "Rabbi Hier," says Israel Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, "is one of the  foremost spiritual leaders in the United States, and in the entire Jewish  world."  </P> <P> THE TENSION BETWEEN Hier and the Jewish Federation Council reached new heights  last November when Prime Minister Shamir refused to reschedule his visit to Los  Angeles after he was told that federation bigwigs would be out of town. But  Shamir made time for Hier; the two had a two-hour heart-to-heart schmooze in  Hier's study. The symbolic blow was soon returned. A few months later at  federation headquarters, former federation president Stanley Hirsch buttonholed  David Peleg, a high-ranking official from the Israeli Embassy in Washington,  who had just finished briefing ranking members on "the Situation" in Israel.  According to several onlookers, including former Anti-Defamation League  executive Hyman H. Haves, an angry Hirsch loudly protested Shamir's scheduling,  insulted the prime minister's height and said, in effect, that the next time  Shamir wanted contributions or financial support, he could forget the  federation and go straight to his friend Hier. (Peleg confirms there was a  public disagreement; Hirsch denies being there.)  </P> <P> Never has anyone with such genius for publicity headed a Jewish organization in  Los Angeles. Hier, a slight, dark-suited, fedora-donning rabbi, has regularly  pulled end-runs around the city's established Jewish agencies and  organizations. Hier has accrued unprecedented clout in the Legislature, on  Capitol Hill, in the city's boardrooms and even in Hollywood. He has so  effectively mastered the art of headline-grabbing that the federation, insiders  say, has trouble getting comparable publicity, even from its own house organ,  The Jewish Journal.  </P> <P> "Success is not a crime," says Hier. "It's not a sin to be successful. My style  is you take a point of view. The worst thing in the world is to go to a  football game and see both teams refuse to move off the 50-yard line. You'll  leave after five minutes."  </P> <P> He ignores all charges of sensationalism and designs the center's fund-raising  mailings with great marketing savvy. A typical piece notes that the head of a  little-known Canadian fringe party seeks a "constitutionally racist state," a  rock concert involving neo-Nazis and skinheads held near London included a song  denying the existence of the Holocaust and a Cairo newspaper alleges that  Israel is exporting AIDS to Egypt.  </P> <P> Not everyone appreciates Hier's tactics. Some accuse him of throwing oil on the  flames of anti-Semitism to scare people into opening their wallets to The  Wiesenthal Center. Hier, however, cares little about community approval. Though  Orthodox in his religion, he employs highly unorthodox tactics, including  riding roughshod over the established channels and methods of the Jewish  community. He openly courted Republicans before it was fashionable in Jewish  circles -- to Hier, political party is incidental, recognition for his center  is everything. He voted for Ronald Reagan for President, Tom Hayden for the  Assembly. He even cultivated a friendship with Menachem Begin when the former  Israeli prime minister was still considered tref, or unclean.  </P> <P> He also has no compunction about asking government officials for funding, which  many Jewish leaders view as a step toward a dangerous marriage of church and  state. Five years ago, when The Wiesenthal Center received $5 million from the  California Legislature for its $46.7-million Museum of Tolerance, several  Jewish leaders complained bitterly -- but not publicly. (The center will also  receive $5 million from Washington, through legislation sponsored in the House  of Representatives by Democratic Congressman Henry A. Waxman.)  </P> <P> Politicians eager to capture Jewish votes and money regularly visit the center  -- in recent years the center's guest book has been signed by President Bush,  Sen. Ted Kennedy, gubernatorial candidates Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson and  other luminaries. The massive federation headquarters is all but ignored.  </P> <P> "They talk about a recent improvement in relations," says the liaison to the  Jewish community for a prominent legislator, "but I can tell you that Hier, the  federation and the ADL (B'nai Brith's Anti-Defamation League) are still at each  other's throats, no holds barred."  </P> <P> HIER WAS BORN with the soul of an activist. Since he was child, he dreamed of  taking revenge upon the Nazis who wiped out most of his parents' families in  Poland. For Hier -- as for most Jews -- the Holocaust was the searing event of  the 20th Century. But later, as a student of history, he saw the Nazis' war on  European Jewry as part of a horrific pattern.  </P> <P> "I remember thinking about the Book of Esther, the story of the first genocide  -- Haman's plot to destroy the Jews. I was always fascinated by the historical  validity of that narrative -- how it repeats itself in generation after  generation," he says. "There was always a plotter out there who wanted to  destroy the Jews."  </P> <P> Unlike Holocaust survivors and authors Elie Wiesel and Primo Levi, Hier's tools  are not pen and paper but museums, speeches and movies. In 1982, he won an  Oscar for "Genocide," a documentary about the Holocaust, narrated by Orson  Welles and Elizabeth Taylor, that he co-authored with distinguished British  historian Martin Gilbert. (Hier accepted the award wearing his yarmulke.) Hier  trades on emotion, not intellect. He realizes that the center's vast majority  of members are not steeped in the culture and traditions of Jewish life. To get  people to pay attention to his battle against anti-Semitism, Hier refuses to  let anyone forget the Holocaust even for a moment. For Marvin Hier, it is  simply "the minimum where otherwise unaffiliated Jews weigh in."  </P> <P> "It's a sad fact," adds Hier's chief financial backer, Canadian financier Sam  Belzberg, "that Israel and Jewish education and all the other familiar  buzzwords no longer serve to rally Jews behind the community. The Holocaust,  though, works every time."  </P> <P> Hier gives the Holocaust a uniquely California spin. He likens the potential of  another such cataclysm to predicting earthquakes. "If you chart the history of  earthquakes," he says, "you find that some are more severe than others. You  also recognize that they are not freak accidents. No one would conclude that we  shouldn't have any research into earthquake prediction, or that we shouldn't  prepare ourselves for the possibility that there might be another."  </P> <P> To that end, Hier has dedicated himself to, among other things, Nazi hunting.  In 1979, when the center was in its infancy, Hier successfully lobbied West  Germany to rescind a proposed statute of limitations on the prosecution of Nazi  war criminals. Since then, the center has forced the Canadian government to set  up systems for pursuing resident ex-Nazis and other war criminals. And he has  urged identical legislation in Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand. He was  also instrumental in publicizing and promoting the career of Viennese  Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal. "Before meeting up with Hier," says one  Wiesenthal Center insider, "Simon was nickel and diming it in Vienna. He  couldn't even pay his phone bills."  </P> <P> In the deadly serious business of protecting Jews around the world, Hier is an  affable, charming activist. He can seem quite childlike -- offering Cokes and  candy to important visitors -- and, when not battling anti-Semites, he follows  his beloved Chicago Cubs on his office TV. He and his wife, Marlene, an urban  planner who is director of membership for the center, live in West Los Angeles,  in Beverlywood. His oldest son, Ari, 26, was just appointed director of the  Hillel Student Union at USC. Avi, 25, is a vice president at Baer, Stearns, a  stock-trading house.  </P> <P> And despite his mission, "Moish," as Hier's friends call him, doesn't always  take himself too seriously -- at a 50th birthday party for Bill Belzberg, Sam  Belzberg's brother, the good rabbi jumped out of a cake.  </P> <P> Michael Berenbaum, project director of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in  Washington, believes that the style and message of "Genocide" are completely  indicative of Hier. " 'Genocide ' is a substantive piece of work," Berenbaum  says. "But watching it is like sitting in a dentist's chair where the drill  begins at the first moment and doesn't let up till the end of the two hours. If  it had, it might have been more effective. In a real sense, that is Marvin  Hier."  </P> <P> Yet Berenbaum has nothing but praise for the man's achievements. "Hier has  essentially taken what could have been regarded as a small, parochial,  peripheral institution and transformed it into the largest single membership  organization in American Jewish life."  </P> <P> For the 380,000 families worldwide who support the center with their  contributions, Hier is refreshing. They cheer his abrasive public manner, his  fondness for confrontation and hyperbole, his doom-and-gloom pronuncimentos and  even his lapses into Holocaust shtick: For example, Hier returned from a visit  to the site of the Treblinka death camp in Poland bearing ash-covered stones  uncovered in a field. "Moish used to shlep those stones around on satin  pillows," a Hier intimate says. "He was perfectly sincere, but it was awfully  kitsch."  </P> <P> "He's a ballsy little guy," says producer Dan Curtis, who raves about Hier's  creative input into his acclaimed TV miniseries, "War &amp; Remembrance." "He  hangs in there; he's tougher than hell, and he won't take bull from anybody."  </P> <P> Simon Wiesenthal is even more effusive. "He's dynamite," says Wiesenthal, in  his broken English, from his home in Vienna. "The man is never quiet. He is  always trying to do things no one else has ever tried. I know that he makes  other Jewish organizations nervous. This center is young and aggressive. I hope  this aggressivity will survive me."  </P> <P> By all indications, it will. In fact, the center's newest project, designed by  James Gardner (who also designed The Museum of Diaspora in Tel Aviv), is rising  now on Pico Boulevard. The Hebrew name of The Museum of Tolerance is Beit  Ha'Shoah -- the House of the Holocaust. However, its focus will extend, in  substance and appeal, beyond the Holocaust and document other genocides,  including those of the Cambodians and the Armenians. As planned, the first  floor of the museum will trace the history of racism and prejudice in the  United States and relates the story of the Holocaust. The second floor will  have a bank of 33 interactive computer consoles linked to videodiscs  containing, among other resources, the center's newly published, four-volume  "Encyclopedia of the Holocaust." The third floor will include a 324-seat  theater that will regularly show motion pictures relevant to the themes of the  museum. The museum will also house one of the country's most complete Holocaust  archives, containing 500 hours of videotaped interviews with survivors,  liberators and others, and 1,200 archival collections of historical documents,  correspondence, photographs, diaries and artifacts.  </P> <P> There is no doubt that Hier intends the museum to become a tourist attraction.  This is not, he insists, a place just for Jews. "Hatred did not die in the  bunker with Hitler," he says. "These are not dinosaurs that you can walk away  from at the Museum of Natural History and then forget about. The haters are  still among us."  </P> <P> THE SON OF a Polish immigrant lamp polisher who arrived in the United States on  the White Star ship in 1917, Hier was not always eager to take on the world's  assorted Jew-haters and baiters. Certainly not in New York, where he was raised  in the city projects. Young Hier spent his early life within three  circumscribed blocks along Cannon Street, his birthplace, among, he recounts,  largely "Sabbath-observant look-alikes and think-alikes."  </P> <P> He was studious, not a street fighter. "I'd like to claim that when we were 13  or 14, we fought back. But when the gangs (from other neighborhoods) pounced on  us," he says, "we just ran."  </P> <P> Hier did well in school. Soon after he was ordained at the Rabbi Jacob Joseph  Theological Seminary, his teachers recommended him to an emissary from the  fledgling Jewish community in Vancouver, Canada, who had come to New York  looking for someone to take over the city's premier Orthodox synagogue. For the  newly married 22-year-old rabbi and his 19-year-old wife, swapping the insular  streets of their neighborhood for Canada's lush and laid-back Pacific Coast was  like moving to the moon. But Hier was adventuresome, and discouraged at the  prospect of achieving prominence in New York's long-established Jewish  community. For Hier's Yiddish-speaking father, who had never heard of Canada,  the move was incomprehensible.  </P> <P> "My father did not know geography very well," recalls Hier. "When I told him I  was going to Vancouver, he thought I told him I was going to 'Van-Cuba.' He  said, 'What Jewish boy goes to a communist country?' "  </P> <P> In 1962, some 7,500 Jews lived in Vancouver. In salmon-rich British Columbia,  these truly were bagel-and-lox Jews: They drove to shul on the Sabbath, in  violation of strict Jewish law; most did not keep kosher homes, and  intermarriage was not uncommon. Other Orthodox rabbis would have been dismayed  at this lack of piety. Hier saw opportunity. As rabbi of Congregation Schara  Tzedek, Hier discovered a facility for inspiring young people. It dawned on him  that through the synagogue youth movement he could reshape the lives of all his  congregants.  </P> <P> Marc Belzberg was one of Hier's first disciples. A child of startling  self-assurance, Marc would become scion of a financial empire that grew out of  the furniture business that his grandfather, Abraham, had established in  Edmonton. He would also become Hier's inside track to Sam Belzberg, Marc's  father and the man who would make The Wiesenthal Center financially possible.  </P> <P> When Hier met Marc, Sam and Fran Belzberg were happily non-observant newcomers  to Vancouver. Because of Marc's fascination with Hier, however, the curious  Belzbergs joined Hier's congregation. But they became angry and perplexed with  the boy's sudden and forceful swing toward Orthodoxy.  </P> <P> Fran Belzberg's distress over her son's religiosity grew daily. And soon her  other children, under Marc's influence, began to fall into strict religious  observance "like dominoes." "Travel was especially tough," she recalls. "We'd  go to Maui, and I'd have to bring along 50 pounds of kosher meat."  </P> <P> Despite Fran's demands that Hier stop "brainwashing" the children of the  community, the Belzbergs eventually warmed to Hier. In the Canadian business  community, the Belzbergs were outsiders with a seldom-appreciated instinct for  making profitable corporate acquisitions. Hier, too, was an outsider. The  couples became friends.  </P> <P> When Hier began to engage in open political activism, Belzberg was his most  fervent supporter. Vancouver Jews were alarmed at Hier's outspokeness,  especially at the spectacle Hier provided to Soviet Prime Minister Alexei  Kosygin in 1975: When Kosygin arrived at the Vancouver Hotel, Hier, with the  city's Reform and Conservative rabbis, all replete in prayer shawls and  tefillin, or phylacteries, greeted him with loud prayers for the consolation of  their oppressed Jewish brethren in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Soon Hier was hobnobbing with royalty, but even then on his own terms. On one  occasion there was a noted Jewish Canadian jurist who took issue with Hier over  the yarmulke he insisted on wearing at a Victoria reception for Queen Elizabeth  and Prince Phillip. To his dismay, the royal couple was captivated by the head  covering, engaged Hier and his wife in friendly conversation and ignored the  judge.  </P> <P> In 1975 Hier took a year's sabbatical in Israel. There, he encountered the Or  Same'ach ("happy light") Yeshiva in Jerusalem. Or Same'ach's scouts used to  scour the city for the many young, disheveled Jewish Westerners who flocked to  Israel during their travels. They would bring them to the yeshiva where the  youths would be bombarded with Sabbath good feeling and haimishness. Eventually  many would enroll as students, and some would become ba'alei tshuva (newly  observant Jews).  </P> <P> It occurred to Hier that if the key to spreading Orthodox Jewish observance was  young people, then he was wasting his time in Vancouver, where he was preaching  to the converted -- the same people who flocked to his synagogue week after  week. When Hier returned home in September, it struck Sam Belzberg that the  fire had disappeared. Belzberg decided the man needed a drink and a sympathetic  ear and invited him into his study. "Hier said, 'I don't drink,' " recounts  Belzberg. "I said, 'You'll have one anyway.' " He drank. And Belzberg heard his  story. Los Angeles, said Hier, was becoming a vibrant center for Jewish life.  And that's where he wanted to move.  </P> <P> Hier and Belzberg flew to Los Angeles in early 1977, where they quickly  snatched up the old Reiss-Davis Center building on Pico Boulevard; real estate  maven Joe Tannenbaum of Toronto had agreed to match Belzberg's  half-million-dollar contribution to open a West Coast branch of Or Same'ach.  </P> <P> Word quickly reached the ears of Rabbi Maurice Lamm, then head of the Beth  Jacob Congregation of Beverly Hills, the largest Orthodox synagogue in the  western United States. He reportedly got his brother Norman Lamm, president of  Yeshiva University in New York, to call Hier and offer an affiliation with  Yeshiva University. L.A.'s nascent Orthodox community was virtually kvelling  that, finally, there would be an Orthodox college for their children. Hier was  equally delighted, having unexpectedly upgraded his operation from a yeshiva to  a university affiliate called Yeshiva University at Los Angeles (YULA).  </P> <P> HIER DROVE TO LOS Angeles with his wife and two young sons in July, 1977.  During the course of the summer, Hier enlisted real estate developers Roland  Arnall and Esther Cohen, who became his lay leaders, and Mara Kochba, a native  New Yorker who had worked in communal public relations and fund-raising. With  Sally Arnall and Marlene, they sat in the courtyard of Hier's rundown building  and planned a fund-raising banquet. A cursory glance at the calendar revealed  that Nov. 12 -- the date of the banquet -- was the anniversary of  Kristallnacht, the Nazi's first pogrom. Upon discovering this, Hier chortled  with childlike glee. "We're in business," he declared.  </P> <P> It was during the next month that the idea for a commemorative museum for the  Holocaust with a strong activist, Jewish-defense orientation jelled. Then,  while planning the banquet Hier proposed honoring Simon Wiesenthal. Hier and  his associates realized that if they could convince Wiesenthal to back their  efforts, they could have both a school and a center. With characteristic  decisiveness, Hier got on the telephone and set up a meeting in Vienna.  </P> <P> Upon arriving a week later, Hier discovered that his luggage had been lost.  Unable to shave, he went down to the hotel barbershop. As Hier sat in the  barber's chair, he noticed a framed, autographed photograph of Adolph Hitler.  He doesn't remember what he said to the barber, but, for Hier, this was clearly  an epiphanous moment. Although in the post-Holocaust world it was impolite to  be openly anti-Semitic, there were clearly people out there who regretted that  the Final Solution had not been final.  </P> <P> Wiesenthal was flattered. The center would become America's answer to Yad  Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust museum in Jerusalem. And Hier assured  Wiesenthal, who detested the idea of a museum in which files and photographs  would merely gather dust, that it would be run as an activist operation. "If  they had said they wanted to set up on the East Coast," Wiesenthal says, "I'd  have said no. It is built up already. But the West Coast was, from the Jewish  point of view, a spiritual desert. And I felt that something should be done."  </P> <P> Although Weisenthal's support of the center was what Hier wanted, it  immediately embroiled the center in controversy. A few years before, a group of  Holocaust survivors led by wealthy Jewish financier Abraham Spiegel, chairman  of the board of Columbia Savings, had invited Wiesenthal to a dinner aimed at  funding a Holocaust memorial in the federation's headquarters. What came out of  that event is still debated. There are those within Spiegel's group who contend  that they had cut a deal with Wiesenthal, that he had agreed to back their  proposed memorial. Hier says that Wiesenthal had never agreed to lend his name  to the Martyrs' Memorial Museum, and Wiesenthal concurs. Wiesenthal's  withdrawal cost the group some $25,000 (but the memorial was eventually built).  Although Hier reimbursed them, he was accused of underhanded dealings.  </P> <P> Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, director of the Hillel Jewish Student Union at  UCLA, recalls confronting Hier at the time. "I asked Hier why he was doing this  when the Martyrs' Memorial had been in the works for 10 years and was reaching  its culmination. His response was: 'We will do it bigger, better, faster -- and  without the survivors.' There was no regard on his part for communal niceties  or respect for the survivor community. It was a venture that he viewed as  competitive. Whoever had the biggest center would be king."  </P> <P> What's more, after the euphoria of the first dinner faded, the local Orthodox  community became disenchanted as members recognized that Hier's commitment to  the college was overshadowed by his commitment to the center. "He had a new  toy," says one former center employee, "so Moish put aside the old toy."  </P> <P> Their fears were well-grounded -- the school never evolved into a full-scale  affiliate of Yeshiva University in New York. Today, YULA is, in essence, a high  school. Indeed, when Hier recently made his appeal for a further $5 million in  federal funding for his museum, some parents of YULA students threatened to  withdraw their children, and there was serious talk of building a new Orthodox  Jewish high school. Hier responded to this threat with customary aplomb; in  late May, he outbid the city's Sikh and Sephardic Jewish communities for a  school building on Robertson Boulevard, into which he plans to move at least  the girls school. Heir says it cost the center $2.25 million.  </P> <P> Indeed, Orthodox Jews have never been givers to The Wiesenthal Center. Hier,  for his part, has not actively sought their support. "My appeal was always  beyond the Orthodox community," he says. At times it has seemed that Hier has  gone out of his way to offend his fellow Orthodox. Some academicians were  reportedly disturbed when Hier, who possessed no academic credentials beyond  his yeshiva ordination, had appointed himself "dean" of Yeshiva University of  Los Angeles. And that, despite his lack of academic standing, he would not  permit the parent organization in New York to exert any influence on his  operation.  </P> <P> Not all Jewish leaders keep their sentiments private. For the past several  years, Hyman Haves has been Hier's equal in tenacity and verve. The 74-year-old  former ADL executive has publicly battled The Wiesenthal Center over its foray  into California and federal politics. Haves believes the center -- which was  united with the yeshiva and thus a religious institution -- has no business  seeking money or favors from the government. Haves, in fact, testified before  the Legislature against the approval of the $5-million grant in 1985.  </P> <P> Like Haves, UCLA's Rabbi Seidler-Feller has not always hidden his criticisms of  Hier and The Wiesenthal Center. Seidler-Feller claims that his outspokeness  almost cost him his job. At a Yom Kippur service several years ago,  Seidler-Feller lectured that the center was an aberration from traditional  Orthodoxy. "In Orthodox communities," says Siedler-Feller today, "you are never  browbeaten with anti-Semitism. The Holocaust is not a force for promoting  Jewishness. The agenda for Orthodoxy after the war was not to build memorials  and not to cry, but to promote learning and create the positive capabilities  for the survival of Judaism."  </P> <P> As a result, he says, an irate member of the center tried to have him fired.  Hier says he, himself, would never have done such a thing, and knew nothing of  it.  </P> <P> In its fervid pursuit of anti-Semitism, the center also sometimes slips. Last  February, Donald Dean Hiner, a part-time history instructor at Indiana  University-Purdue University at Indiana, taught that the Holocaust never took  place and the Nazis had no plan to exterminate the Jews. Marcia Goldstone,  director of the Jewish Community Relations Council in Indianapolis, worked  behind the scenes on the Hiner case with university officials and the ADL. The  university agreed to suspend Hiner with pay, indicating that he could be fired  later. But a Midwest member of the center -- unaware of these moves -- called  Cooper demanding action. Without telling the local Jewish establishment,  Wiesenthal Center Director Gerald Margolis contacted the university and urged  Hiner's dismissal.  </P> <P> Goldstone learned of his effort from the newspaper. She was not happy. "From  the outside it looks like the Jewish community doesn't know what it's doing,"  she says. "From the inside it confuses and upsets people."  </P> <P> Hier offered a grudging apology. But he hates the idea of having to observe  Jewish organizational etiquette. "There is no such thing as somebody 'handling  an incident,' " says Hier. "Who pre-assigned it? Was it a group that got  together 90 years ago and said this is our turf?  </P> <P> "Sometimes there is a danger of being too organized," says Hier. "Being too  organized sometimes stifles creativity, individuality. Sometimes the organized  Jewish community, by its democratic nature, becomes too unruly. It's hard to  conduct a committee with 200 people."  </P> <P> There have been occasions, however, in which Hier's disregard for diplomatic  prerogatives could conceivably harm the very Jews he has sought to protect. For  example, in 1985, Hier decided to commemorate the Armenian genocide in his  museum, despite criticism from some elements of the Jewish community. The Turks  soon responded to Hier's plan with veiled threats about no longer being able to  "protect" the Jews living in Muslim Turkey. (Israel has been quiet regarding  the Armenian genocide for precisely that reason.)  </P> <P> Hier says he took the position in service to historical truth. The Armenian  genocide happened, he says. That, in itself, is sufficient to be commemorated  in his museum.  </P> <P> "What Hier has done," said Berenbaum, Washington's Holocaust Memorial director,  "which is an act of almost singular integrity, is not to allow the rewriting of  history to the exclusion of Armenian genocide. He is saying if you can rewrite  one history, you can rewrite another."  </P> <P> As far as Israeli politics go, Hier believes it is not the place of American  Jews to tell Israelis how to run their country. This does not preclude all  criticism: He is aghast at the breakdown of Israel's electoral system and at  its inept public relations. But he says he will always profess unqualified  support for the government in power -- as long as certain lines are not  crossed. For instance, Hier says he would never support or acquiesce to the  expulsion of Palestinians from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Having gone  through the Holocaust, he says, Jews must never subject another people to  similar horrors.  </P> <P> It all always seems to come back to the Holocaust, to Hier's burning dedication  to never let anyone forget, and his use of its horrors to rally Jews  everywhere. Rosalie Zalas, an advisor to Sen. Wilson and a member of the  center's board of directors, believes Hier's attitude is not fanatical, but  necessary. In 1964, Zalas and her young children followed her husband, a doctor  assigned to the United States Army, to West Germany. She knew German, and was  shocked by what people said to each other about the Holocaust when they thought  she couldn't understand.  </P> <P> "It was appalling to find out there was such a large number of Germans,  particularly older Germans, who never really regretted the Holocaust," she  says. "They only regretted that they had not finished the job and there were  still people left to talk about it." When she asked the location of the Dachau  concentration camp, people feigned ignorance.  </P> <P> When Zalas moved to Los Angeles a few years later, she was distressed to find  that the city's Jewish community also largely ignored the Holocaust. "Before  The Wiesenthal Center, nobody knew anything about the Holocaust, nobody talked  about it." The sole exception, she said, was Marvin Hier.  </P> <P> Of course, some people wish he would keep quiet about it once in a while.  Seidler-Feller keeps a "Holocaust abuse file" in his office that is filled with  news of The Wiesenthal Center's activities. Raising the specter of the  Holocaust at every turn lessens its horror and denies its singularity,  Seidler-Feller says.  </P> <P> Nationally respected leader Rabbi Harold Schulweis, of Valley Beth Shalom in  Encino, has his own misgivings: "Ideologically, I am concerned with the  imbalance in the center's regard for the Holocaust," he says. "It is the  predominant event in the Jewish psyche. Jews have the Holocaust clinging  beneath their skin, in their nostrils. The majority of the people out there  find their strong and their visceral identification through the Holocaust, and  Hier has been able to tap into that." That ability is harmful to Jews, he says.  "I think there is that one-sided, mono-dimensional aspect to the center's take  on the Holocaust that I honestly believe is inimical to Jewish flexibility,  creativity and innovativeness. It is a sad shortcut to Jewish loyalty."  </P> <P> Hier finds these criticisms irrelevant. In his view, memory and warning are  inseparable. The Holocaust must be recalled so as to never be repeated. His  message is that Jews are never safe, that anti-Semitism is pandemic, occurring  everywhere and in various degrees of virulence, and no matter the occasion,  Jews must always stand up for themselves.  </P> <P> "I have experienced anti-Semitism in public life in a very profound way," says  Hier, harking back to his dinner with the Queen. Sitting at his table -- Hier  had ordered a kosher meal -- was a kilt-clad Canadian admiral holding forth on  the ethnicity he declared was ruining Canada. The admiral turned to Hier and  said: "Take you, rabbi. Here we all are having dinner. And you have to eat  differently."  </P> <P> Hier turned to the admiral in disgust: "With all due respect, sir," Hier said,  "if you are not embarrassed to sit amongst us wearing a skirt, I don't think I  have to be embarrassed about what I choose to eat."  </P></p>

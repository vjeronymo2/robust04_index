Fretes was the head of the Investigative Department during the  previous government and according to the "Terror Archive," he  was one of Pastor Coronel's [former investigative police chief  accused of human right violations] trusted men during [Alfredo]  Stroessner's dictatorship.    Presidential Decree 2325 says that Publio Fretes replaces  Superintendent Justino Ramon Bracho "who will receive another  assignment."    Surprised Dinar officials confirmed in the afternoon that  the  decree was released yesterday morning without them knowing that  their director had been changed.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Bonds: European Investment Bank launches L500bn offering Offerings in a variety of currencies on the eurobond market yesterday drew support from the improved tone in government bond markets. The European Investment Bank launched L500bn of three-year bonds yielding 11.45 per cent. Joint lead manager Deutsche Bank reported strong demand from fund managers in Italy, Germany and the Benelux countries. 'The lira market has been very volatile but there is now a feeling that the worst is behind us for a time,' said a dealer. Joint lead manager IMI Luxembourg said L300bn of the proceeds were swapped into floating-rate lire. Commerzbank launched a CDollars 150m offering of five-year bonds priced to yield 20 basis points over Canadian government bonds. The bonds were mainly sold to retail accounts in Benelux and Germany, joint lead manager Merrill Lynch said. 'We have seen continued demand in the Canadian dollar market with large amounts of loan redemption at the moment and investors are looking to come back into the market,' said one trader. Some syndicate managers were surprised there was not more issuance in the Canadian market following the rally in Canadian government bonds. However, others questioned the timing of the launch. 'The Canadian market has outperformed the US market in recent months and banking on a further correction may be overly optimistic,' said one manager. Reed Elsevier tapped the dollar market with a Dollars 200m offering of five-year bonds, priced to yield 40 basis points over US Treasuries. 'The pricing was aggressive in what has been an anaemic market,' said one dealer. 'There seems to be continued buying in the dollar sector, which is surprising given its recent turbulence. The US and Canadian dollar markets are the markets of choice at the moment, it seems,' said one syndicate manager ABN Amro launched a Fl 350m issue of 10-year bonds, increased from an initial offering of Fl 250m. The bonds were priced to yield 65 basis points over underlying government bonds and were sold to Dutch pension funds and investors in Switzerland and the UK, ABN Amro said.</p>

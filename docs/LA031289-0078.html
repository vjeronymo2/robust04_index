			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 'WE'RE LOSING,' NUNN TELLS DEMOCRATS  </P> <P> Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) warned fellow Democrats Friday that they are losing the  "heart of the electorate" and must prove to mainstream voters that they can be  trusted.  </P> <P> In a keynote address to the Democratic Leadership Council a day after he  successfully led the fight against the nomination of John Tower as defense  secretary, Nunn stressed that the party must move quickly to recapture  middle-class voters.  </P> <P> "Democratic support is hemorrhaging in the heart of the electorate," Nunn told  the council, organized as a showcase for some of the more moderate party  members. "We are losing the working and middle-class Americans who used to be  the mainstay of our party's governing coalition."  </P></p>

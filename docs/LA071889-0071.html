			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Campaigners suffered a legal setback Monday in their fight to save the  foundations of the 16th-Century Rose Theatre in London where William  Shakespeare is believed to have acted. A High Court judge rejected an appeal by  the Rose Theatre Trust of the government's refusal to make the ruins a national  monument and prevent new building on the site. The government last month backed  developers' plans to construct an office block on giant stilts above the  theater, whose remains were discovered earlier this year. It argued the remains  would not be damaged and there was no need to give them the extra protection of  national-monument status. Monday's ruling upheld the decision, to the  disappointment of the members of the Rose Theatre Trust campaign, whose  supporters included the late Laurence Olivier, who died last week at the age of  82. "It was Lord Olivier's last wish, his last public pronouncement, that the  Rose be preserved and displayed in the best possible way -- obviously not with  an office block over it," said actor James Fox.

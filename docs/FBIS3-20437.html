			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Xuefa (1728 1331 3127): "The First Year of </F> Grain Price Deregulation -- Perspectives on Grain Production,  Consumption, Circulation"]    [Text] The first of April 1993, is a day that people would  consider out of the ordinary.    Beginning on that day, the national grain price deregulation  policy was formally implemented and urban residents' grain and  oil was no longer provided based on the plan. Its price stopped  being based on "planned supply" and was thoroughly freed up.    Grain planting farmers no longer planted in accordance with  the national mandatory plan. Some regions also eliminated grain  contract fixed quota purchases, and farmers set up and adjusted  their planting structure and set up their planting plan based on  market demand, and grain and oil sales freely entered the market.    When people regard food as heavenly, in the set traditional  thinking of Chinese urban residents, freeing up grain prices  undoubtedly was a major break through from the era of the plan!    In the first year that grain prices were freed up, what was  the status of grain production, grain markets, grain purchases,  grain consumption, and grain departments?    Urban Residents Everywhere Find Convenience    The deregulation of grain prices was a "great liberation"  for  hundreds of millions of urban residents. The residents did not  need to go every month to line up to receive grain coupons, and  did not need to go to the designated grain stores to buy grain.  At every grain exchange market there were large and small  packages of grain for sale. Moreover, the vendors' service was  enthusiastic and the price could be negotiated. At the food  market one could even conveniently pick up the Thai fragrant  rice, jiaozi flour, and cornmeal that he needed.    An organizational cadre said that for a number of years  before we ate plenty of old rice. Now it is better. After we get  off from work, we go to the exchange market and we can buy  either a lot or a little. It is all new rice and the price is  fair. His viewpoint is rather representative.    Grain Enterprises Move Toward the Market    In several places the state grain stores are no longer  crowded as they were. According to a survey of a certain city's  state grain store business, grain stores throughout the city  realized a profit of 991,000 yuan from January through October  of this year, a 74.03 percent decline from the same period last  year, and 85 percent of total grain stores suffered a loss.  Grain enterprises are quietly turning to the market.    One county's grain and oil supply company established six  grain stores in the county seat. Formerly monthly grain sales  were more than 3 million jin, but this year in the first two  months that grain prices were deregulated, they only sold  slightly over 10,000 jin of grain.    The freeing up of grain prices forced grain stores to  actively participate in the intense competition of "the great  market, the great circulation, and the great commerce." Several  state grain stores have begun to engage in grain finishing and  manufacture semi-finished products. They are striving to  establish a foothold in market competition.    Exchange Markets Are Full of Customers    The pattern of state grain stores being the only business  throughout the country has been broken. So, in the area of  circulation, in addition to the grain department, retail stores  and exchange markets are emerging in streets and lanes all over.    Grain exchange markets, in comparison to the one-price,  several-variety state grain stores, are a cut above. The crowded  situation in several exchange markets says it all.    Four Great Grain Purchasing Wars    This is the first year that grain prices have been freed up  and there are numerous difficulties with grain purchases in  localities throughout the nation. The reason is that after the  grain market was freed up, there were numerous rushes to  purchase.    In this year's summer and fall grain purchasing seasons, the  grain that the farmers harvested still had not been entirely  dried when in several localities and townships several  collective and individual purchasers and grain using units one  after another put up signs as purchasers. In some local  townships, in addition to those in the locality concerned with  grain, supply and marketing, farm machinery, transport, and seed  units; flour mills, rice mills, breweries, and vermicelli  factories came directly to the people for purchases.    Numerous purchasing units, in order to scramble for grain  sources, raised the purchasing price on one another. In this  year's fall grain purchases for example, the purchasing price  for hybrid paddy was bid up from 0.64 yuan per kilogram to 0.66  yuan, 0.68 yuan, and a high of 0.74 yuan. Some individual grain  dealers drove their tractors to the field and immediately  purchased the grain that the farmers had just husked. They took  it in with their left hand and put it out with their right hand.  When making purchases, they played with the "scales" to entrap  the farmers and do everything possible to avoid taxes and  industrial and commercial administrative fees. They drove up  prices and expanded the differential with the grain department's  purchasing price.    Numerous rushes to purchase disrupt the order of the market,  and the grain department's grain purchases face a serious crisis.    Mixed Emotions for Grain Planting Farmers    With the total freeing up of grain purchases and prices,  farmers who plant grain have mixed emotions. They are happy  because the self-determination in planting that farmers have  been crying for for several years has been implemented. Farmers  can take the initiative in selecting what they will plant based  on market demand, and contract grain orders are changed to  parity purchases to add protective prices to the purchases  determined by the market, and farmers can acquire many benefits.    Farmers are sad because nowadays planting grain does not  make  money. Although farmers benefit from the state's freeing up of  grain prices, a large part of this benefit is offset by the rise  in prices of the means of production. According to statistical  estimates, nowadays those who plant one mu of paddy  essentially do not earn any money, and some have to take money  from their own pockets. So, farmers' enthusiasm for planting  grain is dampened. Second, those who have the freedom to plant  crops do not know what they can plant to earn money. Before,  whatever they planted, the state would purchase it. Nowadays  what one plants must be determined by the market situation and  the risks are great. Third, they are worried about heavy  burdens. Since opening up, township cadres have run economic  entities and weakened their function of serving the farmers,  increased charges, and made burdens heavier, and the funds and  materials to support agriculture have been squeezed out. Fourth,  delaying the signing of contracts until production and delaying  payment until the purchase make it difficult to arrange planting.    Existing Problems Cannot Be Easily Overlooked    If the problems that have occurred since grain prices were  freed up are not promptly adjusted and resolved, the  consequences are dreadful to contemplate.    Grain volume has gone down and grain prices are seen  constantly rising. With the freeing up of grain prices and  farmers free to plant what they want, they plant whatever makes  money. Prompted by economic benefit, farmers see that planting  grain does not make money and one after the other change to  planting cash crops such as garlic, peanuts, rape, and  medicines. According to relevant department statistics, the area  planted in early rice this year throughout the country is 119  million mu -- 12.17 million mu less than  last year. Because the grain area is reduced, production has  declined, making formerly tight supply and demand relations  tighter and leading to an expected constant rise in the market  prices of grains and oils. Purchasing is chaotic and grain  reserves have fallen dramatically. Multi-channel grain purchases  are intensely competitive, making purchasing extremely chaotic.  In Jiangsu alone, this year's grain reserves are 50 percent  lower than at the same time last year.    Individual businesses play tricks and the residents are  greatly harmed. Because various sets of remedies are still not  sound, especially because there is no central quality testing  department to check the quality of grains and oils, some  individual business people, intent on nothing but profit, mix  gypsum powder into flour and market it and some mix  semi-finished oil or semi-finished sprouts with mixed oil,  cottonseed oil, and bran oil and sell it as first or second  class rapeseed oil. The consumers' rights are damaged.    The grain stores' path is difficult and it is not easy to be  optimistic about the prospects. Grain stores that for a long  time depended on planned supply do not have their own funds. All  business activity depends on bank loans. In addition, old and  new debts build up and do not go down, the bank interest that  enterprises are burdened with builds up from year to year, and  burdens become heavier and heavier. Since the opening up of the  market, grain enterprises have been bearing this burden and  there is no way to go into battle with a light pack. In  addition, old employees are in the majority in grain  enterprises. In some urban areas, the ratio of retiring  employees to employees on the job has reached approximately 1:1.  Enterprise burdens are heavy. Some units even have difficulty  maintaining employees' basic livelihood.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The limited occurrence of Red River pupfish ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyprinodon rubrofluviatilis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in the Canadian River drainage since 1969 (Pigg  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1984) indicates that the release of at least one Red River endemic has already occurred in this drainage. While the introduction of non-native fish does not fully account for the disappearance of Arkansas River shiners, particularly outside of the Cimarron River, competition with introduced species can have a significant adverse impact on Arkansas River shiner populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reproductive characteristics and specialized spawning and early life-history requirements of this species intensify the effects of certain natural or manmade factors, such as drought. Successful reproduction of the Arkansas River shiner appears to require precise flow conditions conducive to breeding and embryonic development. Spawning is triggered, in part, by abrupt increases in stream flow during the late spring or summer (Cross  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1983, Moore 1944). Stream flows favorable to spawning must be sustained over at least a 24 hour period to ensure complete embryonic and larval development. As discussed under Factor A, suitable habitat conditions are becoming scarce and where conditions are not favorable, rapid population declines have occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Declining populations of the Arkansas River shiner may also be due to poor survival of juveniles. Bestgen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1989) observed that spawning in Arkansas River shiners appeared to be primarily limited to age class I individuals, based on an absence of age class I and older fish from collections made after the spawning period. The apparent extremely high post-spawning mortality observed in Arkansas River shiner populations in the Pecos River suggests that the reproductive contribution of individuals in age class II or older is very limited. Thus, the continued existence of Arkansas River shiner populations may be almost entirely dependent upon successful annual reproduction and subsequent recruitment of age class 0 (juvenile) individuals into the population. The loss of a single reproductive event/cycle would seriously reduce recruitment, and possibly lead to localized extinctions. The fragmentation of Arkansas River shiner habitat by impoundments intensifies the effects of failed reproduction by hindering repopulation following rapid declines or localized extinctions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list the Arkansas River basin population of the Arkansas River shiner as endangered. Endangered status, which means that the species is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, is appropriate for the Arkansas River shiner because of its significantly reduced range, including the apparent extirpation of the shiner in Arkansas, Kansas, and throughout much of its historic range in Oklahoma. Threatened status does not appear appropriate considering the extent of the species' population decline and the vulnerability of the remaining populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not presently determinable for this species. The Service's regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(2)) state that critical habitat is not determinable if information sufficient to perform required analyses of the impacts of the designation is lacking or if the biological needs of the species are not sufficiently well known to permit identification of an area as critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arkansas River shiners occur at scattered locations throughout the Canadian River. Specific habitat features, such as substrate composition, water depths, and water velocities, preferred by Arkansas River shiners are unknown and data explaining the distribution and abundance of Arkansas River shiners within a given segment of stream are lacking. Without this information, designation of critical habitat is not possible because the Service cannot adequately determine the precise constituent elements within specific areas that are essential to the survival and recovery of the Arkansas River shiner. The Service has initiated studies, funded under the provisions of Section 6(d) of the Act, which will determine and characterize the specific physical habitat requirements of the Arkansas River shiner. Within 2 years from the date of publication of this proposed rule, the Service must designate critical habitat to the maximum extent prudent (50 CFR 424.17(b)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Technology: Keeping the engine running smoothly - Why Royal Dutch/Shell is spending Pounds 70m on an R&amp;D overhaul When Formula One racing cars were allowed to carry only a fixed amount of fuel to get them through a race, many used to succumb to dry tanks in the closing stages. The answer to improving fuel economy was engine oil. By making it thinner, viscosity was lower, so the engine turned slightly more freely and needed less fuel for the same speed. The consequence was about one lap's extra travel per race - the difference between winning and losing. Carrying this principle to the ordinary car or truck on the ordinary road is, however, more difficult than it appears. Road vehicles have to last years, not the two hours of an F1 race. Thinner oils that get even thinner as engine temperature rises are no aid to longevity; volatility increases, so oil and vapour seep up the cylinder into the combustion chamber where they burn, possibly leading to smoking, particle-laden exhaust fumes. The Anglo-Dutch company Royal Dutch/Shell demonstrates the dangers on a test-bed using a 10-litre Volvo truck diesel engine. To solve the problem, chemicals must be added to control the viscosity of the oil and stabilise the range of its volatility - in effect to limit how thin it can get and how much can evaporate above the piston head. Motorists may grumble that this sort of work will inevitably make engine oils more expensive, but Shell says it is not so much selling high-tech oil as commercial benefits worth much more. Like all leading oil companies it claims to be responding to trends in market demand. Car manufacturers and most drivers want improved fuel economy, reduced oil consumption, longer lasting oil at higher temperatures, fewer oil changes, extended engine life, lower particle and noxious exhaust emissions, and more care for the environment. The benefits have been creeping up on us almost unnoticed, so that we already take many for granted. 'When did you last have a car that needed a decoke?' asks Andrew Scott, head of engineering services at Shell's main UK research centre at Thornton, near Ellesmere Port in Cheshire. He and David Parkes, Thornton's managing director, were elaborating on Shell's decision last month to spend Pounds 70m over seven years modernising and expanding the research centre, which is Shell's world headquarters for studying what happens to fuels and lubricants inside internal combustion engines. The investment in Thornton will be one of the biggest single cash injections yet in UK-based research and development. Shell has 15 complexes of laboratories worldwide with Thornton one of the largest. It currently employs 600 staff with a wide range of scientific skills. By the end of next year it will take in 140 extra scientists from another research centre in Sittingbourne, Kent, which Shell is closing. The Cheshire centre's main work stems from its original wartime role - it was founded in 1940 - developing fuels and lubricants for the Allied air forces and tanks fighting in North Africa. However, it has also become one of the world's foremost centres for combustion science and hazard analysis, where its work on gas explosions in confined spaces has made for safer design of offshore oil and gas platforms since the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988. The Sittingbourne scientists will add environmental and additives synthesis research to Thornton's portfolio. The Pounds 70m will mainly be spent replacing a large number of old buildings with a smaller number of bigger laboratory wings, linked by communal support services. Additions will include a new product development and testing centre, as well as a visitor centre to improve public relations. Although this will confirm Thornton's position as the group's prime laboratory for research and development in oil products, there is a great deal of hard-headed commercial nous behind the decision, apart from merely adding to prestige. There was debate within Shell about whether to build on a green-field site, rather than extending Thornton in the shadow of the giant Stanlow refinery. This would have cost twice as much, but would a more bucolic environment lead to better work? Most of Thornton is surrounded by the green fields of Cheshire anyway - and, the argument went, it would do no harm to remind scientists of what they were there for by having Stanlow next door. What was crucial, senior management argued, was to get away from a 'rabbit hutch' image of having people scattered about in small, individual buildings. Thornton's buildings have been numbered sequentially as they have been constructed; the site is now up to building number 205 in 54 years as new ones have replaced old ones. Parkes says the design of the new Thornton will bring people into closer contact in the communal services areas, promoting the exchange of ideas and creativity. He also thinks a more pleasant environment will help attract and retain staff. He believes all this should help teamwork and the pursuit of collective, commercial goals. 'One of the problems of industrial R&amp;D is to extend the customer-contract principle into the laboratory,' says Parkes. Although 'blue sky' research still accounts for 10 per cent of the budget, most of these customers have a market to sell to, such as millions of motorists - and even the odd Formula One racing team.</p>

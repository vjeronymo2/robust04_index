			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOPE: COMPTON POET WEAVES LYRICAL STORIES OF "AFRICAN VOICES SHARPENED ON  CONCRETE" OF GRITTY URBAN LANDSCAPES.  </P> <P> . . . If the story is not told  </P> <P> The story will be lost  </P> <P> If the name is not spoken  </P> <P> The name will be forgotten . . .  </P> <P>  -- KAMAU DAA'OOD  </P> <P> "Watermelon, Drum and Ink"  </P> <P> In a traditional African culture, Kamau Daa'ood would be a griot, a  storyteller, a keeper of the tribe's history and myths who uses words, song and  dance to tell his stories.  </P> <P> In 20th-Century America, Daa'ood is a word musician, a poet who uses artistic  mediums from music to videos to tell stories about himself and other black  Americans -- their "African voices sharpened on concrete" in the nation's  gritty urban landscapes.  </P> <P> The stories are about people like Arthur, a musician friend celebrated in one  poem, who "moistened his reed with tears he collected" and did not speak  English, "just pig Latin and fluent saxophone and a little Spanish he learned  from his neighbors" in the housing projects.  </P> <P> The stories are about "young minds bleeding naked in front of snot-covered  TVs," about "precision lobotomies executed at ends of ghetto blasters," and  about "a slow suicide that stretches out over a life span."  </P> <P> Daa'ood, who is 39 and a Compton resident, began his writing career in the Los  Angeles public schools. For more than two decades he has pursued a full-time  artistic career that has produced two books of poetry and more than 400  readings, one as far away as Somalia, where in 1979 he performed at the  national theater.  </P> <P> This year he has received a number of accolades, among them a teaching grant  from the state Arts Council. Last month he was named the best poet-performer by  L.A. Weekly, which said he "fuses the dialectics of jazz with the oratorical  powers of gospel and cosmic social satire."  </P> <P> A video that mixes one of his longer poems with music was included last month  in "Songs of the City," the "Take Five: Arts and Culture" series broadcast on  public television station KCET. The poetry and music presentation was given  against a video backdrop of lively city street scenes. Daa'ood hopes to produce  more of his work on video and have it distributed through schools and  libraries.  </P> <P> . . . There are wonderful things  </P> <P> written on the scar tissue of my heart  </P> <P> and i've come to tell the bare butt truth . . .  </P> <P>  Daa'ood's poetry mixes the harsh realities of inner-city life -- the "savage  red streets," the babies who grow up to "harm you" -- with the joy of living  and the echoes of the agrarian, tribal culture that nurtured his African  ancestors.  </P> <P> In a love poem to his wife, for example, he writes of, "purple blossoms, blown  through a bamboo kiss, sailing on a rainbow river drum" to a woman "reading  leaves and cowries, talking to ancestors and singing ancient songs." The couple  have five children, ranging in age from 8 to 16.  </P> <P> Many years ago the poet adopted the African names Kamau, which means quiet  warrior, and Daa'ood, which means beloved. A native of Los Angeles, he was  still in his teens when he joined the Watts Towers Writers Workshop, where  older black writers such as Ojenki, K. Curtis Lyle and Quincy Troupe taught and  served as role models.  </P> <P> Later, he worked with the Pan-African People's Arkestra, the group of musicians  who came together under the leadership of Los Angeles pianist-composer Horace  Tapscott to build an orchestra that would preserve and promote the works of  black composers. It was while he was with the Arkestra that Daa'ood became  known as the "word musician," creating a poetic form that he recites with  music.  </P> <P> Daa'ood works part time on programming for the Watts Towers Arts Center and is  also a full-time outreach supervisor for an AIDS education program at the  Southern California Youth and Family Center in Inglewood.  </P> <P> . . . The essence of the work is healing  </P> <P> rebuilding a circle  </P> <P> promoting the life force . . .  </P> <P> uniting the scars to make something beautiful . . .  </P> <P>  The arts, Daa'ood suggests, are a way in which black people can come to terms  with the bleak lives they have often been forced to bear since being captured  two centuries ago and thrown onto ships bound for American slave markets.  Creativity, he suggests in one of his poems, is "a martial dance in the midst  of despair."  </P> <P> Tall, bearded and bespectacled, with a voice as sonorous as it is gentle,  Daa'ood calls himself "a community arts activist or a grass-roots cultural  worker."  </P> <P> He and drummer Billy Higgins are transforming a storefront in Los Angeles'  Crenshaw District into a performance space that they hope to open within a  month. Dubbed the World Stage, the space will give the Southland's black  artists a place to perform at the same time they are preserving elements of  black culture, be it in jazz, poetry or dance.  </P> <P> "This place that I'm building here," Daa'ood said, "I'm not just building for  myself. I'm building it as a vehicle for other creative people, and for the  community, a place where they can come together. There's not a lot of outlets  for creative people."  </P> <P> . . . This is an army of healers  </P> <P> physician, heal thyself  </P> <P> and radiate, and radiate, and radiate . . .  </P> <P>  If black people are to overcome some of the destructive conditions under which  they live, it is critical, Daa'ood says, that they have a sense of cultural  identity. Problems afflicting blacks in America today, he said, can be traced  in part to the historical fact that they were stripped of their language, their  religion, their national identity, that they "don't know where their  great-great-great-grandfather came from" and that as slaves they were turned  into "property."  </P> <P> When your culture has "totally been annihilated and you can't look back, you're  just stuck with the moment, no anchor, nor roots to your tree. I don't like  that word (roots). I think it's overused today, but I think that's why so much  of my work speaks to" overcoming the loss. "That's part of the healing that  needs to take place in the . . . historical amnesia that we are faced with."  </P> <P> Don't look to Daa'ood, though, to don a dashiki, as many black American men did  as they began to explore their African heritage. "That's very superficial,"  said the poet. "We're not talking about dashikis. We're talking about family  structure, we're talking about ways of doing things. We're talking about the  connectedness of a people, the feeling of being responsible, the extended  concept of self."  </P></p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Slide in Swedish krona halted A slide this week to record low levels for the Swedish krona was halted yesterday when the opposition Social Democratic party said its manifesto for next month's general election, due out today, would contain tough measures to curb Sweden's big budget deficit. Earlier this week, a suggestion by Mr Goran Persson, the shadow finance minister, that the manifesto would not detail spending cuts pushed the krona as low as SKr5.09 against the D-Mark and drove the yield on nine-year government bonds above 12 per cent. The krona fell back to SKr5.04 against the D-Mark yesterday afternoon and nine-year bond yields slipped back below 12 per cent after Mr Persson and Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the party leader, said the manifesto would, after all, contain 'exceptionally tough' fiscal proposals. The markets attach particular weight to the Social Democrats' policies because of their strong lead in opinion polls. But dealers warned of a further lurch in currency and interest rates if today's manifesto, not due to be published until the markets have closed for the weekend, were judged to be less stringent than billed.</p>

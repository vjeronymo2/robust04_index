			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FINAL VOTE DELAYED ON WARNER RIDGE ZONING  </P> <P> At the request of Councilwoman Joy Picus, the Los Angeles City Council on  Wednesday delayed until Feb. 6 a second and final vote on a plan to zone the  Warner Ridge property for residential development.  </P> <P> Picus, who represents the West Valley, sought postponement because the absence  of allied council members left her without the votes she needed to approve her  plan to zone the controversial property to permit residential development only.  </P> <P> Picus needed 10 votes, but only eight of her 10 council supporters were  present.  </P> <P> She said she was confident she could muster sufficient votes on Tuesday, when  all 15 council members are expected.  </P> <P> Last week, the council backed Picus and voted 10-2 to zone developer Albert  Spound's property at Oxnard Street and De Soto Avenue to allow the construction  of 108 large houses. Spound was seeking a zoning change to permit him to  construct seven office structures, with 810,000 square feet of space, on the  parcel.  </P></p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / People: British Rail people hog the track Discouraging news on the rail privatisation front yesterday as former BP boss Robert Horton named the people who will help him run Railtrack, the government-owned company due to take over ownership and control of BR's tracks. Industry watchers had speculated that one of Horton's first actions as Railtrack's chairman-designate would be to set up a management team interposing fresh talent from the private sector among traditional railway managers. Instead, all but one of the 11 executives named yesterday are ex-BR - and the odd one out comes from the Department of Transport. Few of the names are particularly well-known outside transport circles. Chief executive will be John Edmonds (above), 56, formerly BR board member responsible for common services such as procurement and research. Director of major projects will be Gil Howarth, 40, who has had some prominence as managing director of Union Railways, the BR subsidiary responsible for the Channel tunnel rail-link project. And the odd one out is commercial director David Moss, 46, a Grade III civil servant (under secretary) who led the British team in the air liberalisation talks with the US. Railtrack shrugged off criticisms about the lack of private sector input. Several of the people chosen had spent most of their working lives in the private sector before going to BR, it said, and all had been chosen for their records of achievement as managers. Mysteriously, however, we have still not been told who is to become Railtrack's finance director, so perhaps there is room yet for a private sector contribution.</p>

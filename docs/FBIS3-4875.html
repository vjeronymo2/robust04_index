At the news conference, Chairman Saito expressed a  sense of crisis about the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks  which resulted in a rupture during the recent Japanese-U.S.  summit and said, "I, as a businessman, cannot leave the matter  as it is." He stated this was his personal opinion. He said  that the Japanese Government "should present numerical targets  concerning the macroeconomy" in future negotiations.    Moreover, he called for the Japanese Government's positive  action, saying that "because the ball is now in Japan's court,  Japan has to throw the ball back to the United States." And, he  added, "We want to make efforts so that (the Japanese  Government) can throw the ball back as soon as possible." The  conference was held on 23 and 24 February. Chairman Saito gave  a speech on 24 February and stated that antidumping lawsuits by  the United States and other countries have created distortions  in the market. He then reiterated the need for an early  conclusion of the multilateral steel agreement (MSA) which  regulates trade conditions among various countries.</p>

The delegation includes the leaders of  many committees of the lower chamber of the Russian Federal  Assembly. This enabled the delegation to discuss the most  important aspects of Russian-Chinese with their counterparts in  this country.

Both sides spoke out in favour of a consistent  development of the Sino-Russian interaction along all lines  including trade, economic, cultural, military and technical  cooperation.    According to Jiang Zemin, friendly ties between the Chinese  parliament and the Russian State Duma will surely play an  important role in the further expansion of goodneighbourly  relations.

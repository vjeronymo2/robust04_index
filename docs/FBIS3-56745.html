			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 18 TASS -- Russian Vice Prime  Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said on Tuesday it is unlikely that  the government will sharply change its line, if its core remains  intact.    At the same time, he admitted that it would be hard to  resist  the pressure from the industrial and regional lobby especially  after the inflation spiral was wound tightly in the last four  months. Now it is beginning to unwind, forcing the government  to pay off the debts which were not paid in November-December,  Shokhin said.    Even if former First Vice Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar  decided  to stay in the government, this process would continue anyway,  he said. It is hard to imagine that under Gaydar inflation would  be smaller in January-February than in December, Shokhin said.</p>

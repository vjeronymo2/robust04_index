The Basotho National Party leader was granted bail and the  case was postponed until February 18. He allegedly told a  gathering in Maseru in November that soldiers needed to arm  themselves and that the ruling Basotholand Congress Party  planned to disband the army. Five soldiers and three civilians  died in a series of clashes between rival forces in the army  last month.</p>

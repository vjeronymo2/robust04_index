			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A JEALOUSY FESTIVAL IN SANTA CRUZ  </P> <P> Two jealous husbands. Two doomed wives. Two plays in one weekend.  </P> <P> It's true Shakespearean repertory, and it's thriving at Shakespeare Santa Cruz.  </P> <P> Here last weekend, you could watch Charles Shaw Robinson as the schemer Iago  and Ron Dortch as the jealous general in "Othello" on Saturday, then see  Robinson and Dortch as victims of Othello-style jealousy in "The Winter's Tale"  on Sunday. For Dante Di Loreto, the roles were reversed: the innocent Cassio in  "Othello," the furiously avenging Leontes in "The Winter's Tale."  </P> <P> This cross-production actor-watching wouldn't be much fun if the productions  didn't stand up strongly on their own. These do.  </P> <P> This "Othello," directed by former Angeleno Mark Rucker in the 540-seat  Performing Arts Theatre at UC Santa Cruz, is a whirlwind, a production that  really roars. "The Winter's Tale," in the outdoor Festival Glen, operates at a  more leisurely pace, befitting the play, but most of it is intriguing.  </P> <P> "Othello" is set in a contemporary American naval setting. Driving, bombastic  music. Dress whites and tans. Solid, anonymous desks. The names of  Shakespeare's locales, Venice and Cyprus, are unchanged. But it doesn't seem  impossible that Cyprus, at any rate, might be used as a base from which to  stage raids into Iraq or Kuwait.  </P> <P> Yet the setting works best not for cosmetic or speculative reasons, but because  Robinson plays Iago as a very American, street-savvy bully, the kind of guy who  was pushed into the Navy by his parents 20 years ago -- so they wouldn't have  to deal with him any more -- and whose guile has since raised him through the  ranks.  </P> <P> He has a tattoo on his arm and a barking laugh. He likes to shadow box and slap  his comrades on the back. When he wants to act impressed, he whistles. When he  wraps himself around his wife (Amy Thone, in military garb that reflects her  no-nonsense manner), first seductively and then threateningly, it's chilling.  </P> <P> Dortch's Othello seems a calm, judicious fellow. But when Robinson begins to  drop his hints about Desdemona and Cassio, this general quickly loses his  command over the situation. In one extraordinarily moving moment, Dortch  unleashes a gospel-tinged howl of grief and anger that shakes the theater. His  Desdemona, Camilia Sanes, moves with the sort of sensuous grace that might be  misinterpreted by a jealous husband.  </P> <P> "The Winter's Tale" in an outdoor glen in the summer? Well, the somber  contemporary suits of the first half, set amid court intrigues, do look odd  next to the sun-dappled redwoods in Santa Cruz. But when a giant bear emerges  from behind the flat, circular stage, and consumes one of the characters,  suddenly the sylvan setting seems perfectly appropriate.  </P> <P> In fact, much of "Winter's Tale" has a summery feeling; the play's middle  section is set at a sheep-shearing event, staged here as a hillbilly fair, and  the colors are lively during this part of the staging by British director Sarah  Pia Anderson.  </P> <P> The accents wandered a bit farther astray than one might expect, and vocal  projection wasn't helped by a slightly buzzy sound system. Still, these young  Santa Cruz actors do make most of the great poetry accessible and fluent.  </P> <P> Although I didn't see it, "Amadeus" is the third entry in this season -- yet  another take on jealousy, this time of the professional variety. Working in one  of the most appealing summertime retreats imaginable -- the hilltop campus of  UC Santa Cruz -- artistic director Michael Richards has put together a season  that stimulates both serious cerebration and blithe celebration.  </P> <P>  It continues through Sept. 2. $15-$18; (408) 459-4168.  </P> <P> </P></p>

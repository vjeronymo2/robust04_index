			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Arts: Poles apart - Poetry in performance LIKE Manchester, the Polish city of Lodz was a prosperous place in the 19th century thanks to its flourishing textile industries. By the time the English poet Stephen Romer spent a year there in the immediate aftermath of the upheavals of 1989, all that had changed. What Romer experienced during that year has been recorded in a memorable sequence of poems that form the last part of his new book, Plato's Ladder (Oxford, Pounds 6.99), this autumn's choice of the Poetry Book Society, from which he read at the Voice Box last week. According to the Polish poet Adam Zagajewski, too many observers from outside foolishly regard Poland as a kind of 'fairy tale, defenceless land'. They transform it in their writing into a caricature of itself. Romer's poems avoid that kind of wilful dishonesty by means of clear reportage. Romer began by recording his obsession with the painful physical circumstances of his life there - the terrible flat in which he lived, 'worse than Bleaney's', where each room seemed to be a wind tunnel and every morning he would have to remove the film of black dirt from his windowsill. He lived opposite a power station. Beneath the window, he could see a grotesque socialist-realist sculpture group entitled 'The Titans', each one 'black from implementing the future'. And on Friday nights he watched workers, drunk in the snow reeling about like 'bulky moonmen'. Looking back at Lodz's history, there is a sense of shame in the poems about the Ghetto. Lodz, unlike Warsaw, experienced no uprising. Its spiritual elder, Mordecai Chaim Rumkowski, was a very accommodating man, ensuring that his flock did exactly what the Nazis required of them, including satisfying the deportation quotas. He caused his fellow Jews to die in pursuit of the vain hope of a promised survival. Romer's poems are a vivid sequence of sketches, lapidary, epigrammatic; moments, captured and recorded, from an anguished period of his life. Romer's poems, clearly expressed, were pungent in the choice of detail; and he read them self-effacingly as if it were the poems that were important and not the poet himself. Glyn Maxwell on the other hand, another young English poet who read at the Voice Box recently, is seldom easy to listen to because his brash personality gets in the way of the poetry. Maxwell was recently described by America's former Poet Laureate, Joseph Brodsky, as 'the great white hope of English poetry', and there is a great deal to admire in his work. Like the young Auden, he is prolific and tirelessly experimental. Although a new book had appeared only months ago (Out of the Rain, Bloodaxe Books, Pounds 6.95), he had new poems in his hand that he was bursting to share with us. The best of these, 'Poets of the Compass', 'The Sarajevo Zoo', 'Ost', and 'The Devil at War' explore the themes of unrest in Europe, the situation of Berlin; and more general ideas about westernness, easternness, northernness, etc. 'The Sarajevo Zoo', which he wrote he had read of the plight of the last bear remaining there, had a great poignancy: 'The nothing they had between those hands was hope'. Maxwell soaks up everything, very quickly. He feels vehemently. He writes compulsively. But occasionally, like Milton in that great sonnet, he might serve his muse the better by merely standing and waiting.</p>

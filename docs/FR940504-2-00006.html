(NAL), facilities in Flora, Illinois, and the inclusion of a new facility in Salem, Illinois, as part of the reorganized subzone. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on April 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subzones 146A and 146B were approved by the Board in 1988 for two adjacent manufacturing plant sites of NAL, both of which are located within the Flora Industrial Park, Flora, Illinois (Board Order 371, 53 FR 5436, 2&hyph;24&hyph;88). The two facilities (222,000 sq.ft./14 acres) were granted subzone authority to manufacture motor vehicle lighting components and other related auto parts. Subzone 146B was formerly operated by Hella Electronics, Inc., a NAL affiliate. Both plants are now operated as an integrated manufacturing unit by NAL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NAL has added a third manufacturing site (380,000 sq. ft. on 22 acres), located in the Salem Industrial Park, 1075 West Main Street, Salem (Marion County), Illinois (30 miles west of Flora), which would become part of the reorganized zone. Construction is underway at the Flora facilities which will increase manufacturing space to 355,000 square feet. The completed expansion will yield a combined production capacity of some 28 million units annually. Based on the restructured management of the operations, the applicant requests that all three manufacturing facilities be consolidated under one subzone designation_146A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The production activity that would occur within the consolidated subzone would be essentially the same as that currently occurring at the Flora facilities. The finished products would involve motor vehicle lighting components. Materials purchased from abroad include: various polymers and resins in primary form (HTSUS Ch. 39), articles of rubber and plastic, fasteners, optical elements of glass, certain electrical apparatus, lamps and lenses, insulated wire, optical fiber and cable/bundles (duty rates: free-16%, 3.1&cent;/kg+9%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zone procedures exempt NAL from Customs duty payments on the foreign materials used in export production. On domestic sales, the company is able to choose the duty rates that apply to finished automotive lighting equipment and parts (free-10%) for the foreign components noted above. The auto duty rate (2.5%) applies if the finished products are shipped via zone-to-zone transfer to U.S. motor vehicle assembly plants with subzone status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790&hyph;50808, 10&hyph;8&hyph;91), a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is July 5, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to July 18, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Department of Commerce District Office, 8182 Maryland Avenue, Suite 303, St. Louis, MO 63105. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3716, 14th Street &amp; Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 26, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John J.

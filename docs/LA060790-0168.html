			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Playboy Mansion for Sale: The Art Institute of Chicago, which owns the 72-room  Playboy Mansion on Chicago's elegant Gold Coast, is asking $6 million.  </P> <P> The mansion, with its bowling alley and swimming pool, was once famous for wild  parties. Hugh Hefner, founder of Playboy Enterprises Inc., lived there until  moving to Los Angeles. Playboy donated the property and $500,000 a year for  maintenance to the museum in 1984 as a residence for art students. School  officials said the 87-year-old mansion did not make a very good dormitory.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THINGS PEOPLE DO;  </P> <P> LAWN BOWLING: LAID-BACK COMPETITION FOR YOUNG, OLD ALIKE  </P> <P> Rancho Bernardo's Jack Williams calls lawn bowling his "competitive outlet."  </P> <P> When Williams, a Naval Academy graduate, retired as a Marine general 19 years  ago, he looked to sports to occupy his extra time. But when back problems  forced him to give up tennis and golf 10 years ago, he found lawn bowling could  satisfy his competitive nature but wasn't as strenuous.  </P> <P> "You get used to competing," Williams said. "Tennis was my game, but I can't  compete at the national level."  </P> <P> He has done so in lawn bowling, though. Williams is vice president of the  American Lawn Bowlers Assn., which has about 5,000 members. There is also the  American Women Lawn Bowlers Assn. with about 2,000 members.  </P> <P> In 1988, Williams traveled to Australia for the Bicentennial Invitational as  manager (who serves as an alternate) for the U.S. team. He is now a member of  the committee that selects teams for international competition.  </P> <P> Lawn bowling is an English sport and popular in British Commonwealth countries.  In Australia, Williams experienced a sport that is different, played on a much  larger scale, than it is here. In the Commonwealth countries, lawn bowling is  dominated by young players, usually in their 20s and 30s. Williams said that  through corporate sponsors, television endorsements and tournament winnings, a  lawn bowler there can earn about the same as an average American minor league  baseball player.  </P> <P> But in the United States, the older crowd keeps lawn bowling alive. One  attraction is that anyone can play it.  </P> <P> "It's the only competitive sport I know that you can play from 8 years old to  death," said Robert Marsh, president of the San Diego Lawn Bowling Club. "We  have men in their late 90s and some that didn't start playing until they were  70. There's even some who have had a stroke and still play."  </P> <P> Many lawn bowlers are people who have given up other sports for various  reasons. Marsh said his club has two members who switched from pin bowling.  Others were not sports participants until they discovered lawn bowling.  </P> <P> The San Diego club has 125 active members ranging in age from 28 to 90. Marsh  said most who practice regularly (three or four times a week) are retired. The  club has practice games every afternoon except Monday. Bowlers draw names for  partners, and Marsh said this is helpful to novices who improve by playing with  more experienced players.  </P> <P> The sport seems relatively easy. There are two sides, made up of one to four  players. The object is to get as many bowls closer to the white jack than your  opponent. But there's a catch. The bowl isn't round. It is heavier on one end  so instead of rolling in a straight line it curves either inward or outward  depending on how it is rolled.  </P> <P> After each person on each side has bowled, the "end" is completed. After  scoring, the teams move to the opposite sides of the green and bowl in the  opposite direction. Usually, 12 to 14 ends are bowled in a game lasting about  two hours.  </P> <P> One point is given to the side that has a bowl closest to the jack and an  additional point for each bowl that's closer than the opponent's closest bowl.  After all the ends have been played, the points are totaled and the team with  the most wins.  </P> <P> In tournaments, umpires are sometimes called upon to decide measurement  disagreements. Williams, a national umpire, has sometimes been called out of  his own game for a measurement, then returned to where he left off.  </P> <P> More experienced players add strategy, directing the bowl around their  opponent's to get closer to the jack. It's OK to hit the jack but may not be to  a team's advantage.  </P> <P> "The game is very laid back, but it can be so exasperating," Marsh said. "There  can be little difference between a good bowl and a bad bowl."  </P> <P> Marsh began bowling after he moved to San Diego from Colorado 10 years ago. He  needed a hobby, and living near Balboa Park gave him the opportunity to see the  bowlers in action.  </P> <P> "I didn't like golf, and the ocean's too cold," Marsh said. "I watched these  people a couple of days and asked how to get in the club."  </P> <P> He took the three free lessons new lawn bowlers are entitled to, then paid his  yearly dues of $50, rented a locker for $7 (a year) and bought a set of used  bowls for $50.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AREA LAWN BOWLING  </P> <P> CLUBS  </P> <P> San Diego Lawn Bowling Club -- Balboa Park near the Laurel Street bridge.

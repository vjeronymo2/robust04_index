			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs applaud review Confirmation of recent rumours that the electricity distribution review would be much less severe than the market feared produced a surge of buying across the sector. The regional electricity companies (recs) outperformed the wider market by 6 per cent. Adding to the general euphoria was a feeling that the companies themselves may embark on a share buy-back spree. Another story boosting sentiment was that a potential stakebuilder in Eastern Electricity had moved into the market shortly before the close on Wednesday, buying nearly 3 per cent of the company in a single deal. A leading analyst at one of the top integrated trading houses in London said the review was 'much better than expected from the market's point of view', and could lead to a short term upturn in share prices of as much as 10 per cent. He added that all the companies had received shareholder permission to buy back their own shares. There was a minor ripple of unease around the market, however, following the emergence of rumours that an investigation had been instigated by the Stock Exchange into possible insider trading by directors of some of the recs. London Electricity was the sector's best performer, leaping 61 to 645p, closely followed by South West, up 52 at 714p, and Southern, 51 higher at 714p. There was widespread speculation that the buyer of a block of 7.7m Eastern Electricity at 704 1/4 p on Wednesday could have been a potential stakebuilder. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was said to have bought the stock for a client. The deal produced an overnight gain of more than Pounds 2.3m for the purchaser. Around the same time on Wednesday an institution bought a block of 1.7m shares in Midlands Electricity at 701 3/4 p. Midlands rose 32 1/2 to 730 1/2 p and Eastern 30 to 739p.</p>

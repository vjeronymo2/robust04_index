			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Russian privatisation protest Moscow's mayor, Mr Yuri Luzhkov, yesterday stepped up his campaign against Russia's privatisation drive, accusing Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation, of leading the economy into a dead-end. He said Mr Chubais should take responsibility for the fact that Russians had lost confidence in privatisation vouchers, distributed in 1992. Long an opponent of large-scale privatisation, the mayor restricted land and property sales in the capital earlier this year and banned the registration of joint stock companies if they were formed from state-owned enterprises. Mr Luzhkov said the state privatisation committee was simply creating conditions for speculators to buy up state property cheaply and sell it later for higher prices. 'We support the market economy and privatisation. But we do not want state property to be sold off for almost nothing. We wanted to create a class of owner-producers in Russia. But everything has been bought up by speculators,' he said. Mr Chubais responded by vowing to take legal action against Mr Luzhkov, accusing him of prompting a social explosion by violating existing laws.</p>

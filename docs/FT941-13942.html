			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Peasants]: Les paysans Francais - keepers of the countryside wearing berets and striped jerseys? Or straw-burning troublemakers who stand in the way of progress? Nicholas Woodsworth uses his family ties to investigate a threatened way of life It is 15 years since I first met the Chauvin clan in the hills of Provence. It was an exotic occasion, a country Christmas celebration to which I was coaxed - neither entirely willingly, nor at ease - by my French wife-to-be so that she might present me to her family. I was impressed, but also intimidated, by the gathering. Here, at a long farm table flanked by four generations of Chauvins, was a world in which I felt wholly alien. The food alone was exotic enough. There were stews of wild boar shot in the hills behind the house; baby quails - still complete with tiny beaks and claws - sewn up and baked in the oven; omelettes stuffed with truffles sniffed out of the earth by a much-prized family dog. To me, it was all splendid, outlandish and totally new. Even more exotic than the food, however, were the guests themselves: a confusing array of moustachioed uncles, Gauloise-smoking grandfathers, Pernod-sipping nieces. These people, I thought, were positively tribal: between the 30 or so extended family members present, there was a commingling, a sense of sharing through ties of blood which had nothing of the Anglo-Saxon in its warmth and demonstrativeness. The Chauvins were also different politically. I had never socialised with Marxists before. Here, though, was a dining room full of militant leftists and card-carrying communists munching Christmas cake as happily as anyone else. There was, however, something else that made this family so completely different for me. It was simply their daily working lives. For the Chauvins, as they themselves told me proudly, were paysans (peasants). In England, the term belongs to an earlier, feudal age. Not so in France, where few urban families have to look back more than a generation or two to find roots deep in the countryside. Here, beside the little river Doa in the Provencal back country, nothing at all separated the Chauvins from their past: they remained tied to the soil as physically and emotionally as their ancestors 400 years before. It was this sense of belonging, this deep attachment to a long-lived peasant tradition, that impressed me most. We all have an image of the paysan in our minds. In his most hackneyed form, he is cycling down the road, a beret on his head and a string of onions over his handlebars. There are variations. Sometimes, he is sly, calculating and miserly. At other times, he is cheerful, loquacious and sociable. Even when he has nothing at all to say, he still entertains by pushing his lips forward and giving us that famous Gallic shrug. Lately, though, the image has changed and the French peasant has stopped entertaining us. He is no longer the amusing character from A Year in Provence. He is the backward-looking reactionary who has tried to block economic progress for the rest of us. In an effort to retain farm subsidies and state protection for an outmoded way of life, he has set straw bales alight on the French autoroutes, blocked Parisian traffic with tractors, and done what he can to wreck negotiations on world trade. He has refused to change with a changing Europe. Is the new image of the French peasant a valid one - or is it as stereotyped and misinformed as its predecessors? Following that first meeting, I grew to admire the Chauvins tremendously. They were a resilient, resourceful, hard-working clan. They never had much money, but it seemed to me that they had something quite as valuable about them: quiet self-assurance and satisfaction with life. Later, I moved from France and lost touch with them. But, through the family connection, I heard over the years that that satisfaction was fast disappearing and that hard times had settled on the Doa. Not long ago, I returned to find out for myself how an old peasant family and modern Europe were getting along together . . . Going nowhere at Les Gauds Jean Chauvin, my wife's great-grandfather, had more sense of adventure than money. He was not conscripted into the French colonial army but, as was often the custom then, was paid to take the place of someone who was. He survived the invasion of Tonkin in one piece and on his return, like everyone in the family, took up farming. Contrary to popular image, Provence is not a mild, beneficent land. It is harsh: cold and windy in winter, dry and scorching in summer. In the Rhone valley, flat land, good soil and plenty of water for irrigation give western Provence rich fruit and vegetable crops. In Chauvin country, further to the east in the flinty hills and valleys that eventually rise to become the Alps, smallhold farming is an altogether more precarious affair. Nonetheless, in the narrow Doa valley outside the market town of Apt, Jean brought up four florid and brawny sons, each of whom in turn began farming there. One still survives. With his wife Marthe, Aime lives at Les Gauds, a tiny family hamlet of stone houses perched on the valley-side. Aime Chauvin is not as active as he used to be: a few years ago, an accident with a roto-tiller left him with one leg. But, at 81, he still gets around in a Citroen with a hand-operated clutch; and, when visitors ask him, he can still recall life at Les Gauds before any machines made an appearance there. Together, we sat at the dining table and Tante Marthe poured me a small glass of home-made walnut wine to take the chill off the winter's day. To most people the bare, tiled floors and simple furniture at Les Gauds would appear spartan. But, said Tante Marthe, compared with the pre-war years, she and Aime live like kings. Until 1938, there was no electricity in the valley and evenings were spent in lamp-light. The toilet was outdoors, as was the well for water and the stone basin for washing clothes. The shops in Apt were an hour's walk away - and too expensive to use much, anyway. Marthe grew, raised or made most of what they lived on right there - vegetables, pigs, chickens, olives, wine and goat cheese all were tended by her busy hands. Ready money for other daily needs came from the herd of sheep she kept. Horses to plough the wheat fields did not disappear until the early 1950s when Aime bought his first tractor. Like the hands of all elderly peasants, Marthe's are battered and worn; rarely, in the course of her working life, was there much time for herself. Nor was there money, Marthe said, for simple things like a new dress or a visit to the hairdresser. Instead, it went into buying, piece by piece, that single most important peasant possession - land. By the time he retired, Aime had added 11 hectares to the five he had inherited originally. 'Materially, things were not easy,' sighed Marthe, 'but it was a good life. There was a wonderful closeness in families then, and between neighbours, too. What is more, we all knew where we were going; we knew we would never get rich but, with the produce from 16 hectares, Aime and I were able to earn a living, raise our children, build a house, and equip the farm. That is what hurts now. With all the will in the world, no young peasant could produce enough on 16 hectares to do that today.' Marthe and Aime were not speaking in abstract terms. The young peasant to whom they were referring is their 38-year-old son, Daniel, who now owns the farm. Land, once a fixed standard by which peasant prosperity was measured, no longer has its traditional value - other factors have intervened. Unlike his parents, Daniel has no idea where he is going. Politics of survival at Le Marronier A kilometre down the road, in a house under a broad chestnut tree, another of Jean's sons set to tilling the earth in the 1920s. Not only was Louis an energetic peasant-farmer, he was also a staunch anti-cleric and socialist council member for Apt. Succeeding generations followed suit. Robert, son of Louis, fought with a left-wing Resistance organisation during the second world war. As teenagers in the turbulent 1960s and '70s, four of Robert's six children joined the French communist youth movement. Robert and I took a stroll around the 20 hillside hectares of cherry trees, table-grape and wine vineyards, and marrow and melon fields that he began laying out after the war with draught animals. They are now owned by Rolland, Robert's son. 'When, like Aime, I was finally able to change my horses for a tractor,' Robert mused, 'I thought: 'At last] Life is going to get better.' But it didn't. We had to work all that much harder to pay for the tractors and stay competitive with everyone else who bought tractors. The progress was technological, not social. It wasn't real progress at all. But not even technological logic applies any more. Through the '60s and '70s, the harder you worked, the more you produced and the greater was your return. It doesn't work like that now.' We trudged up the soggy winter hillside, mud sticking to our shoes. 'Life has been getting increasingly difficult for 10 years,' Robert went on. 'Every year, production costs rise: insurance, farm machinery, fertilisers, insecticides, packaging, transport, cold-storage charges. But, in the same decade, the prices we have been getting for our produce have stayed the same, or fallen. In mathematical terms, it is simple - we can no longer make a profit from what we do. Our concern now is just surviving.' Could things be that bad? Talk to Rolland, Robert urged me. We found him, thin and wiry, pruning in a vineyard. In the summer season, he is on his feet and running from 4am until 10 at night. Now, in a slower season, he had time to talk. After Rolland took over the farm from his father in 1980, he worked it with his wife, Josianne. They could not afford hired help because of high social security contributions. In spite of the saving, they made little headway: in the mid-1980s, each earned FFr5,000 (a little more than Pounds 500) a month  -just enough to re-invest in the farm to keep it going. Four years ago, things got so bad that Josianne had to take a job in town to assure the family a viable income. Rolland created a farming partnership with his cousin, Daniel, and they began working the two farms together. Last year, each made FFr5,000 a month, the same sum that Rolland earned a decade ago. They can no longer afford new investment. Rolland was something of a hot-head in his youth. As a Marxist militant, he used to take part in roadside ambushes of highway tankers carrying cheap Spanish wine. Emptying them was a way of protecting the French market. Today, like all the Chauvins, he has forsaken leftist politics - they have failed entirely to answer the needs of the paysan. Nor does he believe any longer that markets can be protected by crude means. He knows the problem of falling local prices is a complex one with worldwide causes: cheap agricultural imports from third world countries with low wage and social security costs have made his own produce uncompetitive. Raising trade barriers is not the answer for Rolland: in the end, he believes, only global commerce will solve global imbalance. Nor are EU subsidies an answer. At his level of farming, he said, they make up only the shortfall between producer cost and market price. Breaking even does not allow a centime of new investment; inevitably, farms become run down and go broke. Already, Rolland knows of seven farmers in the area who have given up and are doing garden maintenance for foreigners with holiday homes there. Rolland cannot bear the idea of leaving farming for another job. It is the only thing he has ever wanted to do, and he believes Provencal small farmers might eventually succeed in a market not of quantity but of high quality. In the meantime, he says, something must change. It cannot go on. Robert, though, is not quite sure what changes are possible. 'I cannot see the solutions to peasant decline and the frustrations that come with it. Economically, I am not sure there are any.' His real worry is over the political fallout; his years in the Resistance have given him an uncomfortable perspective. 'Every day, we live in greater uncertainty. I have seen it before. It is an atmosphere that breeds a certain mentality - I am afraid of a resurgence of what I fought against in the war. I thought I would never have to think of fascism again.' Passion for the land at Les Jeans-Jeans I left Le Marronier feeling low, but three minutes further down the road, I cheered up. Les Jeans-Jeans is another tiny hamlet filled with the offspring of yet another of Jean Chauvin's sons, Gaston. I arrived in time for lunch. The Chauvins of Les Jeans-Jeans are a gregarious lot, with a generous sense of hospitality and a great appetite for good things to eat and drink. They have had their share of human tragedies and farming disasters, which could be why they find such comfort in sociability. One does not stay a stranger there for very long. When Gerard Chauvin, a vast man with a great, biblical beard, talks about the land, he shows as much enthusiasm for life as his great-grandfather, Jean, ever did. Unlike his cousins, Rolland and Daniel, he keeps a herd of 50 goats. He is concerned about increasing regulation of his life by Brussels. He has nightmares about EU bans on unpasteurised cheese, which would wipe him out. But, for the time being, there is a good market for high-quality French goat cheese, and it allows Gerard to pursue the only life he cares about. After a vast meal and endless glasses of home-made muscadet, he walked me out through the fields towards the tinkling sound of goat bells. He talked for much of the afternoon - about goats, mountain trout fishing, sausage-making, hunting dogs, liquor stills, rabbit habits, delivering baby calves and much more besides. Gerard loves these things with a passion. I was somewhat reassured. If there were still people like that, I thought, peasant life in Provence might survive after all, in one form or another.</p>

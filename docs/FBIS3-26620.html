			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Jiahuang (0702 1367 3552), director of the Customs </F> Duty Department of the General Administration of Customs: "The  Development of China's Socialist Market Economy and Reform of  the Customs Duty System"]    [Text] In the 15 years since reform and opening-up,  China's socialist market economy has made certain progress. The  prices of agricultural and industrial products and service  prices are basically determined by cost and the supply and  demand relations, and prices set by the state have moved to a  secondary position. The stress of economic reform is being  shifted to funds, labor, technology, and other factor markets.  In the course of development of the market economy, contacts  between China and the outside world are getting ever closer, and  China's foreign trade has already exceeded one-third of its GNP.  China's economy has become an important component part of the  world's economy. In such kind of economic ties, the customs  duty system is playing an important regulatory role.    The development of China's market economy and further  economic ties between China and foreign countries require that  reform of the customs duty system should be intensified in three  respects: First, reduce the customs duty rate; second, readjust  the tax allowance policy; third, improve the customs assessment  system.    1. To lower the level of customs duty. In the early days  after the founding of the PRC, China carried out the policy of  trade protection. The average customs duty rate of the first  tariff worked out on that basis reached 53 percent. After  reform and opening-up, China gradually reduced the tax rate,  introduced the Brussels Tariff Catalogue in 1985, and changed in  1992 to the Harmonized Tax System (H.S.) [preceding initials  published in English] Catalogue in common use in various  countries, and the average tax rate was reduced to 42.5 percent.  Not all high customs duties are sure to be beneficial to the  development of the national economy. In a certain sense,  inappropriate high protection protects backwardness. It makes  the benefited departments satisfied with the existing state of  affairs without seeking progress, and does harm to the interest  of other departments. In spring 1992, the State Council decided  to reduce in the coming few years the customs duty rates in  China to that of the average level of developing countries. All  import regulatory taxes were reduced that year. At the end of  1992, China reduced the tariff of 3,371 tax items; at the end of  1993, it again reduced the tariff of 2,898 tax items. The two  tariff reductions have lowered China's tax rate by 15 percent.  Recently, the State Council Tariff Committee reduced the customs  duties of cars by a big margin and carried out provisional  reduced duty rates for a number of industrial raw and process  materials. As the building and development of China's market  economy are processes of gradual advance, the price relations  between the products of China and those of other countries  remain to be brought closer, and customs duty reduction is  therefore a complicated system engineering, of which certain  policy issues should be handled carefully, such as the issue of  promoting the development of economic relations and trade, the  issue of protecting national industries, and the issue of  carrying out industrial policies.    2. To readjust the tax allowance policy. As a law  enforcement department, China's customs has been carrying out  the preferential duty policies determined by the CPC Central  Committee, State Council, and government departments concerned  since reform and opening-up. For example, the preferential duty  policies of "assembling parts supplied by clients," "processing  of materials supplied by foreign businessmen," "processing  according to buyer's samples," and "compensation trade"  determined by the State Council in 1979. These policies have  enormously promoted the development of the processing trade,  which has so far occupied over 40 percent of the total amount of  China's import and export trade. In the early 1980's, the State  Council approved the tax allowance policy for imports by using  loans provided by World Bank and foreign governments.  Twenty-one billion dollars in preferential loans have been used  so far, which accounts for 30 percent of the total amount of  China's foreign debts. There are corresponding customs duty  preferential policies in special economic zones and coastal open  areas, and the foreign trade volume of five special economic  zones and 14 open cities comes close to one-third of China's  total volume of foreign trade.    In 1983 the CPC Central Committee and the State Council  decided to strengthen the work of using foreign investments, and  granted preferential customs duties to machines, equipment, and  materials imported by foreign investors. In early 1990's the  State Council approved preferential policies for frontier trade  and barter trade. Preferential customs duties are the outcome of  reform and opening-up, and have promoted to a certain extent the  use of foreign investments, the import of technology, and  foreign trade development. However, there are too many tax  allowance policies after all, which have caused serious  comparisons between regions, trades, and enterprises, and become  obstacles to equal competition in the market economy.  Therefore, with further development of the market economy, we  should clear up the tax allowance policies. Whatever  preferential policies are beneficial to reform and opening- up  and conform with the rules and regulations of the market economy  should undoubtedly be continued for implementation. In the  process of clearing up, we should judge our existing policies by  the general principle of international trade -- the principle of  most-favored-nation treatment and that of national treatment.  At the end of 1993, upon deciding to greatly reduce the customs  duties of cars, the State Council abolished their preferential  customs duties. This is a good beginning.    3. The Customs' assessment system draws close to GATT.  China has adopted Brussels' assessment methods over a long  period of time. In judging whether the declared prices of  imported commodities are acceptable or not, we use a kind of  abstract "regular price" concept, tending to repel the price  difference of the same kind of products produced in different  countries and regions. When she revised the provisions of  import and export tariff in 1992, China basically gave up the  Brussels assessment concept, and accepted in principle the  "actual transaction price" concept of the GATT Tokyo Round  Assessment Agreement. Ninety-nine percent of the several  million declaration forms handled each year by the Customs  offices in China accept the actual transaction prices declared.  They put into effect the minimum prices for only a small number  of declaration forms, or replace the declared prices by prices  of the same or similar products, by structural prices, or by  deducting prices. Due to various kinds of complicated reasons,  including the facts that the legal system is weak in the course  of building the system of the market economy, that the means of  antidumping has not been built up, and that the customs tariff  tend to be somewhat low, it is quite common that import and  export enterprises at present declare prices low or hide the  truth in declaration. To cope with such a situation, Customs  cannot but adopt the method of setting the lowest duty-paid  prices for a number of products. With further in-depth economic  structural reform in China, especially with the pricing reform  being further in position, with further reduction of customs  duties, and with the building up of antidumping, antisubsidies,  and other protection means, the Chinese Customs will gradually  narrow the scope of commodities using the methods of the lowest  duty-paid prices, till finally giving up such a method.    The reform of the customs duty system has already promoted  and will further promote the development of China's socialist  market economy.</p>

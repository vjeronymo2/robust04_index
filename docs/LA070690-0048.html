			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PEST-CONTROL RELEASE EXCLUDES COUNTY  </P> <P> The state Department of Food and Agriculture has begun releasing a breed of  stingless wasps in Southern California to combat the devastating ash whitefly,  officials announced Thursday.  </P> <P> Ventura County, however, has been excluded from the first wave of releases  because of short supplies, said Peter Stoddard, a research scientist with the  agriculture department's pest management branch.  </P> <P> The wasps are harmless to humans but act as a biological control against the  ash whitefly.  </P> <P> The wasps are being bred in a UC Riverside greenhouse, but reproduction has  been relatively slow, Stoddard said. Twelve counties from San Diego to Fresno  are expected to see releases of small colonies of wasps before the summer is  through.  </P> <P> The ash whitefly was first detected two years ago by suburban homeowners in the  eastern part of Ventura County where large shade trees have been attacked by  the pesky insect.  </P> <P> The tiny whitefly attacks a tree by sucking its sap. It produces a sticky fluid  that coats cars, sidewalks and patio furniture. Left unchecked, the fly  eventually kills all the leaves on the infested tree.  </P> <P> Agriculture officials say they are trying to stop the spread of the whitefly  before it threatens commercial crops.

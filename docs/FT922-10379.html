			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Le Creuset advances to Pounds 3.32m DESPITE the recession, Le Creuset, the USM-quoted French company famous for its cast-iron cookware, produced a 5.1 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.16m to Pounds 3.32m in the year to December 31 1991. Turnover improved by 5 per cent, from Pounds 32.3m to Pounds 33.9m. Mr Paul Van Zuydam, chairman, said that first quarter sales were encouraging with volumes up in most parts of the world. He said that this should have a positive effect on factory overhead recovery and operating profit. Earnings per share rose from 13.1p to 13.7p. A dividend of FFr0.42 is proposed for the year, compared with a total of FFr0.39 for 1990.</p>

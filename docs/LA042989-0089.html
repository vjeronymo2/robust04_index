			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIGHT WINDS ELIMINATE POSSIBILITY OF A RECORD IN RACE TO ENSENADA  </P> <P> Forget about any records in the 42nd Newport-to-Ensenada yacht race. Mother  Nature took care of that Friday night.  </P> <P> The race started in a light five-to-seven knot southerly breezes that dwindled  to near zero off the Coronados Islands south of South Diego.  </P> <P> Dennis Conner, in Stars &amp; Stripes, was spotted off Rosarito Beach, about 75  miles from Ensenada, with no wind. He called the committee boat about 9 p.m.  and said he was still sitting off Rosarito Beach with no wind.  </P> <P> Doug Wall, Newport Ocean Sailing Assn. president, said no boats were expected  to finish until early this morning and won't come close to the elapsed-time  record of 10 hours 22 minutes, set by the catamaran Double Bullet in 1983.  </P> <P> Friday, clear skies greeted the 520 boats. First off the dual lines, in an  orderly start, were the Ocean Racing Catamarans on the inshore line and the  Ultra-Light Displacement monohulls on the offshore line. Conner's Stars &amp;  Stripes and Rudy Choy's Aikane X-5, the favored catamarans, were lost in a  crowd of 28 multihulls. Blondie and Taxi Dancer led the 17 ultra-lights, known  as downwind sleds, across the line in what was expected to be a close, 125-mile  race.  </P></p>

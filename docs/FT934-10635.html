			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Financial services help BAT shrug off cigarette price war BAT Industries increased pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 1.36bn for the nine months to September 30. Recovery in the group's financial services more than offset the growing impact of the US cigarette price war on tobacco profits. Brown &amp; Williamson, the US tobacco subsidiary, reported a 70 per cent fall in profits during the third quarter as retailers and wholesalers reduced orders until lower prices took effect. B &amp; W's profits for the nine months were 50 per cent down. Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive, said US cigarette prices were now more stable. The price gap between premium cigarettes and economy brands had been cut from Dollars 8 to Dollars 4 a carton. With the prospect of a sharp rise in federal tax in October next year, Mr Broughton said manufacturers' price increases could not be ruled out. He also launched a sharp attack on US legislation requiring cigarette makers to use 75 per cent US-grown tobacco in their products, calling it 'a flagrant breach of Gatt rules'. BAT's overall tobacco profits rose from Pounds 877m to Pounds 889m, but declined 14 per cent if a Pounds 135m gain from an exchange of cigarette brands with American Brands, the US tobacco and drinks group, is excluded. Operations in Germany suffered from recession and increased smuggling, particularly from Poland, but cigarette exports from the UK continued to rise and higher profit contributions came from Australia, Canada, and most African and Asian markets. Profits from continuing financial services operations increased by Pounds 203m to Pounds 593m, with the contribution from the group's life companies growing by 13 per cent to Pounds 229m. Total underwriting losses on continued business at Eagle Star fell to Pounds 100m, from Pounds 244m. Both personal and commercial lines in the UK showed substantial improvement in underwriting results. Underwriting losses from domestic mortgage indemnity business amounted to Pounds 26m for the quarter. The result was marred by a high level of claims from discontinued activities at Eagle Star. Provisions on financial insurance business - mainly commercial mortgage indemnity and agency pool business - amounted to Pounds 94m, compared with Pounds 57m at the half-way stage. Allied Dunbar's contribution to trading profit increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 109m, while the contribution of Farmers' grew by 8 per cent to Pounds 328m. Earnings per share grew 56 per cent to 29.3p for the nine months. Lex, Page 20; London SE, Page 42</p>

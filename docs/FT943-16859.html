			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Ferruzzi profits ahead Ferruzzi Finanziaria, the Italian food and chemicals group, said operating profits in the first five months of 1994 were 46.5 per cent higher than during the same period last year, AP-DJ reports from Rome. The company said at its annual shareholders meeting that gross operating margins were 6.8 per cent in the first five months of 1994, compared to margins of 5 per cent last time. It said it expected to cut its debt to L11,000bn by the end of 1994, compared with L21,950bn in 1993. The reduction will come from restructuring of the debts, capital increases and sales of assets. Ferruzzi also said gross operating profits for the first two months of 1994 were L447bn, up 26 per cent from the year-ago period. The restructuring plan has provided total estimated benefits of L800bn so far, of which L285bn accrues to Montedison, the chemicals group, according to the company.</p>

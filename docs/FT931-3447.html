			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Yeltsin fears communist revival: President's aides signal plan for plebiscite under international supervision MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, yesterday accused his parliamentary opponents of seeking to restore communist rule. His aides signalled that he planned to secure popular support in a plebiscite under international supervision. In a statement issued by Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, his press secretary, Mr Yeltsin accused the Congress of Peoples' Deputies of denying the people the right to a referendum and of 'violating the constitution'. Its decisions during last week's four-day session were 'an attempt to . . . return the levers of government to the communist nomenklatura'. Mr Yeltsin would give his response in the next few days, Mr Kostikov said, adding in a later interview: 'I think that Boris Nikolayevich (the president) intends to act as decisively as he showed himself capable of doing in the fatal days of August 1991' - a reference to the failed communist putsch against president Mikhail Gorbachev. The latest clashes between the president and his hardline opponents in parliament came as western leaders repeated their support for Mr Yeltsin. German chancellor Helmut Kohl warned that not only Mr Yeltsin's domestic reforms but also the entire process of peaceful international co-operation was threatened by the political backlash in Moscow. A similar message is expected to be delivered by French president Francois Mitterrand when he arrives in Moscow on an official visit today. The expressions of international concern follow a weekend meeting of officials from the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations in Hong Kong. However, beyond considering more effective ways of targeting their aid for Russia, there is little sign that western governments are any closer to agreeing increased financial assistance. Mr Yeltsin's tactic now appears to consist of proceeding to a plebiscite on who governs the country. Mr Yegor Gaidar, former prime minister and now chief economic adviser to the president, said yesterday that Mr Yeltsin could constitutionally hold a plebiscite under the existing law on referendums. Mr Gaidar said 'probably it would be a good idea to hold such a plebiscite involving international observers.' Mr Yeltsin's opponents, by contrast, insist that Congress is the constitutional authority. Mr Konstantin Zlobin, the spokesman for the Russian parliament, yesterday rejected the president's allegations and said that the 'democratic gains' made by the Congress last week 'significantly reduce the possibilities of legal cover for the destructive activities' of Mr Yeltsin's advisers. To broaden his political support ahead of a plebiscite, Mr Yeltsin may also consider appointing some centrist figures to his cabinet, according to Mr Gaidar.

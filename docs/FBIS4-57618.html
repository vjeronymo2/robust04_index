			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edgar Barberena S.] </F>   [Text] A mysterious last-minute order, which all reporters  attributed to Daniel Ortega, prohibited Radio Sandino from  joining a national radio network to broadcast a roundtable  discussion among the main proponents of renewal in the FSLN  [Sandinist National Liberation Front], whose slogan is: "For a  Sandinism That Turns to the Majority."    Radio Sandino's mobile unit had been setting up equipment to  join the network at 1000, but the technicians received a  last-minute order not to transmit. However, they were  authorized to record the discussion held by Dr. Sergio Ramirez,  FSLN directorate member Luis Carrion, and Commander Dora Maria  Tellez.    Before the panel discussion began, and as we monitored the  FSLN radio station, we heard a Radio Sandino announcer tell the  station's mobile unit to modulate the signal.    Yesterday EL NUEVO DIARIO phoned Orlando Gomez, deputy  director of Radio Sandino and one of the persons invited to the  panel discussion, to ask him why the station had not broadcast  the roundtable. A secretary said Gomez was not in his office.  The time was a few minutes before noon.    The mysterious order to leave out a Sandinist sector forced  the rest of the radio stations to continue the network, which  was then headed by Radio El Pensamiento. The station's  broadcast was affected by a "strange" interference in the  telephone line used for the transmission.    Despite the mysterious order that silenced those who sponsor  the renewal of Sandinism, the panel was broadcast by the  following stations: Radio El Pensamiento, Radio Istmo, Radio  Noticias, Radio Horizonte, Radio BB Stereo, Radio Fiesta, Radio  America, Radio Stereo Sol, and Radio Universidad.  <H5>  Development of the Roundtable </H5>   During the panel discussion, the first to be broadcast by a  large number of radio stations and held only a few hours before  the opening of the FSLN Special Congress, Commander Luis Carrion  referred to the charges against Commander Henry Ruiz for  accepting the nomination to the post of FSLN secretary general.  "It seems there are some comrades who think this is a crime or  a sin," Carrion noted, while saying that in the past "Modesto"  [Ruiz] was accused of being a "leftist" by the same people who  are now accusing him of being a right-winger. "I think that is  the main reason why this candidacy has so much support in the  FSLN ranks. People see this as an option for unity in the  congress."    Carrion indicated that a proposal began circulating this  week  and will be submitted to the congress to empower the Sandinist  Assembly to appoint editorial boards for the Sandinist news  media based on the one that emerged during an "ad hoc" assembly  in Managua.    He said that if this proposal is submitted, the congress  must  define which media are FSLN media. "At any rate, we will ask  the congress to clearly establish which media are Sandinist  media and which are not, because there is confusion about some  of them. One example is Radio Ya, the status of which is not  defined. Rather than serving as an open platform for all  Sandinists who wish to express their views, it is used as a tool  of currents that have excluded "everyone who doesn't think like  them."  <H5>  FSLN's Behavior </H5>   As Ramirez spoke about the FSLN's behavior, he discussed his  party's previous ability to single-handedly control the armed  institution, the government, and media organizations, but when  the FSLN lost the 1990 elections, it continued to use the same  methods it used as a clandestine party.    The FSLN has had a hard time adjusting to being a civilian  opposition party that lacks the basic components of power, so it  must begin an intense campaign to recover power through the only  means available; the elections.    Sergio added: "I think the FSLN, as a political party with  not only an outward intention of democracy but an internal  democratic structure, must successfully face the challenge of  the 1996 elections." He also added that his party must  definitively end the hierarchical command structure. "I am not  interested in discussing whether that method was necessary in  the past," he added.    <H5>      Good-Bye to Vanguardism </H5>   Sergio said the FSLN can no longer call itself the  "Nicaraguan Vanguard" because it makes no sense. It made sense  during the armed conflict when people had to be led to an  uprising. Now we must see the FSLN as a revolutionary party  that is outwardly and inwardly democratic.    As for affiliation, Ramirez said "we cannot accept an FSLN  with followers, members, associates, and supporters; that is, we  cannot accept an FSLN that is like a train with first-, second-,  third-, and fourth-class cars and even a caboose.    "All Sandinists must belong to one category; they must have  the same duties and obligations. There cannot be a group of  illuminati atop an ivory tower revealing the ideological truth  to those on the ground who must only obey. That is not a  winning party but a monarchic sect."    Regarding criticism by conservative and orthodox FSLN groups  that those who favor party renewal are "bourgeois" or  "bourgeoisie-friendly," Ramirez said those people have very  peculiar concepts of what constitutes an offense.    "I cannot say for certain that someone who calls me a  bourgeois is indeed a proletarian; life is no longer that easy.  It is very complex because many social classes are represented  in the FSLN. There are even independently wealthy people who are  engaged in private activities."    The first phone interruption during the radio network took  place when Sergio was answering questions from Allan Tefel Alba,  one of the reporters officially invited to the discussion. The  second interruption took place when Jose Esteban Quesada from  the [Radio Sandino] "Events" newscast was speaking.  <H5>  Sabotage </H5>   Reporter Teresa Rios called attention to the sabotage of the  FSLN renewal supporters and said that reporters from the  orthodox-controlled media failed to attend the conference, which  led her to wonder if there are two FSLN parties.    Our colleague's questions were answered by Deputy Dora Maria  Tellez, who said she had no doubt that the outcome of the  congress "would differ from what we are currently seeing. Now  we see a group of companeros who resorted to certain methods of  attack and epithets to defend their positions. I do not think  congressmen will make the same decision. I think they will  support unified positions."  <H5>  Surprises in the Congress </H5>   "I think the Congress will make the right decision about  which path the FSLN must take to become a true alternative for  the people and for their daily struggle to reach power. I am  convinced congressmen will reject the sectarianism, the  offenses, and the epithets that the overwhelming majority of  Sandinists are rejecting, because no one will agree that  'Modesto is a rightist,'" explained Tellez.    The deputy emphatically said that Commander Daniel Ortega,  who heads the so-called Democratic Left, resorted to political  intolerance, sectarianism, and attacks on all dissenting  positions, a strategy that "hasn't harmed us but has harmed the  FSLN."    "We have tried to avoid responding to the name-calling with  more name-calling, but obviously there is an image we are  projecting to the people. The important thing is that the FSLN  congress come up with a winning electoral formula and a unified  solution to face the government's neoliberal policies."    Dora Maria added that the Congress could be the right place  for all of those who are resorting to name-calling "to correct  themselves instead of confusing the FSLN rank and file.    "We want an open, broad, flexible, and tolerant FSLN, an  FSLN  that respects people's opinions. However, one group is  proposing a closed and sectarian FSLN," concluded Deputy Tellez.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Duo Duo (1122 1122): "Lu Ping Says Chris Patten Is in </F> Doomsday Mood"]    [Text] Shenzhen 21 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Lu Ping,  director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office, who is holding a meeting here accepted a special  interview with this agency's reporter this afternoon, and  ridiculed the series of recent performances by Hong Kong  Governor Chris Patten, saying this was an expression of his  doomsday mood.    Using an analogy which Hong Kong residents are familiar  with,  namely, the operational methods of a company boss dealing with  Chris Patten, Lu Ping said that a boss who knew perfectly well  that his company was to change hands in less than three years  from today, but who was bent on making personnel arrangements  for three years hence or even 30 years without consulting the  new boss, was this not a joke? Of course, the new boss might  refuse to accept this when he took over the company.    Lu Ping indicated that Chris Patten knows perfectly well  that  there are only three years left of British rule in Hong Kong,  but he wants to make arrangements for the Legislative Council  and its major officials for three years later. In actual fact,  he is attempting to make arrangements for their agents, so that  their spirits would be left behind to continue to affect Hong  Kong when they eventually leave the territory.    Regarding Chris Patten's arguments in his speech delivered  at  the British Foreign Affairs Committee that the British Hong Kong  Government wants to put glass in the windows, whereas the  Chinese side wants to smash them, Lu Ping said that Chris Patten  wanted to arbitrarily fix English-style stained glass in the  windows without first asking the landlord's permission in an  attempt to prevent the sun's rays from entering the house. That  being the case, it was precisely Chris Patten who must make a  clean breast of his ultimate motives to the world. After three  years, when the landlord recovers the house, of course he had  the right to remove those window panes and let the sun's rays  shine all over Hong Kong. Here, the question of whether or not  we have courage to do that does not exist.    On Hong Kong's politics and economy, Lu Ping reiterated that  the Chinese Government has all along advocated the separation of  politics and the economy. Reviewing the talks on Hong Kong's  constitutional reforms, he said that the Chinese side had  already made very great concessions economically. As for the  new airport, Lu Ping stated that the responsibility did not rest  with the Chinese side. He said that there were two principles  in the Memorandum of Understanding on Hong Kong's New Airport:  First, low costs and high economic returns, without creating  difficulties for the future special administrative region [SAR]  government; and second, a minimum of HK$25 billion [Hong Kong  dollars] in financial reserves should be left to the SAR  government, and debt left to the SAR government should not  exceed HK$5 billion. At the same time, the Chinese side had  expressed where it stood, namely, they supported building a new  airport. So long as the airport was built on the basis of the  Memorandum, there was nothing left for the Chinese and British  side to say.    Lu Ping described the British Hong Kong Government's policy  on the airport issue as being the creation of side issues; now  the debt left to the future SAR government would far exceed HK$5  billion, even exceeding the financial reserves of the SAR  government. How could it deny that a financial burden would be  left to the SAR government?    Lu Ping believes that we do not wrong the British side by  saying that it has violated the Memorandum of Understanding; it  was also very clear on which side the responsibility lay  regarding delays in the airport project.    Lu Ping criticized Hamish Macleod's recent remarks that  China  had tried to use the airport projects to put pressure on the  constitutional reform talks, indicating that the Chinese  Government had never had such thinking. What was Mr. Hamish  Macleod really after? It made people doubt whether the British  side really wanted to talk. Therefore, it could be seen that  those people who harped on the same old tune about the Chinese  side wanting to link politics to the economy were precisely the  group who want to turn the airport issue into a political one.    Lu Ping said that the Preliminary Working Committee of the  Pereparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR sincerely hoped that  the British Hong Kong Government would send men to explain  matters concerning the airport authority, proceeding from an  active angle to promote a solution to the airport issue at the  earliest possible date. Such sincerity could be found in the  letter the leaders of the two economic ad hoc groups of the  Preliminary Working Committee had addressed to Anson Chan Fang  On-sang. However, the British side had flatly turned down this  suggestion, whereas Anson Chan Fang On- sang had failed to reply  to the letter in question up to this moment. Once again,  politics and the economy were being linked.    Recalling the fact that during the Sino-British talks over  the constitutional reform issue, the Chinese side had agreed to  the Central reclamation project, Lu Ping stated: We could have  procrastinated, but why should we have given our consent? This  is evidence to the fact that we do not link politics to the  economy.    Lu Ping said: We do not hope that the Sino-British political  differences will affect Sino-British economic ties, but should  the British side insist on linking politics to the economy, thus  affecting Sino-British economic relations and Hong Kong's  economy, the responsibility does not rest with the Chinese side.    Lu Ping said frankly that the crux lay in the fact that  there  should be some common aspirations and an atmosphere of  cooperation between the two sides. Only then, could a major  issue become a minor one; otherwise, a tiny issue can change  into a major one, and a simple matter may become complicated.  Lu Ping said that the Chinese side wished for results should  talks be resumed, but did not wish to see a repetition of the  talks on the 1994/1995 electoral arrangements, which were a  waste of time. It was a pity that the British side had not only  refused to cooperate, but had even adopted a confrontational  attitude. He could only express regrets and disappointment at  that.    Regarding the British side claim that it would leave a  fortune behind in Hong Kong for the Chinese Government, Lu Ping  said that Britain had no right to say this. This was the Hong  Kong people's money, and the Chinese Government did not want a  penny. We tried hard to squeeze every cent to leave HK$25  billion in the kitty during the airport negotiations. But we  did not do that for Lu Ping, nor did we do it for the Chinese  Government. It was for the people of Hong Kong in order to make  preparations for a sound economic basis for the future SAR  Government. Three years from now, Chris Patten would leave Hong  Kong, but the Chinese side would have to bear responsibility for  the Hong Kong people to ensure Hong Kong's long-term prosperity  and stability.    When this reporter asked Lu Ping about Chris Patten quoting  Sir David Akers-Jones at the House of Commons Foreign Affairs  Select Committee on TV this morning, attacking the Chinese side  by saying that "the Chinese style is not to rig elections, but  they do like to know the result before they are held," Lu Ping  said: Regarding such a "cheap joke" by Chris Patten, I can only  despise it; it was looking at a gentleman's vision from the  viewpoint of a mean person. I do not believe that Chris Patten  did not have any idea about the electoral outcome in his  constituency during the last general election in Britain; it was  a pity that Chris Patten did not know his own limitations. That  was why he made an erroneous estimation. Here we can have some  idea about his so-called "credibility." As for the fact that he  asked a certain Mr. Sze to respond to his speech on behalf of  the Hong Kong people at the hearing, this leaves much room for  criticism; people wonder just how many people in Hong Kong would  regard this "loyal" (Lu Ping said forgive me for quoting Chris  Patten's own words) follower as one of themselves?    The reporter hoped that Lu Ping would give an appraisal of  Chris Patten. Lu Ping smiled and said: He is a politician, but  not a good one, nor an honest one.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow stages late surge on program buying Wall Street AFTER drifting in narrow trading ranges for most of the day, US stocks ended with solid gains yesterday, thanks to a late burst of program buying, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.47 at 3,468.75, having spent almost the entire day only a few points above opening values. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, finishing 1.56 ahead at 444.36, while the Nasdaq composite was 0.24 firmer at 683.06. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 221.5m shares, while rises outpaced declines by 1,059 to 859. Once again the absence of fresh economic news, or a lead from either overseas equity markets or from a becalmed US bond market, left investors searching for inspiration at the opening. Although prices rose sharply on Monday morning, the buying was mostly technical in nature and by the end of the day the Dow had registered a gain of only 6 points, which meant that the markets' main index had barely moved for five trading days - a reflection of investors' uncertainty about the outlook for the economy, corporate earnings and stock prices. This pattern was maintained for most of the day, with many investors deciding to sit on the sidelines, at least until the next piece of economic data - today's release of the April producer prices index. The Dow and the S &amp; P suddenly took off, however, in the final hour of trading as computerised buy programs lifted a range of leading stocks. Anheuser Busch, the largest brewer in the US, climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 51 3/4 in busy trading on reports that beer may be exempted from President Bill Clinton's proposed 'sin' taxes, which are likely to be levied on cigarette and liquor sales. Philip Morris, owner of the company which makes Miller Beer, the main domestic competitor to Anheuser Busch's Budweiser brands, failed to receive a lift from the news. Its shares declined Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 51 1/2 , primarily because of profit-taking in the wake of recent gains by the stock. Bank shares were in favour as a group, posting gains across the board. Citicorp added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 28 1/4 , Chemical Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 39 5/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 31. On the Nasdaq market, technology stocks ran into sellers. Intel fell Dollars 3 to Dollars 99 1/2 on 3.7m shares traded after brokerage Kidder Peabody lowered its investment rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'accumulate'. Canada TORONTO closed marginally higher as a rally in gold issues, underpinned by a recovery in bullion futures prices, pulled the market up from earlier losses and offset weakness in banking shares. Dealers said the overall tone was lacklustre as the market consolidates from several months of gains and heavy volumes. The TSE 300 index was finally up 1.8 at 3,780.4 and rises led falls by 355 to 344. Turnover was 54.9m shares. Thomson Corp slipped CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 15 3/8 . The company said Mr Michael W. Johnston resigned as chief executive of Thomson Newspapers, one of Thomson Corp's three major operating units.</p>

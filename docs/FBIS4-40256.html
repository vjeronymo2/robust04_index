			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 24, 6-12 June </F> 94]    [Text] Despite its 67 percent completion, construction of  the Varyag (Varangian) aircraft carrier was frozen since Russia,  the former Soviet Navy's successor, refused to finance it.    The Nikolaev Navy yard, which started the ship's  construction, is said to have suffered colossal losses involving  the ship's maintenance (see UBN no. 1/1993).    The Ukrainian Government remains undecided on the  construction completion issue.    The Varyag, which was designed to carry as many as 80 combat  aircraft and thus could be employed for naval task force  missions, is said to be too costly (about $1 billion) to make  prospects of its marketing abroad bright.    The Ministry of Engineering, MIC [military-industrial  complex] and conversion is reported as studying the Varyag's  utilization.    However, the almost completed Ulyanov aircraft carrier,  which  was scrapped for metal, failed to find buyers. The Chernomorski  Navy yard, which was given the right to sell the scrapped ship,  is reported as engaged in negotiations with a West German firm  to this effect.    The ill-fated Varyag's replica, the Russian Navy's only  aircraft carrier, the Admiral of Fleet Kuznetsov, which belongs  to Russia's Northern Fleet, was built by the Chernomorski Navy  yard, too.    This class ships' precursors included the Moskva, Leningard  air-capable cruisers and the Kiev aircraft carrier.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Canada forced to avoid fast lane for growth: Bernard Simon previews a mini-budget that has expansionary hopes amid restraining realities CANADA'S politicians were in rare agreement after the constitutional referendum in October that their highest priority was to rev up the sluggish domestic economy. The federal government immediately began preparing its strategy for recovery, with a multi-billion dollar infrastructure renewal programme as its centrepiece. Prospects for growth were strengthened last night when the Bank of Canada, the central bank, reduced its key lending rate from 8.82 to 8.27 per cent. In its wake banks moved to cut their prime lending rates, with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, one of the six leading banks, lowering its rate by half a point to 9.25 per cent. However, in the five weeks since the referendum, worries about the elusive business recovery have shared the headlines with a currency crisis and mounting concern about the state of government finances. Politicians and bureaucrats who favoured a strong dose of stimulation in the mini-budget have found their plans blocked by others urging tighter fiscal and monetary discipline. When Finance Minister Don Mazankowski delivers his mini-budget in the House of Commons today, therefore, expansion is likely to be tempered by the need for fiscal restraint. The Canadian Imperial Bank noted in an economic forecast released last week that 'any fiscal package, unless financed through expenditure cuts, will have to be modest'. Mr Paul Darby, director of forecasting at the Conference Board of Canada, adds: 'It looks as if (the mini-budget) will turn into more of a restrictive exercise than an expansionary exercise.' Even Ontario's social-democratic government, which came to office two years ago promising public-spending initiatives, is tightening its belt. Ontario last week announced austerity measures which include cuts in transfer payments to hospitals, schools and municipalities, a 7 per cent jump in university tuition fees and a three-year delay in implementing a scheme promising equal pay to men and women for work of equal value. Without these measures its budget deficit would have soared from a projected CDollars 8.1bn (Pounds 4.1bn) to CDollars 12.3bn. On the federal level, the Progressive-Conservative government has been dogged by over-optimistic fiscal planning since it came to office in 1984. One budget after another has promised to bring down the budget deficit and reverse Canada's spiralling debt. In practice, however, the Finance Department's forecasts have invariably erred on the bright side. In last February's budget, Mr Mazankowski pledged that 'despite the economic slowdown, we will hold the deficit to CDollars 31.4bn' in the fiscal year to March 31 1992. He predicted that, based on gross domestic product growth of 2.7 per cent in 1992, the shortfall would dip to CDollars 27.5bn in the current year, and that the government's borrowing needs would shrink to nil by 1995-96. But the 1991-92 shortfall came to CDollars 34.5bn, the second highest ever. With growth unlikely to exceed 1-1.5 per cent this year, the 1992-93 deficit is now expected to be CDollars 33bn-CDollars 34bn. Hopes of eliminating the borrowing requirement within four years have all but disappeared. Financial markets have become increasingly jittery about Canadian governments' appetite for debt. Burns Fry, a Toronto securities firm, predicts that federal and provincial borrowings will reach CDollars 60bn in the 12 months to next March, almost double the level five years ago. Some foreign institutions, in particular, are nearing the limits of their portfolios earmarked for Canadian debt. News of the latest budget shortfalls contributed to a sudden run on the Canadian dollar. In the past three months the currency has slumped from 84 US cents to less than 78 cents. It now appears to have stabilised at about 78 cents and it was this which permitted last night's lowering of interest rates. Until then, the central bank had sought to smooth the currency's fall by pushing up interest rates. This rise in borrowing costs might have delayed the long-heralded business recovery. Mr Leo de Bever, chief economist at Nomura Securities in Toronto, predicts an 'extremely weak' fourth quarter. The Conference Board has already lowered its 1993 GDP forecast from 3.2 per cent to what Mr Darby calls 'the high twos'. Just as missed budget targets have prompted calls for fiscal restraint from some quarters, the prospect of delayed recovery has led others to urge that Mr Mazankowski give top priority to reflation. The prospect of a stimulatory fiscal package from the Clinton administration in Washington has strengthened the hand of those calling for similar measures in Canada. Canada's unemployment rate is over 11 per cent and hardly a week passes without news of another big corporate retrenchment. Dofasco, the country's biggest steelmaker, announced last week that it plans to close a mill with the loss of 2,000 jobs. Canadian National, the state-owned railway company, plans to cut 10,000 jobs, or almost a third of its workforce. The political argument in favour of stimulation may be most persuasive of all. The Conservatives are languishing at rock-bottom in public opinion polls, and have been banking on a business recovery to improve their popularity before the general election next year. Torn between the equally forceful calls for growth and for fiscal prudence, Mr Mazankowski is expected to steer a middle course in the mini-budget today.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Delta warns it may cut routes DELTA Air Lines, one of the three big US carriers, yesterday said the performance of its loss-making transatlantic routes had improved dramatically over the summer but warned that it may cancel unprofitable routes. Mr Ron Allen, chairman, admitted that the company's foray into Europe had been more difficult than expected. Delta was essentially a domestic carrier until it bought Pan Am's transatlantic routes two years ago. 'We have had lower market share, poorer economic conditions, higher structural costs and greater start-up costs than anticipated over the north Atlantic,' Mr Allen said. 'Pan Am had a name that was known around the world. Delta's name is not that well known around the world,' he added. Mr Allen said Delta's transatlantic performance had improved between June and August, with its load factor rising to 73 per cent from 70 per cent and revenues at its Frankfurt hub up about 50 per cent. He would not say whether the routes had been profitable over summer, but said 'If we can keep on the present trends, then I think it (the transatlantic routes) can be a profitable contributor in 1994.' The carrier has already cancelled some of its German routes. Although Mr Allen said 'we will do more of this as we look at our summer results and decide which routes cannot be profitable,' and that some routes may be consolidated, he added that Delta has no plans to leave any markets entirely, nor is it planning a radical restructuring. The company, which has already slashed about 6,000 jobs, expects to cut another 3,000 by the end of the year, bringing the number of employees to about 70,000.</p>

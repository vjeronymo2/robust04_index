			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHOUP FIRING NOT TIED TO SCIAC MOVE, OFFICIALS SAY  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran President Jerry Miller announced at a Southern California  Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meeting on May 3 that the 1989 season would  be Bob Shoup's last as the school's football coach, but SCIAC sources deny that  Shoup's dismissal was a prerequisite of Cal Lutheran's admittance into their  organization.  </P> <P> Miller's announcement to the SCIAC and to several Cal Lutheran administrators  and faculty members preceded, by more than three months, the public  announcement of Shoup's dismissal August 8.  </P> <P> "I don't feel as though our conference tried to impose pressure on anybody  about that," said Curt Tong, Pomona-Pitzer's athletic director. "I don't think  it had anything to do with the personnel. I think the SCIAC's concern centered  around athletic scholarships. Our only real reservations about withholding  membership centered on that fact."  </P> <P> During the May 3 meeting at Cal Lutheran, Miller gave athletic directors and  faculty-athletic representatives from the SCIAC schools and Cal Lutheran a  progress report on his school's transition from the National Collegiate  Athletic Assn. Division II, which grants athletic scholarships, to the  non-scholarship Division III SCIAC.  </P> <P> "He indicated that at this point, CLU is on track" in the transition, the  minutes read. "Some of the part-time coaching positions, for example,  basketball, are shifting to full-time status, and the present football coach  will conclude his coaching duties at CLU at the end of the 1989 season."  </P> <P> A background paper prepared for the Cal Lutheran Board of Regents by Regent Jim  Tyner points out that the SCIAC football coaches recommended that Cal Lutheran  not be admitted.  </P> <P> "The only negative recommendation we had was from the football coaches," said  John Zinda, the athletic director and football coach at Claremont-Mudd-Scripps,  who said the vote was 4-2.  </P> <P> According to Zinda, the coaches in 15 sports voted on Cal Lutheran's  admittance.  </P> <P> "The propriety of SCIAC schools attempting to dictate (Cal Lutheran's)  personnel practices is left to your judgment," Tyner writes.  </P> <P> However, SCIAC sources contend that Shoup, who fought Cal Lutheran's move to  the SCIAC, was not the reason for their opposition.  </P> <P> "I definitely don't think there was a vendetta against Shoup," said Dale  Widolff, football coach at Occidental. However, Widolff added, "It's public  knowledge that he didn't want to be in the SCIAC, isn't it?"  </P> <P> Widolff emphasized Cal Lutheran's institutional advantages in football,  mentioning the university's association with the Dallas Cowboys, since  terminated, and the name recognition gained from having played at a higher  level.  </P> <P> "The discussion was let them get rid of (scholarships) and then we'll let them  get into the conference," Zinda said.  </P></p>

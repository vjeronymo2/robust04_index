			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Macmillan is refused Berlitz injunction MACMILLAN, the main pub-lishing subsidiary of the insolvent Maxwell Communications Corporation, was yesterday refused an injunction stopping four banks selling shares in Berlitz, the language company, pending the trial later this year to resolve a dispute over ownership of the shares. A High Court judge decided that, because of the volatility of the Berlitz share price, an injunction could harm the banks more than the refusal of an order would damage Macmillan. However, after making his ruling, Mr Justice Hoffmann agreed that if Macmillan could, within 24 hours, raise the money needed to cover the banks against a Dollars 4 (220p) drop in the current share price - calculated by Macmillan at Dollars 17.5m - it could have an injunction. In November 1990 Macmillan's 56 per cent holding in Berlitz was transferred to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private company in the Maxwell group, at the instigation of the late Mr Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin. Some of the 10.6m shares were subsequently pledged to banks to secure loans to other Maxwell companies. The court was concerned with 1.9m shares held by Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings, 2.4m by Swiss Volksbank, 1.5m by Credit Suisse and 3.3m by Morgan Stanley Trust Company. Morgan Stanley did not claim to own its holding and did not oppose an injunction. The judge said the other banks questioned Macmillan's ability to pay them damages if it was granted an injunction but lost at trial. Although Macmillan's latest balance sheet showed a Dollars 162m excess of assets over liabilities that was rapidly being eroded by losses. In the year to March 31 the net loss had been Dollars 277m. Assets included Dollars 1.5bn representing goodwill, and Dollars 221m for the value of the Berlitz shares, ownership of about half of which was in dispute. The judge said the Berlitz share price had ranged between Dollars 12.5 and Dollars 20 in the last two years. He concluded that the likelihood of market fluctuations causing loss to the banks was a great deal higher than any risk of a loss of profit to Macmillan.</p>

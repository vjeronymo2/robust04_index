			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Text of John Major's speech In his statement to the Commons, Mr Major said: 'The Corfu Council has highlighted an issue of increasing concern to many EU members - the way in which decisions are reached. 'It is an important point of principle that the key decisions require unanimity and that all member states should have an equal opportunity to participate in collective decision-making. 'The procedures used for this decision, before and during the council, were not satisfactory. 'There was no need for this matter to have come to an open division at a European council. It should have been avoided. Had more comprehensive consultation taken place, as in the past, and had the views expressed by different states been heeded, it could have been avoided. 'I believe that there are a number of well-qualified people who could take on this post, on the basis of a genuinely common accord. We stand ready to play our part in consultations on it. 'There is no reason why this should not lead to an early and satisfactory outcome. 'I want Europe to succeed. I want it to regain the affections of the people of Europe. I want a Europe with which all member states - soon to be 16, then 20 - can feel comfortable. Achieving that may mean disputes along the way.'</p>

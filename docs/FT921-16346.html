			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / International Company News: Leaner, fitter Greyhound finds its running form - A look at what months of protection from creditors has helped the US bus company achieve Mr Mike Doyle, finance director of Greyhound Lines, has just zoomed into work on a new motorcycle. Intrigued, staff at the US bus company spill out of their corporate headquarters to admire. Two things are worth noting. First, there aren't very many of them. Secondly, the building from which they appear - one of the soulless edifices flanking a freeway north of Dallas - seems to belong to a bank. In fact, Greyhound's spartan offices, only occupied in November, are subleased at the back. But this leaner look is all part of a new image. After a violent drivers' strike tipped Greyhound into bankruptcy 18 months ago, America's best-known bus operator has been struggling to drive its outmoded operations into the 1990s. A financial reorganisation was agreed with creditors last autumn, and bankruptcy status shed. Almost unmarked by US commentators, Greyhound shares also started trading on the American Stock Exchange in November. Now comes the hardest part - cranking out the profits. Ever since the US airline industry was deregulated in 1978, competitive pressure on bus operators has been intense. Deregulation gave birth to a crop of new, low-cost airlines, and sent domestic fares spiralling downwards. Since then, many of these carriers have either failed or merged, but a lingering glut of cash-strapped airlines means that fare-discounting is still rife. The damage to Greyhound has been immense. Imagine, for example, that you want to journey between Tuscon and Phoenix, Arizona's two main cities. A one-way flight would cost you less than Dollars 60 and get you there in 45 minutes. With a little advance planning you might obtain a Greyhound fare for Dollars 15.75, but you would spend two hours bumping down a freeway. Small wonder that most Greyhound customers have an annual income of Dollars 25,000 or less, and the average ticket sale is Dollars 35. Greyhound's financial position has not helped it to compete, either. The bus operation was born over 75 years ago when an enterprising Swedish immigrant started transporting miners in Minnesota. By the mid-1980s, however, it was simply one part of a much larger conglomerate. In 1987, a Dollars 350m leveraged buyout took place - led by Mr Fred Currey, former chief executive of the rival Trailways bus line - and Greyhound became a private company. Mr Currey took some much-needed steps. He acquired Trailways, renovated some of Greyhound's oldest terminals, installed a computer system to improve ticketing and internal information, and boosted advertising. 'We didn't used to know about ticket sales for 45 days,' recalls one employee, spelling out how backward the systems were. But the Dollars 375m lump of LBO debt hung around Greyhound's neck. Between 1987 and 1990, the company was never more than marginally profitable, although its 'regular route' revenues increased significantly to almost Dollars 720m. Meanwhile, labour tensions were rising. Mr Currey secured big wage concessions at the time of the buyout. But in early 1990, attempts to negotiate a new contract with the Amalgamated Transit Union - representing about 8,500 drivers, clerks and mechanics - proved fruitless. The bloody strike followed, and bankruptcy was only a few months behind. So what has months of protection from creditors, and the subsequent reorganisation plan, achieved? Even today, Greyhound does not start with a clean financial sheet. Under the complex reorganisation scheme, many creditors swapped their claims for equity in the ongoing company - currently valued at Dollars 80m - plus a Dollars 165m tranche of senior notes. Coupled with bank debt (and excluding operating leases), this means the company still has over Dollars 300m of long-term borrowings. But the strike did accelerate the operational streamlining. Peripheral businesses, like the charter operations and bus manufacturing, have been wound down or sold, while a 'package express' delivery service - which never recouped the 'small business' element that quickly defected when services were interrupted - is a shadow of its former self. More significantly, core operations are also being reorganised. Although badly hit in the early days of the strike, Greyhound quickly recruited non-union drivers and claimed to be running almost 90 per cent of its pre-strike service within months. A rescheduling of operations, however, coupled with more flexible working arrangements, means that this network is now being serviced with around 3,700 drivers, compared with 6,300 pre-strike. The number of buses and maintenance facilities has also been sharply pruned. This process is not at an end. Greyhound says that its aim is to instigate something akin to an airline 'hub' structure, where buses would feed in and out of regional centres, rather than the traditional point-to-point service. Further improvements in its computer systems could help short-notice pricing decisions. It is, however, a delicate process: Greyhound is acutely aware of criticism suggesting that some small communities may be left without a transport service. Whether this adds to a rebirth remains debatable. In its reorganisation plan, Greyhound projected net profits rising from Dollars 37.4m in 1992, to Dollars 46.9m in 1998, with total revenues increasing by about 15 per cent over the same period. But capital expenditure is still tight, running at little more than Dollars 30m a year at present. Almost half this figure is going on bus renovations; for Dollars 25,000 a bus can be completely overhauled while a new vehicle costs Dollars 225,000. But such refurbishments, repeatable twice or three times, only last three to five years. The average age of a Greyhound bus is already nine years, and replacements will be necessary at some stage. The labour problem is not quite buried, either. Although the bankruptcy court approved the reorganisation plan, a legal appeal by the ATU is still outstanding. There is also a back-pay claim running to tens of millions of dollars, although estimated by the bankruptcy court at a maximum Dollars 31.25m. This is based on union claims that Greyhound bargained in bad faith. Not surprisingly, the bus company says not - but its lawyers estimate that five years could elapse before a final legal determination is made. All this, moreover, is no longer in the hands of Mr Currey. He departed with a Dollars 1m cash payoff plus Dollars 600,000 for non-competition provisions, and has been replaced by Mr Frank Schmieder, previously chief operating officer. In all honesty, it would be hard to tag Greyhound as the growth stock of 1992. But its shares have bumped along at the Dollars 8 level - a respectable edge on the Dollars 4 to Dollars 7.50 valuation suggested by Goldman Sachs, its adviser, last summer. While the famous Greyhound may not be sprinting home, it is at least up and running.</p>

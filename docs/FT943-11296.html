			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Motoring: A hot hatch Why have a family hatchback that looks exactly what it is when you could have one, still with five doors and four seats, that could be taken for Pounds 30,000-worth of high performance coupe? That is the rationale behind Mazda's new 323 which goes on sale in Britain on August 17, priced from Pounds 11,995 upwards. The launch of the 323 is another sign of Mazda's determination to become the chief niche marketeer in the world. It knows it will never be a VW or Ford, Toyota or Fiat in production volume so it is aiming to fill gaps. Britain is the first European country to get the new 323. For the time being, there are just three models - a 1.5-litre four-cylinder in GL and GLX trim and a 2-litre V6 GLX. Three-door hatchback and four-door saloon versions will follow later in the year when a 1.8-litre engine will also become available. There was a lot of design input into the new 323 from Mazda's research and development facility in Frankfurt, as there had been earlier with the Xedos 6 and 9 models. The result is that the 323 feels a thoroughly European car with all the finesse one expects of a Japanese product. Mazda says its objective for the 323 was to combine sportiness with refinement, individuality with concern for safety and environmental protection. Don't they all say that nowadays? Of course they do. But, having sampled 323 fastbacks with both engines, I can confirm their sporty handling and mechanical refinement. As for their looks, I reckon nothing touches them in their class. I first drove the 1.5-litre GLX (Pounds 12,595). The engine, although smaller than the old 323's 88 horsepower 1.6-litre, is slightly more muscular, producing a silky 90 horsepower at 5,500rpm. Torque (pulling power at a given engine speed) is unchanged. The 1.5 GLX rode comfortably and demanded little gear changing in urban areas, handled nimbly on country roads and cruised quietly on the motorway. Delicate controls, effortless power-assisted steering and minimal road-induced tyre noise made it a most relaxing car to travel in. The driving position was comfortable although tall people of mature years may find both front and back seats on the low side for easy entry and, especially, egress. I rated the performance and acceleration more than adequate. Mazda claims a 108mph/ 174kph maximum speed and 0-60mph (0-96kph) acceleration in 11.9 seconds. Fuel consumption should be up to 36mpg (7.85 l/100km) in normal use. The 323 V6 I tried next was a hotter property altogether, with 147 horsepower at 6000rpm and wide 50 series tyres on 16in alloy wheels. It is much more expensive (Pounds 17,495), which puts it into VW Golf V6 territory. Top speed is a claimed 129mph (207kph), with 0-60mph (0-96kph) acceleration in 9.4 seconds. Only uncharacteristically light-footed owners should expect to see more than 31mpg (9.1 l/100km). Naturally, it felt far more eager than the 1.5-litre 323 but - as usual - I preferred the smaller engined car, which has taller and more resilient 70 series tyres on 13in wheels. Squat and sporty tyres increase cornering power and make for nervously responsive steering but they exact a comfort penalty. Although it was fine on a smooth motorway, the V6's ride was much more knobbly at low speeds and there was a lot of tyre roar on coarsely textured surfaces. All 323s have power-operated front windows, mirrors and radio aerial, a pollen filter and seatbelt pre-tensioners. Driver's and front passenger's airbags are standard on the 1.5i GLX and 2.0i V6 but not on the 1.5i GL. A five-speed manual gearbox is standard on all 323s. Mazda says the boot has class-leading volume but it looked too narrow to pass my 'two sets of golf clubs in their trolleys' test and has an exceptionally deep rear sill. Neither of which, I suspect, will do anything to harm sales of this most glamorous looking hatchback.</p>

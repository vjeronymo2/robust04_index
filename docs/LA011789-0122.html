			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: CITY GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS AND RUNS INTO MURPHY'S LAW  </P> <P> In its first week as a city, Dana Point played the smiling host to a series of  inaugural bashes that included rousing speeches and a champagne reception at a  fancy hotel ballroom.  </P> <P> In its second week, Dana Point came crashing back to earth.  </P> <P> Jan. 9, at the city's first regular council meeting, almost anything that could  have gone wrong did.  </P> <P> First, City Manager William O. Talley called in sick with the flu and City  Atty. Jerry M. Patterson was forced to take his place, fumbling along through  unfamiliar territory during the meeting.  </P> <P> Then, Mayor Judy Curreri looked up with a certain degree of alarm to see that  some members of an audience of more than 100 local residents were being forced  to stand outside in a cold hallway. It seems that the meeting room of the  Capistrano Bay Park and Recreation District where the city is holding its  council meetings was not large enough to accommodate them all.  </P> <P> Curreri conscientiously asked some of the shivering residents to step inside  and line up along one wall where there was still standing room, but only three  people responded.  </P> <P> That might have been because the others couldn't hear the mayor's offer over  the din of a lively basketball game going on next door.  </P> <P> The city is meeting in the park district's community center until a new office  building in which the city will have space is ready for occupancy in about 6  months. The city will have its own civic center eventually, but that project is  at least 2 years down the road, Talley has said..  </P> <P> Throughout the 2 1/2-hour council meeting, residents at the back of the meeting  room found themselves straining to hear what council members, city staffers and  a parade of speakers were saying.  </P> <P> At one point, when a resident's voice could not be heard over a podium  microphone, Curreri asked whether the microphone was working. A city staff  member sheepishly replied that the microphone was to record the speakers, not  amplify their voices.  </P> <P> City Council members also found that there is more to running a city than  sitting back and allowing praise to be heaped upon them, as was the case during  the inaugural festivities.  </P> <P> The meeting began on an uplifting note, however, when resident Dennis Block  took the podium to say: "I'd like to tell all the wonderful people of Dana  Point that I salute you."  </P> <P> But that was one of the last noncontroversial comments to come from the  speakers. John Bates officially became Dana Point's first purveyor of bad news  when he stepped up to the podium early in the meeting to complain about the  high accident rate on Selva Road.  </P> <P> "I'd like to see the council investigating that situation," Bates said, as  council members Bill Bamattre, Curreri, Mike Eggers, Eileen Krause and Ingrid  McGauire listened intently, some scribbling notes to themselves.  </P> <P> A few moments later, the council got it with both barrels. Lawyers involved in  a complex legal battle over rent hikes at a Dana Point mobile home park stepped  to the podium to unleash a barrage of legalisms. The council sat numbly as  lawyers for both sides presented their arguments in courtroom fashion.  </P> <P> The council was not asked to take any action on that dispute other than to  "work with these people in no specific direction," according to Gerald Gibbs,  attorney for the mostly elderly residents of the mobile home park.  </P> <P> As Curreri said to those present at one point during the meeting: "We're  learning and you're learning, as we're all new to this."  </P></p>

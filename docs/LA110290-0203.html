			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SPUR-OF-MOMENT DECISION BOUGHT HIM $30.6 MILLION  </P> <P> Jerrell Wardlaw, who sometimes picked up extra cash working part-time at his  neighborhood 7-Eleven, walked into the store this week and made a purchase  worth $30.6 million.  </P> <P> Thursday night, the Lotto ticket held by the Livermore man was verified as the  only one with all six of the numbers drawn Wednesday night.  </P> <P> The jackpot, which he'll collect in 20 yearly after-tax payments of $1.2  million, is the biggest won by an individual in the California lottery game.  </P> <P> Wardlaw, married with four children, said his spending plans include buying a  motor home for a cross-country trip, making sure his children get good  educations and building a new home in Livermore.  </P> <P> After buying a pack of cigarettes Monday at the 4th Street 7-Eleven, Wardlaw  had only a dollar left in his pocket, according to store owner Jud McDonnell.  </P> <P> "Eh, give me a (Lotto) quick pick," Wardlaw said.  </P> <P> Thursday morning, Wardlaw went to his job at an engine company in Santa Clara  -- he was late because his truck broke down -- without knowing he held the  winning ticket. A co-worker had heard that the winning ticket was sold in  Livermore and jokingly asked if it was Wardlaw's.  </P> <P> "He said, 'Yeah, sure.' And then Jerry looked at his ticket and sure enough it  was him," McDonnell related.  </P> <P> The jackpot winner returned at once to Livermore and the 7-Eleven. McDonnell  rented a 30-foot limousine that took the Wardlaws to Sacramento.  </P></p>

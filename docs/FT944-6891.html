			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / International Press Review: Zedillo in the margins - Mexico At first glance, it was hard to tell from the Mexican press that the country is to install a new president in a few days. Articles about Mr Ernesto Zedillo's inauguration on December 1 were swamped by extensive coverage of Mexico's latest political scandal. This involves accusations - fiercely denied - that senior officials and members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party conspired to block the investigation of the September assassination of Mr Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the PRI's own secretary general. However, Mr Zedillo was a constant figure in the margins of the scandal coverage, with the press noting that problems within the ruling party were affecting his delicate task of forming a cabinet and promoting political reform. The crisis was unleashed by Mr Ruiz's younger brother Mario, who last week levelled his accusations and resigned as deputy attorney general, chief investigator into his brother's murder, and PRI militant. Papers accustomed to touting PRI orthodoxy took to attacking Mario for disrupting an already complicated transition. The financially troubled Excelsior alleged that the 'aggrieved brother' had been put up to the whole affair by another renegade PRI member and media star, Mr Manuel Camacho, and that the scandal 'was a prelude to the formation of an opposition political party' led by Mr Camacho and Mr Ruiz. Paid advertisements in several other papers made the same claims. El Financiero, the country's main business daily, took a different approach, theorising that outgoing President Carlos Salinas had orchestrated the entire Ruiz-PRI conflict to lay the groundwork for Mr Zedillo to 'take charge' by exorcising the hardline 'dinosaurs' from the ruling party. One columnist even said the conflict had opened the way for Mr Zedillo 'also to resign from the PRI, to show he is serious about reform'. Reforma, known for its independence and sensationalism, flatly declared that the accused PRI hierarchy had been so politically damaged by the back-biting that they were going to be left out of the Zedillo administration. One cartoonist at the leftist La Jornada took a more cynical view, drawing a picture of the PRI hierarchy completely soaked in mud, but saying: 'We just have to clean ourselves up a little bit for the cabinet photo.' The pink financial paper, El Economista, seemed not to care about the who, what or why of the affair, saying only: 'The political crisis slows the flow of foreign capital.' Over the weekend, the only public statement from the president-elect himself was his offer to respect the freedom of the press. Reporters who camped outside his office in hopes of eliciting a comment about the Ruiz-PRI conflict were snubbed, possibly in retaliation for all but ignoring Mr Zedillo's trip to Washington last week to see President Bill Clinton. Instead, they were told Mr Zedillo was trying to fine-tune his inauguration speech. Judging by other hot stories filling the papers, the new president will have a lot of issues to talk about in his Thursday address. Conflict is beginning to simmer again in the southern state of Chiapas, scene of an armed rebellion this year, according to the government-owned news agency Notimex. In addition thousands of opposition protesters from the southeastern state of Tabasco will soon arrive in Mexico City to denounce alleged electoral fraud in a recent gubernatorial election, noted La Jornada and El Financiero. And many papers reported, based on official sources, that the confessed killer of the PRI's first presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio had been secretly interrogated and possibly tortured just hours after the assassination and raised the idea that the murder was the work of drug traffickers. With all these problems, veteran columnist Rene Delgado noted that Mr Salinas was the fifth president in a row to leave office amid political crisis. 'Zedillo's challenge is enormous. In a few days he will have to face it,' wrote Mr Delgado in Reforma. 'We hope this time the story will be different.'</p>

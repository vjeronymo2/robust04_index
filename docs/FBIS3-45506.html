			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, a top  Chinese leader, said the establishment of a socialist market  economic structure requires "standardization and perfect legal  guarantee."    In an interview carried in the latest issue of the  fortnightly magazine, CHINA'S TALENTS, Qiao, chairman of the  Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), said  that China has to explore ways to shift from a planned economy  to a market economy and to introduce a corresponding legal  system.    Since 1979 the NPC and its Standing Committee have adopted  promulgated 200 laws and regulations, he said, adding that a  number of important laws will be enacted in the near future.    The enforcement of these laws have guided, standardized and  guaranteed the creation of a market economy, he noted.    Qiao, who is also a Standing Committee member of the  Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central  Committee, stressed that the NPC and its Standing Committee must  act promptly to formulate laws to standardize market behavior,  protect the order of a market economy, and improve  macro-economic control and social guarantee.    "The enactment of laws in these areas is essential to the  establishment and perfection of a socialist market economy," the  leader said.    Qiao also stressed the importance of using laws to guide,  promote and guarantee the smooth progress of the reforms, and to  provide a legal basis for the growth of a market economy.    Meanwhile, laws, decrees and regulations short of the need  of  the market economy must be either revised or abolished in time,  he said.    He said that in formulating laws concerning the market  economy, it was imperative to follow the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, and act in the spirit of  the party's 14th National Congress and in accordance with  China's Constitution.    While formulating such laws, he said, "we must proceed from  the reality in China, and make an extensive study and draw on  the experience of the rest of the world."    All new laws must be made to facilitate the expansion of  China's economy, and stability and unity throughout the country,  he stressed.    "Since a market economy is an open one geared up with the  global market, Chinese laws governing the market economy must be  compatible with relevant laws in other countries and  internationally accepted practices," he pointed out.    That approach will not only quicken the pace of China's  economic legislation, but also enable China to adapt to the  world economy and to participate in global economic competition,  he added.    Qiao Shi also noted that only by taking educational,  administrative, legal and other measures can successes be scored  in the anti-corruption campaign.    Over the past few years, the NPC and its Standing Committee  have enacted a series of new laws to crack down on embezzlement,  bribery, smuggling, prostitution, and drug trafficking and  abuse, he said.    The leader also stressed the importance of formulating and  perfecting laws regarding the building of a clean government by  studying characteristics and circumstances in combating  corruption under a socialist market economy.    In conclusion, he expressed the belief that the  establishment  of a legal system governing the market economy will certainly  help prevent corruption most effectively.</p>

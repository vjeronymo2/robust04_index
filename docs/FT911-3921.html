			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (18): Software takes the driving seat - Mid-Range Systems, hardware architectures under review THE undeniable driving force in much of the mid-range systems market is systems software, and in particular Unix and the broader issues of open systems. These, in turn, are changing some of the rules that govern mid-range hardware architectures. Unix is insinuating its way into a position of dominance in the mid-range market, and the leading manufacturers are all reacting to it. Some, such as Digital Equipment (DEC), have arguably come to it somewhat later than others, while IBM is at last showing some signs that is taking the subject seriously. The operating system is starting to have an impact on the way mid-range systems are designed and built. Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) chip sets are increasingly the order of the day, for example, and those systems manufacturers that do not have their own designs are signing supply and technology licensing agreements with those that do. DEC is committed to the RISC chips produced by MIPS Computer, so much so that it holds a minority stake in the company. The MIPS-based DEC Station systems are still largely at the low-end of the company's product range, but MIPS has a new, more powerful 64-bit processor on the drawing board, which is likely to form the basis of any successor to DEC's successful VAX minicomputer architecture. These chips lie at the heart of the new consortium of leading hardware and software companies, known both as the 'Gibraltar Group' and the Advanced Computing Environment (ACE) group, which is aiming to build a new industry standard for both the lower reaches of mid-range systems and workstations. Most estimates suggest that the first new machines built to this standard will not appear for three years. Evidence to bear this out comes indirectly from DEC, which is pressurising its existing VAX users into updating their applications code to take advantage of future RISC systems within three years, otherwise they will be effectively locked out of future open systems developments. The company plans to shift to RISC-based systems and away from the VAX architecture in the long term. Prime targets for the ACE group are Sun Microsystems, which claims to own about 60 per cent of the workstation and low-end mid-range market place, and a newly reinvigorated IBM, which has scored some significant recent successes with its own RISC-based machines, the RS/6000 range. Sun Microsystems is fast becoming an important player in the mid-range market, not only for its own systems but also for its SPARC RISC-chip set, which is being aggressively marketed to other systems vendors. Several names in the mid-range market, with UK's ICL leading the way, have signed up to use the SPARC chip set and have established their own systems in the market place. The chip set offers systems builders a scalable platform, allowing them to develop machines that range from 12 mips (million instructions per second) workstations to 100 mips superminicomputers, all running the same operating system and applications software. Stretching from the desktop workstation through to large corporate server systems, the IBM RS/6000 has ruffled some feathers among established Unix mid-range suppliers by winning an order for 2,500 systems from Barclays Bank. This cuts across the standard industry perception that IBM only pays lip-service to Unix, and even then takes an alternative stance by having its own version of the system, a extensively re-engineered superset of the Unix standard called AIX. From the company's early efforts in the RISC-based workstation and mid-range markets with the 6150, which were generally considered to be down on performance and up on price in comparison with the competition, the completely re-worked RS/6000 series looks like making a success of itself. This, in turn, may prompt IBM to take an even more positive stance about it, rather than always managing to give the impression that it is something of an afterthought to other, more strategic product families. In this context, the company's main mid-range offering is the AS/400 family. Though by most other manufacturer's standards it would be considered a large success, sales of these machines have generally been considered as somewhat disappointing. It has largely been seen as the replacement for the company's old System 3/X line of minicomputers which have a good, if stolid reputation in the traditional small and medium-sized business market. System 3X replacement sales have been good for the AS/400, but its penetration into new markets, especially those dominated by DEC with its VAX systems, has not been excessive. The machine has been plagued recently with technical problems, particularly in the area of disk storage. It has been found that disk drives for the machine are suffering from excessive vibration which causes disk crashes and consequent failure of the system. What has made this worse is the fact that the system software is spread across all drives used on an AS/400, which means they all must work for the system to work. AS/400 users are subject to the changing pricing policies that can come with such proprietary systems. Recent changes in IBM's software pricing for this machine have left users that upgrade their existing systems facing a 50 per cent jump in software costs for enhanced code that had previously been free. One growing trend in the mid-range market is towards multiprocessor systems built around common devices such as the Intel i486 processor. One of the leading contenders, Sequent, has systems available using as many as 18 of these devices, offering a capability of servicing up to 500 users. NCR has recently announced systems using a similar architecture which, like the Sequent system, runs Unix. Once again, the basis of the trend is towards scale in both the hardware architecture and the applications software to give mid-range users maximum flexibility. Such systems go some way towards meeting the growing need for fault tolerance by the simple expedient of using a lot of processors. This is only a partial solution, however, and rarely satisfies those users with business-critical applications that demand the maximum in reliability. That market place remains the domain of two main contenders, Stratus Computers and, the market leader, Tandem. The latter's Integrity S2 machines use multiple processors, but instead of tasks being shared out among a number of small units, these use large processors to run the applications together, monitoring each other's output and voting between them to discover and isolate faults.</p>

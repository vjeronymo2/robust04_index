			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says Israel has  suggested that Syria upgrade its negotiating team by sending its  foreign minister, rather that what he termed the Foreign  Ministry pensioner.    In reply to a question on whether secret contacts were being  held with Syria, the prime minister said that some things should  be probed secretly before the sides make public commitments.  This was how things had been done in the negotiations with  Egypt, as well as in those with the PLO.    Responding to a question on whether 'Arafat had requested  that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] activity in the territories  be curtailed, Yitzhaq Rabin said various requests had been  submitted, but nothing has been promised. He maintained that  the problem lay in people's focusing on gestures, rather than  the agreement itself.    Our correspondent Qaysar Qabaha reports that the prime  minister made these remarks in an interview with Nazareth's  AL-SINARAH weekly.</p>

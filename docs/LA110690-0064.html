			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> SUTTON NEEDS SURGERY, OUT A MONTH  </P> <P> Ram cornerback Mickey Sutton, scheduled to undergo arthroscopic surgery on his  left knee today, is expected to be sidelined for at least a month.  </P> <P> Complicating the picture in the secondary, the status of injured cornerback  Jerry Gray remains a question.  </P> <P> "We're not looking for any miracles right now," Coach John Robinson said of  Gray, who did not play Sunday because of a sore left knee. "You keep hoping  that all of a sudden the Pro Bowl cornerback would come back. But that just  hasn't happened. Until he can come back in good fashion, we just can't press  him. We will just have to take that day by day."  </P> <P> The Rams hope to shore up their secondary losses with Darryl Henley, who on  Sunday made a successful comeback from a hip injury. Also, Clifford Hicks, who  has been the physically unable to perform list all season with a knee injury,  might be available.  </P> <P> Robinson continued to be vague about when he plans to activate running back  Marcus Dupree from the injured-reserve list. "At some point," Robinson said.  With Sutton out, there will be an open roster spot for Dupree this week, if  Robinson chooses to use it that way. TIM KAWAKAMI  </P></p>

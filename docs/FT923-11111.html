			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: Optimistic forecast after Nestle sales rise 13.4% NESTLE, the Swiss multinational food group which has just won permission from the European Commission to take over France's Perrier mineral water company, has reported a 13.4 per cent rise in salesin the first half to SFr26.3bn (Dollars 19.8bn) and forecast a 'healthy net profit' for the full year. The group said sales volume grew 3.3 per cent, with the remainder of the turnover growth coming from price increases and currency conversions. Volume increased in virtually all product groups and geographical areas, especially in Asia and north America, but it fell in Brazil. The group said it expected volume to grow 'perhaps even at a faster rate' in the second half, and foresaw increases in consolidated sales and net profit, provided that European currencies maintain their exchange rates with respect to the Swiss franc and the US dollar does not suffer 'an even more marked plunge'.</p>

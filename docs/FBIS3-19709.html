The actual building of these  highways is expected to take about twenty years. Industry  Minister Gerard Longuet is expected to have an announcement on  the subject at the next Council of Ministers.    On 22 February, at the conclusion of an interministerial  committee meeting on advance preparations for the vast  information highway project, the prime minister formally  launched implementation of an industrial project that will take  15 to 20 years to complete. It will be one of the most ambitious  undertakings of the decade to come, as its realization will  require great perseverance on the part of all the governments  that will be called on to support it beyond the year 2000.    Edouard Balladur took the first step by naming Gerard Thery,  former director general of telecommunications (today France  Telecom), to head a study mission. Thery's mission is to  propose, by the end of April 1994, a timetable along with a  juridical, financial, and technical framework covering  everything involved in the building of information highways.    The task first of all involves studying, forecasting, and  organizing the harmonization of telecommunications and  audiovisual media, and conducting experiments on images  broadcast on France Telecom's telephone network and distribution  of telephone communications on cable networks. The experiments  to be conducted will oblige cable operators, at least initially  and for as long as the monopoly lasts, to connect up with the  France Telecom network.  <H5>  Several Necessities </H5>   The launching of such a project responds to a variety of  necessities:    First, international economic necessities. Since Bill  Clinton  came into office, the United States has embarked on a vast  regulatory reform that has stimulated and focused the country's  industrial apparatus as a whole. Telephone companies, cable  operators, and computer companies are merging and investing  massively to prepare for the information superhighways that will  pave the way for an interactive, multimedia world. The advance  the United States has in this domain compels all developed  countries to take action, to avoid being left behind.    Second, European necessities. Following up on the report of  the Commission of the European Communities, which in 1992 noted  the inadequacy of new telephone service offerings and  disparities in rates throughout Europe, the Council of Ministers  of the European Union decreed a plan to liberalize the telephone  sector starting 1 January 1998. As of that date, and despite the  presence of monopolies in the telecommunications sector, private  operators will be able to lease capacities on publicly owned  infrastructure and use them or market them as they best see fit.  Liberalization is expected to be complete before the year 2000.    In its recent white paper on growth, the Brussels Commission  also confirmed the great potential of multimedia markets  expected to see strong growth between now and the year 2000--10  percent per year for audiovisual and 8 percent per year for  telephone services. At that rate of growth, they would boost  Europe's GDP by 10 percent by the end of the century.    Third, national necessities. The theme of information  highways may even play an important political role. The closer  the country gets to the next presidential election, the more  useful it will be for the current prime minister to have at his  disposal, instead of a respectable but uninspiring record of  accomplishment, a far-reaching politico-industrial project  capable of reducing unemployment and galvanizing public support.  Such an ambitious endeavor will also have the advantage of  satisfying the big industrial groups athirst for public-sector  contracts. Finally, development of electronic highways will  force the government to rethink the audiovisual system in its  entirety. The growth and development--separate, for the  moment--of cable and pay television, and France Telecom's  defensive strategy in this sector are questions the executive  branch sooner or later will have to address.    Mr. Balladur's government does not seem at all reluctant to  put strong pressure on France Telecom, whose monopoly on  international telephone traffic originating in France is already  threatened by private operators and whose lock on domestic  traffic is being challenged by mobile telephone operators  already allowed to use cable network infrastructure to route  personal communications. Finally, observers are concerned to see  Deutsche Telekom forging multimedia alliances with Astra and  Bertelsmann. The regulatory and financial recommendations that  Gerard Thery makes in his report this May will probably be of  critical importance for all operators in the sector.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar unmoved by repo cut THE D-MARK remained comparatively strong against the dollar and European currencies yesterday in spite of a larger than expected cut in one of the Bundesbank's key interest rates, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank surprised many dealers by reducing its repo rate - the rate at which it lends short-term money to commercial banks - from 8.09 per cent to 7.75 per cent. Market expectations had been for a cut to about 7.90 per cent. The size of the easing underlined recent comments from Bundesbank officials that inflation is no longer as big a problem as had been perceived, and that the central bank is trying to test how far it can ease monetary policy. Mr Gerald Holtham, chief economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said the cut in the repo rate had brought the cost of money market funds in line with the new discount rate level. He believes there will be speculation of another easing in the Bundesbank's rate floor before its next council meeting in a week's time. However, the repo rate cut failed to give the dollar much relief after its recent fall against the D-Mark. After closing at DM1.5847 at the end of trading in New York on Tuesday, the US currency peaked at DM1.5930 in Europe. But it later fell back to end at DM1.5860. In New York yesterday it finished at DM1.5799. The dollar's performance seems rather lame, considering that it has been supported in the last two days by a generous cut in German rates and by Federal Reserve intervention to support the US currency against the yen. The dollar closed stronger against the yen in London at Y112.5, up from Y111.2, and in New York ended at Y112.1. But there are signs the currency remains hampered by uncertainty over US growth prospects and the direction of President Clinton's administration. Mr Mark Austin, an economist at Midland Global Markets in London, believes that a worse than expected figure for first-quarter GDP in the US today might also provide a setback for the dollar. Most European currencies were stronger against the D-Mark in the European morning but later fell back. Sterling again broke the DM2.50 level, but subsequently declined to close unchanged at DM2.4925. At least one dealer said the Bank of England was in the market, selling the pound in order to replenish its foreign reserves. The French franc was firmer amid speculation that the Bundesbank cut had made an easing in French official rates more likely. The franc ended fractionally up at FFr3.374 to the D-Mark. The one currency to strengthen markedly in the last two days has been the Spanish peseta, helped by more Bank of Spain intervention. The peseta closed at Pta73.07 per D-Mark from a previous Pta73.68. It also moved up from bottom place in the exchange rate mechanism's grid to third from bottom.</p>

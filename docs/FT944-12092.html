			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / GCHQ plans cut of up to 500 jobs GCHQ, the government's secret communications centre at Cheltenham, yesterday announced it would shed 300 to 500 jobs over the next three years. The centre, which employs about 6,000 people, said it hoped to achieve most of the job losses through non-replacement and voluntary redundancies. Two hundred jobs have already gone over the past two years. GCHQ blamed the cuts on a 'tightening of the purse strings' throughout the Civil Service. It added: 'Money is tight and there are restrictions on public expenditure.' The ending of the Cold War was also to blame.

The federation replaced unions following the controversial ban on them by the government 10 years ago,</p>

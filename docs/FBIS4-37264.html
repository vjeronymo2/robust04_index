			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the </F> Presidential Council"; place and date not given]    [Text] Despite the appeals of the world to the rulers of  Sanaa to cease fire and to stop the shelling of vital economic  installations and residential quarters, the Sanaa regime  continued throughout today its shelling and barbarous acts and  (?initiated) attacks on all front at about 1730 this evening.  Our brave Armed Forces, as well as volunteers from the sons of  our steadfast people, are repulsing them. We announce to the  world our legitimate right to defend our territory and the honor  of our womenfolk since the Sanaa regime does not respect any  laws or values. Our Armed Forces, with God's will and  assistance and in cooperation with the sons of our people, will  repulse the attacks of the aggressors and will protect dauntless  Aden. These barbarous attacks will only increase the  steadfastness of the sons of our people in Aden and their  challenge of the aggressors.</p>

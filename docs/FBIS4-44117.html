			<p>BFN     [Text] Nuremberg (DDP/ADN) -- Theo Waigel, chairman of the  CSU [Christian Social Union], has again sharply attacked the  SED's [Socialist Unity Party] successor party, the PDS [Party of  Democratic Socialists]. Waigel told the regional conference of  the Bavarian Young Union [CSU's youth organization] here today  that the "criminal SED/PDS" ought to be "turfed out of the  parliaments."    "If we do not tolerate former Nazis or neo-Nazis in  politics,  then we should not tolerate any former communists or  neocommunists," the head of the CSU said. He is not, he said,  fighting against the Republicans' leader Franz Schoenhuber so  that "a Mr. Gysi [leader of PDS] can travel from talk show to  talk show."    Just as the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]/CSU ruled out  any cooperation with the far-right Republicans, so it should  distance itself from the PDS as well, Waigel said.</p>

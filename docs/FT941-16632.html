			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Why the FT is making changes . . . Saturday readers turning to today's share price listings will find a curious mixture of the strange and the familiar. The grey-on-pink columns look, at a glance, just as they always do - or, at least, as they have done since the typography was changed a year or so ago. All the securities listed are exactly the same as before, and many of the sectors into which they are divided are also identical. Some sectors have split or merged, however, some shares have moved sectors, and the names of several sectors have been altered subtly. Overall, it could take some time to adjust to the changes. To make the process easier, this issue also contains a two-page alphabetical listing of every security carried in the London Share Service, together with the name of the sector in which it now appears. The FT has organised share prices by industry for years. Investors like to be able to make a quick estimate of how a share is doing in comparison with its industry rivals; putting them alongside each other in manageable sectors allows the price/earnings ratio or day's price change of, say, Glaxo to be compared easily with that of SmithKline Beecham. None the less, arranging shares by sector does make it harder to look up a share for the first time. You must first make a guess at the heading under which it is likely to be found, then locate that on the page. In the worst cases, it could be necessary to scan several sectors before finding the right one. This problem can be lessened by using accurate and carefully drawn sectors. For this reason, the FT changed a year or so ago from its traditional sectors (memorable for the number of stocks described as Industrials, Miscellaneous) to the classification used for the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share index. That classification has now been through its first thorough overhaul in two decades to yield sectors that reflect more accurately the shape of today's market. Electricals and Electronics have been merged. Oil and Gas has been sub-divided, as has Health and Household. And each of the traditionally large grab-bag of Miscellaneous stocks has been given a proper home of its own. The normal daily table reporting the All-Share also changes, of course, to show the new sectors. In the two-page alphabetical listing, those stocks that are constituents of the All-Share after the normal end-year changes are marked with an asterisk. There is one other change to the London Share Service worth noting. Foreign stocks which are not part of the main classification - those categorised as Americans, Canadians, etc - have moved from the beginning of the pages to the end. The first sector listed is now Banks. We regret any inconvenience caused to readers by the change of sectors, and hope it will be short-lived as the new structure becomes familiar. Users of the FT's financial statistics have had to cope with a number of changes in recent years. Although we believe the service to readers is improved, we are conscious that disruption to long-established habits brings its own costs. After these changes, we hope for a period of greater stability. Fuller details of the changes to the All-Share classification appeared in Tuesday's and Wednesday's editions of the FT.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] President Suleyman Demirel has said that he has  been loyal to democracy, the supremacy of the laws and the  principles of a constitutional state since he assumed office on  16 May, 1993. He added that during his one-year term in office  he has also managed to put an end to the controversy regarding  the presidential seat. Demirel noted that Turkey will  definitely surmount the current difficulties within the  framework of democracy and freedom, pointing out that the  reconstruction of the country will continue. He added: No one  should cast aside daily problems to engage in discussions  concerning the regime. Demirel expressed his views on various  issues at a news conference he held at the Cankaya Mansion on  the first anniversary of his presidency. [passage omitted]    [Begin Demirel recording] Terror is one of Turkey's primary  problems. Turkey's second problem is the current situation  which started as a monetary crisis on 16 January and is  gradually showing a tendency to become an economic crisis.  There is the problem of inflation which we are trying to  reduce, but we have not been able to succeed despite all  efforts. On the one hand there is growing unemployment for  various reasons and on the other the need for infrastructure.  There is a need for reform. There is the problem of  insufficient resources for investments. There is the problem of  expanding the social security umbrella. There is the problem of  distribution income and the problem of equalizing the  development levels among various regions. There is also the  problem of making the state function better. There is the  problem of speeding up the judicial system. There is the  problem of consolidating the democratization process. Then  there is the problem of making the market economy function  better. Finally, there is the issue of waging a struggle  against irregularities and corruption. [end recording]    Demirel said that there are many pluses in the country  together with the problems and cited the functioning democratic  regime, the free parliamentary and judicial systems, the  government which has received a vote of confidence, and the  political parties as among the country's major assets. [passage  omitted]    [Begin Demirel recording] When we begin to discuss the  institutions instead of the issues, when we begin to discuss the  political system instead of the economic problems, when we again  begin to discuss the political system instead of the security  issues, we destroy our trust in that political system. We then  weaken the political system which is supposed to help us.  Whatever the discussion it should remain within the boundaries  of that particular issue.    Of course economizing is a most important issue. I would  like to state, however, that bringing the state to a standstill  for the sake of economizing is not a feasible measure. In other  words, we may cause psychological damage. If the trust in the  state is shaken then it would take much more than what has been  economized to repair the damage. The trust in the state should,  therefore, continue. The current situation in various parts of  the country can be understandable for a while but this period  should not continue for long. Investments have almost come to a  standstill. A project such as the Southeastern Anatolian  Project cannot come to a standstill. The same goes for similar  big projects. [end recording]    Demirel later replied to reporters' questions on various  issues. [passage omitted]    [Begin Demirel recording] The jump in the exchange rate of  the U.S. dollar from 16,000 Turkish Lira [TL] to over TL20,000  on 16 January 1994 cannot be explained away with what happened  in the years 1993, 1992, and 1991. The Turkish currency is  convertible. It has to be linked to something. There must be an  explanation. There is a free market economy in Turkey. There is  a free and fluctuating currency exchange rate within this  system. There is a banking institution. We are experiencing  inflation which is affecting the exchange rates, which in turn  affect the interest rates. If one fails to regulate the  association among the rate of inflation, the exchange rate, and  the interest rates, then certain difficulties might arise. Now  you ask if this is the reason? Yes it is. [end recording]    Demirel recalled that Turkey's budget deficit has been an  issue for each government and said: If those who prepared the  1994 budget thought that it could be prepared without first  estimating the budget deficit and that their economic measure  would be to assess the deficit within three to five months, then  they should have done so within that time. Demirel further  pointed out the burden of the interest rate was present in both  the 1992 and 1993 budgets.    [Begin Demirel recording] If, after seven months -- that is,  today -- or after eight, nine, 10, or 11 months, a government  says that current difficulties are the result of the situation  two or three years ago, this raises questions. If you claim  that today's situation results from the fact that the necessary  measures were not taken three years ago, then you should have  done what is necessary the day after you established the  government. Of course, that is only if these are the real  reasons. I think this argument is meaningless. I have to  clearly state that the government [word indistinct] [end  recording]    Demirel said he has no arguments with anybody, is not  responding to anybody, but is acting only in self-defense.    Demirel stated that during their meetings with him, the  political party leaders had communicated their distrust of the  existing political and bureaucratic cadres and that he, in turn,  had communicated these views to the prime minister and to the  deputy prime minister.    [Begin Demirel recording] Let us assume that the opposition,  by virtue of being in the opposition, can only condemn the  present government -- that is, oppose whatever government is in  power. Yes, but it has a voice. What am I to do with this  voice? Now I want to make my point: Government issues are not  Cankaya's concern. Anybody who wants to establish a government  or has complaints about the present government should address  the Assembly. Let everybody know his place, speak correctly,  and not try to implicate me in all kinds of things. [end  recording]    In answer to a question on whether it had occurred to him  that today's situation would be better if he were leader or  prime minister, Demirel said that events propel him forward and  not backward. Stressing that the presidency is a very honorable  and important position, Demirel stated that he is happy with his  post and is exerting every effort necessary to be of better  service. Demirel said: If you believe that I left a void when I  took this office, then you assume that I am indispensable. I am  not indispensable.    Answering another question, which recalled the article in  the  Constitution that grants the Council of Ministers, headed by the  president, the power to declare a state of emergency during  difficult economic conditions and asked whether he would use  this power, Demirel said: There are no hardships in the country  despite the fact that a state of emergency has not been  declared. If a law must be adopted, the Turkish Grand National  Assembly adopts it. I do not think it necessary to declare a  state of emergency, Demirel said.    In answer to another question, Demirel said that he has no  disputes with the government or with its leader, but added that  he cannot be indifferent to criticism of his term as prime  minister. Demirel said: A charge was made. Whoever presents  this charge will receive this reaction from me. I have also  conveyed this to Mrs. Ciller. I presented an account of my  500-day term in office in a news conference, such as this, in  the presence of Mrs. Ciller. The account I submitted then was a  good account, Demirel said.    Demirel noted that it is everybody's right to ask what  economic measures were proposed and rejected during his term as  prime minister.    [Begin Demirel recording] I have communicated these measures  to the parties concerned on various occasions. I have told them  that they were also members of the 500-day cabinet they are  criticizing. I ask those who claim that they did not have the  necessary authority during those 500 days whether they  participated in that government unwillingly and also whether  they were not aware of the word resignation. [end recording]    Demirel noted that joint responsibility is essential for a  government.</p>

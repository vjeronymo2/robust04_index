			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDEMPTION RATE FOR RECYCLED CANS  </P> <P> I agree with your editorial ("Definitely Worth a Toast!" Sept. 4) that  consumers deserve "more than a fistful of pennies for their effort" in  returning soda bottles and empty beer cans, and that the state "should approve  the nickel reward." But I would suggest an additional piece of legislation  which immediately upon enactment would eliminate most bottles and cans from our  parks and roads. Simply stated, require a like number of empty containers to be  returned at each purchase of full containers.  </P> <P> Thirsty Californians who aren't attracted to returning empties for a redemption  fee -- no matter how big it gets -- will tote those bottles and cans to make a  new purchase to quench their thirst.  </P> <P> RON BARTH  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

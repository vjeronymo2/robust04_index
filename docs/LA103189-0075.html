			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SINGER EVOKES THE PAST WITH HAUNTING, FUNNY BALLADS;  </P> <P> FOLK MUSIC: THE ANCESTRAL MUSIC OF HOLLY TANNEN INCLUDES SONGS DEALING WITH  MAGIC, HALLOWEEN AND GETTING IN TOUCH WITH ANCESTORS.  </P> <P> It was a rather unusual Halloween celebration -- no costumes or  jack-o'-lanterns, no cobwebs hanging in the doorways. Only a woman strumming  her dulcimer and singing traditional ballads. She seemed more ethereal than  sinister.  </P> <P> But when she sang, the spirits of the past came alive. And, at times, it was  haunting.  </P> <P> Those who heard Holly Tannen sing at the Shade Tree on Friday night were  reminded that the Celtic tradition of Halloween is not just about  trick-or-treating but getting in touch with the spirits of ancestors -- a  ritual performed with stories and songs about magic and the supernatural.  </P> <P> "Halloween is a celebration for keeping our ancestors alive, both our genetic  and our spiritual ancestors," Tannen explained to the audience of about 40 (a  full house). The holiday derives, she said, from the old festival of Samhain  (pronounced sow-en), which is Gaelic for "the end of the summer," when cattle  were brought in from their summer pastures, the harvest was completed and the  spirits of the ancestors were invoked.  </P> <P> In fact, youngsters were impersonating the souls of their ancestors when they  went house to house for handouts, spawning the trick-or-treating practiced by  children today.  </P> <P> Songs at the Shade Tree included ones about a woman who must rescue her lover  from the evil "fairies" of the forest who had kidnaped him when he fell from  his horse ("Tam Lin"); a deceased lover who comes back from the grave to  complain when his beloved's constant tears disrupt his sleep ("The Unquiet  Grave"), and a woman, accused of being a witch and about to be burned at the  stake, who calls upon the spirits of air, water, fire and earth for protection.  </P> <P> Tannen's humorous songs included the tale of a man who, in an attempt to get in  touch with his spirituality, gives up his polyester pants for a silver fox  loincloth and a Navajo drum, and proclaims: "Once I was a husband but a cave  bear I am now." Another, by Mark Graham, lamented mankind's lack of respect for  the dinosaur ("All we say is 'their brains were small and they died.' ")  </P> <P> Tannen sang her Scottish, Irish, English and Appalachian songs in their  respective dialects, with her eyes closed, as if yielding to the voices of the  past, acting as a kind of ancestral medium, a channel through which these  spirits could communicate. At times, the audience was encouraged to sing along,  which added a campfire feel to the evening.  </P> <P> Tannen's own ancestry is Russian and Romanian-Jewish. She said, "We (the  Jewish) have tended to play the music of the countries we've gone to . . . like  Gypsies." But she emphasized that the songs really are universal. "The music is  passed down from generation to generation, so they are in a sense our  ancestors."  </P> <P> Tannen, who was born in New York, first began playing at 17 when she received  her first Appalachian mountain dulcimer from a boyfriend who made it for her  after seeing Jean Ritchie perform at a Berkeley folk festival. She drew early  inspiration from Greenwich Village, where she heard such performers as Carly  Simon, Joan Baez, and Peter, Paul and Mary.  </P> <P> She went to England in 1974, living and traveling in a mini-van for about five  years as she studied the country's traditional folk music. She recently took a  master's degree in folklore, concentrating on the songs and stories of the  "traveling people of Scotland." She lives in Mendocino, where she teaches  folklore and anthropology at the College of the Redwoods.  </P> <P> Tannen has recorded two albums, "Between the Worlds" and "Invocation," which  includes a note on the back of the jacket: "For best results, this album should  be listened to by candlelight."  </P></p>

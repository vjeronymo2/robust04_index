			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Property advisers' skills criticised PROPERTY advisers lack proper management skills and financial expertise, according to a report by the College of Estate Management, an independent training and research establishment. The report, based on 23 interviews with representatives from all sides of the property industry, identifies weaknesses among property advisers, including poor analytical skills; a reluctance to be innovative and independent; and a tendency to be superficial. Advisers' strengths are centred on contacts, local knowledge and depth of resources. The report says that the failure of chartered surveyors to understand their clients' overall business needs has led to the entry of other professions such as accountants and management consultants into the marketplace. Quantity surveyors, architects and building surveyors are declining in importance because of changing practices in the building industry, the report says. For instance, the growing importance of comprehensive 'design and build' contracts has weakened demand for architects' traditional management and co-ordination roles, although their design skills continue to be in demand. Demand for investment surveyors is also likely to fall, as their skills do not meet the demands of increasingly complex financial markets. In general, the professionals who will be at a disadvantage are those who have 'a narrow, myopic outlook and training and an inability to bridge across disciplines and understand both the complexity of, and synergy within, the entire property and construction industry'. The report concludes: 'Individuals need to be complete business men or women, rather than narrow technicians.' The Skills Mismatch.

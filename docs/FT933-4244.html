			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Charts show mixed pictures for precious metals after yesterday's nervous base-building in the wake of technically-inspired selling on Tuesday, analysts said. As the London bullion market GOLD price fell another Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 351.75 a troy ounce traders said the the downside risk was relatively limited. 'The break through Dollars 360 was important,' said Ms Elli Gifford, analyst at Investment Research of Cambridge. But she thought the Dollars 350 mark was 'not particularly significant'. She said the market was 'oversold' and 'the real support doesn't begin until Dollars 340'. Mr David Kerly, senior analyst with Chart Analysis, thought an early return to the high prices seen a month ago, was unlikely. 'So much damage has been done that it will really take time for confidence to be re-built,' he said. PLATINUM had the weakest chart background, according to Ms Gifford, with the downside stretching from the current Dollars 357/Dollars 358 an ounce range down to about Dollars 340. But Mr Kerly saw platinum coming into support in the January-April 1993 trading range at closer to Dollars 350, about Dollars 10 below the present level. Compiled from Reuters</p>

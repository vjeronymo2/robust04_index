			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC LUMBER'S OLD-GROWTH REDWOOD LOGGING BID REJECTED  </P> <P> Pacific Lumber Co.'s plan to log 453 acres of old-growth timber in the north  coast Headwaters Forest was rejected Friday by the California Department of  Forestry.  </P> <P> CDF officials cited concerns for the rare marbled murrelet, a robin-sized bird  that nests in the tops of ancient redwood trees near the Pacific Ocean.  </P> <P> The decision was the latest obstacle to Pacific Lumber's plans to log the 3,000  acres of virgin timber east of Eureka known as the Headwaters Forest.  </P> <P> A lawsuit by environmental groups has blocked the company from carrying out  state-approved plans to cut 319 acres in the forest, the largest remaining  privately owned grove of ancient redwoods.  </P> <P> The decision also highlighted growing public concern over the environmental  impact of logging old-growth forests, where giant trees up to 1,500 years old  shelter unique species of wildlife, including the controversial northern  spotted owl.  </P> <P> The owl's listing as an endangered species by the federal government last month  angered the timber industry, which said it could cost thousands of jobs. Unlike  the spotted owl, the marbled murrelet is not listed as an endangered species by  either the federal government or the state of California, although conservation  groups have filed petitions to have it listed.  </P> <P> Pacific Lumber President John Campbell said the CDF decision was "based on  political rather than scientific reasons." Pacific Lumber already has agreed to  study the murrelet population and take steps to protect the birds, he said.  </P> <P> Pacific Lumber has 10 days to appeal the CDF decision to the state Board of  Forestry.  </P></p>

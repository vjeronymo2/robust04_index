			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank: Economists go back to school - Basic training in Kiev When Ukraine first became an independent state, cabinet ministers were apt to telephone western journalists in a frantic search for an explanation of basic economic terms such as 'balance of payments'. Three years later, Kiev has a small but aggressive team of economists who last week negotiated a Dollars 360m (Pounds 240m) loan with the International Monetary Fund - Ukraine's first IMF deal - and hope to launch a coherent programme of market reforms this month. A World Bank public education project being piloted in Ukraine has played a quiet but crucial role in the transformation of at least a small part of Kiev's parochial elite, trained only in obediently fulfilling the Kremlin's central plan, into leaders with a working knowledge of market economics. For a year, Mr Daniel Kaufmann, World Bank representative in Kiev, has been running economic round-tables for politicians and civil servants, more formal seminars and workshops for government bureaucrats, and one-to-one economic training courses for key would-be reformers. The most able ministers and civil servants in the Ukrainian government are alumni of this project. They remain outnumbered by anti-reformist Ukrainian leaders, who have begun to snipe at the IMF deal, but Mr Kaufmann claims to 'convert' one or two members of Ukraine's communist-dominated parliament every week. The project began when Mr Kaufmann realised that meetings between senior Ukrainian leaders and World Bank and International Monetary Fund delegations were 'dialogues of the deaf' in which the Ukrainians solemnly nodded their heads but understood nothing. That experience convinced Mr Kaufmann that before starting standard development projects geared at bolstering market reforms, the World Bank (if Ukraine eventually negotiates a stand-by IMF agreement) could provide Kiev with a rehabilitation loan of up to Dollars 600m, needed to help Ukrainians learn what a market economy is. 'The conventional World Bank approach may have served us well in Latin America and much of Asia where the economic elite which really rules had a solid western education,' Mr Kaufmann says. 'But this is not the case in the former Soviet Union, eastern and central Europe and much of Africa.' Mr Kaufmann also points out that because of the high general level of education, particularly in maths and the sciences, in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, public education in economics gives rapid results. 'The returns to relatively small, focused investment are enormous, extremely steep,' Mr Kaufmann says. 'This is not a 15- or 20-year proposition. The goal is to make ourselves irrelevant in two years.' Mr Kaufmann began the programme using funds from his office's operating budget and small sums of money contributed by western governments, but his initial success has won the admiration of Mr George Soros, the American financier and philanthropist, who announced last week he would like to finance a Ukrainian centre to co-ordinate public economic education. As the World Bank assesses a half-century of operation, Mr Kaufmann hopes his project will become a model for a new approach in the bank, better suited, at least initially, to the regions in which the bank operates than the large projects which have been its traditional mainstay.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: NSK declines 20% to Y3.33bn NSK, Japan's largest maker of ball-bearings, yesterday reported a 20 per cent fall in pre-tax profit for the 12 months to March, but forecast a slight recovery this year. The group had to sell securities to keep its published earnings in the black, a technique used by many Japanese companies to tide them through the longest decline in operating earnings since the second world war. NSK's taxable profits fell to Y3.33bn (Dollars 32m), on sales down by 8.4 per cent to Y325.16bn. The pre-tax profit includes a Y7.3bn capital gain from securities sales, said Mr Shunji Saigo, managing director. Sales of bearings and parts to the car industry fell by 9 per cent and demand from the electrical and information equipment industry was poor, he said. Earnings rose from Y4.47 per share in 1992 to Y6.43 last year. The dividend is to be cut from an uncovered Y7 per share to a barely covered Y6 per share. In the current year, NSK expects pre-tax profit to show a small recovery to Y3.5bn, on sales up to Y330bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Pressure Cannot Be Method for </F> Solution to Problem"]    [Text] According to a report, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry  recently babbled about the so-called development of nuclear  weapons by the North. He said that even at the cost of war that  may be triggered on the Korean peninsula again, the United  States will suspend the development of nuclear arms and it has  made a series of military preparations for this.    Moreover, he unhesitatingly and undisguisedly made violent  remarks on war that the United States will deal an overwhelming  air strike against someone else's provocation within 24 hours.    These bellicose remarks by U.S. Defense Secretary should not  be overlooked in view of the grave situation prevailing on the  Korean peninsula today.    As is known to all, the United States totally reversed the  agreement reached during the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York by  presenting unreasonable excuses, instead of doing what it should  have done according to this agreement, thus leading the  situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme pitch.    By raving about resumption of the Team Spirit nuclear war  exercise, the United States deployed in the advance area the  U.S. naval fleet made up of 30 ships, including a mobile  aircraft carrier unit, so that the fleet can reach the coast of  our country within 24 hours.    In addition, Patriot missiles departed Texas, United States  and are on the way to South Korea at the order of the U.S.  President. Meanwhile, the U.S. military is working out a plan to  deploy 600,000 troops, including two Marine corps divisions from  the U.S. mainland; 200-odd ships and vessels, and 1,600-odd  airplanes to the Korean peninsula within 80 days in an emergency.    Timed to coincide with this bustling military move, U.S.  Defense Secretary made violent remarks about an overwhelming air  strike, and so forth. This clearly shows the U.S. imperialists'  intention to start a war of aggression on the Korean peninsula  at last.    The United States raved that such military steps are to be  taken because we are developing nuclear weapons. However, this  is nothing but sophism designed to deceive the people and to  justify its maneuvers of aggression by misleading public opinion.    As is known to all, the nuclear problem on the Korean  peninsula occurred when the United States began to bring nuclear  weapons to South Korea. As the United States threatened our  people with them, the problem has increased.    Nevertheless, the United States, the offender of a nuclear  threat, laid blame on us, the sufferer, and expanded the war  maneuvers in a step-by-step manner. This is an intolerable crime  that is the same as a thief calling, "Stop thief!" These are  stereotypical tactics used by the U.S. imperialists whenever  they invade other nations.    As the whole world knows, all situations illustrate that the  one who is blocking the road of a solution to the nuclear  problem on the Korean peninsula is none other than the United  States and the ringleader who is driving the situation on the  Korean peninsula into a phase of confrontation and war is none  other than the United States.    The U.S. imperialists should correctly realize that they  cannot solve the problem by a military threat and menace, nor  can they frighten and bring our people to their knees. This is  proven by historic facts, including the Korean war in the early  1950's, the Pueblo incident in the 1960's, and the Panmunjom  incident in the 1970's.    The time when the means of force worked disappeared a long  time ago. The time when the United states could threaten and  menace small nations by wielding military clubs as a almighty  means and act like the international police is gone forever.    Moreover, the Korean people are not the people of the past  when the nation was just liberated from the Japanese  imperialists' colonial rule, but are the mighty and dignified  people who shape their destiny independently by grasping it in  their own hands.    Our people have a firm self-reliant national economy and  strong defense capabilities to defend our-style socialism by  smashing any aggressor in a stroke. Our people do not want war  but are not afraid of war.    It is our consistent position to resolve the nuclear problem  through dialogue and negotiations. If the United States is truly  interested in resolving the nuclear problem, it should not  adhere to foolish military means and discard nuclear threats to  us. It should first take a step to give up the policy of  hostility against us.    If the United States, instead of doing this, advances along  the road of provoking a war by further aggravating tension, the  rascals will suffer only bitter defeat. If the Korean war in  1950 was described as the beginning of a downward slope for the  U.S. imperialists, a second Korean war will drive the U.S.  imperialists into a corner from which they can never come out.    The United States should ponder the consequences to be  brought about by its new war provocation maneuvers and should  act with discretion.</p>

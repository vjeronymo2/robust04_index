			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / ECGD unit may go to foreign buyer: Troubled government sale branded 'a shambles' as it loses last British bidder OVERSEAS companies emerged as the most likely winners in the privatisation of part of the Export Credits Guarantee Department as the deadline for bids expired yesterday. The government's sale effort, which has been dogged by a series of embarrassing setbacks, took another battering after Trade Indemnity, the last remaining British bidder, declined to put any money on the table. Trade Indemnity said it made a proposal to collaborate with the government in export credit insurance but this did not involve a monetary offer to buy ECGD's short-term export credit insurance business which is for sale. Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, will now have to abandon the sale or allow the business to pass, probably at a knock-down price, to one of the only two foreign bidders - Italy's Assicurazioni Generali and NCM of the Netherlands. Mr John Hollows, deputy chairman of the British Exporters Association, said the privatisation was turning into 'a shambles'. He blamed the earlier withdrawal of Eagle Star, Sun Alliance and Cobac, the privately-owned Belgian company, on the government's refusal to make an irrevocable commitment to continue underwriting credits to politically risky developing countries after the privatisation. Trade Indemnity's interest in buying the Cardiff-based division has waned noticeably in recent weeks as it digested a Pounds 29m loss for 1990 amid fears that its shareholders would baulk at the rights issue needed to finance a bid. However, potential bidders have also been disappointed by government sale documents which reveal limited profit potential at the ECGD division. This has added to their worries about the strength of its customer base in the absence of an ability to offer political risk cover on the back of a government reinsurance scheme. The privatised company would also be impeded in Europe by tax regulations treating mandatory reserve requirements on British credit insurance companies less favourably than those of other community countries. The government is expected to proceed with the next stage of the sale - an evaluation of the offers received - followed in about a month's time by the selection of a preferred bidder. Although the deal is expected to yield only a minimal return, the government has paid heavily in embarrassment. After quashing a Commons backbench rebellion, it has now had to postpone debate of the legislation in the House of Lords to fend off revolt there. Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, will discuss political risk with exporters, who hope he will offer a commitment to an improved facility along the lines of those open to companies in continental Europe.

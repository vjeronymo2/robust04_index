			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luiza Kowalska: "The Army: When Will Deputies </F> Discuss the Army; President Delays Defense Debate?"]    [Text] It is not very likely that the Sejm debate on  Poland's defense system, the first in four years, will be held  in June. The Sejm's National Defense Committee issued a  statement yesterday, expressing its "concern over the prolonged  work on the document on the fundamental problems for the defense  system."    It was a few months ago that Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy  promised the leadership of the National Defense Ministry [MON]  to hold a debate on the defense system, the first in four years.  MON Head Piotr Kolodziejczyk hoped that during the debate the  deputies would say exactly how much money it would be possible  to earmark for the Army in the next few years. There are many  indications, however, that the deputies will not hold this  discussion before the summer holiday break. Tbe reason for this  is the delay of a document, which the government is supposed to  submit to the Sejm for discussion -- "On the Fundamental  Problems of the Defense System."    The government is supposed to decide in this document who  should steer the Army and what the scope of his powers should  be. Originally the document contained two proposals: the  president, as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, steers  the Army through the chief of the General Staff who is  subordinate to him; the president controls the Army through the  defense minister, to whom, in turn, as it is today, the chief of  the General Staff is subordinate.    Even though everything seems to indicate that the government  will accept the second option, at the last moment the president  proposed that the National Defense Committee [KOK] should be  consulted on this issue. The president supports the first  solution, and the composition of KOK (most of them are  supporters of Lech Walesa) guarantees that he will gain definite  support there.    However, decisions of KOK are not final for the government.  Thus, they will not influence its final choice and the session  of KOK will only delay the submission of the document "On the  Fundamental Problems of the Defense System" in the Sejm. This  will probably defer the entire debate.    It is not very likely that the president will manage to win  the support of the Sejm by stalling for time. All the major  parties in the Sejm are in favor of the solution that is in  force today and they declare that nothing will make them change  their opinions. "We really do care about democracy," says Jerzy  Szmajdzinski of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], asked about  the possibility of backing the president's option. According to  him, SLD will not change its mind, even if it counts on  Aleksander Kwasniewski to be elected president soon.    If the debate is eventually held, the deputies would like to  define in a special resolution what issues are most important  for the Army. Janusz Onyszkiewicz of the Union of Liberty  suggested yesterday that the resolution include the necessity of  maintaining the apolitical character of the Army and leaving the  responsibility for defense affairs with the government,  especially with the defense minister.</p>

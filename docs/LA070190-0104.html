			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART AND GOOD WILL FROM ACROSS THE WORLD;  </P> <P> CULTURAL FESTIVAL SPRINGS FROM AN INTERNATIONAL SPORTS COMPETITION  </P> <P> When members of the Seattle Organizing Committee sat down to plan the 1990  Goodwill Games here, they felt swimming, figure skating and gymnastics were  just a start. They wanted Ted Turner's huge international sporting event to  have a cultural side too.  </P> <P> The result? The Goodwill Games themselves don't start until July 20, but  beginning Monday is the Goodwill Arts Festival, four weeks of world-class  productions and mini-festivals. Budgeted at $12.4 million, the festival  includes performances by the Bolshoi Ballet and the Grand Kabuki Theatre,  exhibitions of Soviet constructivist and conceptual art, Arab films and a  National Gay and Lesbian Theatre Festival.  </P> <P> "The arts are a strong component of everyday living in Seattle," explains  Norman Langill, festival executive producer. "If you're planning a large-scale  event here, sports or otherwise, it's very natural to include a cultural  element. Nobody here said, 'Let's talk about it.' It was as normal as figuring  out whether or not there was sufficient hotel space."  </P> <P> Langill, who has been producing the huge, annual Bumbershoot arts festival at  Seattle Center for years, apparently knew his audience. The Bolshoi and Kabuki  sold out on mail order alone, says Langill, adding that Montreal's Cirque du  Soleil reported "one of the hottest starts they've ever had on a first-time  visit to any city." And when organizers added an extra performance of the  Bolshoi a few weeks ago, all 3,000 tickets were sold in less than two hours.  </P> <P> It's a massive undertaking. There are 33 programs on the official roster,  involving at least 26 local arts organizations and more than 200 performances.  Besides total attendance of about 500,000 people, festival organizers expect  more than 1,300 artists from two dozen countries (although special attention is  being given to the arts of the Soviet Union). Also planned is an exchange  program that will involve 250 Soviet educators, scientists, lawyers and writers  and an equal number of their American counterparts.  </P> <P> Already open is "Moscow: Treasures &amp; Traditions," a sprawling exhibition of  paintings, religious objects, costumes and other items spanning five centuries  and generally not seen before in the United States, a show of modern Pacific  Northwest art at the Seattle Art Museum, and Soviet conceptual art at the  Tacoma Art Museum. Set to open this week is an exhibition of Soviet  constructivism at the University of Washington's Henry Art Gallery.  </P> <P> The Seattle Opera is presenting Prokofiev's "War and Peace" -- at $2 million  the most expensive production in the opera's history -- with 200 Soviet and  other artists.  </P> <P> Seattle's Intiman Theatre Company is presenting "Into the Whirlwind," the  Sovremennick Theatre of Moscow's new adaptation of Eugenia Ginzburg's  long-suppressed memoir of life in a Stalinist prison camp.  </P> <P> Things changed during the four-year course of festival planning. Consider, for  instance, the Eastern Europe political climate then and now. "When we started  this, the Department of Defense was appalled at the notion we'd be inviting all  these people to Seattle," says attorney Paul Schell, festival co-chair and a  member of the Seattle Organizing Committee. "We were still in the Cold War era,  and for a long time, people organizing the Games had better access than the  State Department did."  </P> <P> Pacific Northwest Ballet co-artistic director Francia Russell staged  Balanchine's "Theme and Variations" for the Kirov two years ago, leading to a  continuing relationship between the two organizations, and Schell says he hopes  similar links will develop for Intiman and other groups after the festival.  </P> <P> "There is a consistent feeling now of our destiny as an economic and cultural  crossroads between Europe and Asia, " says Schell. "London is five minutes  closer to us than Tokyo, and the vision of our being a crossroads city like  Venice was in the Mediterranean era is increasingly shared by Seattle's  economic and cultural communities. That's where we're going in the '90s, and  the Goodwill Games and Arts Festival are our calling cards."  </P> <P>  Ticket information at press time: The Bolshoi Ballet and Grand Kabuki are sold  out, and seats are getting scarce for "War and Peace," "Into the Whirlwind" and  Cirque du Soleil. Tickets are still available for all other events; contact  Ticketmaster in Seattle at (206) 292-1990 or (206) 628-0888.  </P> <P> BARBARA ISENBERG  </P></p>

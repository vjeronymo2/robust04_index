			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Department </F> of Information and the Press of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  of the Russian Federation, by SEGODNYA correspondent Irina  Grudinina: "The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Is Concerned  at the Drain of Professionals"; date and place not given]    [Text] [Grudinina] Grigoriy Borisovich, how do you assess  the situation and the mood in Russia's diplomatic service?    [Karasin] The main thing, in my opinion, is that since the  1991-1992 period, which was difficult and dramatic for the  diplomatic service, the Foreign Ministry structures have  stabilized and interaction between subdivisions, along  center-embassies lines, has strengthened. Whence also the more  composed, business-oriented mood of the diplomats.    Russia's new foreign policy realities have made necessary a  qualitative retuning of thinking and practice. The Foreign  Ministry is now characterized by a state, not party, approach to  its activity. We are actively mastering the skills of  interaction with all the Russian state and political structures,  considering the state of public opinion, and trying to speak  more broadly and simply about actual foreign policy in order  that it be comprehensible to and accepted by Russians. Doing  this is, as you will understand, very difficult, but essential.    [Grudinina] Russia's foreign policy is today the most active  zone, perhaps, where different positions clash and sharply  worded and, at times, mutually exclusive statements are made.  How is this being reflected in the practical activity of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is it helping or hindering?    [Karasin] Real pluralism and a comparison of positions and  opinions not only do not hinder but also help considerably in  the formation of foreign policy approaches at the state level.  That pluralism geared to a search for the most appropriate  approaches cannot be confused with "megaphone" statements behind  which a responsible attitude and an aspiration to make a  constructive contribution to Russia's foreign policy are barely  discernible is another matter. Avowed self-publicity is an  inevitable concomitant here also. I am convinced that foreign  policy is far from being the sphere in which it is possible "to  fully expose oneself" to the world just for fun. Like it or not,  the country's foreign prestige depends on this. State-minded  commonsense needs to be displayed here.    It would seem that, considering the sensitivity of the  foreign policy theme, we could polemicize far more effectively  within the framework of the current state  structures--committees, councils, and other mechanisms,  especially since a sufficient quantity of them has been created.    I frequently ask myself why problems of industrial  production, agriculture, commerce, and education are not  discussed publicly with such intensity and sharpness. Because,  most likely, the majority understand that this is primarily  specialists' business. Although, to be honest, there are far  fewer "delicate moments" in these fields than in foreign policy.  This sphere probably merits a special approach. We should treat  it solicitously and avoid excessive revelations and public  mistakes in the eyes of the world. Otherwise some politicians  will be temporary winners, some will be thinking about their  counter-play, and long-term national interests will be the  losers.    [Grudinina] There are in the Foreign Ministry, most likely,  as in other state institutions also, serious internal problems  that disturb people and that need to be resolved. Could you  distinguish the most important, most painful problem?    [Karasin] I was, I confess, expecting this question. There  are many problems, of course, and they are, for the most part,  typical of all public service. But there is one that disturbs  all of us most of all. It is the question of the future of the  country's diplomatic service. The Foreign Ministry has always  been characterized by a continuity of the generations and strict  professional schooling. A diplomat is not simply a government  official but a person to whom state interests have been  entrusted. He has to renounce the euphoria of simple solutions,  accustom himself to painstaking work, and know the value of the  actual and the sham result.    We are today observing a dangerous trend of a drain from the  Foreign Ministry system of both experienced and young  specialists, which raises the serious question of what Russia's  diplomatic service will be like in three to five years and the  more distant future. If we disregard the details, what is  fundamental is the problem of financial support for diplomats  working in the central machinery in Moscow. Please understand me  correctly. In no country can diplomats be compared in terms of  living standard with businessmen nor, to be honest, do they  aspire to this. They derive satisfaction from service of the  country and take pride in this, but, granted all this, they have  sufficient for the decent support of their family. With us the  situation is different. A well-trained graduate of a higher  educational institution with a knowledge of two or three  languages receives on coming to work in the Foreign Ministry  R55,000 (for comparison: An army lieutenant receives  R200,000-R250,000), and after 20 years' service a Foreign  Ministry counselor receives R130,000. Is it surprising that  under such conditions young people are being forced, primarily  from "family considerations," to go into private structures and  sell Snickers bars and chewing gum, getting 10-15 times more for  this.    The time has come to sound the alarm. The professional  structure, which the country needs and whose formation has taken  several decades, could fall apart.    [Grudinina] We have to agree with your arguments. But the  question as to the sum that an increase in diplomats' pay would  cost the treasury arises.    [Karasin] I would like to make clear once more that we are  talking only about the central machinery of the Foreign  Ministry. Those who work in Moscow. And, following repeated  cuts, there are little more than 1,500 of these remaining. I  would say for comparison that there are in the U.S. State  Department, with an approximately similar structure, 10,000  diplomats. It is obvious, in my opinion, that economies in the  diplomatic service will not resolve the problems of the state  budget but could cause the country's interests palpable harm. It  is indisputable also that Russia's diplomatic service needs high  professionals no less than the armed forces or intelligence, say.    [Grudinina] There has been frequent talk recently of the  need  for an active search for off-budget sources of funding of state  institutions. Could not the problem be resolved this way?    [Karasin] I am convinced that the possibilities of the  Foreign Ministry in a search for such sources are extremely  limited. Entangling public service, in such sensitive areas as  foreign policy, what is more, in commerce and business is an  extraordinarily risky and, in the long-term, unjustified  venture. The microbes of "official enterprise" could very  quickly eat through the entire organism of the diplomatic  service. Everyone should concern himself with his own work,  giving it all his efforts, time, and ability, otherwise the  state will be the loser.</p>

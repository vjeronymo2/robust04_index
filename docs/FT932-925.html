			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Cheaper money FALLS IN interest rates in Denmark and Italy yesterday widened the pattern of easier borrowing conditions across Europe, Peter Marsh writes. The reductions underlined the gradual downtrend irrespective of any action by the Bundesbank. While pessimism about the outlook for the German economy has moderated slightly, many investors see easier monetary conditions across the Continent as inevitable in the light of the European recession. The Danish central bank said it offered to enter two-week repurchase agreements at a fixed yield of 7.95 per cent, down from 8.10 per cent in the previous two-week offer. But it left its discount and deposit rates unchanged at 7.75 per cent. In Milan, the minimum rate at the Bank of Italy's lira repo fell 40 basis points to 9.50 per cent, possibly foreshadowing cuts in official interest rates. Ms Marianne Jelved, the Danish economy minister, said Danish short and long-term interest rates were likely to fall to below German levels over the next six months. The Bundesbank's key discount rate stands at 7.25 per cent, although it could come down at its council meeting on Thursday. Three-month interbank rates in the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Ireland were all last night comfortably below the equivalent figure in Germany of 7.44 per cent. While Dutch interbank rates were 88 basis points below the German level, corresponding figures for the other three nations were 56, 70 and 75 basis points respectively. In Frankfurt, Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank board member, said a one basis point cut this week in the central bank's repo rate to 7.59 per cent did not prejudice future policy decisions. In Amsterdam, dealers said the Dutch central bank would stick to its policy of protecting the D-Mark/guilder parity in spite of a string of recent independent rate cuts, led by the French central bank. Call money edged up to 7 per cent from 6.93 per cent. On UK money markets, the Bank of England injected Pounds 962m into the banking system after a forecast shortage of Pounds 950m. While UK speculation on imminent cuts in base rates has cooled, many believe the government is likely to sanction easier borrowing conditions over the next few months to boost the recovery.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Accountancy Column: An institutional fracture in need of repair - The importance of solving the debate on how to reshape the six professional bodies The accountancy profession is currently suffering from an acute attack of institutional gridlock. Asked to forge a new structure to meet the challenges of the next century, the six main professional bodies have been reduced, in the words of one leading player, to 'flicking paperclips at each other'. In theory, the reshaping of the profession should be taking place in an office on Salisbury Square, off Fleet Street. Here leading representatives of the bodies meet to discuss reform under the chairmanship of David Bishop, a partner at the accountants KPMG Peat Marwick specialising, helpfully, in change management. Gathered around a single table are the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA), the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa), and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (Cima). The bodies have already produced the so-called Bishop Plan which envisaged a merger to form three geographical blocks - England, Scotland and Ireland. They agreed that their combined membership of 200,000 should be consulted on the plan. At least that is what they thought they had agreed. The powerful ICAEW is accused of not consulting at all but promoting the merger plan, which its rivals see as a vehicle for it to swallow up the rest, or at least its biggest rival, the ACCA. Partly motivated by this perceived injustice, ACCA promptly produced its own plan - dubbed Bishop 2. This shelved rationalisation in favour of harmonisation under a new umbrella body constructed along the lines of the General Medical Council - and named the General Accounting Council. The ICAEW was stung to respond in language not normally associated with accountants. The idea was, according to the its mild-mannered president Roger Lawson, not only 'dead on arrival' but 'still-born'. A president of one of the bodies received notification of this plan several days after it appeared in the press. Others heard of it for the first time over the table at Salisbury Square. One can only imagine the discomfort felt by David Bishop in such circumstances. Yet again the accountancy profession appears to be heading for fracture when consolidation was in sight. The last successful merger was in 1957. The last time they failed, in 1970, the result was the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies. Born of failure it is seen by many as having failed the profession at a vital time. During a decade marked by corporate collapses such as the fall of the Maxwell empire, Polly Peck and BCCI, many in the profession, and plenty in government, have looked to the professional bodies for public accountability. This highlights the problem facing the bickering six: there are strong forces at work which require the profession to do something before something is done to it. Another corporate collapse could convince the present government to put the accountancy profession on its agenda. A Labour government might find the time any way. If neither acts the European Parliament may. The need to provide public accountability, regulation and standards is recognised. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, joined the argument by telling the profession earlier this year to merge in order to improve its ability to lobby government. Accountants, he said, should speak with one voice. The problem is that the six cannot bring themselves to talk sensibly to each other. The cloud of competition has to some extent obscured the need to provide a service to customers. The ICAEW is, for one, aware that prevarication could cost the profession dear. ACCA is emerging as a dynamic body. Its chief executive Anthea Rose is a forceful personality who appears to have a firm grip on her organisation. It has 100,000 students (about half of them outside the UK) compared with the institute's 11,000. Outside the UK, ACCA's qualifications and ideas are spreading fast. The body wants this potential power to be realised while the ICAEW's strengths, founded on its prestigious chartered brand and more than 100,000 members, stand in its way. It is understandably furious about the Bishop 2 plan. However, ACCA is terrified of being swallowed whole by the ICAEW. It wants to protect its 'core values' of open access to the profession, flexible education and a common 'title' for accountants. ACCA suspects the institute is pushing its members to share their coveted title now, in a merger they can dominate, rather than later in a merger with stronger partners. The other bodies watch this clash of power with increasing alarm. In Ireland things are simplest in the most complicated of settings. Throughout the violence the institute has met in both Belfast and Dublin, and is committed to an all-Ireland body. It would preserve this arrangement under Bishop and has therefore given it a cautious welcome. Cima is for rationalisation and welcomed the publication of Bishop. It wants recognition of the value of its international activities and of the status of management accountancy as an equal partner with other disciplines. Cipfa has strong sympathies with Bishop 2. It feels that the original plan was rushed through and as a result was ill-conceived with little regard for detail. A papering over of the cracks which inevitably fell apart. It would probably support a limited Bishop 2 scheme for an umbrella body and some harmonisation between the bodies operating under its governance. The Scots find themselves in a no lose situation. Their treasured independence and compact organisation are rigorously defended. Their position is less anxious and summed up as: 'Its best to remain good friends rather than be unhappily married.' Most of the bodies believe that the worst scenario is approaching. That the position ante Bishop will be the same as before. To avoid such an outcome some creative thinking is going on about a possible structure for debate in 1995. The idea of the General Accounting Council might survive in some form - perhaps even as a 'limited umbrella' covering some of the bodies. There is a strong sense that the GAC was a credible idea launched with disastrous consequences for merger. Cynics believe its launch was designed to be just that. Meanwhile a process of ad hoc harmonisation may well begin to spring up. This could be limited to targeting areas for joint action or simply to cutting costs by amalgamation of services. It might also stimulate a debate about whether the profession is one profession, or several. If the second, what is wrong with not speaking with one voice? The role of the ICAEW is crucial. It has moved boldly for change at a time when it knows it can dominate the outcome. But its motives are not as ignoble as often painted. Even the other bodies acknowledge that the profession gains much of its intellectual drive from auditing and the Big Six accountancy firms. The ICAEW is vital to the health of both. In the rush to merge many fear these traditional strengths of the ICAEW will be undermined and isolated in some new conglomerate of bodies. The ICAEW rejects the charge that it tried to push Bishop on its members. It says that to achieve progress, all the bodies agreed to consultation on the Bishop plan. Above all there is a sense from all concerned that the profession must put its own house in order. If the present acrimonious debate achieves anything it must be a willingness to compromise to achieve change.</p>

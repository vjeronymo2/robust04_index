			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (57): After apartheid, optimism grows - South Africa / The crucial problem is government spending For most of the past decade, South African planners have been warning that without drastic policy changes in the political and economic arenas, the domestic economy was doomed to continue on a downward spiral of high inflation, low growth and stagnant employment. Testifying to the accuracy of such predictions, South Africa's economic record over the past 10 years has been dismal, averaging growth of less than 1 per cent a year. At the same time, triggered by the combination of sustained political unrest, the loss of international confidence, and gross economic mismanagement by the government, inflation and government spending soared while investment, domestic savings and overall business confidence plunged. Now that the political side of the equation has finally been resolved, however, there is widespread optimism in the country that the economic challenges can be tackled with equal success. And with political change fortuitously coinciding with an upturn in the global business cycle, there is a widespread belief that South Africa can become an economic engine capable not only of pulling millions of its own citizens out of the mire of poverty, but acting as a catalyst for renewed growth in the region as well. Unfortunately, however, the situation is not that simple. The distorted policies of the apartheid era have left a deep-seated and destructive economic legacy that will take years to resolve. The crucial problem remains government spending, which accounted for 21 per cent of GDP over the first half of 1994 - a figure double the norm in most developing Asian economies. This extraordinarily high level of government involvement in the economy causes other problems, too. Funding the budget deficit, expected to be 6.6 per cent of GDP, diverts money from new fixed investment while continued spending by government intensifies inflationary pressures. The high level of government borrowing also means that gross domestic saving in the economy, essential to help fund new development, is at only 16 per cent of GDP. Compounding the problem is the fact that the economy remains overwhelmingly dependent on commodity exports, which account for some 71 per cent of foreign exchange earnings. Although the government has been trying for some years to switch the focus to manufactured goods, it remains hampered by the fact that South Africa's economy is still highly protected, and many of its enterprises uncompetitive by global standards. In addition, the maintenance of a relatively expensive workforce with a low skills base acts as a further obstacle to development. In an international competiveness survey released by the World Economic Forum this month South Africa ranked 35th out of 41 countries and came last in the 'people' category, assessing the educational and training levels of the general populace. Despite all this, however, the underlying fact remains that the economic outlook for South Africa is better than it has been for decades. Growth this year is expected to be around 2.5 per cent, below the more optimistic forecasts made at the beginning of the year, but still up on 1993's 1.1 per cent, which itself followed four years of painful recession. Next year the figure is expected to reach between 3.5-4 per cent. The consensus among most economists is that provided the government sticks to conservative fiscal and monetary policies, South Africa is capable of continuing to generate domestic growth of around 3.5 per cent for the next five years. But to achieve more than that, a significant inflow of foreign investment, bringing with it exposure to new international skills and technology denied to the country during its years of isolation, is desperately needed. So far, the first condition seems to be met. Despite the immense political pressures on the ruling African National Congress to provide the populace with tangible benefits following the demise of apartheid, it has successfully resisted the temptation to undertake high spending, populist policies that would further destroy the economy's fragile base. Indeed, in its public statements to date, including the June budget, the government has been a model of fiscal probity, stressing its commitment to reducing the budget deficit and promising to fund its centrepiece reconstruction and development programme through savings rather than new borrowing. And while inflation may be rising, its current level of 8.2 per cent is still well down on the double digit rates that characterised the 1980s. In addition, trade and industry minister Trevor Manuel has shown an encouraging willingess to take on entrenched business lobbies and has already started to dismantle tariffs in sectors such as the motor and textiles industry to force South African manufacturers to become more competitive. Despite its good track record, however, the markets remain sceptical of the government's ability to successfully rein in spending - a fact signalled in the recent rise of bond yields to more than 17 per cent, representing a real rate of return of more than 9 per cent. And while industrial restructuring is an essential step if South Africa is to successfully start pursuing an export-led growth strategy, in the short term it is likely to depress rather than enhance growth prospects. However, most analysts agree that the key to whether the South African economy can finally step on to the high road of renewed growth is whether it can successfully attract renewed inflows of foreign capital. Although the country has seen net capital outflows of around R50bn between 1985 and the first half of 1994, since June the situation appears to have stabilised. But it has not yet reversed. People have stopped taking money out of South Africa, but few people are yet willing to start putting new investments into the country. Meanwhile, the country's foreign reserves remain seriously depleted and are currently able to cover only five weeks of imports. With total foreign currency debt at only Dollars 16.7bn and interest payments accounting for just 7 per cent of exports in 1993, one possible means of correcting this is renewed borrowing. However, the far more desirable route is new foreign investment. But while a large number of foreign companies have set up offices or franchise operations in South Africa over the past 18 months, few have yet made any investments of any significance. As a result, over the next few years South Africa is likely to follow a path of only moderate growth, representing a significant improvement over the recent past but still well short of the high levels the ANC needs to satisfy the needs of its black constituents.</p>

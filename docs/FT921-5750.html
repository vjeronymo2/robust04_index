			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Irish 'want change' in abortion legislation AN OPINION poll published in Ireland yesterday shows that 66 per cent of voters are in favour of altering the country's strict anti-abortion legislation. This represents a big shift in public opinion since the right-to-life amendment to the constitution was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum in 1983 by a nine-to-two margin. The poll was commissioned by the Irish Times, and carried out by the Market Research Bureau of Ireland (MRBI) after the recent controversy over a High Court injunction which prevented a 14 year-old rape victim from travelling to Britain for an abortion. The injunction was overturned last Wednesday by the Supreme Court. The poll shows that only 30 per cent of voters wish to retain the right-to-life article in the constitution, 48 per cent are in favour of amending it, and 18 per cent want it removed altogether. Only 4 per cent were undecided. It also shows 52 per cent of the population are in favour of a new referendum on the issue. Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, said a referendum was low on his list of priorities following the Supreme Court ruling. The Supreme Court is expected to publish the reasons for its ruling this week. Of particular interest is how the ruling may affect Ireland's ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. Ireland has negotiated a protocol to the treaty, which will prevent EC legislation from overruling Ireland's anti-abortion stance. Dr Desmond Connell, archbishop of Dublin, equated 'the spread of permissive legislation on abortion' with the kind of abuses carried out 'under Nazi and communist rule'.</p>

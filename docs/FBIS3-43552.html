He  said he had made a specific proposal on dealing with violence  ahead of their Tuesday talks.    "If he does not act on that proposal, then South Africa is  facing a crisis," he said. He declined to give details.    But he added: "We cannot allow a situation where a hostel  has  become the centre of the most blatant criminal action and  without the police doing anything."</p>

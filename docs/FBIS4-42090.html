			<p>BFN     [Text] Southern Sudan has been going through civil war for  many years now. Drought, last year's bad harvest, the lack of  seeds, and the people's difficulties in moving about have only  made matters worse for people. The threatening famine could be  as devastating as that which laid Somalia to waste two years  ago, according to Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF], which has  warned that humanitarian resupplying by air is becoming  increasingly difficult. MSF Doctor Karim Lawabia spoke to  Muriel Pomponne:    [Begin recording] [Lawabia] One can say that if nothing is  done by 30 May there will not be a single plane left to bring  food to southern Sudan and people will be deprived of food. In  reports from Juba, our colleagues at AICF [Association  Internationale Contre la Faim] told us that the food situation  in Juba was also tragic since the UN operation, Operation  Lifeline Sudan, has almost put an end to the distribution of  food on the government's side, that is, in the zones held by the  Sudanese Government. Moreover, we are now expecting the rainy  season, which makes air transport totally uncertain, and if  nothing is done quickly, we--humanitarian organizations--may  find ourselves in a position where we have to leave because we  are unable to face up to the food situation.    [Pomponne] You have to have agreements with the Sudanese  Government in order to face up to the food situation, don't you?    [Lawabia] The entire UN operation, Operation Lifeline Sudan,  is taking place with the agreement of the Sudanese Government,  this is obvious. As for non-governmental organizations, it is  true that we do not necessarily need the agreement of the  Sudanese Government, but it goes without saying that, if you  want to reach the zones that need help, you have to travel for  one and a half or two hours in Sudanese air space, and you need  flight authorization from the Khartoum Government or one given  to the UN operation.    [Pomponne] Is action required very quickly?    [Lawabia] Very, very quickly.    [Pomponne] What is the deadline?    [Lawabia] One month, even less. [end recording]</p>

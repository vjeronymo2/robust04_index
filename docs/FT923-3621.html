			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Lisbon fears 'crisis' for Europe REJECTION of the Maastricht Treaty on European union by the French electorate would cause foreign exchange and financial instability and throw the Community into crisis, Mr Antonio Borges, deputy governor of the Portuguese central bank, warned yesterday, Patrick Blum writes from Lisbon. The Portuguese government, whose economic strategy is predicated on deepening European integration, is concerned at the possibility of a negative vote in the French referendum. Mr Borges told the Financial Times a No result would be 'disastrous not just for Portugal, but especially for Portugal' - 'Not simply because of the money (Portugal receives from the Community), though that is important, but because (Portugal's EC membership) has opened trade opportunities, encouraged foreign investment which otherwise would not have come here, and has motivated (the authorities) to implement difficult domestic decisions which would not have been made without the excuse of the Community.' About three-quarters of Portugal's trade is with the Community, which is also the main source of direct foreign investment. Trade would suffer and investment decisions would be put off if there was financial instability, he said.</p>

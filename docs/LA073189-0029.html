			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> In his final days in office, Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. personally  approved consulting contracts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, according  to Department of Housing and Urban Development officials who contend that in  one case Pierce overruled lopsided opposition from department experts. The two  contracts were earmarked for firms with ties to a former Pierce deputy and a  prominent black Republican couple, said the officials, who asked not to be  identified. Despite Pierce's endorsement, the contracts were eventually put on  hold by the new officials at HUD. Jack Flynn, a department spokesman, said both  projects are being reviewed and other officials said agency experts contend the  contracts are unnecessary and poorly designed.  </P></p>

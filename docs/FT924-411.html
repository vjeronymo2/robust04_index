			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Five BR routes are set tougher Charter targets which it calls 'routes' - will be set higher standards under the Passenger's Charter next year, BR announced yesterday. That follows BR's poor performance in 1992, during which a quarter of its routes performed badly enough for regular users to qualify for discounts on renewal of their season tickets. All the routes facing tougher targets are Network SouthEast services, some of which were set comparatively easy standards this year and beat them by a comfortable margin. The five routes are Chiltern, North London, West Anglia, Thames and the London Tilbury &amp; Southend. All face targets demanding higher standards of punctuality and Thames also faces more ambitious reliability targets. BR's InterCity sector has fallen so far short of its targets in 1992 that it has asked for easier ones next year. Its request has been rejected. BR therefore enters the new year with the same standards as this year, requiring it to run at least 99 per cent of scheduled trains and to get at least 90 per cent of them to their destination on time. Mr Chris Green, InterCity's managing director, said some routes were not playing on a level pitch. 'The West Coast route needs the total renewal of much of its ageing infrastructure before it can achieve these ideal targets,' he explained. Regional Railways, which has failed to meet its targets on five out of 23 routes this year, also starts the new year with targets unchanged. Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, said: 'The fact that we have not met all our standards shows that they are demanding ones, particularly in some areas. We aim to use the resources we have to secure continuous improvement.' The Central Transport Consultative Committee, the rail users' watchdog, said it was pleased to see some Network SouthEast targets moving upwards. 'However, the committee is concerned that some of the targets are still not set at the right level,' it said. Letters, Page 7</p>

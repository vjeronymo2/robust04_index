			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: NFU welcomes government measures The National Farmers' Union of England and Wales yesterday welcomed government measures to tighten health checks on imported livestock following outbreaks of brucellosis and warble fly in Britain. The government is to check all livestock imports from countries where there are high-risk diseases and to examine 50 to 60 per cent of all imported animals. Cattle from France are already being checked following the warble fly outbreaks, which originated from French imports. The government is also pressing for common EU standards to be used by vets who certify the health of livestock. Mr David Naish, the NFU president, said: 'These are all moves in the right direction. It's got to be policed very carefully'.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Yeltsin's young reformers in firing line PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's government may have survived the launch of unpopular economic reforms. But behind the scenes the Russian leader is having to manoeuvre hard to withstand what could be a fatal attack on his young cabinet of economic reformers. Storm clouds are gathering fast before the crucial meeting of the Congress of People's Deputies, Russia's top legislature, on April 6 - its first since it gave President Yeltsin emergency powers to conduct the reforms. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the Russian parliament, yesterday again urged Mr Yeltsin to give up the leadership of the cabinet and reshuffle the government in order to protect his popularity. Otherwise Congress could strip him of the emergency powers, or force the government's resignation with a no-confidence vote. Meanwhile, an aide to Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, another leading critic of the team of economic reformers, claimed Mr Yeltsin had given Mr Rutskoi additional powers to 'control the cabinet'. He said a new presidential decree confirming Mr Rutskoi in his new role as land reform overlord gave him the final say in matters extending to the conversion of defence plants for the production of agriculture machinery and the allocation of proceeds from state arms sales. A spokesman for Mr Yeltsin's government denied that the decree gave Mr Rutskoi additional powers, saying his authority would simply extend over areas such as drafting unemployed army officers into private agriculture. Mr Khasbulatov and Mr Rutskoi have led public attacks on the government for focusing on financial recovery at the expense of industrial output and social subsidies. Although they do not as yet command significant popular support, both men are waiting for further economic woes - such as an slump in production - to advance their cause. It was no coincidence that Mr Yeltsin was yesterday consulting leaders of parliamentary factions, and his vice-president. Other critics include the mayor of St Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak, who told the German magazine Stern that Russia faced a 'social explosion' if Mr Yeltsin's government continued its current economic policies. In addition, 60 deputies who are also managers of heavy industry, are drafting a plan to strengthen state controls and subsidies for industry. The group, which includes a number of directors from the defence industry, will take their plan to parliament if the government rejects it. President Yeltsin is unlikely to crumble easily. Not only does he enjoy the legitimacy of being Russia's first democratically elected president, but he has been driven into the radical reforms because of the failure of half-measures in the past. None the less, he will need all his political skills to outmanoeuvre his critics.</p>

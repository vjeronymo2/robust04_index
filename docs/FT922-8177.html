			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei resumes upward path on firm yen and bonds THE NIKKEI average resumed its upward trend, after Tuesday's brief interruption, as a sharp rise in the yen and a rally in the bond market prompted bargain hunting by domestic investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed 260.04 up at 18,768.57. Initially, arbitrage unwinding depressed the index to the day's low of 18,425.83, but the firm bond market later encouraged bargain hunting and index-related buying which pushed the Nikkei to the day's high of 18,803.79. Volume was down slightly to 380m shares from 392m. Mr Brian Tobin at SG Warburg Securities said most investors were 'cautiously optimistic' and activity was supported by small-lot domestic interest. Mr Tobin added that foreign investors remained on the buying side, picking up cheap blue chip issues. Advances outnumbered declines by 570 to 423, with 141 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 12.41 to 1,398.22, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 3.36 to 1,117.13. The yen gained strength on a testimony by Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury undersecretary, in which he expressed concern about the Japanese currency's weakness against the dollar. The yen rose Y2.30 against the dollar to close at Y130.30. Currency movements sparked active buying in interest rate-sensitive issues. Power utilities and shipbuilding shares firmed, with Tokyo Electric Power adding Y110 at Y2,890 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gaining Y5 to Y600. However, exporters lost ground. Hitachi fell Y11 to Y839 and Matsushita Electric Industrial retreated Y10 to Y1,390. Auto makers were also weak, with Toyota Motor down Y10 to Y1,480 and Honda Motor declining Y30 to Y1,530. Rumours that the development of an anti-Aids drug would be announced later this week lifted bio-technology issues. Okamoto Industries advanced Y130 to Y1,550 and Morinaga Milk appreciated Y17 to Y856. Oil refiners rose on the recovery in crude oil products on overseas commodity markets. Nippon Oil gained Y26 to Y726 and Showa Shell Sekiyu Y100 to Y1,380. Sanrio, the novelty maker, climbed Y80 to Y1,620. The company, which made extensive stock investments in the late 1980s, announced an upward revision of unrealised losses on its investment portfolio to Y21bn for the fiscal year ended this March. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 60.49 higher at 21,346.90 in volume of 27.2m shares. Traders with a short-term horizon sought pharmaceutical issues. Ono Pharmaceutical advanced Y180 to Y3,150. Roundup DOMESTIC politics and foreign buying gave most markets in the region a lift yesterday, but political jitters had the reverse effect in Thailand. HONG KONG accredited US buying and reform prospects in mainland China for its third consecutive record high. The Hang Seng index closed 52.02 stronger at 5,757.95 for a gain of 7.2 per cent so far this month. Turnover expanded from HKDollars 3.65bn to HKDollars 3.99bn. Blue chips dominated the active list. HSBC turnover exceeded HKDollars 300m as it moved up 50 cents to HKDollars 45, boosted by the recent visit to Hong Kong by Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, HSBC's takeover target. MANILA took heart from early election indications that senior presidential hopes Ms Miriam Defensor-Santiago and former defence secretary Mr Fidel Ramos were ahead in the polls. Closed on Monday and Tuesday for the elections, the exchange saw the composite index rise 93.02, or 7.5 per cent, to 1,328.04, almost in touch with its all-time high of 1,396 registered late in 1989. BANGKOK continued Tuesday's decline, reflecting further uncertainty over whether the government would accept a proposed constitutional amendment which would allow only an elected member of parliament to be prime minister. The SET index fell 23.36, or 3.01 per cent, to 731.27 in turnover of Bt3.43bn. Bangkok Bank lost Bt16 to Bt676 and Bangkok Land Bt8 to Bt145. SEOUL's high-capitalisation stocks retreated from their day's highs, but this still left the composite index 5.89 higher at 592.29 in turnover up from Won241bn to Won325bn. TAIWAN reported buying of small speculative-oriented shares as the weighted index rose 36.08 to 4,325.32 in TDollars 16.7bn turnover (TDollars 13.3bn). AUSTRALIA was lifted by industrials, and particularly media stocks after the recovery at News Corp. The All Ordinaries index put on 5.9, or 0.4 per cent, to 1,682.7, its highest for six months. News Corp moved ahead 68 cents to ADollars 22.40. John Fairfax gained 8 cents to ADollars 1.52 in high volume of 17.5m shares after last week's listing at an issue price of ADollars 1.20. NEW ZEALAND rose to a four-month high, helped by foreign buying centred on the forestry sector. The NZSE-40 index added 14.19 at 1,509.15. BOMBAY recovered after Tuesday's steep fall. The BSE index moved forward 344.76, or 11 per cent, to 3,431.13.</p>

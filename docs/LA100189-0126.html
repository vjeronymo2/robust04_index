			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LINDBERGH HORRORS  </P> <P> The brains have fallen out of Mr. Roberts' head. They must have landed next to  Mr. Filner's on the floor of a Boeing 747 on a collision course with the Laurel  Travel Center.  </P> <P> Their developer-buddy's multiairport proposal calling for four airports to be  maxed-out to capacity to handle our forecast air traffic needs (Lindbergh,  Brown, Palomar and Montgomery) is ludicrous. This is not a solution. It's  another way of keeping special-interest groups happy.  </P> <P> How stupid do they think we are?  </P> <P> Our two councilmen haven't even finished the year-old airport course at Sandag,  yet they've already flunked out.  </P> <P> JO ANN ZOLEZZI  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Rank hit as Thorn rides high Contrasting fortunes were visited on two of the leisure sector's largest stocks yesterday as dealers reported big switching out of Rank Organisation and into Thorn EMI. Rank shares underwent a weak session, coming off particularly sharply after lunchtime and ending a busy day 14 1/2 off at 402p. Turnover was 3.3m shares. It was announced after the market closed that Mr J. Garret, a director of the company, had sold more than 140,000 shares. Coincidentally, there was also talk in the market of a badly executed sell order. Meanwhile, investors were turning their attention to Thorn, spurred on by positive comments from Goldman Sachs, NatWest Securities, James Capel and Smith New Court. The shares rode high all day, finally coming to rest 23 ahead at 1058p after reasonable volume of 4m. Analysts cited reports of higher video and cassette tape prices in the European Union, the shares' recent underperformance - close on 10 per cent against the market in the past three months - and the first-quarter results due next week as some of the reasons for the strength in the shares. Thorn is also taking analysts on a trip to see its US operations at the end of the month, and there was some speculative buying ahead of what is expected to be an upbeat presentation from the music and rental group. Finally, the demerger story - suggesting that Thorn will float off its music business from the rental division - was again doing the rounds, a move long speculated on in the market and which, should it happen, would put a premium on Thorn shares.</p>

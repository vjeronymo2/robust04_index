			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Credit Lyonnais chief sees return to black in 1995 Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned French bank, will make a profit in 1995 after heavy losses in 1993 and 1994, chairman Mr Jean Peyrelevade told Europe 1 radio, writes John Ridding in Paris. 'The 1995 year will be better than 1994. Finally, we will manage to have positive results,' he said, without giving details. The state-owned bank has been implementing a significant restructuring programme aimed at curbing losses which totalled FFr6.9bn (Dollars 1.27bn) last year. The programme has included the sale of assets, including FNAC, the music and retail chain, and a stake in one of France's mobile telephone operators. Earlier this week, Credit Lyonnais announced that it had sold a 20 per cent stake in Adidas, the German sports equipment company, for an undisclosed sum. Prior to this sale, the bank said it had received almost FFr10bn from asset sales, about half of the target it set for 1994 and 1995. Credit Lyonnais is one of 21 companies slated for privatisation by the centre-right government of prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur. Industry observers say that a return to profit is a condition for privatisation, but that the government may move quickly to implement a sale once the bank has returned to the black and strengthened its balance sheet.</p>

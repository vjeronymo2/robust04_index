			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  (CPPCC) National Committee, met here today with Beni Bahadur  Karki, chairman of the upper house of Nepal's parliament, and  his party.    Li expressed thanks for his warm reception during his Nepal  visit at the end of last year.    He said that the two countries, as close neighbours and with  a long history of friendship, have neither old contradictions  nor new differences and therefore set a good example of  developing bilateral ties.    Li said that he was convinced that the current visit by  Karki  would promote the existing Sino-Nepalese friendly relations.    Karki shared Li's view that the bilateral relations were  good, without any differences. He said that he and his  colleagues were very pleased to have a chance to visit China.    China had made tremendous contribution to strengthening  Nepal-China friendly ties, he said.    Karki expressed his thanks for China's aid and support to  the  economic development of Nepal, and spoke highly of China's  economic achievements.    The Nepalese guests arrived in Lhasa on April 9 to begin a  ten- day visit to China at the invitation of the CPPCC National  Committee.</p>

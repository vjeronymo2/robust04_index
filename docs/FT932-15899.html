			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Barclays closes book on unhappy chapter: How the bank hopes to avoid the mistakes of the past THE short, unhappy life of the Barclays Bank division that let property lending get out of hand in the late 1980s is at least ending with a bang rather than a whimper. The bank will tell its managers today that the Central Advances Department is to disappear, along with the executive in charge. Mr Mark Deverell, whose misfortune was to be made director of risk management of Barclays in 1989 amid what turned out to be a catastrophic lending boom, is leaving the bank. His job has been abolished as Barclays reforms the way it assesses loan risks, and balances its portfolio. Mr Alan Brown, who takes the equivalent post in the new structure, does not mince words about the failure of the CAD, founded in the early 1980s. He says the lending following Barclays' Pounds 921m rights issue in 1988 was too much for managers who had to approve loans and monitor the portfolio. 'We undoubtedly feel that we were too aggressive in that period. That means you take on business at a speed which makes your executives so busy that they cannot be as thorough as they could be before.' He says the balance of loans was distorted towards property, construction and hotels because the 500 managers and staff under Mr Deverell were swamped: 'We had the classic business dilemma of choosing between things that are important and things that are urgent. The balance was wrong.' The effect can be seen by comparing Barclays' portfolio and provisions with those of National Westminster, the second largest UK bank by assets. The banks have lent in roughly the same proportions to most sectors, but Barclays has more exposure to property and construction. Barclays was always strong in property and construction. But the two sectors proved far more risky than in the past. Together, they accounted for only 11.9 per cent of its loan book last year. But 38 per cent of its Pounds 1.96bn provision against UK lending in the UK related to them. A second problem was over the approval and monitoring of individual loans. Each loan of more than Pounds 5m was approved by at least one executive in CAD, and monitored by the bank's risk management committee. This comprised senior directors and executives which reviewed bad debts and exposures. Mr Brown says that this committee - in spite of the emphasis placed on it in Barclays' annual report - met infrequently. 'They did not meet on individual loans unless there was a special reason. They passed the proposition around. The first person signed, and then the second, and so on.' So although Barclays in theory had a system of checks and balances to monitor loans, in practice the CAD was too busy to balance the portfolio well, and the risk committee hardly discussed individual loans. 'There was a danger that because the first person said yes, so did the others,' he says. Under Barclays' new structure - in place this month - there will be three changes. The first is that Mr Brown will head the new 'group credit policy unit' which will monitor exposures and balancing the portfolio. Mr Brown says this means there will be a smaller proportion of property lending, as well as shifts in country exposure, and the re-pricing of loans in some other lending areas. 'We have still got a big business here. We are not talking about dumping whole categories of customers, but of lightening the load in certain areas,' he says. He expects that over two years, the bank will be able to rebalance its portfolio to match a new computer model of credit risk it is developing. The model is expected to be applied to all but the smallest loans within a year. It rates risk according to factors such as industry sector, company size and history, and financial information. Barclays has drawn it up using data on large loans dating back six years in the UK. Mr Brown emphasises that he sees his task as rebalancing the portfolio rather than growing Barclays' balance sheet. 'It is patently obvious from our results that we could have lent the same amount of money, and if we had lost less of it, we would have a better net result,' he says. The second change is that the loan approval responsibility of the CAD will be broken up. Instead, there will be separate risk management departments within the banking and investment banking divisions. This is intended to give a greater sense of responsibility for loans to those who make them. All loans which would have had to be approved within the CAD previously will be allocated to a single 'responsible executive' within the line divisions. This executive - drawn from about 150 around the world - will have to follow each loan through to the end. 'There should be less chance of a line person saying 'It is my job to deliver as many propositions to you as possible, and the ones that go right will get me a bonus, and the ones that go wrong are down to you',' says Mr Brown. The third change is that the risk management committee is being scrapped and a 'group credit committee' put in its place. This will be chaired by Mr Humphrey Norrington, a vice-chairman of Barclays, and will meet daily to discuss individual exposures of above Pounds 150m. 'They are similar directors from the ones who signed the very largest credits before, but in order to get a more active discussion they will meet if necessary every day for a short period,' says Mr Brown. He says the bank wants to promote a debate about risks that was largely absent before. Will this new scrutiny leave a bank that just looks like all the rest? Mr Brown says it wants to remain distinctive, but its traditions will be under scrutiny. 'Where we are different, we will want to have asked ourselves why in a diligent, professional manner.'</p>

The data, obtained from the director of the Research  Institute for Agricultural Economics, Josef Kraus, resulted from  the institute's analysis and are preliminary.    Of the loss, 4.14 billion crowns was generated by state  farms  and 2.24 billion crowns by agricultural cooperatives. Private  farmers showed the best results: They showed a profit when  compensation for the work of the farmer and family members are  not included.    Businesses involved in agricultural primary production saw a  loss of 384 million crowns, while other agricultural companies,  such as school farms, ended up with 1.2 to 1.4 billion crowns in  aggregate losses.    Debts owed by the farms worsen the situation. They total  42.2 billion crowns, more than twice the amount of claims --  19.7 billion crowns.</p>

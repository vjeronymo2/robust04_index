			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York (DPA) -- On Friday [25 March] UN Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali expressed the hope that Germany will make a  greater contribution to the work of the United Nations. In a  talk with Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union group in the German  Bundestag, he was, however, very restrained regarding any  specific demands: Germany itself must decide what the greater  German involvement in the United Nations should be like.    The United Nations has many and great needs, Butrus-Ghali  said. Schaeuble pointed out that Germany has gone through  considerable learning processes regarding its new international  role since 1989 and has made considerable progress in this  respect.    Butrus-Ghali stressed that in the United Nations the issue  is  not at all just blue helmet soldiers and peacekeeping -- this  amounts to only 20 to 30 percent. More than half of the UN  activities and also of his own work refer to social problems in  the world, from environmental protection to development aid to  population issues, the secretary general stressed.    The critical financial situation of the United Nations  played  a considerable role. Schaeuble stressed his readiness to  advocate more intensively the interests of the international  organization. However, as a parliamentarian and as the leader of  the parliamentary majority, he can do this only if it is  possible to define clearly the work of the United Nations and to  make its success visible.    The financial means that were available for the Cold War,  Butrus-Ghali complained, are in no proportion to those that are  used to eliminate the relics of this period. Schaeuble assured  the secretary general that Germany will certainly not leave him  alone with his important task.    Before the talk with Butrus-Ghali Schaeuble had met with  Russian UN Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsev. Both expressed the hope  that the worst military conflicts in the former Yugoslavia are  now over. However, Vorontsev expressed the fear that the  negotiations about a peace settlement might take years. It has  been shown that the United Nations cannot force anyone to accept  a peaceful solution, Vorontsev said.</p>

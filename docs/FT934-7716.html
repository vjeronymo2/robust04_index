			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (1): Brisk activity on most fronts - Continuing recession is a dampening factor but a sharp upturn in its fortunes is persuading the sector that it still has a useful role to play in European finance SWITZERLAND'S international financial services sector is enjoying an unexpected and vigorous revival. It is not just the fact that the country's big universal and private banks are heading for bumper profits this year. Big banks and brokers everywhere have benefitted from buoyant securities and money markets in recent months. And it is not just the fact that the brisk inflow of foreign investment capital is continuing, although the decision by the Swiss a year ago to eschew closer ties with the European Union has undoubtedly helped refresh the country's image as an independent safe haven. More importantly, the financial scene has been energised by the recent removal of stifling restrictions on importing skilled professionals, the removal of some transaction taxes and improved education programmes. A new sense of optimism is emerging that Finanzplatz Schweiz can after all retain a useful and profitable role in European finance in the face of increasingly stiff competition from London and other large centres. While hundreds of clerical jobs are being lost as banks rationalise branch networks and streamline back office operations, many new high value ones are being created in the country's increasingly lively securities and derivatives markets. Indeed, activity is so brisk that the Zurich Stock Exchange, whose leaders were in a state of high anxiety two years ago over the burgeoning trade in big Swiss equities in London, is planning to open a seventh trading ring next February, either for Swiss bonds or for foreign equities. The derivatives markets, underdeveloped and flagging two years ago, have been helped by improved education programmes in Swiss universities and a more liberal government policy on granting work permits to highly skilled people. Last year, the authorities would allow Credit Suisse Financial Products to bring in only two experts from its London base. Now, banks can bring in whoever they need. 'Zurich is at the state of the art', says Mathis Cabiallavetta, Union Bank of Switzerland's director responsible for derivatives. 'We feel we can do anything here that could be done in New York or London, and we are regaining ground.' The one dampening element in this revival is that the Swiss economy is in a dreary state, having suffered three years of mild recession and some economists believe even a weak recovery is still some months away. Thus, while securities and international financial business are booming, the domestic commercial banking scene is in a dismal state. Three years of slumping property markets, sluggish sales for industrial companies and falling tourism activity have left banks with an unprecedented level of bad debts. The big universal banks can and will absorb record provisions for bad loans this year without breaking stride, but the smaller cantonal and regional banks are not so resilient and the trend to painful consolidation in these sectors continues. The number of regional banks, for example, has tumbled from 190 to 150 in the past two years, and Mr Roland Boeschenstein, deputy director of the Association of Regional Banks, says the process, which has slowed so far this year, is likely to accelerate again when bank directors take stock at year end. Ironically, the biggest single consolidation seen to date, the takeover by Credit Suisse of Swiss Volksbank early this year for SFr1.6bn, (Pounds 740m) appears to have intensified the competitive struggle, at least for the time being. At a stroke, this acquisition catapulted Credit Suisse from a weak third position in most domestic markets to a neck and neck battle with UBS for leadership. Both UBS and Swiss Bank Corporation - the latter now an embarrassed number three in most markets - have responded by stepping up their marketing efforts, undoubtedly in the hope of picking off disaffected customers from Credit Suisse or Volksbank. Others have had no choice but to follow. 'We thought that after everyone took a bath in the mortgage market in the past two years, a risk premium would appear this year, but no way,' says Mr Josef Ackermann, the new chief executive of Credit Suisse. One immediate consequence is that the big banks are, if anything, accelerating their cost-cutting programmes, including eliminating jobs. This has gone down badly with the general public. Many people cannot understand how the banks can be so insensitive at a time when they are making record profits and when unemployment is already soaring because of lay-offs by hard pressed industrial companies. But the banks, if slightly uncomfortable with this criticism, are unrepentant. 'It would be totally wrong to finance the weak, domestic side from our trading profits from elsewhere,' says Mr Ackermann. 'We would be heavily and rightly criticised three years from now if we did not act.' The private banks, too, are having a banner year. Most of these banks, which specialise in managing private fortunes and, to an increasing extent, institutional portfolios, are themselves private and do not publish their financial results. But Baer Holding, one of the largest, reported that its consolidated net income more than doubled in the first half to SFr71m, with the volume of clients' assets up 17 per cent to SFr38.7bn and trading income more than doubling to SFr114m. This sparkling performance has helped rebuild confidence that this sector, the heart of the Swiss financial centre, can remain internationally competitive. Estimates put the value of foreigners' funds in the country at more than SFr1,000bn, a third of all offshore investment. That may be a big drop in market share from the near monopoly that Swiss bankers had early in the century in this high margin field, but 'the miracle', says one private banker, 'is that we have held on to as much as we have'. 'Our market share is an advantage,' says Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel, chief executive of the eponymous private banking group in Zurich. 'It enables us to do things that someone starting from zero cannot do.' Mr Vontobel published a book two years ago expressing concern about the future of the Swiss financial centre, and in particular about the commitment of the big universal banks to it. At the time, the big banks seemed to be moving many activities - especially in the securities field - to London. Today, he confesses to having become 'rather optimistic'. He points in particular to the development of the national electronic stock exchange, due to be completed late next year after two false starts in the late 1980s. That development, with the removal of some transaction taxes and aggressive cost-cutting, makes operating in Switzerland look much more attractive. 'The big banks realise that we are now able to be low cost producers. London outmanoeuvred Switzerland and others in the 1980s, but it has its problems now. I cannot comment on the outcome of the war, but the next battle could go to the continent and to Switzerland,' Mr Vontobel says.</p>

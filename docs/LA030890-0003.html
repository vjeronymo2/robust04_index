			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: COUCH POTATOES SHOULD GET MOVING FOR BETTER HEALTH  </P> <P> Is moving off the sofa to fill the snack bowl during commercial breaks your  major form of exercise? If so, we can officially dub you a couch potato.  </P> <P> Maybe it doesn't bother you to be named after a tuberous vegetable and a piece  of furniture, but perhaps this will: Scientific research shows that you have a  good chance of dying sooner than your more active friends.  </P> <P> A depressing thought, yes? But don't stop there. Despite your current sedentary  habits, all is not lost. Results of an important new study in Dallas provide  evidence that even moving a little goes a long way toward protecting your  health.  </P> <P> This study differed significantly from earlier models. Instead of trying to  assess physical activity -- a difficult task to accomplish accurately,  especially where large groups of people are concerned -- it measured physical  fitness. Fitness, the product of both genetic makeup and physical activity, can  be tested easily by performance on a treadmill.  </P> <P> More than 10,000 men and 3,000 women, all healthy, participated. Besides the  treadmill test, each subject underwent a thorough medical evaluation and  provided detailed background information. After eight years, researchers were  able to account for an impressive 95% of the original group. Of those, 283 (240  men and 43 women) had died.  </P> <P> To probe the connection between death and physical fitness, subjects were  grouped into five fitness levels. Naturally, more deaths (primarily from  cardiovascular disease and cancer) occur among older subjects, but this was  handled by dividing subjects according to age: 20 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 59,  and 60 years or older.  </P> <P> When this is done, risk of death among those who are least active is revealed  as more than triple that of the most active men. Among least active women, the  risk is more than 4.5 times as great. For older individuals, the difference in  death rates is still more pronounced. These relationships hold true even after  factors like blood cholesterol level, blood pressure, smoking, blood sugar  levels and family history are accounted for.  </P> <P> A closer look at the data shows something rather surprising: The greatest  difference in risk occurs between people classified as least physically fit and  the next 20% of subjects. In other words, if you can move just one rung up the  fitness ladder, you'll be able to make real progress in improving your  prospects for continued good health.  </P> <P> So if you're starting at the bottom and you have nowhere to go but up, the next  question is: How do you make it to that crucial next level? Based on their  data, the researchers estimate that as little as a brisk walk of 30 to 60  minutes a day is all that's needed. In other words, you don't have to undergo a  personality change and turn into a aerobic or jogging fanatic to boost your  health odds. You must merely become a pedestrian instead of a lounger. And if  all unfit persons became fit, the death rate among men would fall an estimated  9% and among women, over 15%.  </P> <P> With this incentive, you'd think more Americans would get the message. Sadly,  fewer than 10% of us over age 18 meet exercise goals set by the Public Health  Service as Health Objectives for 1990. Nearly one in three is estimated to be  sedentary.  </P> <P> For the year 2000, the Public Health Service would like to see at least 30% of  everyone six and older exercise vigorously enough to develop and maintain  cardiorespiratory fitness three or more days a week for 20 minutes each. That  seems a modest objective, and one with a major health payoff.  </P> <P> But will we attain it? Experts at the Centers for Disease Control suggest we'll  have a better chance of doing so if we beef up health-education programs in  schools, from kindergarten through high school, and provide children with the  motivation, knowledge and skills to lead a physically active life. They also  believe that physicians should take more initiative in promoting physical  activity, prescribing it as a specific component of treatment for their  patients, and in leading community drives to upgrade programs in our schools.  </P> <P> Physicians can, indeed, play a special role. But working to make America a  physically fit nation again is a goal for us all. So couch potatoes of the  world, arise. You can join in, starting today.  </P> <P> All you need to do is put on some comfortable clothing and sturdy shoes -- and  get up off that sofa. It will still be there after you come back from a  vigorous, health-giving walk.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FDA Considers Aspartame Safe, but Sets Acceptable Daily Intake  </P> <P> Question: I know aspartame is considered a safe artificial sweetener, but are  there any guidelines defining acceptable intake?  </P> <P> Answer: Yes, and the margin of safety is extremely large. Based on available  evidence, the Food and Drug Administration has established an acceptable daily  intake (ADI) at just 1% of that which has been shown in animals and humans to  have no toxic effect. The individual estimate is based on body weight.  </P> <P> In a man weighing about 155 pounds, it translates to the amount you'd get in  seventeen 12-ounce cans of soda artificially sweetened with aspartame. Studies  show this is well above the daily level usually consumed.  </P> <P> Q: A few years ago the subject of bulimia was constantly splashed across the  cover of women's magazines. Lately I haven't seen anything about it. Has the  problem subsided?  </P> <P> A: At least one survey has suggested that the behaviors associated with bulimia  may be on the decline. Researchers sound a note of caution, however, that  bingeing and purging could be replaced by excessive exercise among those who  are particularly dissatisfied with their bodies.  </P> <P> When bulimia first emerged as a popular topic, original estimates of its  prevalence may have been too high, since the criteria used to define it were  overly broad. For instance, sometimes it was the existence -- but not the  frequency -- of bingeing and purging that was measured.  </P> <P> Seeking to discover whether these behaviors were on the decline, Craig Johnson,  Ph.D., and his colleagues from Northwestern University repeated a survey  conducted five years earlier with over 1,200 female high-school students. The  second group included nearly 1,100.  </P> <P> Good news first. In 1981, researchers found that 4.1% of the women met criteria  for bulimia (and these criteria were somewhat broader than revised standards  now used). In 1986, that figure had dropped to 2%. Significantly fewer students  binged, used diet pills or reported that there were times when they couldn't  stop eating.  </P> <P> Concern about weight and the need to go on a diet had fallen as well. Fewer of  the students believed they were overweight, or that their family and friends  thought they were overweight. Fewer were on a diet and they felt less pressure  from family and friends to start one. Scores on a psychological test that  measures drive for thinness dropped too. This is all to the good.  </P> <P> Now, the worrisome side. Scores on another psychological test that measures  body dissatisfaction did not change. Dissatisfaction correlates with low  self-esteem and personal ineffectiveness.  </P> <P> The researchers suggest that some young women will seek other solutions to  counter their perceptions, and that exercise in the "pursuit of strength" will  produce a set of side effects related to exercise abuse. Obviously, those who  are most vulnerable will exhibit the most severe symptoms. Whether the  researchers' prediction is correct, or whether interventions to alter their  prophecy can be developed, remains to be seen.  </P> <P> Q: Is fiber useful to individuals with irritable bowel syndrome?  </P> <P> A: The jury's still out. Studies addressing the question have reached different  conclusions, due both to problems in study design and to the variable nature of  symptoms described as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  </P> <P> One recent study is of particular interest. The investigators, from McMaster  University Medical Center in Ontario, Canada, used the so-called double-blind  crossover. In this approach, neither investigators nor subjects know whether  the fiber supplement or a placebo is being used, and all subjects are given  supplements part of the time and a placebo for the rest of the time. This trial  was extended over seven months, allowing time to examine longer term changes in  symptoms.  </P> <P> Over a six-month period, subjects were given four cookies daily, containing  either corn fiber or a placebo for 12 weeks at a time. Each trial was separated  from the next by a "washout" period to allow any effects to erode. Subjects  were asked to score symptoms on a questionnaire as they entered the trial and  at four-week intervals thereafter. Pressure measurements to assess changes in  motility were also taken.  </P> <P> Curiously, several problems, including pain severity, frequency and consistency  of bowel movements, and other abdominal symptoms improved over time both with  corn fiber and the placebo. Pain in the lower left side was the most frequent  symptom reported. And in this study, the "placebo effect" (the likelihood of  reduced symptoms during periods when the cookies contained no bran) was  greatest for pain.  </P> <P> But the reduction in symptoms tended to erode over time. A drop in colon  pressure with fiber intake did occur, but not to a significant degree. Perhaps  one reason for the failure to demonstrate benefit is that fiber would be more  effective in relieving constipation. However, only one-third of the subjects  reported bowel movements less than twice a week.  </P> <P> This was a small study. Only nine patients completed the entire trial, which  lasted seven months. More research is needed to answer your question.  </P> <P> Q: Recently a friend brought me a fruit called a pear-apple and I really  enjoyed it. They are quite expensive and so will be only an occasional special  treat, but I would like to know more about them. Are they a hybrid between a  pear and an apple?  </P> <P> A: No. While both their shape and color suggest they are relatives of golden  delicious apples, botanically they are pears. Tottori, or 20th-Century Pears as  they are called, were discovered growing wild on the northern coast of Western  Japan at the turn of the century, and have since been cultivated. One feature  of the King of Japanese Pears, as they are also sometimes called, is the  painstaking care they receive as they grow. Blossoms are hand pollinated, and  once the fruit begins to mature they are wrapped in wax-treated bags to protect  them against insects and disease.  </P> <P> Pears, to varying degrees, have a texture perhaps best described as a little  gritty. It is contributed by lignin, a so-called "nonpolysaccharide" component  of fiber. Tottori have a mild, aromatic pear flavor and, like other Oriental  pears, a more-pronounced gritty texture than some varieties with which we are  more familiar. A 3 1/2 ounce serving of pear-apple provides about 40 calories,  but most of the fruits weigh considerably more than that.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, Italian Northern League </F> lower house floor leader, by "r.u."; place and date not given:  "Maroni: `Berlusconi and Italian Social Movement? A Minor  Agreement...'"]    [Text] Rome -- [LA REPUBBLICA] Mr. Maroni, did you know  that there are now rumors of a secret meeting between [League  Secretary] Bossi, [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, and  [National Alliance leader] Fini?    [Maroni] That is quite ridiculous. You will never see any  such meeting; we will never sit down at the same table as Fini.    [LA REPUBBLICA] But Berlusconi, your great ally, has just  signed an agreement with the Italian Social Movement [MSI].    [Maroni] It is not a political agreement nor an agreement on  policy. It is merely an agreement to defeat the left in central  and southern Italy. As far as we are concerned, they are still  fascists; we will sweep them away.    [LA REPUBBLICA] But this "triangle" has every appearance of  a  political calculation: If Bossi allies with Berlusconi and  Berlusconi allies with Fini, Bossi is allying with Fini.    [Maroni] That would threaten to split Italy, with the north  going to the League and the south to the National Alliance, with  Berlusconi acting as a link. In any case, how could we ally  with a party that is waging war on us?    [LA REPUBBLICA] What are you referring to?    [Maroni] Fini will field his own candidates in all the  constituencies of the north, which means against the League.    [LA REPUBBLICA] The MSI's strength in those areas does not  appear to be unstoppable.    [Maroni] They will field Servello in Milan, and in any case,  even if they were to field Almirante--brought back to  life--those lists are stacked against us, irrespective of the  names on them. But in this election we will have great pleasure  in proclaiming the death of the DC [Christian Democratic Party]  and the MSI.    [LA REPUBBLICA] The end of [Italian Popular Party Secretary]  Martinazzoli's party?    [Maroni] Of course. They will not win a single seat in the  north, at most two or three seats in the Senate as a result of  the fragmentation of the vote. From the proportional quota,  they will not gain the minimum 4 percent. Martinazzoli's idea  is suicidal.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Will you too not pay a high price for the  MSI's "support."    [Maroni] I repeat: We have nothing to share with them. Fini  and his men will not be part of the single liberal-democratic  parliamentary group. There will be deputies elected from the  League, those of Forza Italia, and also those of the CCD  [Democratic Christian Center] and the UDS [Union of Democratic  Socialists].    [LA REPUBBLICA] But Fini and Berlusconi will be standing  together in central and southern Italy.    [Maroni] The National Alliance deputies will form a group on  their own, while those of Forza Italia will join our  parliamentary group. Berlusconi has a agreement covering policy  and government with us, and with Fini only an electoral  understanding.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Do Berlusconi and, above all, Fini see it  this way?    [Maroni) Fini himself has said so, stressing that it is not  an alliance on policy with Forza Italia. So everything is  clear. We want to govern.    [LA REPUBBLICA] With whose votes?    [Maroni] In the 360 constituencies of the north we will win  a  minimum of 250 seats and a maximum of 300.    [LA REPUBBLICA] How will you share candidates with  Berlusconi?    [Maroni] On the basis of specific responsibilities with  regard to work in parliament. To be specific, there are 360  constituencies and 13 parliamentary committees; dividing one by  the other, we will identify 27 individuals appropriate to each  committee. What will happen in the case of the Justice  Committee, for instance? Well, we will choose as our candidates  27 lawyers or attorneys.</p>

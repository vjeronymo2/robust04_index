			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Ocean joins European white goods alliance A FRENCH-inspired project to create a European alliance of domestic appliances makers to compete against the growing concentration of power in the white goods industry yesterday received its finishing touch. Ocean, the last remaining independent Italian maker of home appliances, with annual sales of FFr3.2bn (Dollars 603m) mainly in refrigerators, washing machines and cooking equipment, became the fourth member of a group started two years ago by French-state owned Thomson Electromenager and Fagor, the leading Spanish white goods group. The other member, which joined last June, is General Domestic Appliances, the Anglo-American group jointly owned by GEC of Britain and General Electric of the US. The four partners have a combined turnover of FFr16.7bn, of which the largest slice, FFr6bn comes from profitable Thomson Electromenager. They have a combined 19.3 per cent share of the European market, second after Electrolux-AEG, the German-Swedish combine, with 24.5 per cent. This is the latest step in the trend for white goods producers to join forces in various forms. It follows the 1988 acquisition of Philips' domestic appliances businesses by Whirlpool of the US, and last June's joint production and development deal between Electrolux and AEG. The French-led alliance, which was called Temfa until being renamed Eurodom yesterday, exists to allow its members to seek economies of scale in what is a high volume, low-margin business. They will pool their combined FFr9bn per year purchases of components to obtain lower prices, share some research and development, exchange information about each others' markets and exchange products on an OEM basis. The original members had already seen an improvement in domestic market share, said Mr Henri Lagarde, chairman of Thomson Electromenager. This means that Thomson Electromenager, for example, will be able to sell Fagor or Ocean-made refrigerators, which are typically larger than French ones, under its own label in Spain and Italy, according to an official at the French group. Fagor or Ocean will by the same token be able to sell Thomson-made washing machines, as designed for the French market, under their own labels. Eurodom is set up as a so-called European economic interest grouping, a simplified structure allowed by European Community law for cross-frontier alliances. They do not, for the time being, plan to exchange equity stakes in each other, though Mr Lagarde said this would be 'desirable'.</p>

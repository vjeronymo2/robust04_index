			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Marisa Chimprapha] </F>   [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday  welcomed a report that Australia is likely to turn down a  request by Cambodia for weapons, saying that Thailand's position  on the issue has been seriously taken into consideration.    Surin said, however, that Australia and other countries  considering the request from Cambodia had taken their own  positions into account when deciding on the arms request.    The minister was referring to a report that Canberra  preferred to implement the promise to provide about US$2.2  million for mine clearing and training with a separate programme  for civil servants.    "Any additional assistance that we provide is likely to be  focused on the area of training and institutional support,"  Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evens was quoted as  saying.    Cambodia has sought military aid from several countries,  including the U.S. and France to fight against the guerrillas.  The request for the weapons coincided with the failed roundtable  talks hosted by King Norodom Sihanouk in North Korea last month.    Surin said stressed that the Thai position on Cambodia's  request to three western countries to provide weapons for the  Cambodian government to fight the Khmer Rouge is based on its  sincere and honest desire to see lasting peace in Cambodia.    "Thailand's position on the issue is not to interfere in the  internal affairs of Cambodia. We want to deny that. Our country  and ASEAN have long participated in helping to solve the  Cambodian conflict, we have the right to state our position,"  Surin said.    Bangkok opposed the request on the grounds that more weapons  would prolong the fighting and the ill-disciplined and unpaid  Cambodian government troops may sell the weapons to others, even  the Khmer Rouge. Surin had earlier said that military aid should  focus on a training programme for civil servants.    Cambodia's First Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh,  had criticized those who opposed the request for weapons as  interference in Cambodia's internal conflict.    "I am glad that Thai position on the issue was taken into  consideration," Surin said.    According to Surin, the Australian Foreign Ministry's  Permanent Secretary, Michael Costello, had explored the Thai  position on the issue with Surin during a recent meeting.    "The western countries are well aware that Thailand and  other  ASEAN countries have taken part in solving the Cambodian  conflict. Therefore they explored the idea and I explained the  Thai position when asked," Surin said.    The U.S. and France have also sought Thai opinion on the  issue, which has already been conveyed through the Thai  embassies in the two countries.    Meanwhile, an informed source said yesterday that Son Sann,  leader of Cambodia's Khmer People's National Liberal Front,  during talks with Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri last month  also voiced opposition to the request, saying that the supply of  weapons would prolong the fighting.    He added that Cambodia also forwarded the request to Canada  and Japan.    A Cambodian party, the Khmer Neutral Party, has appealed to  the international community to stop military aid to Cambodia to  end suffering, but instead provide it with financial aid to  implement economic development.    The party's chairman, Buo Hel, said in a statement dated May  23 that to overcome "this terrible reality" the Cambodian  conflict must not be solved by military aid from foreign  countries but by a political solution through the participation  of all Cambodian parties at a roundtable conference.    "On behalf of Khmer Neutral Party I would like to make an  appeal to the international community to cease military aid. To  solve the problem, all factions concerned should hand full power  to His Majesty the King Norodom Sihanouk, to decide the future  of the country," said Buo Hel.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Murray Split beats benchmark Murray Split Capital Trust yesterday announced net assets ahead 45 per cent to Pounds 24.1m over the 12 months to August 31: the FT-A All-Share Index, the trust's benchmark, rose 40 per cent over the same period. The trust's total return of 53.7 per cent compared with a total return of 46 per cent for the All-Share. Net asset value per capital share jumped from 94.6p to 214.9p over the year. Available revenue amounted to Pounds 823,000, down from Pounds 1.03m in the previous 65 week period, leaving earnings per income share at 10.29p (12.83p). A proposed final dividend of 2.65p brings the total, as forecast, to 10.6p (11.6p for 65 weeks), necessitating a transfer of Pounds 98,000 from reserves. Directors intend to maintain the total in the current year.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> THIS TIME, THE HEAVENS DO NORMAN A FAVOR  </P> <P> Greg Norman finally found an ally in pursuit of a victory -- the rain.  </P> <P> Norman, who lost two titles this year when opponents made dramatic shots on the  final hole, was declared the winner of the $1-million Memorial tournament  Sunday when heavy rains at Dublin, Ohio, washed away the final round.  </P> <P> Norman, stunned by his good fortune, had inherited the third-round lead after  Fred Couples double-bogeyed No. 18 Saturday.  </P> <P> "I've never had this happen to me before," said Norman, who finished with a  three-round total of even-par 216. "I really don't know what to say or what to  feel. Nobody likes to win like this."  </P> <P> But Norman will take it. On March 25, Robert Gamez holed a 176-yard shot for  eagle-two on No. 18 to beat Norman at Orlando, Fla. On April 29, David Frost  sank a 50-foot bunker shot for birdie on the final hole to beat Norman by a  shot at New Orleans.  </P> <P> Norman, who won $180,000, called the victory "a good break," but added it did  nothing to ease the sting of those losses.  </P> <P> "I don't think about that," Norman said. "There's nothing you can do about  that. It's passed. It's history. If I thought about it, I'd probably be in a  funny farm by now."  </P> <P> Payne Stewart finished second at 217 a week after winning the Byron Nelson  Classic the same way Norman won Sunday -- by rainout. Mark Brooks, Brad Faxon,  Don Pooley and Couples tied for third at 218.  </P> <P> Norman's victory at Jack Nicklaus' Muirfield Village Golf Club course enabled  him to join Stewart and Gamez as the only two-time winners on the tour this  year.  </P> <P> Norman didn't know he had won until Stewart offered congratulations. "Give me  some skin," Stewart said to Norman on the practice range just after the final  round was canceled.  </P> <P> If it was up to Nicklaus, however, the final round would be played today. But  because of various considerations, it was canceled.  </P> <P> "It's the Tour's policy not to go beyond Monday," said Nicklaus, the  tournament's founder, host and the course designer. "I think that was their  decision; it was not our decision."  </P> <P> Dottie Mochrie shot a four-under-par 68 to win a $350,000 women's tournament at  Chesapeake, Va., by nine shots, the second most-lopsided margin of victory in a  54-hole LPGA event.  </P> <P> Mochrie, who won $52,000, completed three rounds in 200, 16 under par.  </P> <P> Chris Johnson wound up at 209 after a closing-round 69 and Meg Mallon's 68 left  her at 210.  </P> <P> Mochrie played the front nine in three-under 33, moving her to 15 under and  giving her a nine-shot lead over Johnson. No one else was within 10 shots of  the leader.  </P> <P> The only questions left for Mochrie after she made the turn were whether she  could match the tour's scoring and margin-of-victory records for 54 holes.  </P> <P> Mochrie needed another three-under 33 on the back nine to equal the scoring  mark of 198 set by Jan Stephenson in a 1981 tournament. Stephenson set the  winning-margin record of 11 shots in the same event.  </P> <P> Jimmy Powell, who has struggled most of the year, shot a seven-under-par 65 to  move past several players and win a $350,000 Senior PGA tournament at Oklahoma  City by three strokes.  </P> <P> Powell's bogey-free round gave him his first PGA Senior Tour victory in six  years on the tour -- he also was a non-winner on the regular PGA tour.  </P> <P> The 65 tied the tournament record set by Chi Chi Rodriguez when he won the 1987  title.  </P> <P> Powell's eight-under 208 total for 54 holes was three better than Mike Hill,  second-round leader Terry Dill, Jim Dent and Rives McBee.  </P> <P> Powell's best previous finish this year was a ninth-place tie, last week at Las  Vegas. That also was the first time in nine starts he had even shot a sub-par  round.  </P></p>

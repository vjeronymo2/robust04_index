			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / People: Old hands at James Fisher's helm James Fisher, which controls one of Britain's biggest short-sea shipping fleets, has brought a couple of the shipping industry's elder statesmen out of lay-up to help guide it through current harsh trading conditions. Sir David Hardy, 62, a former finance director of Ocean Transport, and Sir David Thomson, 53, a former joint managing director of the family-owned Ben Line, have been appointed non-executive directors of James Fisher and Sons. The Cumbria-based group, which is still controlled by descendants of the founding families, has a fleet of around 30 ships and has port operations in Newhaven, Heysham, Barrow and Whitehaven. In addition to its own fleet the firm manages another 30 vessels, including the British Nuclear Fuels fleet, and has a reputation for running safe and dependable ships. However, this expertise has not insulated it from the downturn in the industry and its pre-tax profits have fallen from Pounds 4.3m in 1989 to Pounds 1.5m in 1992. Last year it cut its dividend. John Hornby, Fisher's chairman and managing director, says that he had wanted directors who had shipping experience but did not work for the competition. 'We are at the specialist end of a very small industry,' says Mr Hornby, who doesn't believe that non-execs drawn from the general business world would be much help. Sir David Hardy, who sits on the board of Hanson and numerous other companies, resigned from Ocean Transport more than a decade ago, and Sir David Thomson quit Ben Line in 1989 after 28 years with the company. The latter's appointment is particularly appropriate since he is understood to have left Ben Line after a disagreement over the future direction of what used to be one of the great names of the British shipping industry. Since he left, Ben Line has withdrawn from mainline shipping. Meanwhile his brother, William Thomson, also left Ben Line and is now running Edinburgh Tankers. Three Fisher directors - Mike Shields, Mike Tyrell and Terry Blyth - are stepping down from the board but will remain as executive directors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gabonese Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba by </F> Africa No. 1 reporters Christian Dounou de Louamiy and Jean  Valere Mbinamanza; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Oye-Mba] A survey has shown that Gabon does not  expect to gain from a devaluation of the CFA franc because the  purpose of a devaluation is to increase the competitiveness of  an economy. It implies that prices of the country's products --  agricultural and industrial products which are exported and  services -- will decrease, thus enabling one to sell more  abroad. However, in Gabon's case, the country depends mainly on  oil, timber, manganese, and uranium today. The devaluation of  the CFA franc would not enable us to sell more oil or timber.  The price of oil has decreased because there is a current glut  in the international markets. There is overproduction of oil  and OPEC's major debate is, precisely, on trying to regulate  production to prevent oversupply. Therefore, based on the  analysis of the structure of our country's economy, I can affirm  that Gabon does not expect to gain from the devaluation of the  CFA franc.    Now coming back to your question, the problem of price  control is effectively a central one in the manipulation of  exchange rates. There is a great risk of inflation. Why?  Because the consequence of the devaluation of a currency is  that all imported products automatically become more expensive  in proportion to the devaluation, of course. It also means that  human beings being what they are, each of us individually and,  collectively -- groups, societies, nations -- each one will  leave no stones unturned to restore the predevaluation situation  in order to gain, as it were, what it would have been lost in  the devaluation. All these phenomena create a spiralling price  increase that must be controlled. If it is not controlled, the  possible benefits of the devaluation will be annulled. The  success or failure of any decision to manipulate the exchange  rate in a country hinges on this price control.    [De Louamiy] I will go deeper into the question, Mr. Prime  Minister. In a context of devaluation, the state, of course,  finds itself in a situation where it has less income because  exports remain at about the same level for certain countries  like Gabon and are no longer able to fetch as much money as  before. At the same time, the prices of imported goods remain  at the same level. Since the state no longer has the full  capacity to subsidize the prices of essential commodities, will  we not end up in a situation where the purchasing power of  citizens will be decreased?    [Oye-Mba] Of course. Effectively, the risk of a devaluation  is that the purchasing power of the people decreases because the  value of the currency they use in acquiring goods reduces after  devaluation. Besides, the state no longer has the same  possibility to subsidize the prices of goods both for equipment  or consumption. It is more difficult to do so, therefore,  effectively, the consequence is the risk of decreased purchasing  power which it is appropriate for one to examine. It is a  question of making the right decisions for things to continue to  move on even better than before the devaluation. I would say it  is a whole alchemy; it is an art, it is an art.    [Mbinamanza] Has the Gabonese Government thought about these  compensatory measures?    [Oye-Mba] Well, I am telling you that in the meantime, we  consider that there should be no devaluation. There should not  be any devaluation because Gabon will not benefit from any  devaluation. Nevertheless, we are aware that our country is in  an extremely difficult economic and financial situation. I have  never hidden this from the Gabonese. We intend to pursue the  policy that we have started, that of controlling the [words  indistinct] of our country, notably the [word indistinct] of the  state in the strict sense of the word.

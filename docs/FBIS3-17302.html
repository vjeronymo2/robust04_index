Speaking at a news briefing in Moscow on Thursday, Churkin  expressed regret that the sides could not reach an agreement on  cease-fire and the withdrawal of troops from the front line due  to objective reasons. At the same time, he said that the  meeting has confirmed the existence of an entirely new "format  of mediatory activity." Russian, U.S., EU and UN mediators who  took part in the talks acted jointly. This allowed them to  influence the sides' behaviour in a constructive way and help  the sides find common positions at the most critical stages of  the negotiation process.    The Zagreb talks have confirmed the correctness of the  chosen  priorities in reaching a final settlement of the Yugoslav  conflict. Mediators believe that ceasefire agreements are a top  priority. The next step would be normalisation of economic ties  between Croatia and "districts with the capital in Knin." This  will create favourable conditions for determining the political  status of these districts, he said.    Disagreements in relations between Zagreb and the "Serb  capital in Knin" are fraught with a situation in which "any  prospects of settlement in the former Yugoslavia will be  buried," the diplomat said. He said the mediators will use the  remaining time before the next round of talks scheduled for 29  March to try to bring the warring sides to the realisation of  the need to find constructive approaches, he said.</p>

[passage omitted]    Sr. Gen. Than Shwe noted that this 1993 third four-monthly  coordination meeting is an important one and it is time to  review 1993 and to draw plans for the first four months of 1994.  He expressed the need to review the achievements truthfully  when presenting reports. Successes and failures should be  presented realistically. Continuing, he explained that if  success is not yet realized, new correct methods should be  implemented to achieve it. If honest presentations are not made  there will be many errors in the activities and this will hinder  the progress of the country.    He then noted that in this present era there are many  development works according to the areas and regions. He said  there are three classifications -- work activities purely on a  self-help basis, work activities jointly on a self-help basis  with government support, and government funded activities  jointly with regional support. He remarked that in implementing  regional development activities one could not rely on the  government for everything and they should not be neglected by  the central organizations also. He then explained since  regional authorities have been delegated with the power to act,  they should choose their priorities in implementing development  projects. Basically, it must be on a self-help basis. If it is  not feasible, then government support should be acquired. He  reminded that after taking the responsibilities of the state  according to historical changes, work should be carried out with  determination and commitment for the benefit of the country and  the people. He explained that this opportunity should not be  utilized for personal gain, but to work with the intent to  benefit the country.    He stressed that after a long time activities tend to become  routine and responsible personnel need to adopt an active and  alert motivation to work for the betterment of the state.  Finally, Than Shwe reminded responsible personnel not to be  satisfied with the achievements but to work for the better in  1994 based on past successes and failures. [passage omitted]</p>

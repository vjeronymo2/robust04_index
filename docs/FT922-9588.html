			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Profits warning hits Andrews Sykes SHARES IN Andrews Sykes fell from 160p to 140p after the plant hire company warned that profits in the year to March 31 would be significantly below the level previously anticipated. In the previous year, the company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.32m on turnover of Pounds 62.6m. The board said that although it was disappointed by the fall in hire demand, it intended to recommend a maintained final dividend of 3p when its annual results are announced on May 26. Strong cash flow had reduced group borrowings by Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 14.5m, cutting gearing from 110 to 90 per cent.</p>

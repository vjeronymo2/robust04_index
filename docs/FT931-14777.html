			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Inflation at 23-year low in Israel ISRAEL achieved single-digit inflation for the first time in 23 years in 1992, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported yesterday. The Consumer Price Index rose 9.4 per cent last year, down from 18 per cent in 1991. The key factors behind the sharp drop were a significant slowdown in housing price increases, due to sluggish demand in the market, and relatively low wage increases in most sectors owing to high unemployment. Since 1985, when the government implemented an emergency economic stabilisation programme to combat hyperinflation, the annual increase in the CPI had stabilised at around 18 per cent. The inflation figure was welcomed by treasury and central bank officials, who said it had not interfered with the country's other main economic target of higher growth. Israel's GNP rose by over 6 per cent in 1992, according to preliminary forecasts. Mr Dov Lautman, President of the Israel Manufacturers' Association, hinted that the government should take advantage of low inflation to allow a further devaluation of the shekel, to improve export profitability.' It's now possible to exploit this situation of single-digit inflation, combined with high unemployment, to initiate a more energetic policy of growth without fearing a resurgence of inflation.' Housing prices rose only 5.4 per cent last year. The reason for the sharp drop was the slowdown in the number of immigrants arriving in the country from the former Soviet Union.</p>

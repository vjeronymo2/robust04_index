			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (21): Freight forwarders make a smart mov - EDI Is vital for securing the industry's future THERE is no future for the freight forwarding industry without electronic data interchange (EDI). So says Mr Jim White, director-general of the British International Freight Association (BIFA), which in February set up a company to run an EDI service not only for its member-companies but also for those companies' customers, couriers and hauliers. For Pounds 400, companies can join a service which automates the production and transmission of documents between the sender, the freight forwarder, carriers and recipients and also sends the required information to HM Customs, writes John Kavanagh. 'Without EDI, a trader typically creates a despatch document on its computer and sends it by fax or post to its freight forwarder,' says Mr White. 'The forwarder then produces its own documents for one or more carriers, which in turn create further documents of their own.' 'With EDI, the trader sends the despatch instructions to the freight forwarder through the EDI system. The forwarder just adds a line or two of instructions and sends the information on through the system to the carriers. He can also send a note by EDI to the recipient. 'In addition, BIFA has become the first organisation to send the required statistical information to Customs and Excise using the X4 00 message standard.' He adds: 'The beauty is that everything is based on the original EDI document from the trader. There is no re-keying of the same information at every stage in the chain.' EDI in the freight forwarding business has been led by BIFA, initially to protect the very survival of its member-companies - 'traders are looking for high-quality services and, especially, at extending the just-in-time techniques they have adopted in manufacturing to their freight operations,' he says. 'This means the freight forwarding business has had to become more sophisticated. Without EDI there is no future for our industry, because if we're not in the EDI chain, traders could cut us out and talk directly to the carriers.' Instead, BIFA has taken the initiative by setting up Bifanet, a company which runs an EDI service for communication of instructions and other information from one end of the despatch and delivery chain to the other. Bifanet's trump card is its Pounds 400 fee, a rock-bottom bargain rate for joining the service. The Pounds 400 also covers an EDI software package and use of electronic mail and bulletin board systems as well as EDI. The benefit of the low fee is that it is already attracting the freight forwarding companies' customers and haulage firms to the network. Companies used to paying several thousand pounds for EDI links to their customers and raw materials suppliers are happy to pay Pounds 400 for a service which makes for more efficient national and international shipping. The software package was introduced six months a go and already more than 200 companies and haulage firms have signed up, in addition to 50 freight forwarders. Another 40 BIFA members are now being connected. FREIGHT forwarders have been inhibited from joining EDI services because of the high entry costs, Jim White says - 'half the BIFA members have 10 staff or less. We are offering them a low-cost entry with a simple software package which runs on a personal computer.' The success of the EDI initiative has led to the formation of Bifanet. 'The growth has put a strain on BIFA resources, so we are setting up Bifanet as a company dedicated to the EDI service,' he says. BIFA has put up Pounds 50,000 to get the company started and it is looking for share subscriptions totalling Pounds 800,000 from its members. Bifanet is being built around Emelco, a small software company which developed the EDI software. It is starting with eight people and expects to grow to 16 staff within two years. Bifanet will maintain and develop the software package, provide EDI consultancy and training - and market the package world-wide. 'The UK is a year ahead of other countries on EDI in this field,' Mr White says. 'Our software is based on the Edifact international standard for EDI messages. Our network supplier, GEIS, has a world-wide operation and recently signed an agreement with the international freight forwarders federation, FIATA, to promote EDI. The UK is therefore well placed to be the world leader: indeed, five other countries are already looking at what we are doing and are evaluating the software.' Bifanet is able to keep the price of EDI so low because it is running the service for subscribers, rather than the network company, GEIS. Bifanet negotiated special rates by taking on all the billing and support for the service. GEIS sends Bifanet one detailed invoice - by EDI, naturally - and Bifanet produces individual invoices for all the subscribers. Mr White says GEIS was chosen because it had an established worldwide EDI and electronic mail network and was already involved with the freight industry. Subscribers can also use the GEIS electronic mail and bulletin board services - 'electronic mail is a painless way into EDI for very small companies,' says Mr White. 'They can get going immediately and graduate to EDI when they are confident. After all, electronic mail simply replaces the fax and the phone, whereas EDI can change the very way you do business.' The bulletin board system is in effect an extension of electronic mail, allowing users to leave messages for anyone who cares to link in. BIFA and Bifanet will use it to broadcast details of training courses, information on the single European market and so on. Mr White suggests individual freight forwarders could set up private bulletin boards for their customers. But the prime aim of Bifanet is to make trade more efficient - 'there is estimated to be Pounds 50bn of freight sitting in warehouses worldwide,' he says. 'EDI can make a big impact on that inventory.'</p>

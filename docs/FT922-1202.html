			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Arts: Local government drama - Television What did our grandparents know about local government? And how did they come by the knowledge? The questions are prompted by two series now running on television: the eight-part documentary Town Hall, which reached its second episode on BBC2 last night, and the repeat of Alan Bleasdale's seven-part drama GBH which began on Channel 4 on Saturday. Between them they have drawn a lot of attention to local government, and provided information of a sort which would not have been available to previous generations of the general public. The original idea of this column was to compare these two major series, each taking up a lot of screen time, both - as I assumed - chiefly concerned with the minutiae of local government, and providing a valuable example of the comparative strengths of drama and documentary. There are people, Roger Graef springs to mind and Leslie Woodhead, who have started out working in one discipline and switched to the other. Woodhead, a Granada journalist, began making 'faction', or drama documentaries, in the late 1960s when it proved impossible for the current affairs series World In Action to show the audience what was going on behind the iron curtain in any other way. Graef started out in drama in North America but after coming to Britain began making fly-on-the-wall documentaries such as The Space Between Words a series which contrived to show how people in various groups such as a family and a factory workforce communicated, or failed to do so. With this sort of programme the key technician is the cameraman who, to get in close and remain inconspicuous, frequently has to work for long spells with a hand-held camera. Graef's cameraman for those programmes and on the later series Police, shot in the Thames Valley, was Charles Stewart who, while continuing to operate his camera, has gone on to be his own co-producer and is now responsible with Malcolm Hirst for Town Hall. After the Police documentaries Graef returned to drama, still taking the police as his subject, because he knew there were some aspects of police behaviour, certain attitudes he had observed among policemen, which the fly on the wall seemed unable to record. Does this mean that 'art is a lie which tells us the truth', that drama is the superior form even for a journalist's purposes, and that the documentary is inherently inferior? I doubt whether Graef or Woodhead (who returned to documentaries) would say that. I suspect that both would say what almost anyone would say who has spent a lot of time observing the success rates of different sorts of programme: that what matters most is the ability and integrity of the individual programme maker, regardless of the form in which he is working. Nevertheless, given that the teams making Town Hall (Stewart and Hirst) and GBH (Bleasdale, with Verity Lambert as executive producer and Robert Young directing) were among the most highly regarded in their respective sections of the industry, and that I had been abroad for all but the last part of GBH on its first transmission, this coincidence of subject matter seemed too good an opportunity to miss. Who would reveal most to us about the workings of local government, the dramatists with their fiction or the documentary makers with their fact? In the event the question proves almost irrelevant because local government is merely one of the frames within which Bleasdale presents his pictures. The details of council structures and activities are no more important to GBH than the details of shoe making are to Hobson's Choice. What Bleasdale gives us is an account of two men's lives: Michael Murray (played by Robert Lindsay, giving the best and most subtle performance of his life, on television anyway), who happens to be the Labour leader of a big city council, and who, in some ways, reminds us unavoidably of Liverpool's Derek Hatton; and headmaster Jim Nelson (Michael Palin giving the best performance of his life) who is a more complex and peculiar character, suffering from fear of death and worry about anxiety. When the series first appeared what claimed all the attention was the way that Bleasdale depicted the organisation of the inner city riots. Some watched the opening episodes and lamented Bleasdale's desertion to the right since he appeared to be blaming left wingers for cynically organising mayhem to gain political advantage. Others watched longer and ridiculed Bleasdale for the plot twist in which it emerged that secret government agents had infiltrated the left to produce chaos and discredit Labour councils. Yet that is a relatively trivial sub-plot. The important purpose of GBH is to use television serial drama as a means to explore that landscape of the mind which has long been the subject of the novel but which has so rarely been approached on television. The master of the form is Dennis Potter whose Singing Detective is, so far, the best thing ever attempted in this area, but GBH - and this only becomes clear when you pay close attention to the whole piece, which is asking a lot since it lasts ten and a half hours - runs it a close second. Though every episode is slightly too long, it is a most impressive piece of work, and it seems absurd that BAFTA should continue to deny it the drama prize which a majority of the jurors say they voted for. The 'winner', Prime Suspect was good but GBH is outstanding. However, if knowledge about the workings of local government is your aim then Town Hall is your programme. Thirty years ago this series would have astounded us; today, having seen umpteen fly-on-the-wall series revealing the working methods of detectives, customs men, and even politicians, we have become blase, yet this is a remarkable series. True, it has all the bugbears of its genre: in the name of purity (presumably) we are denied a voice-over and are consequently obliged to read captions, giving financial statistics for instance, when we ought to be watching the pictures; and sometimes the refusal to use television lights, as in the library sit-in next week, leaves us with a screen full of dark silhouettes. But those are niggling complaints when judged against the achievement as a whole. Stewart and Hirst have recorded the activities of the elected councillors, the Labour group, the council's paid executives, and public groups such as those who, this week - in a scene strikingly similar to one in GBH - stormed the town hall doors. The revelations are both impressive and infuriating: impressive in the quantity of time that unpaid councillors are willing to contribute, and infuriating in the way that they endlessly prevaricate over the balancing of the council's budget. It was brave or foolhardy or both of Lewisham Council to give television this sort of access because the programmes reveal an alarmingly unimpressive standard of management, considering these people are handling hundreds of millions of pounds of public money; and the relationship between volunteer councillors and the professional staff who must do their bidding looks just as tense and touchy as you might expect. Of course 'stars' are emerging: Leisha Fullick, Director of Education, who seems worryingly unworried about taking the blame for an Pounds 8.2m over-spend and whose brother-in-law the priest has lit four candles for her; Cllr Jim Mallory, the man with a mild American (?) accent, chairman of the education committee, who reminds you of a 1917 Bolshevik and never smiles, and so on. Previously my knowledge of local government was slightly greater than that of most people I knew because I had covered council matters as a reporter. This series greatly increases my knowledge and puts every other viewer on a par with me. It is inconceivable that our grandparents could have had such knowledge unless they actually worked in local government. Thus does television change our lives.</p>

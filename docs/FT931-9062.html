			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Foster's Brewing advances 126% FOSTER'S Brewing, the Australian beer, pastoral and finance group, yesterday announced a 126 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 173m (USDollars 116m) for the six months ended December 1992. The group said the 'solid performance' marked the beginning of a period of consolidation following its four-year restructuring programme, which culminated in a net loss of ADollars 951m in the year ended last June. However, the improvement in net profit was struck after an abnormal profit of ADollars 18m, against an abnormal loss of ADollars 91m in the comparable period a year ago. The increase in net profit also masked a 15 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to ADollars 157m, caused mainly by a 9 per cent fall in the contribution from the core brewing operations. The group cut the interim dividend from 3 cents to 2.75 cents, unfranked, but the board said it was confident that the second-half dividend could be increased to 3.25 cents, of which 2.5 cents would be franked. This would enable the group to achieve the directors' dividend forecast in the prospectus for last year's ADollars 1bn rights issue, which helped reduce debt from ADollars 4.1bn to ADollars 2.8bn. Mr Ted Kunkel, chief executive, said the board was confident that provisions made last year were adequate, despite the 'tough' outlook for the group's loss-making finance business, which it is trying to sell. He said Foster's would continue its efforts to refocus on its core brewing activities - Carlton United in Australia, Courage in the UK, and 40 per cent of Molson Breweries in Canada. 'The general outlook in our three main markets . . . is still uncertain at best, but Foster's has in place the operational structure necessary for a tough, competitive environment,' he added. At the operating level, Carlton reported a 9 per cent cut in profit to ADollars 101m; Courage was down 11 per cent to ADollars 131m after a ADollars 18m contribution to the Courage Pension Fund; and Molson's contribution fell by 6 per cent to ADollars 70m. The group said sales volumes fell by 4.4 per cent in Australia, 5 per cent in the UK and 3.7 per cent in Canada. Overall, sales fell by 3 per cent to ADollars 5.1bn. However, the Elders subsidiary, which consists of the group's residual agribusiness operations, reported an 'outstanding' profit of ADollars 5m following a series of losses. See Lex</p>

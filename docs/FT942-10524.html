			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: CS Holding goes cold on bank deal - Frustration as Austrian government stalls on Creditanstalt stake sale Mr Rainer Gut, chairman of CS Holding, the big Swiss international financial group built around Credit Suisse, may well be wondering if he has been used by Austria's financial establishment. Speaking in London earlier this month, Mr Gut put an end to months of speculation in Vienna by confirming that his group was interested in buying from the Austrian finance ministry a large part of its controlling stake in Creditanstalt-Bankverein, the country's second-largest bank. He went further, saying that if CS bought, say, a 28 per cent stake initially, it would ultimately like to take full control of the bank. As he put it: 'I do not like to be half pregnant.' That brought a dusty response from Creditanstalt's chief executive, Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari. 'We would be the only leading commercial bank in the developed world that would be controlled from abroad,' he said. The bank's new supervisory board chairman, Mr Walter Fremuth, chimed in. 'We do not need to find a partner. We can live without one.' It has long been known that Mr Schmidt-Chiari would like the finance ministry's stake to be widely dispersed among domestic and foreign investors. He and his colleagues put together a proposal to do just that last autumn, when Creditanstalt shares were still among the most popular on the Vienna stock exchange. Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the finance minister, rejected the proposal, even though he needed funds from privatisation to prevent the public deficit from reaching unacceptable levels. Mr Lacina has little confidence in Creditanstalt, and believes that a strong partner is needed to prevent it from getting into trouble again. The bank has suffered huge losses twice in the past 15 years. Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency, seems to share Mr Lacina's view. It said last week that loss of government control of Creditanstalt, if not replaced by a strong controlling shareholder, might have a negative impact on the bank's rating. Creditanstalt directors, aware of Mr Lacina's view, have tried in recent months to rally an Austrian consortium, built around EA-Generali, the insurance group, to buy a large part of the government's holding. This is an outcome that could also satisfy Mr Lacina, as it would eliminate complaints of a foreign sell-out. However, as with other recent attempts to mobilise Austria's conservative financiers to action, progress has been slow, to say the least. Mr Gut's intervention may have been just the thing to galvanise them into action. The word from the EA-Generali camp yesterday was that a formal offer would be made at the end of this week. Even if an Austrian offer does not materialise, it is unlikely that CS will pursue its suit. An official said the group would not want to get involved with a bank whose management did not want it. CS's recent acquisitions in Switzerland, including the big SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.1bn) takeover last year of Swiss Volksbank - which, coincidentally, is only slightly smaller than Creditanstalt - have shown that integration can be difficult even when the top management of both sides are fully supportive. Without that support, a takeover can be disastrous. Again, Standard &amp; Poor's seems to share that view. It said on Thursday that an involvement by CS with Creditanstalt would probably have an adverse effect on the rating of Credit Suisse.</p>

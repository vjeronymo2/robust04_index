			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Existing shares of The One Group correspond to shares authorized under the Multiple Pricing System as follows: Class A shares of the non-money market series correspond to Class A shares, and class A shares of the money market series correspond to Class E shares; class B shares correspond to Class B shares; retirement class shares of the non-money market series correspond to Class D shares, and retirement class shares of the money market series correspond to Class F shares; fiduciary class shares of the non-money market series correspond to Class D shares, and fiduciary class shares of the money market series correspond to Class G shares. Existing shares of The Kent Fund correspond to shares authorized under the Multiple Pricing System as follows: investment class shares of the non-money market series correspond to Class A shares, and investment class shares of the money market series correspond to Class E shares; institutional class shares of the non-money market series correspond to Class D shares, and institutional class shares of the money market series correspond to Class F shares. Shares of Allmerica Funds' existing non-money market series will be redesignated Class A, and shares of the existing money market series will be redesignated Class E. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. From time to time each Trust also may offer additional classes of shares. Certain of these additional classes (``Indirect Investor Classes'') will be offered only to Qualified Institutional Investors (as defined herein). All classes of shares other than the Indirect Investor Classes, including Classes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, will be referred to herein as ``Direct Investor Classes.'' Qualified Institutional Investors eligible to purchase Indirect Investor Classes are limited to the following five categories: (a) benefit plans such as qualified retirement plans, other than individual retirement accounts and retirement plans of self-employed persons, with total assets in excess of $5 million or such other amounts as the Trusts may establish and with such other characteristics as the Trusts may establish; (b) defined contribution retirement plans maintained by the Advisers or their affiliates for the benefit of their employees; (c) banks and insurance companies purchasing shares for their own accounts; (d) registered investment companies not affiliated with 440 Financial or with any of the Advisers; and (e) endowment funds of non-profit organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The benefit plans in category (a) will have a separate trustee for the plan who is vested with investment discretion as to plan assets. The plan beneficiaries will have limited ability to access their plan investments without incurring adverse tax consequences. Applicants will exclude self-directed plans from this category. The assets of the tax-exempt retirement plans in category (b) will be held in trust by a trustee, and the employees who participate in such plans will have limited pre-retirement access to their plan investments. The investors in categories (c), (d), and (e) will share with category (a) the essential features of substantial assets under management and investment decision-making by institutional management. Investors in the Direct Investor Classes will not be eligible to purchase shares of the Indirect Investor Classes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Applicants propose to convert Class B shares, other than Class B shares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends and distributions, automatically to Class A shares a certain number of years after the end of the calendar month in which the shareholders' order to purchase was accepted. Shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and distributions will be considered held in a separate sub-account, and each time any Class B shares convert to Class A shares, a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> portion of the Class B shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends or distributions also will convert. The purpose of the conversion feature is to relieve the holders of the Class B shares from continuing to pay a high ongoing distribution fee after the Class B shares have been outstanding long enough for the Distributor to have recouped its distribution expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Shares of one class of a series generally may be exchanged for a corresponding class of another series belonging to the same ``family of funds'' (as defined in rule 11a&hyph;3). Each Trust is a separate family of funds. Exchanges will not be permitted between Direct Investor Classes of shares and Indirect Investor Classes of shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Applicants seek exemptive relief to permit them to impose a CDSC on redemptions of shares of Classes B and C. In no event would the aggregate amount of the Class B CDSC exceed 6% of the aggregate purchase payments made by an investor for Class B shares of a series. The CDSC for the Class C shares of a series will not exceed 1% of the aggregate purchase payments. The CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase or redemption. In determining the applicability and rate of any CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares representing capital appreciation, next of shares representing reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions, and finally of other shares held by the shareholder for the longest period of time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

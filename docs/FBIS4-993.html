The comrade chairman expressed his pleasure with the  significant growth of the Frelimo Party membership between the  third and fourth sessions, with 359,700 new members joining the  party.    9. Noting the great commitment, courage, and resolve of the  militants in the fulfillment of tasks, the comrade chairman  spoke of the need for them to double their efforts in view of  the challenges they are faced with as Frelimo members and  sympathizers in this period of multiparty democracy.    10. The comrade chairman urged all Frelimo militants to  actively and effectively intervene in the search for innovative  solutions to the problems faced by our society.    11. He noted the need for greater support for the  government's programs at all levels, as well as for strengthened  coordination between the party and the government with a view to  promoting a society of peace, democracy, unity, justice, and  progress for all Mozambicans.    12. In his speech, Comrade Chairman Joaquim Alberto Chissano  stressed the role and historical responsibility of members and  sympathizers, as well as society in general, to ensure an  overwhelming Frelimo Party victory in the first general  multiparty elections, to guarantee peace and normalization, and  to consolidate democracy, national unity, progress, and social  justice in the Mozambican fatherland.    13.

Finally, he reviewed the latest developments in southern  Africa.    15. The session observed a minute of silence in memory of  Comrade Luciano Kuling Katambalale, candidate member of the  Frelimo Party Central Committee, who passed away in Tete  Province's Angonia District on 10 December 1992.  <H5>  Report on Activities Carried Out Between the Third and </H5> Fourth Sessions of the Central Committee    16. In assessing activities carried out by the Frelimo Party  between the third and fourth sessions, the Central Committee  made important decisions to improve the functioning of party  organs at this stage of important political, economic, social,  and cultural transformations promoted by the Frelimo Party.    17. Thus, the Frelimo Central Committee decided to  systematically and suitably upgrade the party's working methods  in all echelons.    18. It recommended the continued adoption of working  mechanisms and methods at all levels of party structures to  guarantee that individual members produce a better collective  work, leading to a more active intervention, permanently  affecting each militant and sympathizer, as well as all social  layers, so that they may join Frelimo and actively participate  in the building of a society of peace, justice, and progress.    19. The session stated the need for improved vertical and  horizontal communication among all party organs.    20. Taking into account the need to train Frelimo Party  members and sympathizers for a more effective and mobilizing  role in the implementation of its tasks in the community, the  Central Committee decided to take measures to increase  production and timely dissemination of study material,  information, and propaganda.    21. The demand for a greater coordination between the party  and the government at all levels was strengthened with a view to  improving the operation and effectiveness of party and  government activities in society.    22. In view of demands posed by the electoral campaign and  the need to increase the party's ability to respond to ongoing  challenges, the Central Committee decided that it was urgent and  fundamental to strengthen the Central Committee Secretariat and  the Provincial Committee Secretariats, recommending the  Political Commission and provincial committees adopt appropriate  measures.    23. The Frelimo Party Central Committee noted with  satisfaction the significant growth in members who joined the  party ranks since its last session as a unequivocal sign of the  mobilizing capacity of its members and the prestige Frelimo  enjoys among the Mozambican people.    24. The Central Committee urged all its members to redouble  their efforts and actively participate in each cell, in working  places, and in residences to ensure the continued popularity of  the party and a convincing victory in the October 1994 elections.    25. The fourth session also recommended the intensification  of cadre training activities in a pragmatic way, taking into  account the aims, needs, and priorities of the party.    26. Taking into account the necessary funds for the success  of Frelimo's electoral campaign, the Central Committee:  A. Recommended all party cells and committees at various  levels immediately begin fund raising campaigns;  B. Urged all party members to pay their fees as stated in  the directive on payment of fees;  C. Encouraged all party organs to use and manage party  property in an austere manner.    27. Taking into account the level of relationship,  friendship, cooperation, and solidarity with friendly parties,  the Central Committee recommended the strengthening of such  relations, and the mobilization of assistance for the holding of  our party's electoral campaign.    28. Taking into account the domestic and foreign factors  affecting Mozambique's socioeconomic development, the Frelimo  Party Central Committee saluted the achievements of the  Mozambican Government in the fulfillment of the main activities  provided for in the government's program of action since the  holding of the Third Frelimo Party Central Committee Session.    29. The Central Committee urged the government to continue  its efforts to implement the General Peace Accord, and the  activities planned for national reconstruction and normalization  of life in the country.    30. The Frelimo Party Central Committee also urged the  government to speed up the implementation of measures to ease  the hardships resulting from the implementation of the Economic  and Social Rehabilitation Program, particularly among the lower  income brackets.    31. The Central Committee assessed the land problem and  decided that the government should define mechanisms and  activities which permit:  A. Expediting the allocation of land to applicants,  particularly demobilized soldiers, displaced persons, and  returnees;  B. Expediting the process for the legalization of the use  of land by peasants;  C. Establishment of mechanisms leading to improved  management and use of land, and the speedy solution of land  disputes.    32. The Central Committee saluted the government's actions  in  assisting in the social reintegration of demobilized soldiers,  displaced persons, and returnees, and called for greater  involvement of all national and foreign nongovernmental  organizations, and concerted action between the latter and local  government organs.    33. The Central Committee also saluted the initiatives of  the people in support of demobilized soldiers and returnees,  particularly their integration into social and economic  structures.    34. The Central Committee noted that the people responded  positively to the appeal for an increase in agricultural  production during the 1992-93 season, though the problems they  faced in the bartering of products did not permit the surplus of  a number of regions to reduce the shortages of others.    35. The Central Committee urged the government to take  measures and adopt mechanisms that will lead to the timely  intervention of businessmen in the bartering of products to  encourage agricultural production.    36. The Central Committee assessed the situation of  education  and recommended the government continue making efforts to:  A. Continue to speed up the reconstruction of the school  network, particularly in rural areas;  B. Guarantee the expansion and maintenance of the school  network;  C. Increase the quality of education at all levels;  D. Promote the expansion of medium and higher education in  all regions of the country, involving private institutions where  the state lacks the technical and financial capacity;  E. Promote in each province the establishment of  elementary, basic, and medium-level professional training, aimed  in particular at demobilized soldiers, the unemployed, and  displaced persons.    37.

Protect species in danger of extinction and guarantee  the effective management of our wildlife and forest  resources.    43. The Central Committee recommended the government speed  up  the implementation of water programs, paying particular  attention to the opening of wells and fountains in suburban and  rural areas.  <H5>  Report From the Elections Office </H5>   44. With a view to the Frelimo Party's preparations for the  campaign for the first general multiparty legislative and  presidential elections in October 1994, the Central Committee  reviewed and saluted the activities carried out by the Elections  Office and decided to:  A.

The Central Committee assessed the report on the current  situation of the peace process and noted that:  A. The Mozambican Government continues to strictly  implement the General Peace Accord.  B. Although the international community has been assisting  in the implementation of the General Peace Accord and in the  democratization of Mozambican society, the Frelimo Central  Committee noted with concern a number of patronizing attitudes  toward Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] by some members  of the international community, as well as actions likely to  downplay the seriousness of the violations of the General Peace  Accord, and to underestimate maneuvers for the nonimplementation  of agreed timetables by that armed movement.  C. In open contradiction with its public statements on the  upholding of democracy and rights, Renamo continues to:     -  Ban the movement of citizens in areas under its control,  thus violating the General Peace Accord and the Constitution of  the Republic;    -  Prohibit the carrying out of economic activities -- namely,  hunting, fishing, and logging in areas under its control,  violating the letter and spirit of the General Peace Accord and  the Constitution of the Republic;    -  Assault and detain citizens, intimidating people with threats  of violence both in areas under its control and in other parts  of the country, in violation of the fundamental freedom and  rights of citizens.    E. [as published] Renamo has been confining mostly  children, elderly, and disabled people in assembly areas, with  no clear-cut explanation about the destination and purpose of  its men who are really physically and militarily fit to wage  war.  F. The Frelimo Central Committee has observed with concern  that the weapons delivered by Renamo to Unomoz [UN Operations in  Mozambique] are not only old and obsolete, but do not correspond  to the principle of one man one weapon.    48. [as published] Aware of the need and the imperative for  peace, the Central Committee salutes all efforts made by the  government in the search for mechanisms and actions leading to  the maintenance of an atmosphere of peace, the upholding of  sovereignty and interests of the Mozambican people within the  framework of the implementation of the General Peace Accord.    49. The Central Committee cautions against maneuvers likely  to prevent legislative and presidential elections from taking  place in our country as scheduled in October 1994. Reiterating  the need for strictly adhering to that date, the Central  Committee urged the government to define measures to:  A. Speed up the process of troop confinement;  B. Guarantee a real and effective disarmament of all  forces;  C. Ensure the agreed demobilization of military personnel  and promote their reintegration;  D. Actively participate in the formation of the new  Mozambique defense forces;  E. Speed up the minesweeping operation, giving priority to  areas to where people are returning;  F. Intensify actions to combat crime.    50. The Central Committee salutes the international  community's contribution toward the implementation of the  General Peace Accord and the deepening of democracy in the  country, and appeals for continued actions to ensure the success  of its mission in Mozambique, and a more positive Renamo role in  the implementation of the General Peace Accord.    51. The Central Committee urges the government to speed up  the effective integration of areas under Renamo control in the  administration of the Mozambican state, a fact that will  contribute to real stability and will permit all parties to  carry out their political activities in those areas.  <H5>  Situation in Southern Africa </H5>   52. The Frelimo Central Committee expresses its total  support  of the efforts made by the ANC and other progressive parties in  South Africa to hold the first general multiracial elections in  an atmosphere of peace and stability in South Africa. Only if  the democratic forces representing the true aspirations of the  South African people come into power will South Africa become  stable and participate effectively in regional cooperation.    53. The Frelimo Party Central Committee salutes the spirit  of tolerance shown by the MPLA [Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola] and the Angolan Government in the search  for solutions leading to the establishment of a lasting peace  for Angola and its martyred people. The Central Committee urges  UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] to  adopt a similar attitude to minimize the suffering of the  Angolan people.    54. The Central Committee expresses the hope that the  current Malawian political process, characterized by dialogue  among the different political forces will produce great  achievements, and that that dialogue may lead to the best ways  of upholding the interests of the Malawian people.  <H5>  Criterion For Selecting Candidates to Parliament </H5>   55. The Frelimo Central Committee reviewed the proposed  criterion for the selection of candidates for the Assembly of  the Republic for the October 1994 elections and salutes the  efforts made by the Electoral Office in the drafting of that  document.    56. Taking into account the need to select the finest sons  of  the Mozambican people to uphold their best aspirations, the  Central Committee decided to:  A. Accept the registration of people who volunteer as  candidates at their committees;  B. Ensure the selection of candidates to Frelimo lists in  the party's provincial committees.    57. The Frelimo Central Committee decided to give priority  to  the following people in the composition of its lists:     -  Mozambican women    -  Youth    -  Workers from public and private institutions    -  Peasants    The Frelimo Central Committee also decided to give special  importance to the following people in the composition of its  lists:     -  Businessmen    -  Intellectuals    -  Combatants    -  Members of social associations and institutions.    58. In line with Frelimo's tradition of rallying the  support of leading sectors of society in the search for the best  future for the country, and, in the current circumstances, for  the consolidation of peace, the strengthening of national unity,  and the promotion of democracy and progress, the Central  Committee decided to hold a national meeting of cadres in June  1994.    59. The Frelimo Central Committee decided to hold a special  session of the Central Committee in June to assess the level of  readiness of the October 1994 campaign.  <H5>  Proposal for the Government's Program for the Post Electoral </H5> Period    60. The Frelimo Central Committee assessed the Government's  Draft Program for the Post Electoral Period. The draft program  will be reviewed, taking into account the contributions made  during the current session. The draft program will be submitted  to the upcoming special session of the Central Committee.    61. The Central Committee decided to take part in the  October  1994 multiparty elections.    62. The Fourth Session of the Central Committee, expressing  the highest aspirations and the unequivocal will of all Frelimo  members and sympathizers, decided to declare Frelimo Chairman  Comrade Joaquim Chissano as a candidate for the post of  president of the Republic in the presidential elections to be  held in October 1994.    63. The Frelimo Central Committee affectionately salutes all  the Mozambican people for their commitment to the various tasks  of national reconstruction.    The people have given magnificent lessons in reconciliation  and building of social harmony in the various parts of the  country, of which the reception and social reintegration of  displaced persons and returnees, and the tenderness in  sheltering orphans and abandoned children are singled out.    The Central Committee salutes in particular the youth and  women for the enthusiastic manner in which they have taken part  in the consolidation of peace, national unity, and in the  process of normalization of life.    64. The Central Committee salutes the residents of Matola  for  the affectionate manner in which they welcome the members of  that organ, and for the solidarity expressed in messages  addressed to Frelimo.    65. The Central Committee gives thanks for the gifts from  the  residents of this city in support of the Fourth Session of the  Central Committee and the Frelimo electoral campaign.    Mozambican people, Frelimo members and sympathizers, women  and youth, peasants and workers employed by public and private  institutions, soldiers, intellectuals and combatants, teachers  and nurses, entrepreneurs, and members of social associations  and organizations, the Frelimo Central Committee urges everyone  to take part in large numbers in the first general multiparty  elections in our country, which we all want to be free and fair.    The Frelimo Central Committee urges all Mozambicans to unite  around Frelimo for the upholding of peace, sovereignty and  territorial integrity, the strengthening of national unity, and  the building of a democratic society based on progress and  social justice.

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Letter: Buccaneering capitalism in a not so free market Sir, Samuel Brittan's defence of liberal market capitalism ('Too early for requiem', November 9) was as eloquent as it was effective, but, sadly, implicitly conceded the common fallacy that German and Japanese capitalism is more 'planned' than the 'buccaneering' Anglo-American variety. I hope that I may be allowed to deploy some simple facts to counter this. According to OECD figures, US state funding for non-military R&amp;D runs at about Dollars 20bn a year - a third of all civil research spending - while the Japanese government funds just 2 per cent of its industry's research. A World Bank survey of non-tariff barriers showed that they covered 9 per cent of all goods in Japan - compared with 34 per cent in the US - figures reinforced by David Henderson of the OECD, who stated that during the 1980s the US had the worst record for devising new non-tariff barriers. Apart from massive subsidies to the coal, steel, car and aerospace industries since the second world war, Britain has imposed import limits on TVs, machine tools, VCRs, pottery, cutlery, fork-lift trucks, footwear, cars and textiles, many of which are still in force. Germany has no import quotas on Japanese cars and is the only major European country not to impose Multi-Fibre Arrangement textile import quotas on developing countries. The US, incidentally, uses the MFA to restrict clothing imports from 29 countries - one of which is Japan. Sadly, the free-market image of the US and the rhetoric of its leaders rarely match the facts, while the interventionism and protectionism of Germany and Japan are habitually exaggerated by politicians and industrialists for self-serving reasons. If these policies really were the holy grail of economic success, Brazil and India would be economic superpowers. Phillip Oppenheim, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

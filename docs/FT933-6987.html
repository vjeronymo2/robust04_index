			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Bikuben returns to black as loss provisions double BIKUBEN, Denmark's third-largest bank, reported a first-half pre-tax profit of DKr207m (Dollars 30m) compared with a loss of DKr442m in the same period last year. The bank returned to profit despite a doubling of loss provisions to DKr1.68bn from DKr781m, which Mr Borge Munk Ebbesen, the bank's chief executive officer, described as reflecting 'the culmination of a series of the economic difficulties which have hit Danish business in recent years'. The bank has become involved in a legal dispute over the interest formula on Dollars 50m in subordinated loan capital subscribed to Bikuben by the Danish dairy group, MD Foods. As a consequence, the bank has decided not to include the loan in the capital base at the half-year, which nevertheless left the bank with a capital adequacy ratio of 10.5 per cent. The main contribution to the improvement in the bank's performance in the first half was a DKr784m gain from the value adjustment of the securities portfolio.</p>

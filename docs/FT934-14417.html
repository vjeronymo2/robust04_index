			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Rally goes on - International bond funds INVESTORS in international bond funds have had a terrific year. As the table shows, the average bond fund returned 19.7 per cent over the 12 months to October 1 (offer-to-bid with net income re-invested), streets ahead of even the best building society account. And the last year was only a continuation of a three-year rally which has allowed international bond fund investors to earn an average return of 59.2 per cent. Substantial falls in inflation, and in short-term interest rates, have helped. But the performance of international bond funds has also been boosted by sterling's decline against most major currencies. Anyone contemplating an investment in an international bond fund should be aware that the combination of favourable factors seen so far in the 1990s might not continue. Inflation and interest rates could rise again; the pound could rebound in value. One factor which could keep attracting investors to international bond funds, however, is that yields are only marginally below those available on UK funds. The average for the international sector is 5.56 per cent; for the UK, 5.85 per cent. Investors should not assume automatically that the higher the yield, the more attractive the fund; income could be in the process of being bought at the expense of capital growth. The highest yielding fund in the sector on October 1 was Guinness Flight EMU; but, in terms of total return, it ranked just 22nd (out of 25) over the year. Another Guinness Flight fund, Global High Income, was top of the sector over the past year. Manager Philip Saunders says the fund, which invests in high-yielding government debt, has benefited from its substantial holdings of Italian and Spanish government bonds. Charges vary between 1.5 and 3.5 per cent initially (depending on size of investment) and are 0.75 per cent annually. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. CU PPT Global Bond trust (the CU stands for Commercial Union), while eighth over the one-year period, is top of the sector over both three and five years, with returns of 72.7 per cent and 76.1 per cent respectively. The charges are 6 per cent initially and 0.75 per cent annually; minimum investment is Pounds 500. Since, over the long term, equities tend to outperform bonds, these funds should be considered primarily by income-seeking investors. Over the past 10 years, the average international fixed-interest fund was up 182.3 per cent; UK equity general funds rose an average 308.4 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 10 PERFORMING INTERNATIONAL BOND FUNDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                              Size (Pds m)*   Yield* (%)     Perf*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Guinness Flight Glb High Inc               14.0          7.8      32.1 Invesco Int'l Bond                          4.4          5.9      29.2 Newton Int'l Bond                           5.0          7.3      25.8 Beckman Int'l                              54.5          2.8      23.4 Baring Global Bond                        176.8          5.3      23.1 Cannon Int'l Curr Bond                     30.3          5.7      20.8 Norwich Int'l Bond                         33.1          4.9      20.8 CU PPT Global Bond                          7.4          5.9      20.5 Sun Alliance W'ldwide Bond                  9.0          5.3      20.4 Perpetual Global Bond                      89.0          6.2      19.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sector average                             31.8          5.6      19.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal ** As of October 1 * Offer-to-bid with net income reinvested over year to October 1.

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Belgians at odds on austerity plan BELGIUM'S centre-left government failed after a weekend marathon of talks to agree on an austerity plan to cut the country's huge debt, Reuter reports from Brussels. A government spokeswoman said there were still serious differences among the coalition parties and that plans to present the austerity package to parliament today had been scrapped. The Christian Democrat and Socialist parties agree on the need to find an extra BFr110bn (Dollars 3.3bn) by the end of next year, either in savings or in extra revenue. However, the Socialists want to avoid higher taxation, while the Christian Democrats favour large spending cuts and extra taxes.</p>

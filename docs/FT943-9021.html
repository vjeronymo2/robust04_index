			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / MAM cuts business with parent Warburg over Lasmo Mercury Asset Management has taken the unprecedented step of punishing its parent company, SG Warburg, for the way Warburg managed Enterprise Oil's failed bid for Lasmo. For the past month, MAM has cut the business in UK share trading that it gives Warburg to the minimum required by law. The fund management group, 75 per cent owned by Warburg, took the decision because of its fury that the securities firm did not buy any of MAM's Lasmo shares when it bought 10 per cent of the oil group on behalf of Enterprise seven weeks ago. Warburg's unusual decision to buy the 10 per cent from only five investment institutions, rather than picking up stock more widely in the market, outraged MAM and other Lasmo shareholders. Anger over the way Warburg handled the purchase contributed to the subsequent failure of Enterprise's Pounds 1.6bn takeover bid for Lasmo. MAM, among the biggest fund managers in the UK with more than Pounds 60bn under its control, could not impose an absolute embargo on dealing with Warburg because it has a legal duty to its clients to trade with any City firm offering the best prices. However, it has been giving Warburg a fraction of its normal level of business in UK shares. MAM has continued to deal with its parent in the securities of overseas companies. Warburg said yesterday that its trading with MAM has this week returned to normal levels. Disclosure of MAM's actions is the latest in a stream of embarrassments for Warburg stemming from its decision to buy the 10 per cent of Lasmo at above the market price from the five institutions - PDFM, Capital Group, Legal &amp; General, Sun Life and British Gas. The purchase of 8 per cent from PDFM alone was particularly galling to other Lasmo shareholders. Warburg last week agreed to pay Pounds 250,000 to Rwanda charities to settle a dispute with Swiss Banking Corporation, which had complained to the London Stock Exchange that Warburg should have purchased its Lasmo shares, since it had left a 'limit order' with Warburg. A special sub-committee of the exchange's domestic equity rules committee had earlier ruled in SBC's favour, but Warburg refused to pay the Pounds 750,000 claimed by SBC. It made an offer to SBC of Pounds 250,000. SBC turned this down, but said it would settle if Warburg paid Pounds 750,000 to charity. Mr John Kemp-Welch, exchange chairman, put pressure on both firms to settle, to avoid an appeal to the professional standards committee. SBC finally said it would drop the matter if Warburg paid Pounds 250,000 to charity.</p>

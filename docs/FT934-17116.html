			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Wescol Pounds 30,000 in the black THE DECISION to focus on steel fabrication and construction enabled Wescol Group to report profits of Pounds 30,000 for the year to July 31 against losses of Pounds 2.49m. The USM-quoted Halifax-based company also announced the raising of Pounds 2.94m through a rights issue, the issue of shares to Lloyds Bank and the proposed reduction of the share premium account. Turnover fell from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 15.2m, which included Pounds 39,000 (Pounds 1.93m) from discontinued activities. Sales of continuing activities rose 5.4 per cent achieved in very competitive trading but helped by a reduction in the overall capacity of the steel construction industry, said the company. Earnings per share were 0.6p, against losses of 21.6p. Mr Peter Price, the chairman, said that while the results benefited from lower interest rates - finance charges fell to Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 476,000) - high borrowings, following the losses of the past two years, imposed a heavy burden. In the rights issue 14m shares are being offered on a 4-for-3 basis at 15p each to raise a net Pounds 1.94m. The issue is underwritten by British Linen Bank with Wise Speke as brokers. Lloyds Bank is subscribing for 6.67m shares at 15p to raise Pounds 1m providing the rights issue raises not less than Pounds 1.94m. The cash will be used to reduce borrowings. Following the cut in debt Lloyds has also agreed to provide overdraft facilities of Pounds 1.2m and a medium term loan of Pounds 1m. Shareholders are being asked to approve a reduction of Pounds 1.69m in the share premium account to cover the deficit on the profit and loss account and the resumption of dividends.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Rapid response by banks lifts Dow Wall Street SHARE prices rose sharply in lively trading yesterday after the leading US money centre banks quickly lowered their prime lending rates in the wake of Tuesday's surprise discount rate cut by the Federal Reserve, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 42.33 stronger at 2,930.20, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 4.94 to 380.29. The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, which had been on a steady decline since it set several record closing highs last month, recovered from an Apple Computer profits warning to end 3.13 ahead on the day at 487.85. Turnover on the New York SE came to 182m shares, with the number of rising stocks beating falling issues by 1,155 to 477. Although the banks had been expected to lower their prime rates, the speed with which they moved and the sight of bank loan rates dropping by 50 basis points to 8 1/2 per cent gave the market something to cheer about. Investors hope that cheaper borrowing costs will stimulate economic activity and help bring the recession to an end before the final quarter of the year. There was a muted reaction from bank shares to the prime rate reductions. Citicorp edged up Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 15 7/8 , Manufacturers Hanover firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 25 5/8 and Chase Manhattan added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 18 3/4 , while Chemical Bank, Dollars 20 3/8 , and BankAmerica, Dollars 38 1/2 , eased Dollars  1/8 apiece. Elsewhere in the financial sector, securities house Salomon Bros rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 33 7/8 in spite of a warning from chairman Mr John Gutfreund that the company could not guarantee that the earnings growth of the first quarter would be maintained throughout the rest of the year. Given the recent declines in share prices and the drop in daily turnover levels, Mr Gutfreund's comments came as no surprise to the market. A similar warning of tougher times ahead also failed to upset General Dynamics, which put on Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 39 after the aerospace and defence group was reported to have announced plans to shed 30 per cent of its workforce over the next four years. Chrysler completed the first-quarter earnings picture for the motor industry, unveiling a net loss in the period of Dollars 598m, against net profits of Dollars 71m for the same quarter in 1990. The figures were in line with expectations, and the shares improved Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 13 1/2 . On the over-the-counter market, Apple Computer plunged Dollars 7 3/4 to Dollars 47 1/4 , or 14 per cent, on volume of almost 10m shares in the wake of a warning from the company that third-quarter profits could be below the figure achieved in 1990. Wall Street analysts promptly cut their earnings estimates for Apple, and there was a knock-on effect for other technology issues, most notably Commodore, down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 14 3/4 . LTV, the diversified steel, aerospace and energy group, slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 1 3/8 after announcing provisional plans for a reorganisation designed to bring it out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Canada INTEREST RATE cuts in the US and Canada helped Toronto stocks to advance in moderate trading. The Bank of Montreal cut its prime rate 1/4 point to 9.75 per cent, the first time the rate has dipped below 10 per cent since 1987. The composite index moved forward 24.2 to close at 3,493.0, and rises outnumbered declines by 303 to 237. Volume amounted to 21.3m shares. Among the 14 sub-groups, 11 showed increases, led by mining, financial services and industrial products, up 1.38 per cent, 1.10 per cent and 0.92 per cent respectively.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Kerry acquiring leading chilled food brands from Unilever Kerry Group, the Irish meat, dairy and food ingredients manufacturer, is to acquire the chilled meats business of Mattessons Walls from Van den Burgh Foods for an as yet undisclosed sum. Net asset value of the business being acquired has been independently estimated at Pounds 25m. The acquisition, which Kerry said was still at the due diligence appraisal, would double Kerry's business in the UK consumer foods sector to about Pounds 160m in sales. It would also give it control of some of the leading brand names in Walls, the added-value meats business. Walls ice cream will continue to be produced and marketed by Birds Eye Walls. Other brands include Mattessons, Richmond, Lawson, New York Deli and Valley Farm, all familiar names on UK supermarket shelves. According to Kerry: 'The acquisition is part of our strategy to build a strong branded position in the UK market.' The deal would add a nationwide van sales operation of 200 people in England and Wales and two manufacturing plants at Manchester and Durham to Kerry's existing UK distribution and manufacturing facilities. The company said the Mattessons business 'is now at a turnaround stage and there will be opportunities for further streamlining'. According to analysts in Dublin, the UK chilled meat sector is highly competitive, but the acquisition would strengthen Kerry's focus on the food ingredients and consumer foods businesses, and position it well for an upturn in the UK food sector next year. Van den Burgh Foods said the decision to sell its chilled meats business was part of its plan to concentrate resources in its established core areas of margarine, low-fat foods, spreads, liquid oils and meat snacks. Mattessons Walls joined Van den Burgh, a subsidiary of Unilever, in 1992 from another division of Unilever. The company said that during the past two years there had been an ongoing pruning and rationalisation of the chilled meats division.</p>

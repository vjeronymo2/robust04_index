			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVING TREES  </P> <P> The juxtaposition (Opinion, Feb. 11) of the two tree columns further  complicates the dilemma well-meaning tree lovers are confronted with: to  preserve or plan anew.  </P> <P> We need both.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the stultifying effect of sugar coating tree planting in the  urban scene is precisely the "mask" which hides the reality: Every mature and  maturing tree removed from our urban blight accelerates our already seriously  impacted air quality and exacerbates non-human water consumption. (Any young  tree requires at least two years of monitored watering as contrasted to  established trees which have generally adapted to rainfall only.)  </P> <P> Let us not be deceived by the Arbor Day scenario that planting is better than  protecting.  </P> <P> JILL SWIFT, Tarzana  </P></p>

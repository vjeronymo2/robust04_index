			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, Apr 23 (CNA)--The Cyprus Government  welcomed with skepticism a statement by U.S. President Bill  Clinton, who expressed the hope that there would be some  movement from the Turkish side on Cyprus in the next couple of  days with regard to the U.N.-proposed package of  confidence-building measures (CBM'S).    Government spokesman Ioannis Kassoulidhis told the Cyprus  News Agency Saturday [23 April] that "really President Clinton  has shown personal interest" in the efforts for a Cyprus  settlement.    "He (Clinton) correctly noted that the ball has been in  Denktas's court," the spokesman said.    Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas has so far refused to  accept the U.N.-proposed CBM's package while President Glavkos  Kliridhis has accepted it in principle since May 1993.    Spokesman Kassoulidhis said he would not make further  comments "until we really see that Mr Denktas has accepted the  21 March document" of the United Nations regarding the  implementation of the CBM's    Asked "what about Cyprus" before his White House talks  Friday  with Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou, President Clinton  said:    "We're working hard on Cyprus, and I think, I hope there  will  be some movement from the Turkish side on Cyprus in the next  couple of days with regard to the confidence-building measures.  I think that the ball has been sort of in Mr. Denktas's court,  and I hope he will take it up, and then I hope that Greece and  all others will support pushing forward. I have worked hard to  resolve this since I've been in office, and I will continue to  stay on it."    Speaking during a press conference after his talks with  Premier Papandreou, the U.S. President said the U.S. "supports  the U.N. confidence-building measures. Those measures grew out  of discussions with President Kliridhis soon after he took  office, and we hope that both sides will support them."    He said his coordinator for Cyprus Robert Lamb had just  returned from talks with both sides.    He said "A settlement in Cyprus would benefit all the  nations  in the region, especially Greece and Turkey, two vital members  of NATO."    President Clinton pledged to do what he can "to promote  greater understanding between these two critical nations and, in  the process, to promote progress on Cyprus."    Meanwhile, U.N envoys on Cyprus were due Saturday to start a  new effort to try to convince the Turkish side to accept the  CBM'S.    U.N. secretary-general's special representative Joe Clark  was  scheduled to meet Saturday in Washington Greece's Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias, who is accompanying premier  Papandreou on his U.S. trip.    On Sunday, the former Canadian prime minister will fly to  Ankara for talks with the Turkish Government. He will be joined  in the Turkish capital by the U.N. chief's resident  representative to Cyprus Gustave Feissel.    The U.N. envoys will come to Cyprus on Wednesday for talks  with President Kliridhis and Rauf Denktas.    Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops  invaded and occupied 37 per cent of its territory.    Among the confidence-building measures proposed by the U.N.  is the transfer of part of the Turkish-occupied town of  Famagusta to the U.N. administration to allow some 16.000 Greek  Cypriot refugees to return to their homes and the re-opening of  the now defunct Nicosia International Airport.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Rangoon, Dec 24 (AFP) -- The Burmese timber  industry, the country's leading foreign exchange earner, is  actively courting foreign investors while promoting sound  ecological principles.    And its forestry conservation practices have enabled the  government to reap rare accolades from a Western world which was  outspoken in its criticism of the military junta's takeover  after public demonstrations five years ago.    "Burma gets a bum rap" on logging practices, an otherwise-  critical foreign observer commented. "The government is  repressive, but its conservation policies are enlightened," a  Western diplomat said.    With about 75 percent of the world's teak reserves and a  large quantity of other hardwoods, Rangoon has invited up to 100  percent foreign investment in everything from sawmills to  furniture factories to gain sorely-needed funds for development.    It intends, however, to maintain strict control of logging  operations in order to preserve its forest resources for the  future, officials stressed in recent interviews here.    About half the country is covered in forests, and officials  said that so far only three million cubic meters (105 million  cubic yards) of wood had been cut, compared to 40 million cubic  meters (1,400 cubic yards) in Malaysia, which is half the size  of Burma.    Before neighboring Thailand banned logging on its own  territory in 1988, it had almost halved its forest cover.    When Rangoon called a halt early last year to allegedly  abusive Thai logging in concessions along the border, it  adjusted its income targets accordingly, planning a 6.9 percent  GDP drop in the forestry sector.    In the 1994-95 fiscal year, starting April 1, it hopes to  see  a new rise in income as investors from places such as Sweden and  Thailand come on stream with renovations to local hardwood  furniture factories.    But would-be foreign investors are mainly looking for big  profits and a quick return, instead of taking a longer view,  officials of the Forestry Department and the state-run Myanmar  Timber Enterprise complained.    They said they need equipment--including tractors, skidders  and road-building machinery to help speed up extraction and  delivery to the investors--as well as marketing and technology  knowhow.    From the felling of a tree to the factory can take up to two  years. "The faster we can do it, the faster we can produce  downstream products," one official said.    But all officials, including Forestry Minister Lieutenant  General Chit Swe, stressed that Burma's future resources would  not be sacrificed.    Interviewed surrounded by top aides and advisors, the  minister, a member of the ruling junta, noted that no one else  in the group was wearing military dress.    "I'm the only one wearing the green," he said, tugging at  the  sleeve of his forest-green uniform. "I like green. I am a  conservationist."    His statement was backed up separately by other officials,  one of whom said: "The minister is a fanatic. He doesn't want to  fell any trees. He wants to lower the quota. What he wants are  natural parks, wildlife, eco-tourism."    Under a system of selective felling on a sustainable basis,  the Forestry Department allocates a quota of Annual Allowable  Cuts (AAC) for all commercial varieties in strictly-defined  sites.    Loggers could harvest up to 350,000 tonnes of teak and 1.3  million tonnes of other hardwoods annually without endangering  future extraction, according to official calculations.    Actual figures stand at approximately 250,000 tonnes and  500,000 tonnes -- due in part to equipment shortages, officials  acknowledged.    They also said the shortfall compensated for remote areas  outside their control along the borders--estimated by one  official at "maybe 5-7 percent" but which foreign analysts put  at between 15 and 20 percent.    The ministry meanwhile replants some 80,000 acres (200,000  hectares) a year, half in teak and other hardwoods. Much of the  rest is devoted to faster-growing trees to be used for the fuel  on which 70 percent of the population is dependent.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SEWAGE SPILL FOULS WATER OFF DOG BEACH  </P> <P> A blocked sewage main sent 72,000 gallons of raw sewage into the San Diego  River on Friday, leading to the posting of water contamination signs where the  river dumps into the ocean at Dog Beach, county health officials said.  </P> <P> The spill began at about 7 a.m. after rocks blocked a 12-inch sewer main,  forcing sewage to overflow from a manhole in the 7400 block of Princess View  Drive.  </P> <P> The sewage ran into a nearby storm drain in the 7300 block of Mission Gorge  Road and then flowed through a storm drain into the river. The spill was halted  after four hours.  </P> <P> Dan Avera, a spokesman for the county Department of Health Services, said the  beach will remain off-limits until the water meets recreational standards.  </P></p>

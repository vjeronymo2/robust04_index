			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW PRESIDENT TAKES A HAMMER TO NORIEGA'S REDOUBT;  </P> <P> PANAMA: DEMOLITION BEGINS ON THE BUILDING WHERE FALLEN DICTATOR RULED. 'HOUSING  FOR THE POOR WILL GO UP IN ITS PLACE,' ENDARA SAYS.  </P> <P> President Guillermo Endara, swinging a heavy sledgehammer, began the demolition  Thursday of the Comandancia, the seat and symbol of Manuel A. Noriega's power.  </P> <P> "It is a good feeling to see a hated institution come down," Endara declared.  "And it is good to see that housing for the poor will go up in its place."  </P> <P> The hammer blows Endara delivered against a cement railing at the front of the  building signaled the start of a two-month dismantling project that is to be  followed by a multimillion-dollar public housing project.  </P> <P> The Comandancia, built just after World War II, served many purposes, but after  Noriega took power in 1981, its main purpose was to remind Panamanians of the  control he exercised from his corner office on the second floor.  </P> <P> From the barred windows, Noriega could see the headquarters of his secret  police and the warehouse-like building where agents known as sapos (toads) beat  Noriega's enemies.  </P> <P> Down the street were the barracks of the Machos de Montes, a special battalion  of the Panama Defense Forces thought to be particularly loyal to Noriega and  particularly brutal in carrying out his wishes.  </P> <P> Within a few minutes in the early morning darkness of Dec. 20, the Comandancia  and the other nearby symbols of power were all but destroyed. Their roofs were  blown off, their walls raked by artillery and rockets.  </P> <P> The Comandancia was among the first important targets of invading U.S. troops,  who used mortars, tanks and helicopter gunships in the attack.  </P> <P> For a handful of foreign journalists who were brought to the Comandancia and  abused one night last May, the sight of the wrecked compound provided feelings  both of satisfaction and detachment. The buildings that had seemed so  forbidding were now no more threatening than a child's playhouse, one said.  </P> <P> On Thursday, President Endara, Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon and other  victims of Noriega's brutality took turns in hammering at the Comandancia.  </P> <P> Harmodio Arias, whose father's newspapers were confiscated by the military  rulers, looked on and commented: "Fantastic. I never imagined I would see this  day, and I can't tell you in any language how this makes me feel."  </P> <P> The Comandancia, an architectural oddity that was meant to be futuristic, did  not fall easily to the U.S. weaponry, and it resisted the blows that fell on it  Thursday.  </P> <P> "It is so solid," Capt. Kirk Amundson of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said.  "We would have to use so much explosive to bring it down that the damage in the  surrounding neighborhood would be unacceptable."  </P> <P> Instead the walls will be brought down by wrecking balls, bulldozers, backhoes  and men swinging 16-pound sledges.  </P> <P> The weight of the hammer was almost too much for Endara. His first blow was on  target, but the next went awry, and the flying debris it dislodged sent  onlookers scurrying. Endara laughed.  </P> <P> Vice President Arias grinned broadly as he delivered two strong blows directly  on target, tearing out large chunks of material.  </P> <P> Arias told the crowd: "It was an affront to have this in this neighborhood. Now  we can use the money, the resources that were wasted on corruption, to build  housing for the poor."  </P> <P> The site is El Chorrillo, one of Panama City's poorest districts, and the  shooting that destroyed Noriega's offices also destroyed several acres of slum  housing.  </P> <P> Now, under a plan drawn up by the military in 1981, the new government plans to  construct apartments for 2,880 families. The land where the Comandancia stood  will become a park called the Plaza of Democracy.  </P> <P> To speed the project along, hundreds of people took part in Thursday's  demolition ceremony. Chunks of walls were pulled loose and carried away.  Plumbing fixtures were ripped out, along with floor coverings.  </P> <P> The most sought-after souvenirs were documents, magazines, pamphlets and  personal papers left by the soldiers, including a 1988 Christmas card to  Noriega signed by the British military attache, Lt. Col. Robert Lawson.  </P> <P> And there was a singed copy of a 1988 pamphlet complaining about U.S. influence  all through Panama's history. Its title: "Panama, the Country Invaded by the  United States."  </P></p>

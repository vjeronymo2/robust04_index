			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has  left New Delhi this morning for the United States. He was seen  off at the airport by his cabinet colleagues, chief ministers of  Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh, the governor of  Uttar Pradesh and senior officials. The seven-day visit will  take Mr. Narasimha Rao to four cities, including the capital  Washington and will enable him to meet a broad segment of the  Clinton Administration, congressmen, and business circles.    Our correspondent, M. Rama Rao, covering the visit, says the  main thrust of the prime minister's talks will be on enhanced  economic and investment cooperation between the two countries.  India will also reiterate its position on sensitive issues like  Nuclear Nonproliferation, arms control, human rights, and  Kashmir to the U.S. leaders. The Clinton-Rao talks slated for  Thursday are expected to be open and frank, giving the leaders  an opportunity to appreciate each other's point of view on world  issues as also matters of mutual concern.    A high-level official delegation is accompanying the prime  minister. It includes the finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh;  the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salaman  Khurshid; and the minister of state in the prime minister's  office, Mr. Bhuvanesh Chaturvedi. A 21-member trade delegation  drawn from the three apex bodies of Indian industry is also  accompanying the prime minister to help forge enhanced Indo-U.S.  economic relations. The highlights of the visit include an  address by Mr. Narasimha Rao to a joint meeting of the U.S.  Congress and the lecture at the prestigious Harvard University.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Concerns on liquidity TRADING ON the UK money markets was dominated by concerns about the massive liquidity shortage created by the Bank of England's recent attempts to prop up the pound, writes Emma Tucker. Estimates of the number of pounds bought by the Bank ahead of Britain's suspension from the European exchange rate mechanism on Wednesday ranged between Pounds 10bn and Pounds 20bn. In the early morning, as traders worried about how the Bank was going to inject such big quantities back into the system, the overnight rate shot up to 150 per cent and one-month money traded at 18 per cent. Tensions eased, however, after the Bank announced a temporary facility to the banking system, to take effect today in a technical operation which would complement its normal money market operations. The Bank said the facilities were being made available to a group of banks, the gilt-edged marketmakers and the five biggest building societies to relieve the money market shortage expected today. The initial duration of the help would be seven days and the rate of interest 10 per cent. The money market position would be reviewed in a week's time to assess the need to roll over the special facility, the Bank said. 'There is possibly going to be a larger than usual shortage tomorrow. We have always reserved the right to deal direct with the banks in addition to the discount houses if it suited us,' a spokesman for the Bank of England said. On the cash markets, short sterling soared as expectations of further cuts in base rates took hold of the baskets. Short sterling futures, buoyed early in the day by the Bank's announcement that it was cutting the minimum lending rate to 10 per cent from 12 per cent, closed 263 basis points higher. The December contract finished at 91.28 compared with a close of 88.65 on the previous day. This suggested that base rates would be 9 per cent, or just below, by the expiry of the contract. The fact that the three-month interbank rate ended at 10 1/4 per cent was more a reflection of residual worries over the liquidity shortage facing the system than anything to do with expec-tations of base rate moves.</p>

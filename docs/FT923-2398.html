			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Japan backs G7 currency plans JAPANESE leaders yesterday threw their weight behind moves for the meeting tomorrow of finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, to draw up contingency plans to make sure European currency instability does not spread. Officials in Japan are concerned that the European currency crisis may put the US dollar under pressure, strengthening the yen and thus pushing Japan towards cutting interest rates. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, said the meeting tomorrow would discuss ways to calm European currency markets, and Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, said Japan was ready to back concerted action to prevent instability spreading. Mr Hata will meet his US counterpart, Mr Nicholas Brady, this afternoon. Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, suggested the G7 might take co-ordinated action to stabilise European currencies. A senior official at the finance ministry said plans were being prepared for concerted intervention in the Tokyo market on Monday if, in their referendum on Sunday, the French vote against the Maastricht treaty on European integration. The Tokyo market would be the first to feel the violent impact that a French rejection of the treaty could have on forex markets. Finance ministry officials said the G7 meeting would probably draw up a contingency plan for concerted intervention in Tokyo in case the vote went against the treaty. Beyond these immediate worries, the turmoil of the past week, combined with the imminence of the French vote, has provoked concerns among Japanese financiers, industrialists and policy-makers. Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister at the ministry of international trade and industry, warned that, if the pound's suspension in the ERM were prolonged, Japan would be hurt. One main worry is that the US dollar may soon be sucked into the turmoil. That would drag in the yen. If the French vote against Maastricht, Tokyo financial analysts expect the D-Mark to strengthen against the dollar, which would further weaken against the yen. A weaker dollar would limit the US scope to cut interest rates to revive its economy. Prospects for a recovery of Japan's battered economy would be enhanced by higher exports to North America, so Japan would come under strong pressure to cut interest rates. Mr Yukio Yanbe, DKB Research Institute's chief economist, said: 'If the dollar weakens, a wider adjustment will be necessary to prevent the dollar falling too far.'</p>

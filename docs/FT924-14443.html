			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Platon in talks as losses rise PLATON International, the USM-quoted instrumentation group, is in preliminary discussions which could lead to an offer for the group. The shares rose 4p from the year's low to close at 26p. The company also announced its results for the year to April 3 which showed pre-tax losses of Pounds 547,000 (Pounds 484,000) after exceptional charges of Pounds 196,000 (Pounds 410,000) relating to net rationalisation costs. The auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick, said the accounts had been prepared on a going concern basis dependent on a significant increase in operating profits in the present year or on additional sources of finance being obtained. They added: 'We have been unable to satisfy ourselves yet as to the likelihood of adequate profits or finance being achieved.' Mr Robin Meyer, chairman, said he was unable to say when he could make a further comment on the talks or whether the auditors had set a time limit for seeking finance. He added that the results had been delayed because the management had been taking a number of actions to improve performance and wished to be able to inform shareholders of their actions. The moves include targetting sales activity on industries offering potential and improving manufacturing efficiencies. Turnover for the period improved 15 per cent to Pounds 7.53m (Pounds 6.56m) for a trading loss of Pounds 74,000, against profits of Pounds 199,000. Losses per share were unchanged at 5.1p. The result of the losses left net assets down from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.56m increasing gearing from 49 per cent to 100 per cent at the year end. Mr Meyer said the present year had begun with two difficult months but was encouraged by trading in June and July and the outlook for the second quarter.</p>

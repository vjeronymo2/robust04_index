			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / SPD urges jail terms for insider dealing in shares GERMANY'S opposition Social Democrats yesterday called for statutory jail sentences to deter insider dealing in shares, as Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of the country's most powerful union, struggled to contain calls for his resignation from his own rank and file. The leader of the IG Metall engineering union has denied insider dealing, but admits speculating in almost DM1m (Pounds 400,000) worth of shares in MAH, a Daimler-Benz holding company. He is on the Daimler supervisory board, which decided to dissolve MAH and exchange its shares for full Daimler shares on April 2 - causing a 20 per cent jump in the MAH share price. Mr Steinkuhler admits to making a profit of DM64,000. The affair threatened further ramifications yesterday when Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank and chairman of the Daimler supervisory board, came under strong attack from shareholders at his bank's annual meeting for the way the decision to dissolve MAH was announced. Daimler made the announcement at 4 pm on April 2, well after the close of floor trading on German stock exchanges. However, it prompted a sharp rise in the MAH share price in trading conducted over the IBIS electronic dealing system. Meanwhile, BfG Bank, the former trade union bank that carried out Mr Steinkuhler's share purchases, is investigating how information had been leaked to the press. Pressure for legislation to control insider dealing - not an offence in Germany - was fuelled by Mr Uwe Jens, SPD economics spokesman. He called for a law based on US legislation, which provides for up to two years in prison. 'It needs a jail sentence to provide an adequate deterrent.' Although he refused to comment on the Steinkuhler case, other members of the SPD have joined calls for him to quit, as have rank-and-file members of IG Metall.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Watchdog agrees pensions guidelines The Securities and Invest-ments Board, the City's chief watchdog, has completed the first stage of its work to allay public concern about the mis-selling of personal pensions to people transferring out of an occupational scheme. The decision came yesterday as Legal &amp; General, the life and general insurance group, became the latest insurer to announce that it was making 'prudent' provision against the potential need to compensate investors who had been badly advised to transfer out of an employer's scheme. Mr David Prosser, group chief executive, refused to give the scale of the provisions, or say how many pension transfers L&amp;G had carried out, but said that the overall value of pension transfers received as premiums was about Pounds 500m. He said the industry had been 'hit quite hard in the press' over the issue, and suggested that the position of actuaries and occupational scheme trustees had been somewhat overlooked so far. At its meeting yesterday, the SIB board agreed, with only slight changes, the proposals put forward by the regulators' steering group. The group was set up in December to ensure higher standards in this area of business for the future. The main elements of the plans - which will be published shortly - are the introduction of a cooling-off period into the pension transfer transaction and issuing SIB guidance directly to investors about the points they should raise with sales agents or advisers in considering a pension transfer. The focus of SIB's work on pension transfers will now shift to compensating people who have suffered as a result of poor advice. By the end of next month it will issue guidance to companies about how to identify priority cases. This will be followed three months later by an overall plan for dealing with past business.

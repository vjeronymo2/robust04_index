			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON AGING: A NEW FREEDOM AT FIFTYSOMETHING  </P> <P> Question: When my co-workers surprised me recently on my 50th birthday, I cried  during the party. Although my colleagues interpreted my tears as a sign of joy,  to me they were a symbol of a frightening realization: I'm growing older. I  know I have many good years left, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm racing  against the clock. Is this common among people in their 50s?  </P> <P> Answer: Yes -- perhaps more so than people age "fiftysomething" care to admit.  </P> <P> "The 50s is a fulcrum decade, a turning point in the aging process during which  people, more sharply than before, are made to feel their age," sociologist  David A. Karp writes in a recent issue of the Gerontologist.  </P> <P> A 50th birthday, particularly one marked by a special celebration, can spark  new awareness of the years gone by. So can a body that tires more easily, the  death of a friend or the birth of a first grandchild. "Events pile up in the  50s, making reflection about age particularly likely in this decade," Karp  writes.  </P> <P> The Boston College professor's findings are based on in-depth interviews with  72 professional men and women age 50 to 60. Few of the study participants  described themselves as old. ("I want to continue to call it middle age until  I'm physically impaired," one person said, echoing a common sentiment.)  However, many did experience the finiteness of time. As gerontologist Bernice  Neugarten once noted of middle-age adults, they had begun to view life in terms  of the "time-left-to-live rather than the time since birth."  </P> <P> Frequently, the heightened sense of mortality in the 50s is mitigated by a  feeling of new freedom. The participants in Karp's study reported feeling less  worried about things, more laid back, liberated from major family  responsibilities and wiser as a result of their accumulated experience.  </P> <P> Q: I am a 79-year-old woman who has always been active. Recently, I enrolled in  an exercise class for older people and am now experiencing chronic soreness and  stiffness in both legs. My doctor diagnosed this as osteoarthritis, possibly  triggered by the exercise. Must I now lead a sedentary life, or may I continue  to exercise?  </P> <P> A: Exercise is an important part of any plan to manage osteoarthritis, or  degenerative joint disease. This chronic disease, of unknown cause, involves  the gradual breakdown of tissues that allow proper joint movement. You  mentioned a key symptom of the disease: mild aching or soreness of affected  joints.  </P> <P> Although osteoarthritis can occur in any joint, weight-bearing joints, such as  the knees, hips and spine, are most commonly affected.  </P> <P> According to the Arthritis Foundation, exercise for osteoarthritis sufferers  can help maintain flexibility in the affected joints, restore and preserve the  strength of surrounding muscles, and protect diseased joints from further  damage.  </P> <P> Appropriate exercises usually involve gentle movements that take the affected  joints through their full range of motion. The exercise regimen may also  include isometrics (tightening parts of the body without moving joints) and  non- or low-impact aerobic activity, such as swimming, which promotes  cardiovascular fitness.  </P> <P> Before resuming any exercise program, consult your physician or a  rheumatologist (a physician who specializes in diseases of the connective  tissue, such as arthritis). Your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist  to design a personal exercise plan. In addition to exercise, a comprehensive  plan may include protection for the affected joints, weight control to minimize  stress on weight-bearing joints, heat and cold treatments, and medication to  relieve discomfort.  </P> <P> The Arthritis Foundation offers group exercise programs for people with  arthritis. For further information, contact your local chapter.  </P> <P> Q: I was widowed seven years ago (I'm 58) and am now dating several men. I'm  enjoying my freedom and am not sure I want to remarry. Is single or married  life best?  </P> <P> A: There are pros and cons with either choice. Single life and married life  share similar fulfillments, disappointments, pleasures and problems. When  people feel frustrated, it's usually because they aren't living the way they  would like.  </P> <P> You may prefer to keep relationships open-ended because remarriage would mean  giving up new-found independence. You may not want to support your partner  financially or in ill health, jeopardize your economic benefits or give up your  home.  </P> <P> When unmarried respondents with sexual partners were asked in a Consumer's  Union survey of older adults why they didn't get married, almost half indicated  they preferred things the way they were. The biggest difference between women  and men was that 43% of the women -- but only 16% of the men -- said they  couldn't get married because their sexual partners were already married to  someone else.  </P> <P> If marriage is your goal, someone who is committed to someone else, emotionally  unstable or uninterested in a sustained relationship is not for you.  </P> <P> Today's social climate is more permissive. Think about your views on marriage,  living together and the circumstances under which sexual activity is acceptable  to you. What's important is making choices with which you feel comfortable.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HORSE RACING;  </P> <P> A SILVER ENDING IS EXPECTED TODAY  </P> <P> Several weeks ago, it was predicted in this space that California was primed to  have its fifth consecutive Kentucky Derby winner, and that Silver Ending was  the leading candidate to follow the lead of Ferdinand, Alysheba, Winning Colors  and Sunday Silence.  </P> <P> Now, Derby Day No. 116 has arrived, and there's no reason to make any changes.  </P> <P> A surprising 12-1 on Mike Battaglia's morning line -- the Churchill Downs track  announcer's Eastern bias appears to be showing again -- Silver Ending deserves  to be no worse than third choice behind Summer Squall and Mister Frisky.  </P> <P> Winner of four of his eight starts, the Silver Hawk colt's lone poor  performance came in the San Felipe Handicap on March 18. Hindered by a Santa  Anita track on which passing was impossible all afternoon, he finished ninth,  beaten by 15 1/4 lengths.  </P> <P> At the time, the race seemed to be a fluke, easily dismissed. Everything that  has happened since then gives credence to this line of thinking.  </P> <P> In his next start, the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park, Silver Ending sat well  off the fast pace, slipped through along the rail, then drew away to win by a  bit more than three lengths in a quick 1:48 over a track labeled as good.  </P> <P> Since the April 21 victory, trainer Ron McAnally's sophomore has worked well in  Louisville -- he went six furlongs in 1:13 last Sunday -- and his  come-from-behind style should play well in a Derby where the early pace figures  to be fast.  </P> <P> The way he finished at Oaklawn and in his earlier victories suggests that 1 1/4  miles won't bother him. Neither should an off track, which is considered a  possibility, or the move to Chris McCarron, who is no stranger to Derby  success.  </P> <P> Silver Ending's regular rider, Gary Stevens, is otherwise engaged today. He  will be aboard Mister Frisky, who hasn't made any mistakes in Puerto Rico or  California and will try to stay perfect in Kentucky.  </P> <P> After perfect races in all three of his victories at Santa Anita, the son of  Marsayas figures to be well placed once more in his bid to go 17-0. With his  tactical speed, Mister Frisky is able to get position, and no jockey in the  country is riding better than Stevens.  </P> <P> The nagging doubt about the pride of Puerto Rico is the distance. Even though  he drew away in the Santa Anita Derby, Mister Frisky didn't exactly finish with  a flourish. Still, it's hard to be too critical of a horse that is unbeaten.  </P> <P> Summer Squall is the 7-5 choice on Battaglia's line. His connections should  hope the Storm Bird colt isn't favored at post time. Not since Spectacular  Bid's race in 1979 has the favorite won the Derby, and several of them were  embarrassed. Proud Appeal, the more highly regarded half of an entry, finished  18th in 1981; Snow Chief was 11th in 1986, and Demon's Begone was pulled up  when he bled a year later.  </P> <P> Rain would be a help to Summer Squall, who won the Jim Beam and the Blue Grass  Stakes in the mud. He is unbeaten in four starts on off tracks and is two for  two at Churchill Downs.  </P> <P> On a fast track, his chances would diminish, mainly because he seems suspect at  1 1/4 miles. Also, he will be ridden by Pat Day, who hasn't exactly overwhelmed  anyone with his efforts in the Derby and several other big races.  </P> <P> Although Wayne Lukas will have three starters, Land Rush is his lone hope for a  second Derby victory. The Nijinsky II colt appears to be coming up to his best  race and finally figures to get the kind of fractions in front of him that he  needs. Land Rush had two fast workouts over the track and will benefit from the  distance. Real Cash and Power Lunch are the other Lukas entrants.  </P> <P> Like Silver Ending, Pleasant Tap bounced back from a dull San Felipe showing to  run second in the Blue Grass, but he doesn't seem quite up to this challenge.  Thirty Six Red won the Wood Memorial and the Gotham Stakes in New York, but  that parlay doesn't mean much anymore in terms of Triple Crown success.  Unbridled's main claim to fame was a victory over a weak Florida Derby field.  The others don't really matter.  </P> <P> Royal Touch, who could have been voted the unluckiest horse of the recent Santa  Anita meeting, will seek her first victory in the United States Sunday in the  $100,000 Wilshire Handicap at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Beaten a nose by Brown Bess in the Santa Barbara Handicap after a head loss to  Annoconnor in the Santa Ana, Royal Touch worked a half-mile in :47 2/5 on the  turf Thursday morning. Charlie Whittingham's mare is the 121-pound highweight  and will again be ridden by Russell Baze.  </P> <P> Others in the field include Life at the Top, White Mischief II, Reluctant  Guest, Stylish Star, Beautiful Melody and the entry of Estrella Fuega and Mamma  Rosita.  </P> <P> Successful in three of eight starts in England, Life at the Top dominated an  allowance field on April 19 at Santa Anita. Trained by Neil Drysdale, she will  be getting five pounds from Royal Touch, and Eddie Delahoussaye will be in the  saddle.  </P> <P> Reluctant Guest won the Senorita over this course last spring, Beautiful Melody  is unbeaten in two starts on the grass and Stylish Star has also shown a  fondness for the Inglewood grass.  </P> <P> Olympic Prospect will be heavily favored to win the $110,200 Triple Bend  Handicap today, one of two feature attractions on Hollywood Park's Kentucky  Derby Day program.  </P> <P> John Sadler will also send out Frost Free in the seven-furlong Triple Bend.  Others in the field are Hot Operator, Twombly, Over the Pole, Joe Nasr,  Prospectors Gamble, Timeless Answer and Raise a Stanza.  </P> <P> Somethingdifferent and Warcraft top the field in the $111,050 Spotlight  Breeders' Cup Handicap, which will be run as the sixth race at a mile on the  turf. A 3-year-old son of Green Forest, Somethingdifferent is perfect in two  U.S. turf appearances and has been worse than second only once in 10 races.  Baze will ride for Richard Mandella.  </P> <P> Warcraft will be making his turf debut for Whittingham after finishing third  behind Mister Frisky and Video Ranger in the Santa Anita Derby. Robbie Davis  has the mount.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> The Prime Minister, who was so impressive while breaking his maiden the first  time out for trainer Charlie Whittingham, will try racing against winners,  around two turns and on the turf in today's ninth race. The Deputy Minister  colt beat maidens by eight lengths on April 21 at Santa Anita, covering six  furlongs in 1:09 2/5. . . . Because of the Kentucky Derby, there will be no  early-bird wagering at Hollywood Park. . . . Robbie Davis won three races  Friday, and Julio Garcia swept the double with longshots Hand's Secret ($19)  and Miss Freezing ($21.80), then won the ninth race with Timeless Juan at  $13.40.  </P></p>

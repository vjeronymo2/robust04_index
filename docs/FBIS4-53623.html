			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Construction [MOC] mapped out final  measures designed to impose strict penalties against  construction companies whose directors or employees were  involved in bid-rigging or bribery for public works project.  The MOC already approved a decision that it can order  construction companies to suspend business for one year at most  if they are found guilty of bribery and other crimes in regards  to public works project. However, the MOC firmed up its  decision this time to: 1) consider bid-rigging in violation of  the Antimonopoly Law as subject to business suspension; and 2)  impose more than one month of business suspension in case of  bribery and more than 15 days in case of bid-rigging that  violate the Antimonopoly Law. At the same time, the MOC will  also introduce a minimum period of business suspension. The MOC  wants to publicly announce criteria for the measures by next  week and to start their application as early as August after  about three months notification. The ministry will also inform  local governments, which are in a position to supervise local  contractors, of the measures and to ask them to adopt similar  criteria.    A decision to determine whether a process of selecting a  contract winner is bid-rigging can be made on the basis of  either criminal law or the Antimonopoly Act. Evidence that can  prove a contract winner was selected through discussions is  sufficient to prosecute a suspect on the basis of the  Antimonopoly Act. In a case of prosecution based on criminal  laws, however, it is necessary to prove, among other things,  that companies involved in such a process actually gave or  accepted money. Therefore, very few companies were arrested for  violation of criminal laws. So far, the MOC has only given  written warnings to construction companies who were involved in  bid-rigging in violation of the Antimonopoly Act. However, they  will be ordered to suspend business if the new criteria are  applied. Business suspension will be imposed after a suspected  company accepts the Fair Trade Commission's warning against  bid-rigging or when the same commission determines that  bid-rigging actually took place.    Regarding the issue of introducing a minimum period of  business suspension, the MOC will set a period almost equal to a  period for which a construction company is taken out of a list  of nominated contractors when it's executives or employees are  arrested or indicted for bid-rigging. As for criminal  prosecution regarding bribery and bid-rigging in violation of  criminal laws or the Antimonopoly Law, a construction company  will be ordered, in principle, to suspend business for three  months at least if its executive, who has the right to represent  the company, is found guilty. It will be two months if an  ordinary employee or a branch manager of a company is involved  in bid-rigging. Less than one month of business suspension will  be ordered if an employee of lower rank is involved. A 15-day  business suspension will be ordered regardless of rank if the  Antimonopoly Law is violated. A construction company will be  ordered to suspend business for a maximum of one year if it  fails to take adequate measures to prevent the recurrence of  bid-rigging.    If it is ordered to suspend business, a construction company  branch office will be banned from all activities to win  contracts. In the past, there was no distinction between  privately funded projects and public works as far as the  application of penal measures were concerned. Therefore, only a  maximum of 15 days of business suspension was imposed against  bid-rigging for fear that "a long-term business suspension may  drive companies to bankruptcy."</p>

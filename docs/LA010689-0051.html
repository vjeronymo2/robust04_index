			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEW COLD SPELL TO GIVE GROWERS A FROST TO BEAR  </P> <P> San Diegans may want to replace their raincoats and galoshes with overcoats and  long johns this weekend, when the rain will dissipate and cold weather will  return.  </P> <P> Remnants of a storm from the upper region of the Gulf of Alaska will bring a  mighty chilly weekend to the county, the National Weather Service reported.  </P> <P> The chance of rain will lessen throughout the weekend, with a 40% chance of  showers today and 10% to 20% Saturday.  </P> <P> But a cold front lingering from a storm that brought rain Thursday prompted the  National Weather Service to issue a frost advisory for the weekend, especially  Sunday morning.  </P> <P> Weather Service forecaster Wilbur Shigehara urged growers to take precautions  to protect their crops this weekend.  </P> <P> "We may see frost right to the beaches," Shigehara said. "Del Mar might have  some frost. It looks like a decent weekend coming up. But it's going to be  plenty cold."  </P> <P> The weekend will be partly cloudy and cold, with highs in the middle 50s and  the possibility of some sunshine Sunday.  </P> <P> "The unusual thing about the storm is it's packing a lot of cold air,"  Shigehara said. "Once the storm goes by, it's going to start drying out.  Sunday, there will be a lot more sunshine for the tourists. We're going to have  a pretty cold weekend."  </P> <P> Shigehara said the snow level may drop to 2,000 feet in the mountains.  </P> <P> Coastal lows will dip into the 30s, while the inland area is expected to drop  into the 20s.  </P> <P> The Weather Service also issued a snow advisory in the mountains for today.  Mountain temperatures aren't expected to rise much above freezing through the  weekend, and a few snow flurries are due. Daytime temperatures will reach the  middle 30s, with nightly lows dropping below 20. Gusty mountain winds may reach  30 to 40 m.p.h.  </P> <P> The desert will be partly cloudy with a 10% to 20% chance of showers, but  sunshine is predicted for Sunday. It's expected to be cold and windy in the  desert, with highs in the mid-50s and overnight temperatures from 28 to 35.  </P> <P> The surf is 2 to 4 feet, and the ocean temperature is a brisk 55.  </P></p>

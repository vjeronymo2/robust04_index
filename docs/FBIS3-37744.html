The very fact of the visit is not being  made much of, but the president is known to have spent some two  days in the British capital. The reason bringing the Azeri  leader to the shores of misty Albion, the entire press in the  republic says in one voice, is the desire to "restore his  health" and "consult English physicians." But even if a visit  to physicians takes place after all, the real purpose of the  visit is obviously not that. The Azerbaijan president, one may  suppose, is to agree on terms of the contract with the  international oil concern led by British Petroleum  (KOMMERSANT-DAILY wrote last on its terms on 17 Feb).    The republic's press, controlled by the authorities, also  spill the true aims of Aliyev's trip: Shortly before the visit,  the newspaper AZARLYK mulled over how successfully Aliyev would  be able "to play the oil card." Besides, the Great Britain  visit is a logical continuation of the Turkey voyage 10 days  earlier. Discussed in Ankara were the terms of the Turkish  side's participation in the international consortium and the  route for the projected pipeline along which oil will flow to  Turkish terminals bypassing Novorossiysk (Russia plans to export  oil across its own territory).    The other problem Aliyev intends to discuss in London is a  Karabakh settlement. Great Britain has lately been increasingly  active in this process (given the fact it is not a member of the  CSCE "Minsk Group" on Nagorno-Karabakh). This is welcomed by  Baku, which seeks independence from Moscow in this process.    Among the delicate questions Aliyev has to solve today is  foreign assistance for his army, in whose ranks are now fighting  1,000 Afghan mujahidin and an unknown number of mercenaries from  neighboring countries. Turkey has provided 300 military  advisers, some 100 of whom are with the units in the field).  True, Ankara denies this fact. The advisers are supposed to  train Azeris in the use of Western military hardware which is  being supplied through the two main channels -- from Afghanistan  (via Iran) and from Turkey. Baku has recently bought 50 tanks  from Kiev. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned from Azeri diplomatic  sources that the question of sending British military advisers  to Azerbaijan may also be discussed in London. Those providing  this information specify, however, that advisers from Great  Britain would take no part in combat operations and would only  be doing "teaching work."    By internationalizing the situation around the war against  the Armenians, Aliyev is also solving the problems of  consolidating his own power. He is balancing between a big  number of international partners (including Russia) while trying  to firm up his shaken positions. Today, a whole series of  regions in the republic (not counting 20 percent of the  territory occupied by Armenians) are not controlled by the  president. For example, the sole master of Azerbaijan's west is  not Aliyev but his "premier rival," Suret Guseynov, who has  armed formations, outside the national defense forces, including  armored vehicles. Thus, the Azeri press is quite right: Aliyev  is off to London to really "restore his health." Political  health, that is.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / BJP challenges the Indian government over early election INDIA'S opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has stepped up its confrontation against the ruling Congress party, accusing it of 'utter failure on the political, social and economic fronts'. At a weekend meeting in the temple town of Bhubaneswar in the eastern state of Orissa, the BJP directed party workers to be prepared for elections in the near future. It was especially strident in its criticism of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao's economic reform programme, which it had earlier supported. The Congress party retorted that it was fully prepared to meet the challenge of a mid-term election. It said it was 'not afraid of the BJP's hollow threats,' and that Mr Rao's policy of consensus politics should not be misconstrued as weakness. The BJP lacks the strength in the lower house of parliament to topple the Rao government. No other political party is thought seriously to want an election so soon after the general election last year. The BJP accused the government of 'practically no performance' in the agrarian and industrial sectors, and of having failed to increase exports or control inflation and foreign debt. It said rises in petroleum and fertiliser prices had played havoc in the economy. Mr L K Advani, leader of the opposition in the lower house and de facto head of the BJP, said his party was confident that it could convince the people that the Congress government, 'with its dismal record in Kashmir, Assam, Punjab and Ayodhya, could not hold the country together'. The Ayodhya temple issue, which has contributed to the BJP's growth in influence over the last two years, threatens to reach another flash-point on December 6, with Hindu militants planning to resume construction of the temple in defiance of court orders.</p>

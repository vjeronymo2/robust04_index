			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock; place </F> and date not given: "We Need Security Zones Everywhere"]    [Text] The cease-fire in Sarajevo is the first positive  approach in this bloody Bosnian war after a long time. Now  there must be a "follow-up": A conclusion must be the  establishment of additional security zones -- which we have been  demanding for one year: Bihac, Tuzla, Gorazde, Srebrenica.  There must be military reactions to every violation of these UN  protection zones. This means that NATO has to continue to  maintain its operational readiness at any time. If two to three  real security zones are created -- as has, for example, now been  achieved in Sarajevo -- a new, large-scale peace conference  would be conceivable. However, a concept has not yet been  developed.    The problem of Sarajevo has not been solved yet by the  observation of the ultimatum. Effective humanitarian help has  to be organized now. After the conclusion of negotiations with  the European Union, I will increasingly devote myself to the  Bosnian conflict. At present, I am making intensive efforts to  gain partners for a children's hospital in Sarajevo and for an  action that enables children from Sarajevo to relax in Vienna.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ZONING STUDY FOR SCHOOL LAND  </P> <P> In an effort to avoid controversy, the Torrance City Council told the city  staff last week to study how the former Columbia School site and surplus land  at the Southern California Regional Occupational Center should be zoned before  the properties are sold.  </P> <P> The 5-acre elementary school site on 186th Street, which is zoned for public  use, became vacant in June. The 2 acres of surplus property at the vocational  school on Crenshaw Boulevard is zoned for manufacturing.  </P> <P> The Columbia site is bounded by a residential neighborhood on the north and  west and by businesses on the south and east. The vocational school land is  bounded by Charles Wilson Park on the north, Torrance High School on the south  and east and Crenshaw on the west.  </P> <P> The council recommended the study to avoid a situation they faced with the  former Meadow Park School site on 230th Street west of Hawthorne Boulevard. A  developer purchased the land before the zoning was changed from its former  "public use" zoning.  </P> <P> Since the land did not have new zoning restrictions, the developer tried to get  the city's approval for a high-density residential project. Neighbors objected  and negotiations dragged on for nearly two years before a lower-density project  was approved.  </P> <P> A staff report is expected at Tuesday's council meeting.  </P></p>

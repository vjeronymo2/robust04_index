			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, "vice chairman of </F> the Democratic Republic of Yemen Presidential Council"; place  and date not given]    [Text] Dear brother citizens, I am honored to speak to  you, in order to inform you as to what is happening in the  country. On the political level, President 'Ali Salim al-Bid  has played an extraordinary role, politically and militarily, in  the mobilization in Hadramawt and Shabwah. Regarding  international contacts, Brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas left  yesterday evening, accompanied by Muhsin Muhammad Abu-Bakr Bin  Farid, the deputy prime minister and minister of planning and  development; and brother Salih 'Ubayd Ahmad, the deputy prime  minister and minister of transportion; for a number of Arab  countries, beginning with Saudi Arabia, where they are now.  Brother 'Abdallah al-Asnaj will go to a few countries and then  to New York, to work together with Dr. 'Abd-al-Aziz al-Dali, to  build the pillars of the fledgling Democratic Republic of Yemen.    At the military level we are, unfortunately, fighting a  brutal enemy; we say a brutal enemy knowing that the people in  the north are brothers of ours in Arabism, Islam, and in the  homeland, but the officials of Sanaa are waging this unjustified  attack in the name of a unity which could, in any way, be on the  skulls of the people and through [words indistinct]. They  issued orders to destroy all villages in their way. Our people,  the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, and the  volunteers, led by the hero Brother Haytham Qasim Tahir, and all  commanders of axes and commanders of all the armies,  particularly the air force, are resisting. [passage omitted]    We did not initiate secession, it was Sanaa's rulers who  started the separation when they rejected all the initiatives  calling for a cease-fire. [passage indistinct]    We are the advocates of unity, and we will, God willing,  build our Republic as a real model of justice and equality. We  will unite with any ruler from Sanaa, provided he sets up the  same regime on the same bases and principles. We will give our  lives and blood so that our people are not subjected to  despotism, injustice, and corruption.    One more point: We would like to send a message to our  brothers in the Democratic Republic of Yemen, some of whom have  joined us, and some who are still siding with the other party  for either few dirhams, or because of old old scores. [passage  indistinct] We said why do we not [word indistinct] a historic  reconciliation between the people of the Democratic Republic of  Yemen. [passage indistinct] We warned many times against  ignoring the UN Security Council's resolution, but our brothers,  the rulers of Sanaa, refuse to observe the UN Security Council's  resolutions, or any call from any quarter, whether Arab or [word  indistinct].    We call on those fraternal and brotherly countries to use  their pressure and influence on those who could not get rid of  their complexes, and who failed to comprehend the meaning of  contemporary times, defying international legitimacy -- as if  past lessons taught to other countries were not enough.    We will fight to the last inch for our country, we will not  allow the occupation of our country, and we will resist them  with all the force we have. We realize that our people are  standing behind us, and that they will fight beside us, whatever  the price. [passage omitted]    I would like to make an important point: We in this state --  president, government, and people, will resist [passage  indistinct]. We do not want to kill, or fight, but we have the  right to defend every inch of our land. On this occasion, I  call on the youngsters in [words indistinct] to unite with us.  Popular resistance groups have begun being formed, and they  will be very well organized; they will go to the fronts and we  will repulse the enemy from Aden, Lahij, Abyan, and Shabwah.    Dear citizens, be sure that we would not have taken this  stance if we were not fully confident of Brother President 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, and if we we were not sure that 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih -- we wish he could see reason -- has lost the way and  waged this barbaric war, which we will not allow to continue.

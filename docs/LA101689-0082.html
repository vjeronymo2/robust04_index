			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P>  ART REVIEW ;  </P> <P> ART CATHY CURTIS;  </P> <P> LAGUNA HOMAGE TO PIONEER DAN LUTZ PROVES EVOCATIVE  </P> <P> One of the things the Laguna Art Museum does best is to remind us of minor but  worthy Southern California artists whose vision helped shape the tone of the  fledgling art scene during the early decades of this century.  </P> <P> One of these figures is Dan Lutz, who came to Los Angeles in 1932 from Illinois  to teach at USC. In a pocket-size exhibit at the museum (through Dec. 31), a  portrait by his friend, Paul Sample, shows Lutz playing his bassoon with an air  of fierce concentration, his brows arched and a shock of hair working its way  loose above his forehead.  </P> <P> Although the setting seems to be his home (a woman -- his wife Dorothy? -- can  be seen cooking in the kitchen), the wiry artist is neatly turned out in a suit  and tie. In a self-portrait a year or so earlier, Lutz, 26, favored the  dun-colored beret and open blue work shirt of the artist-proletariat.  </P> <P> Lutz's mature work included scenes from everyday life, along with ecstatic,  gestural paintings of gospel music-making. Although partial deafness kept him  from a music career, Lutz's schooling included music-conservatory training as  well as art school. A travel fellowship in Europe exposed him to contemporary  art; he studied briefly in the studio of Andre Lhote, a French painter and art  theoretician whose work was influenced by Cubism.  </P> <P> By the time Lutz settled in Los Angeles, he had developed a moody vein of  realism. In his 1936 painting, "Beach Scene," the sky is a sick yellow with an  angry-looking black cloud, the ocean is a threatening blackish-blue and the  crowd is sparse.  </P> <P> A red passenger cart sits idle. On benches nearby, a pair of featureless old  men prop themselves up at askew angles, and a whitefaced woman with a long nose  tends to a baby who sits up in a carriage as stiffly as the subject of an  American primitive painting. A tall, thin man in white stands off by himself,  pinched and irresolute. This figure crops up in several of the paintings of  this period, so it's tempting to see him as a self-portrait.  </P> <P> In "End of the Line," a watercolor from the next year, Lutz abstracts the  shapes of pairs of idle trolley cars into pale-green rectangles. Three oddly  miniaturized conductors trudge past their resting vehicles, heads bowed in  weariness or dejection. The long shadows of the late afternoon also suggest a  symbolic "shadow" -- of the cold hand of industrialization imprisoning people  in routine jobs.  </P> <P> The exhibition brochure essay by assistant curator Susan Anderson mentions  nothing about Lutz's political beliefs; it would have been interesting, in this  context, to know what they were.  </P> <P> Toward the end of the 1930s, Lutz began incorporating carnival and circus  scenes into his work. In "Carnival," broken white brushwork against the  sapphire sky gives a giant Ferris wheel a magical gleam. The viewer peers from  the darkness into the froth of lights and action inside the charmed circle of  booths. Thick white and jewel-color snippets of paint conjure up a gay,  exuberant mood without actually spelling out the details.  </P> <P> Again, the stark light and dark contrasts lead one to ponder possible symbolic  intent. Did Lutz view such events as lone bright spots for people whose lives  had been crushed by the Great Depression, or was he simply celebrating the  dazzle and energy of a popular American phenomenon?  </P> <P> Lutz's paintings of blacks coincided with other "white man's" ventures into  black culture, such as George Gershwin's 1935 musical "Porgy and Bess" (based  on the play by DuBose Heyward) and Vincent Minnelli's 1943 movie musical "Cabin  in the Sky."  </P> <P> At the same time, pioneering Supreme Court rulings were guaranteeing equal (if  still separate) railroad passenger facilities for blacks (1941) and declaring  the unconstitutionality of whites-only primary elections (1944). And the first  Congress of Racial Equality sit-in took place in a Chicago restaurant in 1943.  </P> <P> It was, in other words, a time when equal rights remained a distant dream, and  blacks usually were still portrayed in popular art forms as ever happy. Lutz's  renderings of blacks were not free of caricature, a point Anderson mentions but  does not pursue in relation to other works of the era. On the other hand, some  of Lutz's white folks were caricatured too.  </P> <P> In any case, his interests lay specifically in the feverish transports of black  spirituals. In "I Got a Harp," comma-like dashes of yellow paint sketch in the  boneless arms of the harpist plying her golden instrument. Against the glowing,  green-black space, a constellation of black heads wearing misty green gowns  appear to be a gospel choir. They seem to be gathered at a river, where (in the  lower right-hand corner) a horizontal figure is being baptized.  </P> <P> The painting combines hints of a real scene and real people with the ethereal  aura created by the passionate swell of the music. What music? Well, we have to  fill it in for ourselves. But the fever-brightness of the colors and the sight  of the massed, dematerialized figures are powerfully suggestive.  </P> <P> In other works, Lutz conjured up a celestial three-horse chariot rising above  the robed chorus ("Spiritual Chorus") and a fantastic, jewel-colored parade of  indistinct figures riding on mules, curving into the glowing, aquamarine  landscape ("The Glory Road").  </P> <P> But later in the '40s, the artist moved on to new territory. Judging --  inadequately, to be sure -- by the two examples in the show, his new  fascination with mythology lacked the personality of the earlier work.  "Neptune" seems little more than an excuse to paint with thicker, more  impenetrable crusts of paint. "Spring Fete," with its forest revelers in  various stages of undress, looks rather like a wishful libertine dream,  dutifully disguised as a classical theme.  </P> <P> In any case, it's a pity we don't get more of a handle on Lutz, whose themes  suggest there was a lot more going on in his mind than simply setting paint to  canvas. The show stands in marked contrast with the museum's other exhibit -- a  huge, lumbering survey of paintings by Granville Redmond, organized by the  Oakland Museum and outfitted with a lavish catalogue.  </P> <P> Redmond, born in 1871, was another member of the seemingly endless ranks of  California landscape painters active in the early 20th Century. He specialized  in scenes of fields speckled with red poppies. The catalogue says the landscape  appealed to him. But more important, scenes of poppy fields were what the  public wanted to buy.  </P> <P> So here they are: "California Wild Flowers," "Pond with Poppies," "Poppies and  Lupines," "Field of Poppies," "Poppy Field Landscape," "California's Flowering  Hills," "California Landscape with Poppies," and on and on and on. Pleasant  enough in small doses, perhaps, but tiresome in a crowd.  </P> <P> Redmond also painted landscapes at dusk or dawn or in fogbound moments when the  atmosphere had the dreamy, misty, "poetic" quality sought after by Tonalist  artists. More acutely afflicted with deafness than Lutz, Redmond is popularly  supposed to have revealed his auditory solitude in these works.  </P> <P> A few of them escape sentimental landscape cliches and stand on their own as  works of modern art. Best of all is an undated painting simply called  "Landscape," from the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, in  which pale lacy trees in several shades of green rise up like flat cut-outs  against the sky.  </P> <P> This is not a neat, clean transcription of nature for people to admire in their  living rooms. It's a painting about what a certain corner of the world felt  like to a particular artist and how he colored it with his own fancies --  remade it, in fact, to conform to his cast of mind and sense of formal values.  </P> <P> But collectors of Redmond's day did not care for that sort of thing,  apparently. And he had bills to pay.  </P> <P>  "The Spiritual Series: Dan Lutz and the American Scene" (through Dec. 31) and  "Granville Redmond" (through Nov. 19) are at the Laguna Art Museum, 307 Cliff  Drive, Laguna Beach. Hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday.  Admission: $2 adults, $1 students and seniors, free for children under 12.  Information: (714) 494-6531.  </P> <P> </P></p>

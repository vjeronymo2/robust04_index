			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Gaza witnesses second day of riots Palestinian students rioted in Gaza for a second day in a row yesterday, following an upsurge in militant feeling after the killing of three Islamic kidnappers in an Israeli raid last week and an internal Palestinian crackdown on the fundamentalist organisation, Julian Ozanne reports. The students, supporters of the Hamas Islamic group responsible for the kidnapping and killing of an Israeli soldier, stoned a joint patrol of Israeli and Palestinian police and overran an Israeli military checkpoint. The continuing riots reveal the bitter divide which has emerged between Mr Yassir Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organisation and Hamas since the kidnapping crisis. In an effort to calm the tension, Mr Arafat yesterday began releasing some of the 300 Hamas activists he arrested last week and detained a PLO general who ordered his troops to fire in the air during a Hamas demonstration at the Gaza central prison on Saturday. Mr Arafat's advisers have warned the PLO leader against giving in to Israeli and western pressure to deal a decisive blow to Hamas, which could risk civil war. But relations between the PLO and Hamas, which opposes peace with Israel and is bent on the destruction of the Jewish state, have reached an all-time low and have left deep uncertainty about political stability in the Gaza Strip.</p>

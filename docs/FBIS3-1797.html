Secretary of State Warren Christopher of the United States,  which brokered the talks, said the agreement "shows that peace  is possible."    The agreement was signed at the U.S. State Department by  Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Croatian Republic's  Foreign Minister Mate Granic and Bosnian Croat Leader Kresimir  Zubak.    Under the agreement, the federation would be made up of  cantons where the majority of residents are either Muslim or  Croat and both groups would have equal rights.    The federation, which according to the U.S. initiative would  eventually combine with a Serb republic, would have a central  government taking care of foreign affairs, commerce and overall  defense.    And the cantons would be responsible for local police,  education, culture, housing, public facilities and radio and  television.    The federation's legislature would include two chambers, and  lawmakers would elect the president and vice president. The  Croats and Muslims would alternate yearly in holding the two  positions.</p>

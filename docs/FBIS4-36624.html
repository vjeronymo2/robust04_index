			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri  yesterday received Mohammad Kazem Khonsari, the Iranian foreign  minister's adviser and head of the Middle East and North Africa  Department, at the head of a diplomatic delegation accompanied  by Iranian Ambassador to Lebanon Hamayon 'Alizadeh.    Khonsari, who earlier visited President Ilyas al-Hirawi,  Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri, Foreign Minister Faris  Buwayz, and some Islamic spiritual leaders, said after the  meeting: "I conveyed to his excellency condolences for the  martyrs who died in the latest savage Zionist aggression against  Lebanon. We then discussed regional and international issues as  well as bilateral relations which we agreed to enhance and  strengthen with joint cooperation in all fields."    He added: "We discussed developments in the region,  especially the repeated attacks on Lebanon by the Zionist enemy.  There was identity of views and we agreed that the Zionist  enemy cannot influence the Lebanese policy with attacks,  threats, and troublemaking, nor can it affect the Lebanese  people's resistance which is fully supported by the Lebanese  Government." He also said that "if anything, all the (Israeli)  attacks and threats increase the people's and government's unity  and solidarity against the Zionist enemy. We are with the  resistance which is a legitimate right of the Lebanese people  and which has the government's support."    On the rumor that some Iranians were among the victims of  the  Israeli raid on a Hizballah position in 'Ayn Kawkab east of  Ba'labakk, Khonsari said: "That is not the case at all. This  is the first time we have heard such talk."    Asked if he had any information about the Iranian diplomats  who were kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982, he replied: "I have no  information on that. We expect the Lebanese Government to  explore the fate of these hostages as it deems fit, particularly  as they were diplomats kidnapped on this territory. We have no  accurate knowledge. The Iranian people, the Iranian Government,  and the families of those brothers all always await positive  news about them and the necessary measures to free them."    On Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's assertion that the  four kidnapped people are in Israel, Khonsari said that "one  possibility is that they are alive and held prisoner by the  Zionist enemy."    He said that Iran is ready "for comprehensive cooperation in  all fields desired by Lebanon."    Meanwhile, a delegation from the International Political  Studies Center attached to the Iranian Foreign Ministry headed  by Khadem Haqiqat has visited the Lebanese University and  discussed with its president, Dr. As'ad Diyab, the possibility  of direct scientific dialogue between the people concerned. The  delegation also visited the Arab Information Center.    Elsewhere, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz said yesterday that  the temporary truce between Lebanon and Israel does not mean  that the latter will stop its aggressions against Lebanon. He  added that "the Lebanese people's unity worries Israel and the  latter has always tried to drive a wedge between the Lebanese  state and the resistance but we will not fall into that trap."    Editors' doyen Milhim Karam quoted him as saying that  Iranian  Envoy Khonsari's visit to Lebanon "has been useful and has  somewhat contributed to the enhancement of trust between the  state and the resistance. Iran is known to have good relations  with the Lebanese resistance and that is why it has used that  weight to effectively contribute to the consolidation of the  Lebanese entity on foundations that cannot collapse."    Buwayz believes that the United States "is not playing the  role required of it as a mediator, conference sponsor, and  effective element in the Madrid conference and the entire peace  process. It is just being a postman but that is not its role.  It should be playing an effective part." He expressed the hope  that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher "would bring  clear U.S. proposals."    He said that he "did not agree with those calling for  withdrawal from the negotiations because withdrawal would play  into Israeli hands and we will not do it." He praised the work  and effective presence of the Lebanese Army in the south, adding  that "we are not stepping up the Army's presence for fear of an  Israeli strike but the Army has been there for two years and  that has moral, practical, and military significance."</p>

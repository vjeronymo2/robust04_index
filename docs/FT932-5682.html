			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: GrandMet advances The change in sentiment around Grand Metropolitan gathered pace, with the shares advancing a further 13 to 405p in good volume of 3.6m. UBS became the latest broker to turn more positive on the stock, which also received attention from US buyers who, said dealers, were rekindling their interest in the UK drinks and foods group. Ironically, drinks specialists said it was the recovery in the US economy which was one of the reasons underpinning the shares' recent strength. There was also a general feeling that the bad news on the stock - fears over the threat to its brands, poor sentiment in the domestic brewing market, and the threat of a drinks tax in the US, among others - was out and that the consequent underperformance had led to the stock looking cheap. Mr Kevin Feeny at Henderson Crosthwaite, who yesterday reiterated his positive stance, said GrandMet was still around 10 per cent too cheap relative to other drinks stocks. 'With its geographical business spread, GrandMet is well placed for the US recovery, while currency benefits will also come through strongly this year,' he added.</p>

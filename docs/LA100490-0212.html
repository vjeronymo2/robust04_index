			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: TRIP TO THEATER WORTH AN EXTRA PENCE;  </P> <P> LONDON PLAYGOING: RICHARD HARRIS AND DEREK JACOBI GIVE PERFORMANCES THAT THE  STAGE IS MADE FOR. THE LATEST ALAN AYCKBOURN HAS A DAZZLINGLY NASTY PREMISE.  </P> <P> Inflation is as universal as Burger King and Pizza Hut, which now raise their  garish facades everywhere in the land of Dickens, Sherlock Holmes and  Christopher Wren.  </P> <P> Memory, which does have a merry way of telescoping 30 years into several fewer  than that, says that a pound or two or three got you a good seat at any London  play. That was within 10 bucks, and the memory was old but accurate. The scale  here is still better than in New York, where I recently paid $50 for a balcony  seat to "City of Angels" and $45 for an equally distant view of Maggie Smith.  </P> <P> I winced, but in the end didn't care because both evenings were magical  experiences. A few evenings ago here, it cost the equivalent of $30 to see  Richard Harris in Luigi Pirandello's "Henry IV" and about the same to see Derek  Jacobi in Jean-Paul Sartre's reworking of "Kean" by Alexandre Dumas pere. Those  were orchestra seats. I spent $18 to see Alan Ayckbourn's "Man of the Moment"  from the far reaches of the balcony.  </P> <P> Two out of three wasn't bad, having nothing to do with price.  </P> <P> Harris and Jacobi, in plays that are both studies of illusion and reality and  the wavery line that divides genius from madness, give the kind of all-stops,  whispery-thundery, state-of-the-actor's-art performances that the stage is made  for and that the customers willingly pay the price to see.  </P> <P> In the Pirandello, the time is more or less now -- the civilian sane arrive in  street dress or evening garb -- but Harris is acting out a yearslong charade as  Henry IV of Germany, dead these many centuries. There is a throne, helmeted  guards in attendance, though they sneak the odd cigarette when no one is  looking.  </P> <P> Is he mad, or too sane to accept the pains of the memories that go with sanity?  Harris, imperious and childish, arms frozen in gestures of the deranged, voice  a roar or a squeak, histrionic and then coldly, accusingly logical, is an  astonishment. What makes the portrayal so telling is his sharp control. He may  be the madman acting, or the sane man feigning madness, or the sane man finally  gone mad to stay. But he is never the actor acting merely to display his gifts.  It is a breathtaking display by an actor who has always been powerful (remember  "This Sporting Life"?) but seldom so perfectly disciplined.  </P> <P> Edmund Kean (born 1787 or thereabouts, died 1833) was a legendary Shakespearean  actor. Another legendary Shakespearean, Philip Kemble, on seeing Kean's  Othello, was said to have said, "I did not see Mr. Kean; I saw Othello; and  further I shall not play the part again."  </P> <P> As Dumas, Sartre and Jacobi portray him, Kean is a roistering swinger in a  tradition later to be sustained, let's say, by John Barrymore. More than in  Barrymore, however, the line between the player and the role played, between  the illusion and the reality, grows ever thinner, like the line between genius  and madness, which Harris has been treading like a frayed tightrope. (There are  pre-echoes, so to speak, of Albert Finney as the old trouper, at the end of his  storms, in Ronald Harwood's "The Dresser.")  </P> <P> In the end, Jacobi, whose Kean has been witty, dashing, grandiose, a wonderful  roarer, is a poignant, even pathetic, confusion figure, probably mad, as Kean  seems to have been at the end. Kemble's comment (not in the text) is cruelly  apt; if the audience has taken Kean as Othello, then who at last is Kean, and  does he exist? It is an existential question, as Sartre intended it to be.  </P> <P> It is also a marvelous occasion of theater, with a wistful quartet (violin,  accordion, clarinet and cornet) in clownish costumes playing the entr'actes and  setting a tone at once mocking and melancholy.  </P> <P> Jacobi, who has been so good so often, can never have displayed more of his  reach as an actor.  </P> <P> The awesomely prolific Alan Ayckbourn's latest play, "Man of the Moment," is a  comedy upon television, and television's way of creating its own reality to  suit its own needs, regardless of whatever the true reality of a situation may  be.  </P> <P> A ruthlessly ambitious producer is launching a series about reunions. The first  confronts a bank robber with the teller who defied him during a robbery 17  years earlier. The robber subsequently wrote a repenting bestseller and is now  a TV talk-show host.  </P> <P> It is a dazzlingly nasty premise, not least because the robber is now a  millionaire, vacationing in snarling opulence on Majorca, where the play takes  place. The bank teller is still little better than a clerk, married to the  once-beautiful woman who worked beside him in the bank and was savagely  disfigured by the robber's shotgun blast.  </P> <P> The clerk, who seems fatuously accepting and uncomplaining of the world as it  is, injustices and all, was originally played by Michael Gambon ("The Singing  Detective") and you could only wish to have seen how he handled it.  </P> <P> As it is, the play is nearing the end of its run; the crowd was sparse. The  feeling was one I've had in the past when touring companies limp into Los  Angeles from Des Moines or Grand Junction, the jokes broadened to reach the  dimmest customer in the crowd, the subtleties of text long since swept into the  wings.  </P> <P> "Man of the Moment" builds up a certain plot tension: Surely the worm will turn  and the vile TV man will get his comeuppance. Well, yes and no, depriving us of  the satisfaction a farce -- which this is -- can provide. But television, and  its self-absorption with its own technical and editorial needs, to the  exclusion of all else, gets off almost unscathed, a worthy target hit with a  whipped cream pie instead of an arrow.  </P> <P> It's hard to know whether to blame Nigel Planer, a well-regarded actor who  followed Gambon, or the Ayckbourn text, which gives him so little chance to  suggest the wrath beneath the wimp.  </P></p>

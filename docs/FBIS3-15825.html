He stressed the need for legally confirm that the  Kaliningrad  region, Russia's most western area separated from the rest of  the country by Lithuania and Belarus, belongs to Russia as  successor to the former Soviet Union, to which the region was  handed over after World War II as part of former East Prussia.  At present, the Kaliningrad region's population makes up about  one million Russians.    Shumeyko also pointed to another aspect of the problem, that  of a greater autonomy and economic freedom the enclave should  gain to ensure for its residents living conditions comparable  with those in the rest of Russia.    The house speaker intends to employ the Federation Council's  right for a legislative initiative and move a law on the  Kaliningrad region's status in the parliament's lower house, the  State Duma, which certainly has no doubts about the region's  belonging to Russia.</p>

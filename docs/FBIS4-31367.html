			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dragan Djuric: "False Hopes"] </F>   [Text] They have already begun to beat the band about the  success of the second phase of the Avramovic  program--invigoration of production. The key argument used is  the figure of no less than a 21.3-percent increase in Yugoslav  output between February and March.    In Montenegro, however, the "first successful results" are  proving to be a pure illusion. That is, whereas in Serbia the  March level of output really was 22.6 percent higher than in  February, the Montenegrin economy is continuing to record a drop  of about 6.5 percent.    The program for the country's monetary reform and economic  recovery, recalls Miodrag Causevic, vice president of the  Montenegrin Chamber of Commerce, was commissioned as a project  by the Serbian Government and the president of the Republic of  Serbia, and only later, on grounds that it was the best of all  the stabilization programs that have been requested, was it  submitted to the federal government and almost thrust upon it.  Even Prime Minister Kontic did not immediately accept it with  open arms, while the Montenegrin Government, Causevic recalls,  made a number of objections, suggestions, and warnings. On the  so-called team of some 40 experts headed by Dr. Avramovic, there  was only one man from Montenegro--Dr. Janko Radulovic, secretary  of the republic Secretariat for Development. The objections of  the Government of Montenegro pertained above all to the need to  respect specific structural needs and interests of the  Montenegrin economy, which had no place in the Avramovic  program. In that connection, they particularly accentuated the  problems of the maritime industry and tourism.    "The main reasons why the Montenegrin economy has not felt  more essentially the favorable aspects of the functioning of the  Avramovic program up to this point," Causevic says, "lie in its  more pronounced dependence on exports and the dominant role of  the heavy industrial sectors."    The best example of the impotence of any measures of an  internal nature is offered by the situation in maritime  shipping. In the best of times, this industry brought Montenegro  about one-fifth of its total inflow of foreign exchange. Its  importance to this republic can also be seen from the fact that  if Montenegro were viewed as an independent state, it would be  the strongest maritime power in the world if the size of its  maritime fleet were compared to the size of the country! Today,  its fleet of 38 vessels, with a total capacity of almost 1  million metric tons, is tied up and captive, with immense daily  costs, which are becoming more and more difficult to cover.    Radomir Mugosa, secretary of the general association of the  maritime industry in the Montenegrin Chamber of Commerce, points  out that two companies--Jugooceania of Kotor and Prekookeanska  plovidba of Bar--although before adoption of Resolution No. 820  they were registered under a foreign flag, were literally caught  in the mousetrap of the sanctions. Not a single vessel is  sailing, some have been anchored by the banks as a guarantee for  collection of debts, others are tied up at the dock under the  pressure of the sanctions, while almost half of the fleet "hid"  in China, which it dares not leave.    Last year, these companies had to sell four vessels in order  to cover current costs. At the same time, the empty docks in the  port of Bar, with a capacity for handling almost five million  tons of cargo a year, and the shipyards in Bijela, which can  repair about 100 vessels a year, are gloomy. One part of the  port has been taken over by the fleet of the Yugoslav Navy, and  the launches with which the Italians are carrying on a smuggling  operation (mainly tobacco) with Montenegro are repaired from  time to time in the shipyard. And that is all.    There is no chance at all, Mugosa explains, for this branch  of the economy, which has immense importance to Montenegro, to  get on its feet unless the sanctions are removed.    The electric power industry, which has a share of 22 percent  in total Montenegrin output, coal production, which accounts for  15 percent of output, and ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy,  that is, the Niksic Steel Mill and the Podgorica Aluminum  Combine, whose share is greater than 20 percent, are also  suffering great troubles. In the Montenegrin Chamber of  Commerce, they point out that the Avramovic program helps these  industries only indirectly and that some growth of production  might be expected only if small alternative production programs  are started, using unsuccessful capacity that already exists.    The Podgorica Aluminum Combine, for example, has managed to  maintain production at about 40 percent of capacity, while at  the heart of the combine, the electrolysis operation is  operating at only one-fifth of capacity. The value of the  aluminum produced and held in inventory is estimated at about  $100 million. The need for alkalies, resins, and petroleum coke  (all imported) is so great that it is almost impossible to  obtain them through the usual smuggling channels. What is more,  there is also some doubt about obtaining alumina from Zvornik  the because of exceptional increase in shipping costs since  adoption of the new dinar. If we include in this survey Obod of  Cetinje, which is operating at about 15 percent of capacity and  importing all of 70 percent of components for production, then  we get a clearer idea of what it means to say "dependence of the  economy on imports," and therefore the significance of isolation.    Increasingly frequent charges are also coming from the  largest Montenegrin firm to the effect that instead of  cooperation in carrying out programs for economic recovery, they  are encountering disloyal competition on the part of firms in  Serbia. For instance, at the Niksic Steel Mill they say that  firms from Serbia are importing more and more steel on the basis  of various compensation deals, although the Niksic collective  has on inventory more than 13,000 tons of various types of  quality steels. At the same time, scrap iron is being exported  from Serbia more and more, although Niksic is shutting down more  and more frequently and for longer and longer periods of time.    Anton Kastrati, director of the salt plant at Ulcinj,  explicitly accuses Serbia of importing 50,000 tons of salt in  violation of a contract and thus jeopardizing this year's salt  production. And the warehouses are full.    At Jugopetrol in Kotor they also have objections. It is  extremely difficult to obtain fuel abroad, and it is not  uncommon for it to cost sixfold more than it would have  otherwise. Customs duties are added to that, so that intolerably  high fuel costs are being imposed on the economy. It is as  though Yugoslav sources of petroleum do not exist for  Montenegro. Recently, none other than Prime Minister Milo  Djukanovic said that Montenegro was not getting even a drop from  domestic production.    All in all, the Montenegrin economy is on its knees. For  years now, its production has been dropping faster and faster  and farther and farther. If the 1992 level of output is taken as  the basis of comparison, then what was achieved in the  relatively peaceful year of prewar 1989 would stand at 76, and  last year's results at minus 60. The level of output at the  moment, compared to March of last year, which was disastrous, is  down about 20 percent. To be sure, the statistics show that some  industries with a total share of less than some 10 percent in  output have nevertheless come to life.    In spite of Avramovic's optimism, the Montenegrins are  worried about how to keep production from dying altogether.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Patent Office is scheduled to amend the Patent  Act in order to strengthen the system for protecting inventors'  rights. The pillars of the amendment are: 1) the term of  validity of the patent right should be extended by five years to  20 years; 2) stricter conditions should be applied for invoking  the "compulsory implementation right"--which allows the  government to order a patent holder to allow a third person to  use his patent for welfare purposes; and 3) the application  limits of the patent should be extended. The Patent Office  plans to enact the amended act by January 1995, when an  agreement reached on trade-related aspects of intellectual  property rights negotiations (TRIP) under the Uruguay Round of  (GATT's) multilateral trade talks late last year will come into  effect. The Patent Office plans to submit a bill for amending  the act to an extraordinary Diet session in autumn.    In the current act, it is specified that the term of patent  "shall be 15 years from the date of the public announcement, but  shall not be over 20 years from the date of application for  patent." In the amended act, it will be specified that the term  of patent "shall expire after 20 years from the date of  application."    Therefore, the maximum limits of a patent will be virtually  changed from 15 years to 20 years, and with this change, an  inventor's--companies or individuals--income from patent  royalties will increase. The amended act will be applied to a  patent request which is under examination now.    Under the current act, as far as patent-related medical  supplies are concerned, it takes about 10 years for a  pharmaceutical company to merchandise patented products, and in  many cases the patent term expires soon after patented products  are put on sale. It is expected that pharmaceutical companies  will benefit from the amended act because it costs approximately  10-15 billion yen for them to develop a new medicine.    In addition, in order to further protect a patent holder,  more strict conditions for invoking the "compulsory  implementation right"--which allows the government to order a  patent holder to allow third persons to use the patent only for  the public interest--will be introduced.    Specifically, 1) adoption of the first invention--to which  the patent right has already been granted--should be limited to  the purpose for "developing economically more important and more  advanced technology," and 2) with regard to  semiconductor-related technology, "the compulsory implementation  right" should be invoked only for welfare and noncommercial  purposes.    So far, the Japanese Government has not invoked the  "compulsory implementation right." But among foreign companies  which have basic patents in Japan, a critical view have been  expressed that "Japanese companies, by waving the government's  'compulsory implementation right' before foreign firms, tend to  try to use it to their advantage in conducting negotiations on  royalties of foreign companies' basic patents." The Patent  Office believes the amended act will help to overcome this view.</p>

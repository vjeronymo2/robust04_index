			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> NEW JOURNAL OFFERS STATISTICS GALORE ON HOUSING MARKETS  </P> <P> In case your shelf of real estate periodicals isn't overflowing already, a trio  of industry heavyweights has launched a new one.  </P> <P> The Meyers Group, a Chino-based real estate research and consulting firm, has  teamed with Brea-based economist Alfred Gobar and Boud Real Estate Information  Systems, a statistics specialist, to prepare and publish the Southland-oriented  Real Estate Economic Journal.  </P> <P> Each of the 10 issues each year will concentrate on a single housing market.  </P> <P> Readers of the journal will get supply-and-demand summaries along with  population, employment growth and building permit data; examinations of trends  in residential construction and projections of what to expect from the local  economy and from future home sales will be offered.  </P> <P> The first two issues of the journal already have hit the streets. The inaugural  book dealt with Riverside County, while the second volume was devoted to the  Antelope Valley. Next up, the publishers say, is San Diego County.  </P> <P> It won't be Orange County's turn until the ninth issue in November.  </P> <P> The books, priced from $950 to $1,500 an issue (the Orange County volume will  run $1,250), are aimed at statistics junkies, builders, lenders, speculators  and anyone else who can benefit from what amounts to an off-the-shelf market  feasibility report.  </P> <P> Copies of the journal are available at the three Meyers Group offices.  </P></p>

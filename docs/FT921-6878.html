			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Party files show only part of the Soviet story STALIN'S membership card and Boris Pasternak's pleadings for royalties from his novel Dr Zhivago went on public display yesterday as Soviet Communist party archives were thrown open for the first time. Having rounded up the once-secret files in the heady days following the abortive coup last August, the Russian government has inaugurated a reading room around the corner from the ex-central committee building, the party's former headquarters. Only a tiny selection of the files was on display, but it was a graphic illustration of the now outlawed party's far-reaching control over every detail of Soviet life. For example, a report written in 1986 by Mr Alexander Yakovlev, the acknowledged godfather of glasnost, provided the central committee with details of a meeting with Graham Greene, the British writer. Such reports were until recently routine practice for any senior party official who had contacts with foreigners. The exhibition was also interesting for what it did not show. Documents on controversial topics such as party finances and support for western communist parties were not displayed. Indeed, only 30 per cent of the files are deemed fit for public consumption, in the absence of legislation on state secrets and the right to privacy. Mr Rudolf Pikhoya, chairman of the government's archives committee, said his centre had almost half the 70m Communist party files available in Russia for the period 1952-91. He said that all documents from the past 10 years would remain off-bounds until state experts had determined which should remain classified. But Mr Pikhoya is expecting soon to receive a number of files from the personal archives of former president Mikhail Gorbachev. Yesterday's exhibition featured Mr Gorbachev's membership card from 1952, when he was studying law at Moscow State university. Visitors were also treated to a recording of a speech in which the Soviet leader pledged his undying support to the party whose demise he was unable to prevent. 'The party's interests are for me no less dear than to those who try to doubt my allegiance to it,' Mr Gorbachev told the central committee less than a year ago. Access to documents will be free of charge for academics, but other visitors will have to pay a fee, as befits the new free market regime.</p>

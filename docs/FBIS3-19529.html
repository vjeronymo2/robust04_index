			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed L.M.: "The Not-Really-Good News About the </F> Budget Deficit"]    [Text] Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy clearly has the  touch. Despite the recession, which has hit public finances  hard, he is to announce some good news this morning in the  Council of Ministers: Last year's budget deficit has not grown  as much as expected. According to the final figures, it should  total 315.7 billion French francs [Fr].    At first glance, this is great news, since we have long  expected 1993 to end up being an outright disaster -- with an  unprecedented hole in government finances. A year and a half  ago the Socialists predicted in the initial finance law that the  deficit would be Fr165.4 billion. Then everything started going  wrong. Set up by Edouard Balladur at the time of the  transition, the Raynaud Commission -- which was given the task  of assessing the legacy -- estimated last spring that the  deficit could reach the catastrophic level of Fr320 to 360  billion by the end of the year.    The government will therefore be able to use this as an  example to bolster its argument that it has engaged in sound  management: first because since spring -- and at the time of the  corrected finance law -- it has done everything to limit the  slide, setting itself the goal of not exceeding a deficit of  Fr317 billion; and second because it even managed to do better  than that during the implementation phase. This is proof that  the flood has been contained and that the government is now on  the way toward bringing the deficit down to around Fr300 billion  by the end of 1994, as predicted.    In addition, it should manage to do this even more easily  since, according to reliable sources, the government is said to  have chalked up an even lower deficit in 1993 of around Fr300 to  305 billion. However, it is said that the government has given  this up and has taken certain expenditure into account for 1993  (primarily capital appropriations) planned for 1994 and has  allocated certain receipts planned for 1994 to 1993. This would  have the twofold advantage of not contradicting the conclusions  of the Raynaud report on the Socialist administration, as well  as alleviating the 1994 budget.    Nevertheless, there is one cloud on the horizon. While the  budget deficit is once again falling, government debt is  skyrocketing. It will probably rise from Fr2.110 trillion at  the end of 1992 to Fr2.470 billion at the end of 1993 (a little  less than initially predicted) and to around Fr2.870 trillion by  the end of 1994.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A calendar man who aims to sell sails - The ups and downs of Rick Tomlinson's venture into publishing his own yachting calendar RICK Tomlinson has no difficulty choosing the source of the photographs for the glossy calendar his company publishes. All 12 images are shot by Tomlinson in the course of his work as one of the world's top yachting photographers. Calendars with every picture taken by one man are not so unusual. One tends to think of Lord Lichfield and a portfolio of semi-clothed young women as being typical of the genre. But Tomlinson does more than take the pictures. He is also publisher; and in just three years he has created a market he now dominates. The first Tomlinson calendar was the 1989 edition, which cost Pounds 9.95 plus post and packing and sold 5,000 copies by mail order. 'It somehow made a slight profit, largely because the printer managed to foul everything up, repeated the print run and then gave us a rebate,' recalled Tomlinson, with the air of a driver thinking back to a nasty car crash that was just short of fatal. Inspiration for his project came from the Beken calendar, produced annually with great success by the Cowes family who have been taking genteel, graceful pictures of yachts for over a century. Beken's pictures evoke an endless Edwardian summer. Tomlinson's photos feature more icebergs than picnics. He felt there might be room in the market for both aspects of boating. 'I looked around for a publisher or a backer. Neither were forthcoming,' said Tomlinson, who - at 33 - still has the looks and manner of a modest choirboy. 'That wasn't too surprising since I was a very naive photographer who had really only been in the game five minutes.' This is a little too self-deprecating. Tomlinson trained in his native Isle of Man as a traditional high street studio photographer whose commissions included the inevitable weddings. 'They certainly teach you patience and how to handle people,' he says now. Early in the 1980s he ran away to sea, becoming a professional sailor on the big French multi-hull yachts that then dominated grand prix ocean racing. He crewed on Drum, the maxi-yacht pop star Simon le Bon owned and entered in the 1985/86 Whitbread round-the-world race. The photos he took - delicate portraits of owner and crew and green-water excitement in the Southern Ocean  -led Tomlinson back into full-time photography once the 32,000-mile race ended. His work took him to regattas all over the world. As a former competitor he was welcome on the best boats, put in the best positions and able to exploit his artistic talents to the full. When the calendar idea took root, he had few assets other than a fistful of glamorous photos and a well-travelled kitbag. Tom Power, a Dublin 'yachtie,' marketing consultant and friend agreed that Rick had a viable project and offered to back it. Thus reinforced, Tomlinson decided to go it alone. 'My local bank manager gave me a Pounds 20,000 overdraft secured against my mother's house and we began production in midsummer of 1988,' he recalled. Early support came from marine industries buying the calendar for client gifts; but he was unprepared for the mail-order rush produced by advertisements in the specialist yachting magazines. 'It was a a nightmare in the first year,' he remembered. 'Travelling around the world to take photos and flying back to St Mary Port to open a snowdrift of orders on my desk. I had no idea the amount of paperwork a mail-order business would generate and it's so time-consuming.' Tomlinson lured his sister, Cathy Kneale, out of her life as a housewife to help. She works full time on the calendar with part-time help taken on at the autumn peak. After the debacle with the printer, Tomlinson became much hungrier about his print quotes. He found a Dutch company which would print better quality at nearly half the cost. He also broke the advertising budget in the first year, following instincts, not the business plan, he says ruefully. About 60 per cent of the calendars go to corporate customers, overprinted with company names and personal messages, 30 per cent are sold by mail order to private individuals in dozens of countries, and 10 per cent are sold through yacht chandlers and bookshops. 'We're now printing double the number of calendars for half the original cost, so we must be getting something right,' said Tomlinson. He thinks there is potential to double the number of units sold to corporate customers next year. 'It is much more profitable than the mail-order side, although it's nice to get flattering letters from people in Japan who want the calendar.'</p>

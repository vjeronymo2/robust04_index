			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Italian group agrees rail deal in W Midlands PLANS TO build a rapid transit system in the West Midlands took a step forward yesterday when Ansaldo Trasporti, the Italian rail equipment group, signed a joint-venture deal to develop and operate the line. The deal removes some of the uncertainty over the Pounds 110m contract, which was thrown into confusion earlier this year when Taylor Woodrow, Ansaldo's original partner, abruptly withdrew from the venture. At the time, Taylor Woodrow's decision was put down to an economy drive to minimise losses in its contracting business. The company's withdrawal forced Centro, the operating arm of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority, to seek a new developer for Midland Metro Line One, a light railway to run between Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Centro officials said yesterday they had reopened talks with Eurotransit, a second consortium formed by UK construction group Tilbury Douglas and AEG of Germany, but had failed to reach agreement. The breakdown allowed Ansaldo to resubmit its bid, which has now been accepted by the transport authority. However, construction of the line will not begin until Ansaldo finds a new civil engineering partner, and it depends on winning significant government funding. More than Pounds 100m in state aid or private-sector finance would be required to complete the project, according to Centro. Mr Bob Tarr, Centro's general director, said efforts to secure the government funding 'would now be redoubled with an aim for a start date for work on Line One during 1994-95'. Under the contract, Ansaldo and its partner will pay Pounds 10m towards the building costs and will receive a franchise to operate the transit system for 20 years without subsidy. When completed, Midland Metro will run 20km from central Birmingham, via West Bromwich and Bilston, to Wolverhampton using mainly existing railway trackbeds. Mr Dick Worrall, chairman of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority, said: 'We now have an agreement to build and operate the first line on the terms we were seeking. 'I now hope Ansaldo's discussions with the construction industry provide the final piece of the jigsaw.'</p>

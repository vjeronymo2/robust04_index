			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Observer: Too busy selling This time Michael Heseltine, Britain's trade and industry supremo, had an excuse. When the Italian hosts at the G7 summit called a special meeting of trade ministers on Saturday to discuss ways of freeing new areas of world trade, Hezza was just about to set off at the head of Britain's largest ever trade mission to South Africa. Once again Sarah Hogg, head of the prime minister's policy unit, stepped into the breach. It's not the first time that Hezza has failed to show up for trade talks. He missed Marrakesh in April when the world's leading trade ministers signed off the Uruguay Round. He sent his number three, Tim Sainsbury, who is minister for industry, not trade. Indeed, Hezza's absence from the big trade policy set-piece events is starting to look increasingly odd, especially since he insists on calling himself the President of the Board of Trade.</p>

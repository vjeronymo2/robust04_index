			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.N. APPROVES MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ  </P> <P> As reported in The Times, Center for Defense Information's retired Rear Adm.  Gene R. La Rocque says that the potential for direct military spending on a  six-month war in the Persian Gulf will be on the order of $80 billion, plus  tens of thousands of dead and wounded (Part A, Nov. 28).  </P> <P> Why hasn't anyone thought of directing this huge amount of money and effort  into developing sources of alternative energy so that we can once and for all  assert our independence from that unpredictable part of the world?  </P> <P> Funds expended for this would be a much better long-term investment in our  nation's future, while eliminating the personal toll of lost lives and battered  bodies.  </P> <P> NORM ZARESKI, Palos Verdes Estates  </P></p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: UK should set example on equality Sir, I wonder how many women the FT has on its editorial team? Not many, judging by the leader 'Equal pay for women' (August 25). In censuring the Equal Opportunities Commission's move to take the government to the European authorities, the FT is caught with its equality pants down. It is absurd to suggest that women should be satisfied with their lot just because they have found it easier than men to get jobs. They have had to accept more precarious, part-time and less remunerative jobs (even for the same work done). Should they be grateful for the favour? It does not lessen the farce that we have narrowed the wage differentials to 80 per cent. We are still a long way from equality, regardless of what other countries are doing. It is true that other countries need to do much more, but let us teach by example. As for Mr David Hunt, the new employment secretary, he need not fear. European court actions unfortunately take a long time. All Mr Hunt need do is eliminate the inequalities in order to stop any action in its tracks. The ball is in his court. While we continue to consider women as a minority - even though they make up over 50 per cent of the population in the UK - their unjustifiable treatment can be expected to persist.

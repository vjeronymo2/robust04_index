			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "A Pan-Arab Commitment," the  newspaper AL-THAWRAH writes on the Arab meetings that were  recently held in Syria, the most recent of which was the meeting  held between President Hafiz al-Asad and Yemeni President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih. The talks during this meeting dealt with the  Arab situation and the efforts being exerted to tackle the  situation in fraternal Yemen.    AL-THAWRAH stresses that Syria is actually qualified to play  a pioneering pan-Arab role, and that it was the first to achieve  solidarity and unity. Its Arab and international credibility  has given it this pivotal and effective role that has attracted  the sons of the Arab nation.    AL-THAWRAH reviews some of Syria's achievements and stands,  such as the October war, its sacrifices for the sake of the  Palestine question and Lebanon's unity, and its efforts to  achieve unity with Egypt, Libya, Jordan, Sudan, Iraq, and  Algeria. The paper also reminds us of Syria's pan-Arab stand at  the Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and President  Bill Clinton. The Arabs and the world were unanimous that  President al-Asad negotiated on behalf of all Arabs.    AL-THAWRAH says: It is a stand that is committed to  defending  Arab rights and the Arab nation's interests, to achieving its  unity, to settling differences among Arab brothers, to  preventing internecine fighting and bloodshed, and to defending  every pan-Arab achievement, such as Yemeni unity, which is an  important step toward achieving Arab unity. Syria stands with  the fraternal Yemeni people in their concern about safeguarding  their unity, defending it, and protecting it from any reckless  action or any attempt to torpedo it.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Al-Asad's Syria has frequently warned  against the dangers posed by Arab differences, which Israel  seeks to create. The paper calls for assuming responsibility to  achieve Arab unity and to adopt a unified stand, particularly in  light of the current changes in the world. Israel is exploiting  these changes to besiege the Arabs, increase their differences,  and isolate them from their friends in order to force them into  capitulation and normalization. Unity is needed to face Israel,  especially while it abides by occupying land, annexing  Jerusalem, building settlements, and bringing more Jewish  settlers.    AL-THAWRAH also notes President Hafiz al-Asad's statement  that Syria's policy has always been based on achieving Arab  solidarity. In addition to this, Syria advocates unity and calls  on others to achieve it, whether with us or with the other Arab  states. We have always warned of the dangers posed to the Arabs  if they do not achieve solidarity and unity. Arab solidarity is  the cornerstone of the joint Arab action on which we build our  subsequent steps.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Based on all of this, Damascus  attached great importance to the Yemeni issue in order to arrive  at a quick and practical solution to the current crisis, and to  foil the scheme of internecine fighting and partition, taking  into consideration that safeguarding Yemen's resources  necessitates the establishment of a strong unified state,  especially since Yemen enjoys an important location on the Arab  and international map.</p>

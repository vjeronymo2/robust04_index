			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Josef Joffe: "The Rediscovery of Europe"] </F>   [Text] The fact that a U.S. ambassador leaves Bonn after  only eight months would normally only be a surprising and not  overwhelming piece of news. In this case, however, it means a  new chapter of U.S. foreign policy under the working title:  Europe is "in" again.    Richard Holbrooke is not just leaving, he is climbing up the  ladder -- to lead the European section in the Department of  State, an institution which was powerful in the past but has  recently been almost forgotten, and will now be clearly  revitalized with Holbrooke. He is not a reserve player in  Clinton's team, but a major player -- with a good network of  relations within the administration and the party.    The Washington seismographs have already registered another  underground event. Jenonne Walker, who is responsible for  Europe in the National Security Council and was hardly doing a  better job than former head of the European section Stephen  Oxman, was fired in an elegant way. She will become ambassador  to Prague. Her successor in the White House will be a  heavyweight.    Incidentally, a Washington think tank, the Economic Strategy  Institute, has just published a report that reverses the  traditional truth: The future of the United States is not in  Asia, but in "old," "weary," "sclerotic" (these are the usual  adjectives) Europe. How come -- since it has been preached for  years that the fate of the United States will be decided in the  high-growth Asian region, amidst the "little tigers" and "large  dragons?"    Titled "Europe and the U.S. Economy -- the Most Important of  All Bilateral Relations," the study presents the following  account: Trade with Japan and China accounts for 70 percent of  the U.S. deficit, whereas the United States reaches a surplus in  trade with Europe. The United States exports raw materials to  the Far East and imports high-tech products from there; with  Europe, it is the other way round. Regarding direct investment,  Europe and the United States are mutually the largest investors,  whereas Japan continues to block U.S. investment. The political  upshot is this: "It is the Europeans who share the U.S. notions  on the future of the world economic order most;" one should not  "mistake individual conflicts for conflicts on principles."    Did Secretary of State Warren Christopher not complain about  the fact last year that there was "a lot of criticism" from  Europe, but not from Asia, and that Western Europe was no longer  "the dominant region in the world"? The three visits to Europe  of Bill Clinton (in January, June, and July) speak a different  language, and the reasons for the "promotion" of Europe are  obvious.    First, enthusiasm for the Pacific region is ebbing away.  China -- with its human rights and Korean policy -- has proved  to be a difficult partner, which is demonstrating its big power  awareness too often through opposition to Washington. Japan  remains a stubborn trading partner who is trying to ward off all  attacks against its market fortress in the jujitsu style, but is  also unable to give itself a stable, functioning government.  Nor has the United States forgotten those "Asiatic values" that  Singapore mentioned to justify the humiliating whipping of a  U.S. youth.    Second, Europe is not as boring or as stable as had been  assumed after the end of the 40-Years War -- the Cold War.  Italy, once the most reliable ally, has become a question mark  following the election of Berlusconi and the neofascists.  France and Britain are both suffering from progressive  leadership weakness -- each country in its own way. The same  holds true for Spain. In Bosnia, every cease-fire has proved to  be a treacherous interruption, during which the three warring  parties establish new potentials and positions for the next  phase. On the other side of the Elbe river, Washington sees  former communists regain strength, while Russia -- no matter how  strong or weak it is -- continues to be a problem for Europe.    Briefly, foreign policy, which was apparently tamed after  the  end of the Cold War, has got its clutches on Bill Clinton again.  It could even cost him his reelection in two years -- what with  Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, Korea, where Clinton has not really  shown brilliant leadership. Then the electorate will not deal  with Clinton's scandals and love affairs any more, but will ask  how he turned the superpower's talents that the United States  inherited after the collapse of the Soviet Union, to good  account.    That is why a reshuffle has begun in the present half-time  --  primarily on the classical European parquet, which seems to be  much more slippery than it was one or two years ago. However,  this will not be enough. On the upper floors, too -- regarding  Security Adviser Lake and State Secretary Christopher -- there  is growing unrest. Anyway, there is increasing speculation on  their possible successors. The Europeans should welcome the new  respect for the "old continent" and the reshuffle in Washington  because a confusing, unsteady, and sometimes even blase foreign  policy "Made in U.S.A." has never been an advantage for Europe.  However, it is not the underlings who are responsible for  foreign policy but their chief. He can only be exchanged by the  U.S. voters.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Sir Hugh Weeks, leading CBI figure: Obituary SIR HUGH WEEKS, who has died aged 88, was a leading spokesman for industry and commerce, a former chairman of merchant bank Leopold Joseph and a pioneer in the use of market research in business. He served on public committees under the Wilson and Heath governments, but his main platform was the chairmanship of the Confederation of British Industry economic committee from 1957 to 1972. It was from there in 1958 that he launched the CBI industrial trends survey. His careers in finance and industry developed in parallel. He was deputy chairman of Truscon, a steel company, from 1951 to 1960 and in the mid-60s became deputy chairman of Richard Thomas and Baldwin, a larger steel manufacturer. After nationalisation he was a regional board member of British Steel. He was also a long-serving director of both the Finance Corporation for Industry and the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation, which provided government-sponsored funds for industry.</p>

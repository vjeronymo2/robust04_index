			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(zl)": "Miklos Duray Is the Most Unpopular"] </F>   [Text] Representatives of the Center for Social and  Marketing Analysis (FOCUS) yesterday made available data from a  poll conducted to ascertain public opinion before the  parliamentary elections in the fall. It is apparent from the  poll that, in the wake of the volatility on the political scene  in March, the situation has calmed down and that there has been  a slight increase in support for the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia [HZDS] and a slight decline for the Party of the  Democratic Left [SDL]. The Democratic Union [DU] has a real  chance of getting into parliament.    The poll's results in response to the question "Why would  you  vote?" are interesting. In essence, the replies can be placed  into four categories. Support for a party or movement was  predominant in the first category; up to one-quarter of the  respondents would vote in accordance with this support. The  second category is made up of respondents who give priority to  asserting group interests. The replies of workers, national  economic minorities, believers, and those favoring the Slovak  nation were predominant in this category. Those who give  priority to the programs of the political parties were ranked in  the third category. The last category was made up of  respondents who would vote for a personality. They accounted  for 12 percent of the respondents. A typical response to the  question on why they would not vote was: "No party is worthy of  my vote."    According to the FOCUS poll, the greatest trust is enjoyed  by  M. Kovac (22.8 percent), V. Meciar (22.2 percent), J. Moravcik  (21.7 percent), and Peter Weiss (14.1 percent). L. Cernak  received only 2-percent support. In reply to the question "Who  do you consider to be very pleasant?," the respondents said the  following: M. Kovac (29.9 percent), J. Moravcik (29.9 percent),  I. Gasparovic (23.4 percent), V. Meciar (22.5 percent), and P.  Weiss (22.2 percent). In reply to the question "Who do you  consider to be unpleasant?," the rankings were as follows:  Miklos Duray (64.2 percent), Jan Carnogursky (52.6 percent),  and Vojtech Bugar (50 percent). V. Meciar is unpleasant for  41.5 percent of respondents. According to FOCUS, J. Volf (with  6.7 percent) came last in this category.    Some 7.1 percent of respondents acknowledged that they were  unequivocally left wing, 6.7 percent that they were  unequivocally right wing, and 44.1 percent that they were more  toward the center. Almost half of the respondents would prefer a  "market economy, if the state influences it to a considerable  extent."    [The same newspaper on the same date on page 1, under the  headline "Many Candidates--Few Chosen," carries the following  table, based on FOCUS's analysis of replies to the question  "Imagine that new parliamentary elections were to be held this  weekend. Which party or movement would you vote for?"    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                                      |Percent                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Don't know                            |8.7                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Don't want to say                     |3.8                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Would not vote                        |7.6                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other replies                         |0.6                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hungarian Civic Party                 |0.9                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Christian Social Union                |1.1                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Party of Businessmen and Entrepreneurs|1.9                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Social Democratic Party of Slovakia   |2.1                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Slovak National Party                 |2.8                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |National Democratic Party-New Alterna-|2.8                                   |  |tive                                  |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hungarian Christian Democratic Moveme-|3.3                                   |  |nt                                    |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Democratic Party                      |3.6                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Egyutteles [Coexistence]              |3.8                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Green Party in Slovakia               |3.9                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |DU                                    |6.0                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Association of Workers of Slovakia    |7.1                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Christian Democratic Movement         |7.3                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SDL                                   |11.6                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |HZDS                                  |20.8                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

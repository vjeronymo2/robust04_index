			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> UITTI, BESSETTE AT COUNTY MUSEUM  </P> <P> Back-to-back solo recitals by two outstanding musicians brought intelligence  and uncompromising virtuosity to the latest Monday Evening Concert at Bing  Theater, County Museum of Art. Frances-Marie Uitti -- an American-born cellist  who now resides in Holland -- and Canadian pianist Louise Bessette shared the  intimate event, pleasingly shedding light on some lesser-known 20th-Century  gems.  </P> <P> With an expressionless, markedly poised approach, Uitti unravelled the snarly  serial architecture of Iannis Xenakis' "Kottos"(1978), lucidly deciphering a  montage of technically difficult glissando maneuvers and roughly hewn tremolos.  Similarly fascinating and painstakingly executed was the odd mix of sonic  exploration and ethnic elements in "Curve With Plateaux" (1981) by English  composer Jonathan Harvey.  </P> <P> Uitti's own slowly unfolding, droning Ricercar (1990) demonstrates her  inventive technique of achieving four-part harmony by using two bows, though  little else. A read-through of Roger Sessions' atonal Six Pieces for Cello Solo  (1966) proceeded cautiously, but competently.  </P> <P> The only collaboration between the two, Morton Feldman's note-upon-note  pianissimo study "Durations II" (1960), blended the two talents adequately,  though lacking adventure in context with the overall ambitious programing.  Otherwise, an impressively sturdy technique and prowess steered Bessette's  opening half of the evening.  </P> <P> Gilles Tremblay's piano concoction "Tracantes . . . aupres, au loin . . . "  (1976) assorts loud tremolos and fast xylophone-like melodic lines that  contrast abruptly with resonating sympathetic vibrations achieved by silently  depressing keys. Bessette masterfully melded the diverse elements, relishing  each moment while displaying a deep understanding of the whole.  </P> <P> Giacinto Scelsi's busy Sonata No. 4 for piano (1941) explored rich, eccentric  regions of homophony and neo-Classicism. Three early piano pieces by Henry  Cowell proved attractive exercises for the fingers, not to mention forearms,  fists and palms.GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

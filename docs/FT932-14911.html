			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Caution over next prison contract THE NEXT private-sector contract to provide prison escort services will be introduced on a phased basis, Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, said yesterday. Switching the entire east Midlands, Humberside and Yorkshire contract to Group 4 Court Services on a single day was a significant cause of subsequent problems, Mr Lewis and directors of the security company decided at a meeting yesterday. During Group 4's first week of running the contract four prisoners escaped or were wrongly released, and others were delivered late for court appearances. Tendering for the next contract, covering the London area, will begin soon with Group 4 among the bidders. Companies submitting bids will now be asked to plan for a gradual switch from the public sector to the private sector. Yesterday's meeting ended with Mr Lewis saying that only one of last week's four disappearances by prisoners could be attributed to Group 4. Two resulted from design flaws in vehicles which had been built to Home Office specifications, while a local magistrates court had confirmed that Group 4 was not at fault in the release of the fourth pris-oner. The government's five-year contract with Group 4, worth Pounds 9.5m a year, allows for financial penalties but none will be imposed over last week's problems. There will, however, be another meeting between the Prison Service and Group 4 in a month to review the operation of the contract. It requires Group 4 to collect and return a different number of prisoners each day from 71 police stations, 20 prisons, 72 magistrates courts and 10 Crown courts. Prison Service and Group 4 officials say that last week's start-up was complicated by a number of unscheduled court sessions. Mr Lewis stressed that escapes by prisoners under police or Prison Service escort were not uncommon. 'It is very regrettable and we intend to reduce them, but the experience of last week needs to be seen in that context.' Mr Jim Harrower, managing director of Group 4, said the company had been hurt badly and embarrassed by last week's problems. He was convinced, however, that 'with all agencies playing their part we will meet the terms of the contract'. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, yesterday brushed aside Commons attacks by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs on the Group 4 contract, insisting that the number of escapes was 'not out of the ordinary,' Ivor Owen writes. To laughter and cheers from the opposition benches Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, claimed Group 4's performance could have graced one of Ealing Studios' comedy films. Mr Clarke maintained that the use of private-sector companies for such duties freed police officers for their primary role of tackling crime.</p>

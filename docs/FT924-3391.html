			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Rationalisation helps Incentive advance 57% INCENTIVE, the Swedish industrial group dominated by the Wallenberg family, saw profits rise 57 per cent to SKr222m (Dollars 32.4m) in the first nine months as rationalisation helped offset the impact of recession in key markets. The result compares with a profit of SKr141m in the first nine months of 1991 and is higher than the SKr218m profit achieved for the whole of 1991. Profit per share, excluding non-recurring items, was unchanged at SKr5.50. If income from Incentive's large shareholdings in Asea, Electrolux and Esab are included, profits rose to SKr799m from SKr780m. This was in spite of the impact of disposals and weaker markets, which reduced sales to SKr8.44bn from SKr10.46bn. Mr Mikael Lilius, president, said: 'The cost reduction and rationalisation measures have increased operating margins. We have also had a more efficient utilisation of capital and lower net financial expense.' Incentive companies - construction and environment groups Tour &amp; Andersson and Munters, plus camera group Hasselblad - advanced in spite of adverse economic conditions.</p>

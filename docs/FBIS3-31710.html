			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Robert Rakar] </F>   [Text] The Slovene maritime police at approximately 2015  [1915 GMT] last night stopped the Croatian fishing boat Ucka,  which was dragging a trawl, a mile into Slovene territorial  waters. The policemen tried to take the boat into Piran Bay,  however, its captain, 28-year-old Zvonko Vincekovic from  Opatija, resisted this. For this reason the trawl was dropped  into the sea and the boat was taken to Piran by force.    The policemen decided to impound the Croatian ship and  prosecute the captain. The Croatian fishing boat probably  trawled for the first time as there was no catch on the deck.    This morning a Piran magistrate judge levied a 70,000-tolar  fine upon Vincekovic, which he refused to pay. The boat is thus  still anchored in Piran Bay.    This incident, the second this year, took place on exactly  the same spot as the incident from a month ago that was deemed  hushed up. Namely, on that occasion policemen released the  offender; however, on this occasion they acted in accordance  with the Fishing Law.</p>

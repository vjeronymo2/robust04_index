			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Arts: Elton John: back on song - Pop Elton John is still standing. He is also still straddling the keyboards; boogieing; camping it up; and, a first for him, spitting. After battles with drugs, sexual orientation, hair lines and, judging by a lacklustre performance at Wembley last summer, his talent, he has won through. At Earl's Court on Wednesday he was decidely on top. Of course it is all much duller these days. After the years of entertainment from Elton's fantasies we now get the man plain, as unadorned and artless as an accounts clerk. He is dressed soberly by Versace rather than outrageously by Walt Disney and the frissons of the past which made his performance poignant, like watching a man on the edge of a precipice, are missing. He does not live out the songs so emotionally, and the songs tend to be up-beat and noisy. But who can begrudge Elton his new found enthusiasm. The set, too, is functional, a lighting designers playground, and apart from some dancing lasers, the only surprise is when the keyboard unit transforms into a space pod and lifts Elton into the air and revolves him round the stage. You are left with the music, belted out by the inevitably professional and discreet band, spearheaded as ever by Davey Johnstone on guitar. Since the John-Taupin songbook is arguably the finest in pop there are bound to be blissful moments, especially a plaintive and simple 'Sorry seems to be the hardest word', and 'Empty Garden', his homage to John Lennon. But in the main he was sweeping away the cobwebs by blasting out the belters, like 'Benny and the Jets' and 'The Bitch is Back'. Sometimes there were signs that a man could get bored after 20 years of global touring. His extended keyboard intros threatened to out-last the melody, and 'Sad Songs' received such a protracted build up that you were bored before he hit the theme. But as he climaxed this AIDS benefit concert with Freddy Mercury's 'The Show Must Go On' you felt that Elton was more at home communicating with 10,000 strangers than confined to his own company.</p>

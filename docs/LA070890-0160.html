			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT PROPERTY: GRETZKY'S GOAL: CUT COMMUTE  </P> <P> Hockey star WAYNE GRETZKY has put the Encino house that he bought less than two  years ago on the market at $3.25 million.  </P> <P> "He's selling because he wants to move closer to where he practices," said  Asher Dann of Beverly Hills, who has the Los Angeles Kings center's listing.  "He has to go to the Forum almost every day."  </P> <P> Gretzky has been living in the Encino home since moving to Los Angeles from  Edmonton, Alberta, with his wife, Janet. They have a 17-month-old daughter,  Paulina.  </P> <P> Dann described the home, which is about 7,000 square feet in size, as "old but  updated." "It once belonged to (1942 Academy Award-winning actress) Teresa  Wright," Dann said.  </P> <P> Gretzky's residence was built in 1939 and has six bedrooms, five baths and two  powder rooms. Besides the main house, there are two guest cottages, a rock  swimming pool, three barbecue areas and a driveway more than 100 feet long on  the gated property.  </P> <P> KCBS sportscaster KEITH OLBERMANN is settling into his new home, a condo in  Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> He liked the unit because it is on a quiet street and he can sleep during the  day when he has late telecasts. It has high ceilings (he is about 6-feet-6),  and is within walking distance of restaurants and shops. Olbermann doesn't  drive, according to sources not involved in the sale.  </P> <P> Olbermann bought the 1,900-square-foot unit -- with two bedrooms, a den and 2  1/2 baths -- for about $500,000. The condo is one of several penthouses in a  three-story, 24-unit building constructed 16 years ago.  </P> <P> The condo had been listed with Annette Bravos and Betsy Emanuel in the Santa  Monica office of Fred Sands Realtors.  </P> <P> Interior designers IAN and LINDA PHILLIPS have put their own house in Woodland  Hills on the market at $1,050,000 in preparation for a world cruise on their  60-foot ketch "The Designing Lady."  </P> <P> "We're putting our business on hiatus and taking off to play on the boat for a  year," Linda said.  </P> <P> They've only been married for a year but have had an interior design business  together for about seven years.  </P> <P> The couple have spent the past two years redesigning a 7,500-square-foot La  Canada Flintridge home.  </P> <P> There is a home for sale in Apple Valley that is said to have 400-year-old  post-and-beam timbers in it from three cottages built in Elizabethan England.  </P> <P> British authorities allowed the materials to be exported, the builder said,  because the cottages were about to be demolished to make way for new  construction.  </P> <P> James A.G. Webster, who came from England himself, took 10 years to build the  home, which he describes as "a new English manor house." It was completed about  a year ago.  </P> <P> "He lived in it for awhile, but now he has a ranch in the San Joaquin Valley,"  said Markham Kopang at Bradco Development in Victorville, who is handling the  $1.4-million home, on slightly more than an acre. The 4,300-square-foot house  has four bedrooms and 5 1/2 baths.  </P> <P> The former Palm Springs estate of 20th Century Fox studio chief DARRYL F.  ZANUCK is back on the market at $1.5 million. Its current owner, Zanuck's  daughter, Darrylin Zanuck De Pineda, first listed it in 1987, then changed her  mind.  </P> <P> "Now I think she's serious about selling," said a spokeswoman for Eadie Adams  Realty, the listing brokerage firm.  </P> <P> The 1.5-acre property, behind walls in the Old Movie Colony area of town, is  where Zanuck entertained dozens of Hollywood stars until he died in 1979.  </P> <P> "There is a huge lawn . . . where Daddy would play croquet until 2 in the  morning," De Pineda recalled in a prepared statement. "He and (director) Howard  Hawks were such fierce croquet competitors that the neighbors often called the  police to break up fights."  </P> <P> The Early California-style, 7,500-square-foot estate also has a main house with  four bedrooms and four baths and a two-bedroom apartment over a three-car  garage.  </P> <P> After Darryl and his wife, Virginia, bought the estate in the late 1930s, they  named it Ric Su Dar for their three children -- Richard, co-producer of  "Driving Miss Daisy;" Susan, who died in 1980, and Darrylin, who inherited the  property when Virginia died in 1982.  </P> <P> Clarification: Summit Ridge, the Chatsworth development where White Snake  guitarist STEVE VAI bought a lot for a $2-million house he is now building,  also has some completed houses on the market, said Georgiana D'Angelo of  Coldwell Banker, who has a $1.87-million listing on one.  </P></p>

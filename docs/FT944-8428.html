			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: A special experience - Giles MacDonogh travels (without a donkey) in the Cevennes What is it which makes France so special? One reason is variety. With certain notable exceptions, such as the Brie, the Beauce or the monotonous Landes, the landscape changes every 30 kilometres; parasol pines might give way to maquis, olive trees and vines cede their places to chestnut trees and herds of goats. With every mutation there is a new culture, patois and diet. I have been to Montpellier dozens of times, but before this autumn I had never ventured up into the Cevennes. My destination was the hotel-cum-restaurant Chantoiseau in Vialas in the Lozere, a place so remote that even its owner, the lyrical chef Patrick Pages, is heard to exclaim 'est la ou Jesus Christ a perdu ses savattes', an idiomatic way of saying it is a hell of a place to find. The Cevennes were made famous in Britain by the writings of Robert Louis Stevenson. This is Protestant France. Many fled to Britain, Holland and Germany after the infamous dragonnades of the 17th century. Those who remained maintained a careful secrecy about their lifestyles and even to this day they can be closed and withdrawn. The chestnut is the module of Cevennes cooking. It was a region of intense poverty. and every part of the tree served some practical purpose: the leaves were used to feed the animals; the wood served to make furniture; while the nuts themselves were smoked to rid them of their maggots and used to provide force during the cruel winter months. As Pages points out, a mere handful of chestnuts is enough to nourish a man. Normally they were offered with goats' milk as badjana. In the poorer villages of the Cevennes this is how children are fed to this day. As Pages puts it: 'Chestnuts are not trees, they are an entire civilisation.' The frugality of this basic diet was relieved by the occasional feast. The great speciality was a calves' head vinaigrette with boiled potatoes; or tripoux, a dish which might have reconciled them to their Calvinist ccusins in Scotland: little packets of sheeps' stomach cooked with mutton trotters much in the manner of the pieds et paquets de Marseilles. The onerous task of cleaning the tripe made it one of the few meat dishes consumed by the poor. The soil was so terrible that only the rich possessed sheep or cows. Their diet was slightly different: they consumed slow cooked meat stews or daubes; the plentiful game; or salt cod au gratin. Potatoes were another important staple; either cooked in a puree with herbs or as aligot, an unctuous puree of potatoes and young Cantal cheese which should be so elastic that you are obliged to wrap it round your fork like spaghetti. There was no systematic cultivation of the vine, no beer, no cider and no perry. From the late 19th century onwards, what little wine there was came from the Clinton grape, which, as the name suggests, was imported from America. This hybrid made light coloured, thin wines which were rumoured to affect both the heart and lungs. Pages asserts that it was Clinton, rather than vinegar, that was in the sponge passed up to Christ on the cross: 'It was that which killed him.' This account of the gastronomic specialities of the Lozere might seem calculated to put off potential visitors, but let me assure you that there is no Clinton among the 1,020 wines listed at Chantoiseau. Nor will you be dissatisfied with the menu: Pages is a highly respected chef and sommelier who represents the Languedoc-Roussillon region both in France and abroad. He is, however, more than happy to make use of local Ingredients. He lists as one of his specialities, in the Michelin guide, the plate of juicy sausage which greets you as you arrive at table. The famous chestnuts of the region found their way into the quail consomme with ginger and Soissons beans as well as the exquisite raviole of pelardons, the local goats' cheese; this was served on a bed of Swiss chard and a little sauce of fresh mousseron mushrooms. This is a paradise for mushroom lovers and come the autumn wild mushrooms figure largely on the menu. Some tender fillets of stag, for example, came with two significant piles of mushrooms: one of ceps and the other of grisettes, together with a dollop of aligot. The same pelardons also loom large on the cheeseboard but they are joined by other goats' cheeses and some of the greats of the nearby Auvergne. The name of the restaurant is a little pun which demonstrates something of the owner's humour. His father was a boulanger (baker) who became the owner of the Hotel Platon (no relation to the philosopher) in Vialas. Pages changed the name to Chantoiseau after the man credited with opening Paris' first restaurant in the 1770s. Chantoiseau was his nom de guerre. His real name was Boulanger.

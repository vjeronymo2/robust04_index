			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / CSU leaves Strauss scandals behind and reasserts Bavarian dominance: Michael Lindemann previews state elections that promise little cheer for the SPD The Social Democrats in Bavaria, condemned for decades to thankless opposition in Germany's most conservative state, call it the 'black country'. They mean Wolfratshausen, a prosperous little town nestling on the river Loisach just south of Munich, and an area which boasts the second highest per capita income in the country. It is also the home town of Mr Edmund Stoiber, the Bavarian state premier, and an undisputed stronghold of his ruling Christian Social Union, the sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union. Four years ago 55 per cent of the constituency backed the conservative and Roman Catholic CSU, the party which has ruled the staunchly-independent Free State of Bavaria with an absolute majority since 1962. Last week Mrs Renate Schmidt, the Bavarian SPD leader, took the battle to the heart of enemy territory, for a full-scale rally, complete with beer and brass band, in the Wolfratshausen town hall. She is the liveliest candidate the party has fielded in the state for years. Yet Mrs Schmidt looks unlikely substantially to improve her party's fortunes. Just as the SPD has slipped behind the CDU in polls for the general election on October 16, so the party in Bavaria has seen its hopes of unseating the mighty CSU fading. Earlier this year there seemed to be some chance that the SPD might dislodge a CSU reeling from a series of corruption scandals. Mr Stoiber's predecessor, Mr Max Streibl, was forced to resign after accepting holidays from a wealthy business friend. Since then, the reign of the late Mr Franz Josef Strauss, father figure of the CSU and the strongman of Bavarian politics since the war, has been tarnished with further accusations of shady deals. For example Mr Eduard Zwick, a multi-millionaire spa resort operator, who fled to Switzerland to escape prosecution for income tax evasion, claimed that he had been promised protection by Mr Strauss. But the SPD's attempts to tar Mr Stoiber with the brush of scandal have singularly failed. In the European parliament elections in June the opposition managed only 23.7 per cent of the vote, its worst-ever European result in the state. 'That (tactic) doesn't work any more,' says Mr Julian Gyger, an SPD spokesman. Instead, Mrs Schmidt focuses on the need for more jobs and less nuclear energy. Mr Stoiber became state premier last May and admits he took over a party which was 'insecure'. Once Mr Strauss's closest personal adviser, and then a tough interior minister, he immediately demonstrated his political touch, axing an array of official privileges, such as free seats at the opera. The Bavarian premier is also an unashamed conservative who has taken a hard line against asylum seekers, stealing fire from the right-wing Republicans, once seen as a serious threat. The party, which was founded in Bavaria where it still has its strongest support, is, according to the polls, hovering around the 5 per cent mark needed to secure seats in the Landtag, or state parliament. Observers are wary of predictions because many Republicans do not admit their voting intentions in polls. The party is, however, under considerable pressure, given that it failed to make the 5 per cent four years ago. In addition, Mr Franz Schonhuber, the charismatic 75-year-old party leader, has said he will step down after the elections. The CSU could secure an absolute majority with 46 per cent of the vote if, as many observers expect, several smaller parties do not make it into parliament. Not all of Bavaria votes like Wolfratshausen. But even if Mrs Schmidt picks up votes where she comes from in Lower Bavaria and Franconia, in towns such as Hof and Schweinfurt - where the textile and ball-bearings industry is on its knees because of the recession and competition from the neighbouring Czech Republic - she would need at least another two parties to ensure a parliamentary majority. The SPD's chances are further diminished because historically the party has been much weaker in Bavaria and there are parts of the state where it does not even exist. Mr Stoiber meanwhile says the Bavarians have stood rock-solid behind the CSU for three decades because they have their own way of doing things, different from the rest of Germany. 'We don't always follow the fashion here,' he says. As for suggestions that leading CSU politicians have been lining their pockets in recent years - they impress very few Bavarians. 'Everyone is always talking about connections that leading CSU politicians have,' a customs officer said at a Stoiber rally. 'Well what's wrong with connections - at least you get things done.'</p>

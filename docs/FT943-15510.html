			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Pension funds lift overseas investment European pension funds intend to reduce their reliance on domestic markets and increase investment overseas, according to a report on the industry. Global Research, a division of Euromoney Publications, surveyed 181 of the largest pension funds in Europe between April and June. With the exception of the UK, where fund managers expect to reduce the proportion of their US investments over the year, funds are increasing their investments in all areas of the world. The survey found that managers were diversifying their portfolios away from fixed-income instruments towards equities. Phillips and Drew Fund Management was the most preferred external fund manager for UK pension funds, followed by Mercury Asset Management, Schroder Asset Management, Henderson Pension Fund Management and Gartmore Investment Management. Non-UK pension funds preferred BBL, Kredietbank, AIB and Bank of Ireland. The survey reported a difference in management styles between UK and other European pension funds, with 36 per cent of UK managers using indexing as part of their domestic strategy, compared with about 17 per cent of non-UK European funds. However, there is an increasing trend towards indexing across Europe, with the trend most prominent in the UK. Almost 27 per cent of domestic portfolios are indexed, compared with 19 per cent two years ago. Non-UK pension funds intended to follow UK pension funds and increase their use of external, specialist fund managers, largely for efficiency reasons and a more individual approach. Across Europe, about 62 per cent of funds employ external investment managers. Market presence was given as the most important reason for using an external manager, with efficiency and expertise also important factors. More than half of respondents saw an increasing role for trustees. About one-third of custodial services are still performed by fund managers, with global custodians proving almost as popular. Derivative instruments were used by more than half of those managers surveyed, but UK pension funds were slightly more reluctant than non-UK funds to use derivatives. Risk was cited as the main reason for not using derivatives.</p>

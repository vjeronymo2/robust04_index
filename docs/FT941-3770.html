			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / EU 'rescue' from effects of de-regulation predicted The 'cavalry' of the European Union will 'eventually arrive to rescue the UK from the worst effects of a de-regulated economy,' Mr John Edmonds, the GMB union's general secretary, will tell a US presidential commission today. In evidence to the commission in Washington on management and labour relations, Mr Edmonds will say Britain's industrial-relations system is likely to be 'stuck in limbo' for the time being. But, he continues in written evidence, EU social directives imposed on Britain will rescue the country from the worst excesses of Labour market de-regulation within the next five years. Mr Edmonds is taking comfort from a number of important European legal rulings in recent weeks on part-time work, the transfer of ownership of an enterprise and collective redundancies, which have strengthened the position of trade unions. The GMB leader will tell the commission that Britain cannot escape from the introduction of works councils - consultative and information forums in large companies - inside the EU. Multinationals are unlikely to establish them everywhere but in the UK, he said. British employers will also be greatly inconvenienced by EU directives which seek to improve the conditions of part-time workers and other vulnerable groups. Mr Edmonds will tell the commission that 'whenever a new directive is signed by the other 11 European countries and British workers do not benefit, everybody's trade union will slap in a claim for similar treatment. 'In multinational companies the claims write themselves. How can you deny to your British employees benefits which your other employees throughout Europe have by legal right?'</p>

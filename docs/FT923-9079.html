			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Philips half-year profits fall 63% in wake of price cuts PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, suffered a sharp drop in profits in the second quarter, as fierce competition in the key consumer electronics sector forced the company to reduce prices on compact disc players, televisions and video cassette recorders to maintain its market share. Net profit fell to Fl 82m (Pounds 25m) from Fl 552m the year before, when Philips' results were increased by a Fl 365m extraordinary gain on the sale of its remaining white goods activities to Whirlpool of the US. The sharp decline in quarterly results pushed first-half net profit down to Fl 256m, a fall of 63 per cent from the year before. Philips, whose shares have been under pressure since it issued a profits warning in June, said problems in consumer electronics masked progress in areas such as lighting, where first-half operating profits rose 64 per cent. 'If it had not been for the setbacks in consumer electronics, we might have served you champagne today,' Mr Jan Timmer, president, said at a press conference. Group turnover in the first half fell 1 per cent to Fl 25.8bn, again reflecting price-cutting in consumer electronics. Philips declined to give details of the losses in its consumer electronics sector but said selling prices had been reduced by an average 6 per cent to preserve the company's market share. Mr Henk Bodt, head of consumer electronics, said the sector was not expected to return to profitability until 1994. To achieve the turnaround, the company planned to boost the efficiency of its factories in Europe, to centralise its warehousing and to double the size of its European sales force. The consumer products division - which accounts for nearly half of Philips' annual sales and includes consumer electronics, appliances such as shavers and coffee-makers, and PolyGram, Philips' profitable, 80 per cent-owned music company - saw operating results tumble to Fl 118m in the first half from Fl 470m a year earlier. The malaise in consumer electronics also hit Philips' television picture tube business, as well as associate companies such as Grundig of Germany. Together, these difficulties in consumer electronics shaved Fl 400m to Fl 500m off net results, according to Mr Henk Appelo, Philips' finance director. Jan Timmer's offensive, Page 18</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Arts: Le Corsaire - Ballet The Kirov brought Le Corsaire into the season's repertory on Monday night. It is a preposterous, jolly staging. The corsair's vessel sails under the flag of convenience of 'Petipa', but its real identity is Carry on Slave-trading. The ballet's relationship to any historical antecedents is, shall we say, tenuous. Many editorial hands have been at work on production and score - what we see is nearer Indiana Jones than Byron. Amid piratical goings-on, lovely girls, Pashas, and a squad of Turkish troops who have fed too well on rahat loukoum, there are fascinating set pieces of choreography that have survived from Petipa's recensions of this celebrated 19th-century spectacular. They are surrounded by manic scenes that the Kirov artists play tongue-in-cheek, treading with supreme skill a tight-rope between emotional extravagance and farce. The staging, like its spatch-cocked score, makes no sense other than as an excuse for the company to have fun and then grip us with tremendous classic dancing. I don't think it is Le Corsaire - but I don't know what else to call it, and I enjoy every minute. Chief pleasure on Monday was Konstantin Zaklinsky as the slave-trader Lankedem. Zaklinsky is a spiffing comedian. Under the handsome trappings of the premier danseur there is a fortunately ill-hidden farceur. Whether chaffering over slave prices in the first scene or persuading the heroine to administer a Mickey Finn in a ludicrous bunch of flowers to the infinitely boring hero, Zaklinsky is a joy. He knows exactly how too-far to go, and in a cast more sober-sided than the piece deserves, he was a beacon of physical wit and of the light-hearted manner that must keep the drama alive. The hero, Conrad, is a thankless role, but not as thankless as Alexander Kurkov showed us. His side-kick Ali - whose reward in life is the tricky bits in the famous pas de deux, which turns out to be a pas de trois, with Conrad as the mari complaisant - was Farukh Ruzimatov. His locks more tangled than heretofore, and looking as if he were in search of a production of Hiawatha, Ruzimatov struck serpentine poses and gave us self-parody rather than performance. Yulia Makhalina was the heroine, Medora, very brilliant in technical effects, the conquering virtuoso ever in search of challenges. She provides dancing of aggressive virtuosity, and Medora's character is lost in the steps. I found Irina Shapchits delightful in the second ballerina role of Gulnara. Her dancing is so sweetly, featly done that you warm to the sheer charm of her technical fluency and to the character she establishes with such gentleness. The key to the production is the Jardin Anime, a classical show-piece which is well-preserved Petipa, and a beguiling reminder of his manner. Cohorts of girls in pink group themselves, bearing garlands. Fountains play. Makhalina and Shapchits nip through variations, each according to her temperament (and the contrast between bravura and grace is in itself intriguing). The prelude to the scene also offers soloist roles with more Petipa variations - in which I admired Larissa Lezhnina and Irina Sitnikova. All of this epitomises the evening: sparkling classic dance embedded in an exotic setting. And I suspect that some of Petipa's work was ever like that. It is, on any terms, worth seeing. The Kirov Ballet continues at The Coliseum with mixed programmes until July 31</p>

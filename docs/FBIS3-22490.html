Experts at the Consultation Committee of  the Ministry of Public Health (MPH) warned that although cholera  and typhoid situations in China have stabilized somewhat in  recent two years, yet poor sanitary conditions, low living  standards, and floating population in South China may trigger  outbreaks in that area. MPH urges all concerned epidemic disease  prevention departments to closely monitor trends of the  epidemic, and implement quarantine on floating population.</p>

It is  not to say that any other government would have done better or  anything different given the political illiteracy of most of the  political parties about the fundamentals of India and its  economy and its serious incompatibility with the Western  assumptions. Added to this is the unfortunate drift in the  debate in India on the Dunkel formulation.    The real issue is not whether the Dunkel Treaty is good or  bad for India--there is no doubt that it is bad. It is not just  an issue of India vs the rest or producers vs consumers, as some  would like us to believe. It is far deeper and fundamental. It  raises a far reaching question: whether all that is Western is  to be accepted as the modern, and whether the Western view of  life should have universal application and therefore acceptance.  The Dunkel Regime is the continuation of the Western assumptions  about the superiority of its thoughts, view of life-systems and  institutions. It aims at homogenisation of the world based on  Western experience. The experience of 10 per cent is being  experimented on the rest by Dunkel. The Indian debate so far on  Dunkel has missed precisely this point. It is the failure of  intellectuals and intellectualism in India.    On the practical side, the Dunkel Regime seeks to instal a  world government in trade, technology and services with its  attendant bureaucracy and bureaucratisation. A world government  in trade without a world currency, but dependent on the  currencies of Group 7 nations, will be at the speculators'  mercy. The Dunkel Regime is guaranteed to fail as any global  level hegemony is bound to whether powered by a single nation,  or a cartel of them or a multilateral system. The Indian  government and the political parties have failed to explore the  possibility of bilateral arrangements as an alternative for the  multilateral Dunkel Regime where, given the players and  deciders, India was genuinely a nobody and was rightly treated  as such. So because of incompetence, the Indian political system  has imposed the Dunkel Regime on India.    The Dunkel Regime castrates the government of India but  cannot bind the people of India. The Dunkel Regime can be turned  into a blessing in disguise. The people of India can be awakened  to realise a real alternative lifestyle which is their true  inheritance. For instance, Yoga, Ayurveda and Herbs can  substantially dislodge antibiotics; [word missing] can keep away  stress, heart breaks and psychiatrists. By social initiative we  can revive our independent mind which will blend the modern with  the traditional and discriminate between what we need from what  the West offers. The nation needs to revive this swadeshi  approach which will be symbolically a resistance against  Colgates, Cokes and Pepsies and substantially a re-instatement  of a native alternative as the substance and the Western as the  additive, instead of the Western as the substance and the  native an additive.</p>

This statement was made today by Eduard Shevardnadze at the  Georgian Parliament sitting.    Sharing his impressions of the recent visit to the United  States, he noted with satisfaction that Washington supports the  integrity and indivisibility of Georgia.    Speaking about the possibility of bringing UN peacekeeping  forces into Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone, Shevardnadze  pointed out that UN Security Council can make such a decision  only in terms of mutual agreement of both sides.    The Georgian Head also said the Secretary General of the UN  has already appealed to the governments of 14 countries with a  request to submit military forces for the peacekeeping mission.</p>

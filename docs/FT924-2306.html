			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Spain 'first, first, first' but other members do well too - Budget WHEN the word 'handbag' was mentioned at Mr Felipe Gonzalez's end-of-summit press conference, the Spanish premier and his ministers roared with approving laughter at this comparison with Mrs Margaret Thatcher's 1984 feat in extracting an EC budget rebate for the UK. Not since then has a member state so successfully held the Community to ransom, and Mr Gonzalez was not shy about proclaiming his achievement, or about having put Spain's national interests 'first, first and first', as one of his officials candidly expressed it. Mr Gonzalez pointed out that 'for Spain there will be a doubling' of the development aid all poorer member states get through EC 'cohesion' policy - contributions to the Community budget from the rich north and centre of the EC which are transferred to the south and the periphery. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, the Community's main paymaster, described the outcome as 'a solid compromise. . . between the poor and the developed countries.' It is no exaggeration to say that the future of the European Community hung on this compromise. Mr Gonzalez and his allies from Ireland, Portugal and Greece had demanded budgetary satisfaction as their price for endorsing the Danish opt-outs from Maastricht which are essential for all the 12 to be able to ratify the treaty. And next year's enlargement negotiations on EC entry for Austria, Sweden, Finland, and eventually Norway would not have won their sanction without agreement on future financing. Yet, as Mr Gonzalez acknowledged, the new budget package is, overall, tight when measured against the ambitions of Maastricht, and the interpretation of them by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president. Overall, the EC budget will rise from Ecu66.8bn (Pounds 54bn) now to Ecu84.1bn in 1999, in today's money. The budgetary ceiling, expressed as a portion of joint EC gross national product, will rise from 1.2 per cent now to 1.27 per cent in 1999. The cash increase will be greater over the seven years than this lifted limit suggests, because this year's spending - at around 1.14 per cent of EC GNP - still has 'headroom' under the ceiling. Mr Delors had originally proposed a rise to 1.37 per cent over five years, or an increase to Ecu87.5bn by 1997. He compromised last month, suggesting a rise to Ecu86.2bn over seven years (for a ceiling of 1.32 per cent of GNP in 1999). But Mr John Major, as current president of the EC Council, after first refusing any change in the ceiling, had insisted on holding the line at 1.25 per cent, which would have allowed spending of Ecu79.4bn in 1999 on current EC growth and inflation projections. Total 'structural' spending is to rise from Ecu18.6bn now to Ecu30bn in 1999. The main increase will be in the Structural Funds, which rise to Ecu27.4bn in 1999, and second, the new Cohesion Fund created by the Maastricht treaty, which will by then make up the Ecu2.6bn balance. This new fund is solely for Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece, as their per capita income is less than 90 per cent of the EC average, and is to help them meet EC environmental standards and fill in the 'missing links' in pan-European transport networks. Spain gets its doubling of fiscal transfers not least because it has informally endorsed claims on 55 per cent of the Cohesion Fund. The other 'cohesion' countries are not too unhappy because the main increase in the Structural Funds applies to them. Germany also gets a saleable deal. There is unlikely to be any net increase in its huge Ecu9bn net contribution to the budget. Mr Horst Kohler, the German state secretary for finance, pointed out that new eastern states would get treatment equal to that of the cohesion countries, worth some DM13bn (Pounds 5.3bn) over seven years - something of a rebate for Germany. The UK rebate, worth some Pounds 2bn a year but hotly contested by Mr Kohl, was left intact. The unpopular French government also got a discreet political fillip from its partners, opening the way to compensation for French farmers now up in arms about the Uruguay Round farm trade deal. There is to be no formal relaxing of farm spending limits, which will rise as foreseen from Ecu35.3bn now to Ecu38.4bn in 1999. But there is a 'weasel' paragraph allowing 'appropriate steps' to meet exchange rate turbulence - which Commission officials already reckon could plausibly produce an additional Ecu1.5bn for farmers. It is 'internal policies' - on the environment, transport, R&amp;D and infrastructure - which suffered most from the success of Spain and its allies in prying loose the most from a tight Community wad. These policies are the bread-and-butter of the EC's recent expansion of its competence. The UK, which prefers loose co-operation between governments to Community action stimulated in Brussels, well knew that it was the latter which would be squeezed most when it decided to be parsimonious on EC finance. Spain was not the only victor of the compromise.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Gansu Province and  Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, both in the northwest hinterland,  have both registered rapid growth in foreign trade, according to  their officials participated at an international trade fair  being held here.    Gansu Province registered 280 million U.S. dollars in  exports  last year and is expected to boost its annual export volume to  330 million U.S. dollars this year.    With over 1000 foreign-funded enterprises, the province has  significantly raised the export volume of finished products in  the petroleum and chemical industries, electronics, textiles and  garments, while sales of raw materials such as grain, edible oil  and Chinese medicine have declined.    In Ningxia, a small Muslim province, exports surpassed 100  million U.S. dollars for the first in 1993 with minerals and  farm and sideline products such as ferrosilicon, coal and  cashmere leading the region's exports.    To further exploit domestic and overseas market, Ningxia has  established trade offices across China and in the United States,  Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.</p>

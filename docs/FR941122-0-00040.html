			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The January 11, 1993 regulations implementing substitution and reduced utilization plans pose similar problems concerning the creation of excess, new allowances. However, because section 408(c)(1)(B) of the Act (unlike sections 404(b) and (c)) specifies the formula for allocating allowances, the Agency is adopting a different approach in modifying the requirements for compensating units than the one adopted today for substitution units. In order to ensure that reduced utilization plans are used as a means of accounting for emissions from load shifting from Phase I units and not as a method of creating excess, new allowances through early entry of Phase II units into Phase I, the Agency must limit the circumstances under which Phase II units can become compensating units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the November 18, 1993 notice of proposed rulemaking, the Agency suggested two options for limiting the designation of compensating units: the first option requiring that the compensating units be actually needed to compensate for reduced utilization and involving an end-of-year review of need; and the second option limiting up-front the category of units that can qualify to become compensating units. The Agency is today rejecting the first option and is adopting the second option with some modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Limiting the Category of Units That Can Qualify as Compensating Units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the option (Option 2 in the November 18, 1993 proposal) adopted today with some changes, the category of units that may be designated as compensating units is limited to those units whose designation cannot create excess, new allowances. The final revised rule provides that a unit can be designated as a compensating unit only if (1) the unit's baseline multiplied by the lesser of the unit's 1985 actual or allowable SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate does not exceed (2) the baseline multiplied by the lesser of (i) the greater of the unit's 1989 or 1990 actual SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate or (ii) the unit's most stringent federally enforceable or State enforceable SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions limitation for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for 1995&hyph;99 as of November 15, 1990 plus (iii) the lesser of 10 percent of the tonnage calculated under (1) or 200 tons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with its conclusions concerning substitution units, the Agency maintains that excess allowances may be created by the designation, as a compensating unit, of any Phase II unit whose baseline, multiplied by what its annual SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate in Phase I would be in the absence of the designation, is less than the annual allowances allocated to the unit as a compensating unit. Even if such a Phase II unit increases its own generation to provide compensating generation, the unit may be able to use its own allowance allocation to cover its own emissions without making any more emission rate reductions than it would have otherwise made. In addition, the unit may have extra allowances to transfer, sell, or bank for future use. In order to prevent the creation of excess, new allowances, such units will not be allowed to be designated as compensating units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, the Agency concludes that excess, new allowances are created when Phase II units entering Phase I (e.g., compensating units) are allocated allowances for emissions rate reductions made, or mandated by federal or State law adopted, before passage of title IV. The general approach in the final rule is to bar, from becoming compensating units, those units that would otherwise receive such allocations if they were compensating units. Units that qualify as compensating units will be allocated allowances under the formula in section 408(c)(1)(B), i.e., baseline times the 1985 actual or allowable emissions rate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, despite the claim of some commenters, Option 2 of the proposal does not change the allocation formula, which applies once it is determined that a unit qualifies as a compensating unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Contrary to some commenters, section 408(c)(1)(B) does not require the Administrator to approve whatever units a utility designates as compensating for reduced utilization. The Administrator must approve only those compensating-unit designations that are consistent with the purposes of title IV. 42 U.S.C. 7651h(c)(2). Section 408(c)(1)(B) does not expressly require the Administrator to consider a unit's 1989 or 1990 actual emissions rate or its most stringent emissions limitation. However, in reviewing proposed compensating units using these factors, the Agency is implementing section 408(c)(1)(B) in a way that precludes ``a pattern or practice''_i.e., designation of compensating units that would receive excess, new allowances_``that is counter to the intent of section 404 and *&blank;*&blank;* title [IV of the Act].'' Senate Rep. 101&hyph;228 at 334.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This approach is similar to that adopted with regard to substitution units except that, while the final rule allows units to become substitution units and adjusts their allocations, the final rule completely bars certain units from becoming compensating units. Consistent with the provisions concerning substitution units, the provisions for compensating units use the greater of the unit's 1989 or 1990 emissions rate as reasonably reflecting voluntary emissions reductions made before passage of title IV. Similarly, the provisions for substitution units and the provisions for compensating units take the same approach (including the treatment of non-unit-specific emissions limitations) to using the most stringent federal or State emissions limitations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section III(A)(1)(b) of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, because some units could otherwise be completely barred from becoming compensating units because of very small differences (e.g., due to normal variability in coal quality) between their 1985 emissions and their actual or mandated emissions as of the passage of title IV, the Agency is building some extra flexibility into the provisions governing compensating units. The final rule allows the designation of compensating units whose baseline times the 1985 emissions rate is greater by only a very small amount (i.e., the lesser of 10 percent or 200 tons) than their baseline times the lesser of their 1989 (or 1990) emissions rate or their most stringent emissions limitation for Phase I. The flexibility band is measured in tons of emissions in order to ensure that the potential for creating excess, new allowances is restricted. Further, the flexibility band is also limited as a percentage of 1985 emissions because the band must apply to all potential compensating units, which can vary significantly in size and thus in total emissions. Using only a percentage limit or only a specific tonnage would have an inconsistent impact on units of different sizes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the inherent unreliability of projected utilization figures (discussed above in section III(A)(1)(c) of this preamble), baseline, not projected utilization, will be used to determine whether a unit qualifies as a compensating unit. If a utilization projection less than baseline were used to determine that a unit qualified as a compensating unit but subsequently the unit had a higher actual utilization in Phase I that would have otherwise disqualified the unit, the unit could create excess, new allowances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>   [Text] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd tonight welcomed U.S.  proposals for widening the threat of air strikes to protect  Bosnia's safe havens and intensifying sanctions on Serbia. He  said the United States and Europe were at one over the way  forward, and it was necessary to co-ordinate the military effort  on the ground and in the air.    Washington wants to widen the threat of air strikes to  protect other United Nations safe havens and impose stiffer  sanctions on Serbia, which backs the Bosnian Serbs.    Mr Hurd said: "I believe that the United States and the  European allies are now at one on the main points. Yes we need  to use air power, not because it is magic, not because it will  itself bring peace, but because it can be useful in protecting  the safe areas. Yes we need to keep sanctions strong and indeed  strengthen them where we can, where there are loopholes. Yes we  need UN troops on the ground, more troops. I hope the President  will be able to say America is no longer having to block the  financing of other people's troops, UN troops, on the ground in  Bosnia. I hope other countries will now come forward with  troops."    But, on Channel 4 News, he stressed the only way the war  would end was through a negotiated settlement. And Mr Hurd said  he could imagine a situation when the UN had to withdraw from  the war zone and leave the fighting factions to battle it out.  "I can imagine a situation in which the UN and the  international effort had collapsed and there was no grounds  therefore for preventing the sides from fighting it out. I  think its very dangerous, tragic and might lead to a spread of  the war," he said.</p>

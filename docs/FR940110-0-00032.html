			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The source of this information is the Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) study, ``Draft Report_Review of Epogen Reimbursement'' (Audit No. A&hyph;01&hyph;92&hyph;00506). The OIG reviewed invoices paid by dialysis facilities and financial reports filed by the manufacturer and found that facilities generally pay nine to ten percent less for EPO than the Medicare payment rate. In addition, the manufacturer gave surveyed facilities end-of-year rebates ranging from two percent to eight percent depending upon the volume of EPO used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters expressed the hope that local physicians will be able to continue to administer EPO incident to a physician's service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation is in no way intended to preclude provision of EPO furnished incident to a physician's service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter was of the opinion that there is no statutory authority for the provision in &sect;413.170(c)(6)) requiring suppliers to accept assignment of benefits for EPO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statutory provisions for payment of benefits for EPO are in section 1881(b)(1). Section 1881(b)(1)(B) of the Act provides for payments ``to or in behalf of'' beneficiaries for home dialysis supplies and equipment. However, with respect to payment for self-administered EPO, section 1881(b)(1)(C) permits payment only to a supplier of home dialysis supplies and equipment that is not a provider of services, a renal dialysis facility, or a physician. There is no authority in the law to pay this benefit to a beneficiary. Therefore, the law implicitly requires payment to a supplier under assignment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, any other reading of the statute would have anomalous results. For example, if the statute did not require suppliers to accept assignment, the beneficiary would be protected for charges for home dialysis supplies and equipment, but not for EPO furnished directly by the supplier. Nothing in the legislative history suggests the Congress intended such a result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Specific Changes to the Interim Final Rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the comments discussed above, we have made the following changes in the text of the interim final rule published on September 4, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Patient care plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have revised &sect;405.2137(b)(7) to establish separate requirements for review of medication and evaluation of hematocrit for iron stores and to suggest use of a patient log for keeping the physician informed of the results of blood tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Patient selection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have revised &sect;405.2163 to_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Require that the physician follow the drug labeling when he or she establishes the protocol and monitors home use of EPO; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Include as an assessment requirement obtaining assurance that EPO can be stored under refrigeration, secure from tampering and out of reach of children in the patient's residence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Add a paragraph (h) to highlight the responsibilities of the physician and the dialysis facility and to make clear that the ``two-month'' supply of EPO is a maximum and that control of the amount ``on hand'' is maintained through the physician's prescriptions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> B. Technical amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Throughout the text ``Erythropoietin'' is changed to ``Epoetin'', which is the generic name of the drug.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. In &sect;413.170(c)(6), the cross-reference is corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

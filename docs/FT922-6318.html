			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: WPP warns shareholders not to reject refinancing WPP, The troubled inter-national marketing services group which is seeking a second refinancing from its 28-bank syndicate for its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 551.3m) debt, has prepared moves to bypass shareholder resistance to a recapitalisation proposal announced on May 13 and approved by the four lead banks. According to an internal WPP document, if shareholders refuse to accept an equity-debt exchange whereby the banks subscribe a rights issue worth some Pounds 150m in exchange for reducing WPP's debt by about 25 per cent, then there are three alternatives:  -continuing with the 'status quo', which it warns will mean the 'group's operational difficulties from perceived debt problems would continue; no prospect of dividends on ordinary or preference shares in foreseeable future' and, in the event of a group collapse, 'no value for shareholders'.  -the issue of 'high yielding subordinated loan stock' with the 'possibility' of a clawback offer for existing shareholders to subscribe. However, WPP warns this would mean 'high interest payment' preventing 'prospects of any eventual recovery in present shareholder value'.  -or a new subsidiary would be established and listed on the stock exchange. This would issue Pounds 150m of preferred ordinary shares to banks and the issue would rapidly swamp any interest in the shares of the current WPP group.</p>

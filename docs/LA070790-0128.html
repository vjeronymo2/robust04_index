			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL LETS VOTERS DECIDE ON PARK PLAN  </P> <P> The City Council has decided not to seek a bond issue in the Nov. 6 election  but instead to have a referendum on what voters want built in Central Park.  </P> <P> The council dropped the bond issue option this week after failing to agree on  financing major projects proposed for the park, including a youth sports  complex.  </P> <P> Councilman John Erskine had pushed for getting a bond issue on the Nov. 6  ballot. He contended the city has scores of building projects that should be  financed by bonds, rather than the city's hard-pressed general fund.  </P> <P> But after failing to get agreement from five of the City Council's seven  members -- the minimum needed to put a bond issue on the ballot -- Erskine  instead opted for an advisory vote by residents on Nov. 6.  </P> <P> The council at its July 16 meeting will decide what proposals to submit to the  voters in the Nov. 6 "wish list" referendum. The possible list includes  improvements to the equestrian trail in Central Park, removal of methane gas  from a landfill adjoining the park and financing for a youth sports complex.  </P> <P> A coalition of parents of gymnasts, Little League baseball players and soccer  players has been urging the City Council to use some undeveloped Central Park  land for a multi-use sports complex for youngsters. The proposed youth sports  complex would have a building for the gymnasts and playing fields for baseball  and soccer.  </P> <P> Councilmen Don MacAllister and Wes Bannister voiced strong support for the  youth sports complex.  </P> <P> "Huntington Beach does less for its small kids than most other cities,"  Bannister said. "We provide activities for the adults and teen-agers, but we  don't do much for the small kids."  </P> <P> MacAllister said that in previous years, the City Council has voted to put  baseball fields and other youth sports facilities into Central Park. But the  city staff "has sat on its hands" and failed to implement the council's  instructions, MacAllister contended.  </P> <P> By a 4-3 vote, the council designated a portion of Central Park as the proposed  site for a youth sports complex. The site is undeveloped park land on the west  side of Golden West Street, at the intersection of Talbert Avenue.  </P> <P> Financing for the proposed youth sports complex remains unsettled, however, and  the question is likely to be among the items in the Nov. 6 advisory vote.

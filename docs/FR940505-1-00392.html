If a minimum of 55 percent as described above can not be achieved, subject facilities shall identify alternative methods which will achieve an equivalent level of reduction. Facilities shall be subject to the 55 percent requirement until such time as the alternative methods are submitted and approved in writing by the USEPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The recovery system shall achieve a minimum 80% control efficiency. Demonstration of control efficiency shall be performed in accordance with the methods specified in paragraph (h)(6) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The recovery system shall be maintained and operated in a manner which is consistent with manufacturer specifications and which consistently achieves the control efficiency stated in paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Manured areas shall be managed to minimize the pooling or accumulation of liquids and shall be sloped 2 to 4 percent to allow drainage of excess moisture. Any facility wastewater and precipitation on or drainage through manure areas shall meet the requirements specified in the California Code of Regulations, Title 23, Division 3, Chapter (Discharges of Waste to Land), ``Article 6. Confined Animal Facilities.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Livestock waste not processed under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section and which is placed in a manure storage area or stockpile shall be maintained in long, narrow windrows, no higher than 6 feet. The windrows shall be turned every 5 days during the first 30 days of storage and shall be removed from the dairy cattle facility at least 3 times per year or applied to a disposal field or crop lands at least 3 times per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Reporting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Each owner or operator of a facility that is subject to the provisions of paragraph (h)(3) of this section shall submit for approval to the EPA by January 1, 1998 information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of paragraph (h)(3) of this section by January 1, 1999.

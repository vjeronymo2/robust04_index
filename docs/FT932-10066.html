			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Arts: An artist ripe for reassessment - William Packer admires the work of Graham Sutherland Some 40 years ago, Graham Sutherland stood higher in reputation than any of his contemporaries, higher even than his friend and associate, Francis Bacon who, though no less radical, was still comparatively obscure. Sutherland in the mid 1950s was Britain's pre-eminent and, after the Churchill portrait, most controversial modern painter. By the time of his death in 1980, at the age of 76, all that had long since changed. Indeed it changed with a remarkable suddenness. One minute he was the cynosure of all attention: I well remember in the early 1960s the excitement at the publication of the latest monograph; the next, he was old hat, passe, a figure not merely established but of the establishment, honoured, secure, predictable and safe. Two late decades of indifferent portraiture hardly helped his cause, but then he is hardly the first artist so to suffer a decline. His reputation languishes still and clearly he is ripe, even overdue, for reassessment. The problem is that his career seemed to fall into three sharply distinctive phases, and it has long been the received wisdom that his reputation, such as it is, stands on the work of his middle period, from the late 1930s when he turned to painting, to the early 1960s and the completion of the Coventry tapestry commission. Such a view is not altogether wrong. His work in the immediate post-war period, when he had moved on from the earlier romantic landscapes to the more intense and psychologically ambiguous imagery derived from natural forms, is perhaps the strongest of all. That was the time of his closest association with Bacon, their working relationship one of true equality and mutual respect, each directly influencing the other. But it is, for all that, too simple a view. In particular, it disregards the significance to his development of the first period, when he was entirely taken up with etching. Again the received wisdom has it that here was a young artist limited both to and by his craft, who had at last to break free of it to realise his true creative potential as an artist. It is all too pat, too easy, and it is the great virtue of this small but quite disproportionately important show of these early etchings, at The Fine Art Society, to give the lie to it. Sutherland was a student at London's Goldsmiths' College in the early 1920s, where etching became his particular study. This was the time of the so-called etching boom, when the market in prints was remarkably strong, and naturally attractive to any ambitious young artist. Again the general supposition has been that he was merely a follower, yet another fashionable neo-Palmerian, filtering the romantic intensity of the young Samuel Palmer of a century before through the work of such Edwardian topographical illustrators as Frederick Griggs. In fact Sutherland was much more his own man, looking not only to the example of Palmer but also more variously to other masters, notably Rembrandt and Whistler, and refining a remarkable technique in the process. The etching market collapsed with the crash of 1929, but Sutherland did not abandon the print for other means of income and expression. Rather, it freed him to look about him, into himself, and to experiment and develop. It was to be a slow process, marked by periods of teaching, and by the falling-off of his practise in etching in favour first of lithography and then of watercolour. But already, in the Pastoral and Garden prints of the early 1930s we can see the marked shift in his interest towards a more immediately contemporary manner, and to the particular example, at once surreal, romantic and organic, of Paul Nash. It is by this thread that we are led on first to the more familiar Welsh landscape water-colours of the late 1930s, and so to the oil paintings of his maturity in the 1940s. Sutherland may have been a slow developer, but the young artist was a considerable artist, even so. The work, early and late, is all of a piece. The only disappointment is that this fascinating show should have so short a run, but it does at least overlap with that of the later prints at Marlborough Graphics, to establish the connection between the younger and the older man. By it we may follow the evolution of the imagery, through the such things as the Thorn Cross of the mid 1950s to the bestiaries of the 1960s and '70s, with their bees and fleas, tortoises and birds. But the technical aspects are the more interesting  - for, with the larger scale and the evident practical intervention of technical assistants, the intimacy and intensity of the early work quite falls away. That old integrity of image, object and practice has gone, and we are left with the image more or less alone. Also at the Fine Art Society is a true curiosity, a retrospective exhibition of the work of John Downton, three years Sutherland's junior, who died in 1991. It is a first showing of the work for Downton was reclusive and, a few works in the Royal Academy in the late 1930s apart, he kept his work to himself. He was a painter of the head and the half-length, much influenced by Florentine painting and working in tempera, the most desiccated and painstaking of media. Yet he is redolent of his particular period between the Wars, as it might be a minor Frampton, Brockhurst or Cowie, the image isolated, psychologically ambiguous and remote. He is not a major discovery but a discovery nonetheless, well worth the making. Who knows how many more such there are, 'born to blush unseen'. Graham Sutherland: Early Etchings; presented by Gordon Cooke at The Fine Art Society, 148 New Bond Street W1, until May 14. Graham Sutherland as Printmaker 1950-1979: Marlborough Graphics, 6 Albemarle Street W1, until June 12. John Downton: Fine Art Society, until May 28</p>

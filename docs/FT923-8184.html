			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / North American Free Trade Agreement: Mexican government keen to increase competition - Financial sector IT HAS been Mexico, rather than the US or Canada, that has made the most concessions in negotiations covering the financial sector, largely because its banking system is the most protected of the three, and because the Mexican government is keen to introduce more competition, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. Mexico will increase, over seven years, the maximum market share for US and Canadian investors in banking from 8 to 15 per cent, and in securities from 10 to 20 per cent. By the year 2000, both the US and Canada will be granted full treatment on an equal footing with the local banks. The share any individual US or Canadian bank can acquire will initially be limited to 1.5 per cent of banking equity. Mexico now limits foreign investment to 30 per cent in any individual bank, and 49 per cent in an insurance company. The concessions are unlikely to change Mexico's retail banking overnight. The market - with 18 banks - is already highly competitive, and the required investment substantial. CS First Boston, in a report on Mexico's banking system, concluded: 'The up-front costs which must be faced are huge and the risks of failure too high. We believe that the US and Canadian banks will not repeat in Mexico the mistakes some US banks made in Europe by pursuing a strategy of world-wide retail banking.' But CS First Boston reckons there could be a substantial increase in foreign market share in the wholesale market. Mexico's large companies already have access to US banks when borrowing money, but the medium-size and smaller ones have to rely on Mexican banks, which earn generous spreads on their corporate lending. Foreign banks, perhaps in joint ventures with Mexican counterparts, could enter this market, driving down interest rates.</p>

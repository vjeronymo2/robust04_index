			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Constitutional court to rule on abortion law THE difficulties of integrating two different social systems in Germany will be tested today when the constitutional court decides whether a new abortion law is binding. The law, passed by the Bundestag in June 1992, but immediately referred to the constitutional court by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is a reminder that women in the former east Germany had far more rights than their western counterparts before unification. Abortion in the eastern states was available free on demand, without medical consent, up to the 12th week of pregnancy. In west Germany, abortion was tightly restricted, requiring recommendation by at least three doctors. This was anchored to the constitution, which states that 'everyone shall have the right to life and to inviolability of his person.' In the event, many women either travelled to Holland, or used personal connections in west Germany. Unification meant a compromise had to be found. After months of debate, a free vote was held in the Bundestag. The eastern deputies of the ruling Christian Democratic Union, the Social Democrats and the liberal Free Democrats voted to liberalise abortion throughout Germany, but with some restrictions. A woman had the right to an abortion for up to 12 weeks, provided she accepted counselling. The outcome was challenged by Chancellor Kohl, concerned about losing support from the conservative wing of the CDU and particularly its sister party, the (Catholic) Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria. He immediately applied for an injunction to the constitutional court. As a result, united Berlin is still divided. Women in the west are bound by pre-1989 restrictions, while women in the east have retained their pre-unification status. The court now can throw out the law, ask for amendments, or accept it.</p>

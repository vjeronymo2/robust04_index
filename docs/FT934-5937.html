			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / UN envoy hopes to restart Bosnia talks Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations mediator on former Yugoslavia, said yesterday he hoped next Monday's meeting between European Union foreign ministers and the warring factions in Bosnia would provide the basis for fresh talks leading to a political settlement. He said the EU initiative, which offers a phase-out of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro if more land is returned to the Moslems by Bosnian Serbs, was 'of imperative importance' in seeking to restart the talks. Negotiations on dividing Bosnia into three ethnically-based mini-states collapsed in September over Moslem demands for 3-4 per cent more territory. Other issues for the meeting on Monday, which Presidents Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia will also attend, concern guarantees of access for humanitarian aid convoys in Bosnia and the establishment of what Mr Stoltenberg called a modus vivendi between Croatia and Serb-controlled areas now under UN protection, beginning with a ceasefire. Officials from the UN refugee agency said yesterday that after three days of relatively trouble-free aid deliveries into central and eastern Bosnia, convoys were again experiencing delays and blockages by Bosnian Serb forces. The Georgian government and the breakaway region of Abkhazia are to hold UN-sponsored peace talks in Geneva.</p>

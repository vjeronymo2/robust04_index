			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Charge of financial engineering? - Trafalgar could offset its tax losses, writes Michael Smith Mr David Morris, chairman of Northern Electric, has been involved in one hostile takeover bid before and, in that contest in the electrical engineering sector, he was with Delta when it bid unsuccessfully for Scholes in 1987. 'We are not going to lose this one,' he said as he launched an attempt to keep his company independent from Trafalgar House. His opponents are equally determined. Yesterday's Pounds 1.2bn offer may be insufficient to win Trafalgar its quarry but analysts believe that the benefits of a takeover for it are such that it may be willing to offer more if pushed. The bid will be watched closely throughout the electricity sector. The possibilities of a white knight emerging from within the sector are being played down in the City. Other putative intra-sector alliances, however, together with potential hostile bids from outside, will be given impetus by the bid, particularly if it is successful. What then are Trafalgar's chances? It was still hopeful of a friendly merger, and was trying hard yesterday not to be hostile to Northern's management but a flavour of criticism inevitably crept through. Mr Nigel Rich, chief executive, said that the industry regulator's decision to seek distribution price cuts of 17 per cent next April from Northern implied that Northern had much to do in cost cutting. Some regional companies face price cuts of just 11 per cent. 'Trafalgar's management is confident of its ability to help Northern run its business more efficiently,' said Mr Rich. Analysts were more convinced about what Northern could bring to Trafalgar. Mr Rich pointed to the combination of regulated and non-regulated businesses and to the possibilities for combining the two companies' electricity expertise to expand overseas. Any company would bring similar things. The unusual aspect of Trafalgar's bid is how it can offset tax losses against Northern's steady stream of earnings. Trafalgar has Pounds 223m of unrelieved advance corporation tax and tax losses which could be offset against trading profits and capital gains. Analysts estimate these could cut Northern's tax rate by up to 5 percentage points. The capital losses could be put to use in the flotation of the National Grid, scheduled for May or June. Assuming the regional power companies have to pay about Pounds 1bn in capital gains tax, Northern's 6.5 per cent share of that would be Pounds 65m, some or all of which could be offset by Trafalgar. This may help to explain why Trafalgar decided to launch its bid more than three months before the expiry of the government's golden share. Waiting longer could have meant foregoing the chances to offset Northern's Grid flotation tax bill. In the forthcoming weeks Northern will undoubtedly use the 'financial engineering' charge against Trafalgar. Sensitive to such charges, Mr Simon Keswick, Trafalgar chairman, said his company had no intention of asset stripping. 'We want to keep the business,' he said. Northern will base its attack on Trafalgar's prospects, combined with a defence of its own record. 'Nearly 60 per cent of the basic offer consists of paper of uncertain value,' its directors said. However, this argument may prove of limited value given the cash alternative available which is a 28 per cent premium on Northern's share price a month ago. In defending their record, Northern managers acknowledge that in the first two years after privatisation four years ago the company was rated below average by the sector but say it has been re-evaluated since and this has been reflected by a rise in its share price. Mr Morris will be pointing to several distinguishing features about the company in a sector where 12 companies are constantly trying to differentiate themselves from each other. It has, he says, been the most successful in increasing its supply business outside its area and it was the first to buy back its shares to cut the tax bills of shareholders. Yesterday both Trafalgar and Northern were claiming comfort from Northern's share price which remained, at Pounds 10.18, up 33p on the day, below both the cash and convertible preference share price offered by Trafalgar. Trafalgar believes it means the market approves its bid. Northern believes it means the market is concerned about the possibilities of Trafalgar clearing all the regulatory and fair trading hurdles in its way. Either way there is plenty of time for arguments and share prices to change. Trafalgar said it did not expect to complete the takeover before the end of March when the government's golden share expires. Shareholders can comfort themselves with the thought that they are not being forced to leap to decisions.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> BOARD MAY ATTEMPT TO PROTECT FARMLAND  </P> <P> County officials may create a trust to help preserve farmland that is being  lost to development throughout the county.  </P> <P> On Tuesday the Board of Supervisors will consider setting up an advisory  committee to study how an agricultural land trust can be established.  </P> <P> The interest in forming a trust came out of a 1989 report from the Beyond the  Year 2000 Advisory Committee. The report to the supervisors recommended forming  a trust to preserve both agricultural and open land.  </P> <P> The committee said it is important to preserve the agricultural industry that  has dominated the county's history, Planner Gene Kjellberg said.  </P> <P> Also, the committee said land should be preserved for aesthetic reasons and to  maintain the lifestyle of residents.  </P> <P> "We are indeed losing agricultural land in the cities and in the unincorporated  areas," Kjellberg said.  </P> <P> A trust could preserve the land in several ways, he said, depending on how it  is set up. One way is to provide farmers with economic incentives to maintain  their land for agricultural use. It could also mean using donations, grants or  possibly tax money to purchase land or the development rights to it.  </P> <P> In the report to the supervisors, Kjellberg recommends setting up an 11-member  advisory committee, including elected officials, agricultural experts and  county residents.  </P> <P> "Agricultural lands are the most immediately threatened with development  because they are located in closest proximity to existing urban areas and  available urban services," he said in his report.

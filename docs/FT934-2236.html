			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Consumers' Association embarrassed at being found out The Consumers' Association yesterday admitted to being embarrassed after the Advertising Standards Authority found it guilty of misleading advertising. The authority upheld a complaint by a reader of New Scientist over a leaflet promoting a prize draw run by the association's Which? magazine. The leaflet was headed: 'We've doubled your chances of winning the Pounds 250,000 grand first prize. Specially for readers of New Scientist.' It went on: 'We usually offer six prize draw numbers but for you we have allocated 12 numbers.' The complainant maintained that if everyone received 12 numbers, the chance of winning would remain the same. The association admitted that the insert appeared in 90 magazines, though it said most entries would have come from mailings offering six numbers.</p>

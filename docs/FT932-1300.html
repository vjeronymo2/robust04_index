			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Arts: Tango Para Dos - Dance We know it takes two to tango. The torsos are glued together while the feet go mad below, and the cutting rhythms of the band slice into the dance. Fake passion and real bravura are the hall-marks of skill. The tango is a fascinating expression of social and sexual attitudes, born in Buenos Aires brothels, and tamed - relatively speaking - for the ball-room early in this century. As performed by Argentinian artists it has an intensity and a fervour that no other dancers can give it, and the memorable visit of Tango Argentina a couple of years ago asserted how rich were its forms and its potential in the theatre. Sadler's Wells is now playing host to another troupe, Tango para Dos, rather less sophisticated than Tango Argentina, and less polished, but at its best still showing that combination of quick feelings and razor-edged footwork that is so exhilarating to watch, and to dance. The show is devised by - and features as its stars - Miguel Angel Zotto and Milena Plebs. There is a fine tango orchestra, basic and unimaginative staging, a singer, and two other dance couples. It aims to explore the tango's social history, and its performers are adept. Their steps have the bright flash and riposte of duelling - the tango can look a dangerous encounter - and the orchestra whines and barks and charges the movement with all the cheap emotion one could want. There is a brilliant scene, inspired by a 1930s chanteuse who always appeared in men's clothes, in which three couples, in fedoras and suits, dance, and one of the girls, the beguiling Mora, also sings. (It is reminiscent of those naughty and ambivalent botes photographed by Brassai, where the clientele's sexuality was never quite what it seemed). The evening, though, has a problem - the decision that we are to be treated to a continuing homage to Carlos Gardel (1890-1935), a supreme tango singer, and to Mr Zotto's willingness to 'realise' his songs, to mime to his records, and to emulate his performances in films. This activity brings him repeatedly on stage with patent leather hair and a broad and unrelenting grin, in a series of laboured little numbers which may mean everything to a Buenos Aires audience, but are bemusing to those of us not devotees of the Argentinian cinema of the 1930s. (What would Buenos Aires make of the deadly George Formby?) Dressed as a gaucho, pour le sport, and in various other outfits, Mr Zotto smiles interminably, and is very vital. Miss Plebs also appears with him, once allegedly as Carmen Miranda, an attempt more probable as an impersonation of Dame Barbara Cartland. There is something ineffably amateurish about all this, and the programme suffers. For tango-fans, the first half of the evening is rewarding: the verve and virtuosity of the dances, the charming singing of Roxana Fontan, and the admirable orchestra, are worth part of anyone's evening. Tango para Dos is at Sadler's Wells until July 10</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATES FOR TUSTIN'S CITY COUNCIL  </P> <P> One of the major issues brought out by most of the candidates for the Tustin  City Council is the chaotic, circus-like atmosphere of our council meetings.  They are right on target.  </P> <P> The most troublesome part of this situation, however, is that three of the  candidates, John Kelly, Berklee Maughan and Carole Bryand have actively  participated in creating this atmosphere, have said that they like the way the  council has been running, and that they intend to generate more of the same if  elected.  </P> <P> The last thing our city needs is more clowns trying to keep the circus going. I  would hope that people will take the time to vote on April 10, and to vote for  candidates we can be proud of: candidates who will restore a professional and  adult atmosphere to the serious business of running a city.  </P> <P> GREGG LYNCH  </P> <P> Tustin  </P></p>

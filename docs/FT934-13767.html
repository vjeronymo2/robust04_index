			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / ICL launches an advanced system to tackle IBM ICL, owned by Fujitsu of Japan but based in the UK, will today launch an advanced computer system based on technology developed in Europe and paid for by the European Community's principal information technology research programme. The system, a parallel processor called Goldrush, is one of the first examples of the commercial exploitation of research carried out under the UK Alvey initiative, which absorbed Pounds 350m of public funds between 1983 and 1989, and the European Community's Esprit initiative, part of the EC's Framework programme budgeted at Ecu2.2bn a year. Parallel processing, where many small computers work together, will eventually replace conventional data processing methods, experts believe. Goldrush is designed to process thousands of transactions a second as part of a larger computer network. It will enable ICL to bid for data processing contracts for airlines and banks, which have traditionally been won by IBM. The Goldrush machines will cost from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 10m. A small Goldrush system is being tested at the Department of Social Security, to see whether it can be used to draw together disparate information held on separate files about claimants. Alvey and Esprit were started in response to fears that Europe was lagging the US and Japan in high technology. Designed to boost pan-European collaboration in basic - or 'pre-competitive' - research, they have been criticised for absorbing large sums of money while generating little of commercial value. The research on which Goldrush is based was carried out by ICL in collaboration with Groupe Bull of France and Siemens of Germany before the British company was acquired by Fujitsu in 1990. Neither Bull nor Siemens have taken up their rights to the research. ICL has spent about Pounds 42m to develop parallel processing to the point of a commercial offering. Competitors include Tandem Computers and International Business Machines, both of the US. Mr Peter Bonfield, ICL chairman and chief executive, said yesterday that Fujitsu would not have free access to the Goldrush technology. He hoped that the computer could be sold to other manufacturers, including Fujitsu, to be marketed as part of their own product range. Letters, Page 19</p>

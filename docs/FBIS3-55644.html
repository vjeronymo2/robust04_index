Hava Yolari, Uzbekistan's national airline,  has acquired two of these planes. The comfortable passenger  compartment has room for 64 people. The fundamentally new,  multiblade, virtually silent engines are twice as powerful and  economical as those of the An-24. It can even land and take off  from a dirt strip. The cabin controls have been simplified as  much as possible. Many of the instruments have been replaced by  an on-board computer. The new plane will replace the outdated  Yak-40 and An-24 on CIS internal routes. To be frank, this  shows that once again the series production of modern equipment  is reliant on economic integration between Russia, Uzbekistan,  and other CIS states..

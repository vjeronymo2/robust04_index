The meeting was held amid the budding of some Hong Kong  underground groups in the Mainland where they commit various  kinds of crime posing hazards to social order both in the  Mainland and in the territory.    A representative from the Hong Kong police gave details on  the illegal groups operating in the territory as well as on  measures adopted by the Hong Kong police to counter the groups.  The Mainland police officers elaborated on the infiltration of  illegal organizations into the Mainland for various kinds of  crime and they gave an account of the measures being taken  against such groups.    Participants at the meeting believed that the strengthening  of cooperation between the police in the Mainland and in Hong  Kong was a necessity for the prevention of crime in the two  places.    Director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the  Ministry  of Public Security Mr. Zhuo Feng stressed that underground  forces from outside the country's borders were in no way given  shelter in the Mainland. All members of illegal groups were  harshly punished in accordance with the law once they were found  guilty of committing crimes inside the Mainland.    A Hong Kong police officer said that he hoped police in the  two places would further boost their cooperation in fighting  against organized crime related to the Mainland and Hong Kong in  order to put a halt to the mushrooming of underground forces  with the aim of safeguarding prosperity and stability in the two  places.</p>

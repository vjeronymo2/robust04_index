			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Berlitz turns in loss of Dollars 189.5m BERLITZ, the language school subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC), last night unveiled a Dollars 189.5m loss for the fourth quarter of 1991 following Dollars 195.4m of write-offs and special charges created as a result of MCC's filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law. The partial cause of the write-offs was the default of MCC on certain payments due to Berlitz. Berlitz - which in February hired the Wall Street stockbroking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette to advise on the possible sale or recapitalisation of the company - discovered last year that the late Mr Robert Maxwell had improperly pledged most of MCC's 56.5 per cent Berlitz equity stake as collateral for bank loans. MCC, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year, is itself being managed in a complex arrangement that requires co-ordination between New York and UK court-appointed administrators of the Maxwell empire. At present, most of MCC's 56.5 per cent Berlitz stake is in the hands of five US and European banks and companies. Injunctions have been brought by Macmillan, the MCC publisher, to prevent the Berlitz stock from being sold. Yesterday, Berlitz said its fourth quarter 1991 revenues had declined to Dollars 66.5m from Dollars 73.4m in the last three months of 1990. The company disclosed a Dollars 9.97 per share loss in the quarter, compared with a profit of 12 cents a share in the final quarter of 1990. For the whole of 1991, Berlitz suffered a loss of Dollars 181.2m or Dollars 9.53 a share, compared with a net profit of Dollars 10.6m, or 56 cents, in 1990. Berlitz said it expected the write-offs and reserves - made against certain notes receivable from MCC and affiliates - would generate tax benefits in future. The default by MCC meant Berlitz is no longer required to pay dividends on preferred stock held by an MCC affiliate, the company said.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHOAL CREEK FOUNDER CASTS DOUBTS ON FUTURE TOURNEYS  </P> <P> Shoal Creek founder Hall Thompson said the country club might never host  another major golf tournament because of the controversy that developed over  its membership during the PGA Championship last month.  </P> <P> On Monday, the Birmingham businessman made his first public comments since the  controversy when he presented a check for $25,000 to the Shelby County  Commission to help defray the $52,000 in overtime that sheriff's deputies were  paid during the tournament Aug. 9-12.  </P> <P> Thompson was quoted in a newspaper story on June 21 as saying the all-white  club would not be pressured into accepting a black member. After blacks  threatened protests during the tournament and sponsors began pulling their  television advertising, the club accepted a black as an honorary member.  </P> <P> Shoal Creek also hosted the PGA Championship in 1984, but Thompson told the  county commission, "We may or may not have another championship because of  this."  </P> <P> Thompson said he had been "sorely abused" during the controversy.  </P> <P> Also, he said, "Our membership doesn't deserve to be treated as it has been."  </P></p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Finance warning for Underground LONDON UNDERGROUND yesterday warned that improvements in service on London's Underground network could be jeopardised if the government goes ahead with reductions in investment announced in the Autumn Statement. The company, announcing the results of the first year of the Underground's Customer Charter, said that it had achieved all its service performance targets for 1992-93. These covered train service, punctuality, cleanliness, staff helpfulness, ticketing, escalator service and station closures. Targets for most performance indicators will be increased next year with much higher standards of train cleanliness, information for passengers and reliability of train services and lifts. But Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director, said efficient management alone could not sustain service improvements if investment fell. He said: 'The key to a decently modern metro is good management and the right level of investment.' Mr Steven Norris, minister for transport in London, said he shared London Underground's disappointment at funding. He promised to battle with the Treasury to secure the best possible deal in the next public expenditure round in the autumn. The options for reforming the laws regulating taxis and minicabs in England and Wales will be reviewed in a green paper to be published in the summer. Mr Norris said yesterday that the government would bring forward legislation after a period of consultation. The announcement follows the failure of a working party on the safety of taxis and minicabs in London to reach agreement on the licensing of minicabs.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Currencies It is remarkable how little impact the turmoil in the bond markets has had on the dollar. Perhaps the consensus, which believed it would rise this year as the Federal Reserve tightened, was wrong about currencies too. Certainly the 7.5 per cent US growth rate achieved in the fourth 1993 quarter, the January purchasing managers survey and the latest robust employment figures should push the dollar up. In the event it is trading slightly lower against the D-Mark than when the Federal Reserve tightened a month ago. Some of this may have to do with the trade pressures that the US is exerting on Japan. The dollar's weakness against the yen has spilled over into the D-Mark as well, though that could change now that the US has shifted the focus from the currency market to direct sanctions under section 301 of its trade act. Leveraged investors may also be selling D-Mark positions they have held profitably for some time to cover their losses in other markets. Yet it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the forces in favour of the dollar are weaker than the market thought. Germany's steep money supply growth will almost certainly delay Bundesbank interest rate cuts, and though the Fed will almost certainly tighten further it is far from clear how far the process will go. The interest rate differential may still not do much to help the dollar. Meanwhile the US current account deficit is a drag. And if the market is reluctant to buy dollars now, that may be because it is long enough already.</p>

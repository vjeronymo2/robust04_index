			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> CATARACTS LINKED TO SMOKING  </P> <P> Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute have found that men who  quit smoking 10 or more years ago have half the risk of smokers of developing  the most common type of cataracts, a condition in which the lens of the eye  becomes cloudy and later opaque when proteins inside the cells of the eye's  lens undergo structural change. By age 70, most people have some evidence of  nuclear cataracts, which form in the center of the lens.  </P> <P> "The mechanism by which smoking might damage the lens nucleus is unclear," said  Dr. Sheila K. West, the study's principal investigator. "Among the  possibilities is the damage from toxic byproducts in cigarette smoke. The  reduced cataract risk among the men who stopped smoking suggests that damage to  the lens may be reversible."  </P> <P> In the past, cataracts have been related solely to aging, and most  ophthalmologists believed that nothing could be done to alter the cataract's  course.

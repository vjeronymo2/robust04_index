			<p>BFN     [Text] The Christian Democratic Party [PDC] on 4 April  proposed the establishment of a Democratic Front encompassing  the widest social and political spectrum to oppose the Alberto  Fujimori administration's plans to remain in power.    Addressing a PDC rally at the Ovalo on Saenz Pena del Callao  Avenue, PDC President Julio Luque Tijero called on all  democratic political parties, labor centrals, federations and  unions, peasants, professionals, and students to join this front.    The current PDC leadership held the rally "as a sign of  mourning for democracy on the second anniversary of the rupture  of the national institutional order," on the occasion of the  self-inflicted coup perpetrated by President Fujimori with the  support of the Armed Forces high command.    In his speech, Luque Tijero said the PDC "looks favorably  upon the presidential candidacy of Javier Perez de Cuellar," who  is heading voters' opinion polls by considerable margins.    Speaking later to LA REPUBLICA, PDC President Luque Tijero  said: "The main objective of all Peruvians with democratic  heritage is the defeat of the concealed dictatorship headed by  President Fujimori." He added that the Democratic Front should  elect its presidential candidacy through a consensus.    He said: "I believe that in this case all of us must look  beyond any selfish party ambitions or ideologies and that Perez  de Cuellar is the person who will enjoy everyone's support."    In his address at the rally, Luque Tijero warned citizens  and  international public opinion about the danger that "at any time"  the government may decide to either postpone or not hold the  1995 elections.    He said: "President Fujimori has an extensive record so as  to  be able to trust him. First, he won over the people's confidence  by promising that he would not implement an economic `shock'  program but he turned around and enforced a brutal `supershock'  program."    He added: "Later, he swore before God and the fatherland to  uphold and enforce the Constitution but he abruptly violated it  exactly two years ago. Now that polls show that his popularity  is sharply declining, who can guarantee what Fujimori will do  tomorrow?"    In this regard, he said the country must stay alert and  united in case of eventual election fraud or any attempt to  perpetrate another coup.    Luque Tijero said: "Not only all Peruvians but also  international public opinion must be alert."    To this effect he called upon all democratic governments of  the world, particularly those who comprise the so-called  "Support Group," and international organizations such as the  United Nations, the OAS, the ILO [International Labor  Organization], etc., to demand from the Fujimori administration  the full and effective upholding of the sovereign will of the  Peruvian people expressed in free elections.    For our part, stated Luque Tijero, we have addressed letters  to international organizations that represent the PDC such as  the Christian Democratic International and the Christian  Democratic Organization of the Americas.    Present at the 4 April rally were delegations from the  Peruvian Port and Maritime Workers Federation, the PescaPeru  [State Fishmeal and Fish Oil Production Agency] Workers  Federation, and other Callao port labor unions.    Sergio Valdivia, secretary general of the Port and Maritime  Workers Federation, who harshly criticized President Fujimori's  administration's antilabor policy, delivered a speech before  Luque Tijero.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A musical money-go-round - Joeske van Walsum, who is instrumental in the success of those he manages THE CIRCUS of promoters, managers, agents and commentators which envelops the boxing ring after a big title fight usually generates a wry smile on the face of Joeske van Walsum. 'It sometimes makes me cry, too,' says the tall Dutchman. 'Of course I see a few similarities with what I do.' On the face of it, van Walsum's business world is far more cerebral and gentle. From a converted house in the south-west London suburb of Putney, his company is both agent and manager to 30 instrumental soloists and concert conductors as well as an organiser of orchestral tours. 'Agents are meant to be leeches on society, but we are not leeches if we are doing a good job for everyone,' he stresses. 'You can still get into this kind of agency work, but it is risky and not many people make much money.' If that is the case, 43-year-old van Walsum is not doing too badly. In the year to April 1991, van Walsum Management took in Pounds 800,000 in commissions and other payments, on which it made a profit of Pounds 175,000. Out of this, the staff of 17 earned more than Pounds 70,000 in profit-sharing payments. The more renowned artists the company manages include pianist Mitsuko Uchida; viola player Yuri Bashmet; and the young Finn, Esa-Pekko Salonen, conductor and musical director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Van Walsum's parents went to live in Scotland when he was a teenager and he studied flute at the Royal College of Music in London. Late in the 1960s, he began freelancing, organising small music groups and making a small profit. As time went on, he became known as an artists' manager, although he had to work as a chauffeur in the evenings to earn enough money on which to live. In 1975, when the company was set up, yearly revenue was just Pounds 1,000 and van Walsum was running the operation from a rented London flat. But he says: 'I'm very analytical and bureaucratic and have always been well organised.' He also enjoyed his fair share of luck. This world is small, but not that small. According to artists' directories, there are 650 professional orchestras world-wide, 850 conductors and 3,000- 4000 soloists. 'Targets' - industry jargon for the concert promoters and other people with whom van Walsum books his artists for anything from one night to perhaps two weeks - number around 750. While income for solo instrumentalists and conductors is not in the Pavarotti class, it can be very high. A few earn more than Pounds 500,000 a year - although these individuals are not on van Walsum's books - while many earn above Pounds 100,000. 'A young soloist might get Pounds 200 for one night,' he says. 'The highest for one night I have seen was Pounds 25,000 in Japan. They travel alone and have to pay their own expenses like flights and hotels. Some will do 120 concerts a year.' His company, the fourth largest of its type in Britain, charges artists a commission of 15 to 20 per cent but also uses local agents to help with organisation, cutting margins to about 12 per cent. 'We have to be available for these artists every single day of the year if necessary. We arrange every booking, every rehearsal time, every fee, every contract, collect all the money and make the travel and hotel arrangements.' The company and its staff of around eight - nearly all women university graduates - often are approached by promoters and permanent orchestra managers seeking soloists and conductors, sometimes at only a day's notice if someone has dropped out unexpectedly. Part of their job, though, is to approach promoters and 'offer' artists - in order to give them the right exposure. Clashes of personality and ego are not unknown. 'Performers must have a lot of inner strength because it is a lonely life for them,' van Walsum explains. 'There is an element of arrogance, and they have to be good communicators to reach their audience with their music. They can be very awkward. We have to be supportive.' He says he can also be awkward, outspoken and direct when dealing with them. Any arguments that erupt are usually over money, though. 'We have a scale of charges for each artist. The worst are the Russians. They can be so stupid. A successful westerner makes sure the guy he's dealing with is happy. Russians just want to screw the other person.' Diplomatically, van Walsum says he has no such problem with the Russians on his books. The company has contracts with its artists but either side can back out at a moment's notice - and sometimes does. Van Walsum says poaching exists, particularly by US agencies. 'They really stick knives into each other.' But the 60 members of the British Association of Concert Agents tend not to do this. The company's income last financial year was split equally between artists' management and orchestra touring, although the latter has slid during the past two years of recession and its margins are under severe pressure. Van Walsum says pre-tax net profits will be lucky to reach Pounds 50,000 after profit-sharing. Office costs amount to a hefty Pounds 600,000, three-quarters of total income. Salaries account for Pounds 300,000 and travel Pounds 45,000. Much of that involves van Walsum and his managers visiting promoters and artists around the world. One week last month, he had to go to six evening concerts. Finding new 'stars' is one of the thrills of the job, although van Walsum admits to some 'terrible blunders' - usually, pushing someone too quickly. 'Sitting in the audience, you can sense whether it is going well. It produces a shiver down your spine and a tear, almost of relief. You can also sit there so worried that you are virtually wetting yourself.' Van Walsum Management, 26 Wadham Road, London SW15 2LR. Tel: 081-874-6344.</p>

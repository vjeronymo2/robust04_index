			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand to spin off operation as profits dive Uni Storebrand, Norway's largest insurance group, is to spin-off its international reinsurance business into a new stock market-listed company, having failed to sell the loss-making activity. The announcement yesterday came as Uni Storebrand revealed that in the first nine months group profit, after transfers to life assurance customers, plunged to NKr223m (Dollars 33.8m) from NKr1.11bn at the same stage last year. Operating profit of NKr1.45bn was NKr2.38bn lower but there was a NKr972m increase in net premium income to NKr10.92bn. Finance income dropped NKr3.04bn to NKr3.8bn due to bonds which were hit hard by rising interest rates. Realised losses on securities were NKr710m against gains of NKr2.42bn as unrealised gains sunk to NKr5m from NKr4bn. Nevertheless, Uni said it had increased market share, improved the result in the non-life business and achieved a sharp increase in life assurance premiums. In March, Uni said it would seek to sell Christiania Re in the US but, in the meantime, the unit would be transferred to the non-life unit. Uni had planned to dispose of the UK business and close the Singapore office. But the strategy failed and Uni yesterday announced plans to spin them off. The Oslo, London and Singapore re-insurance units increased nine-month losses, before allocations, to NKr106m from NKr30m while Christiania Re expanded losses to NKr165m from NKr16m. During the past three years, Uni injected about NKr1bn in capital into the reserves of these units to keep them running. But Uni said its shareholders would benefit more if reinsurance was divested from the group so that it could concentrate on core businesses of life assurance, non-life and asset management. Existing shareholders will be offered pre-emptive rights to subscribe to shares of the new company but Uni could take a 10 per cent stake. Uni will recapitalise reinsurance with 'a couple of hundred million kroner' and seek a guarantee from its largest shareholders for the disposal of 90 per cent of the new company's shares. A prospectus is to be issued this month. It hopes to complete the operation before the summer.</p>

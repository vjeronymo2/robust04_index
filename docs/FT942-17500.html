			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Japan reactor near critical level A nuclear chain reaction will reach a critical, self-sustaining level next Tuesday in Japan's controversial 'fast-breeder' nuclear reactor, officials said yesterday. The fast-breeder reactor uses plutonium as a base substance to generate electric power. Other industrialised nations have dropped plans for fast-breeders because of the hazards associated with plutonium, leaving Japan as the only country actively pursuing the technology as an energy source. The plant, is located in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, 335 km west of Tokyo.</p>

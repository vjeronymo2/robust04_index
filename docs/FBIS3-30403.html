			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Zvornik, Bratunac, 3 Feb (TANJUG) -- According  to the latest reports, the level of Serb suffering in  Muslim-held areas is growing and Croats are also being  persecuted with increasing frequency, TANJUG has learned from  sources close to the Srpska republic army.    According to the same source, many previous reports are now  being confirmed by the Croat side in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The latest example is the HVO [Croatian  Defense Council] report on Muslim terror against Serbs and  Croats in Tarcin. According to the reports many Serbs and Croats  have been imprisoned in Tarcin for a long time and all other  Serbs and Croats from the area have been forced to join work  details of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army. They have  been transferred to Zabrdje near Kiseljak where they have been  forced to dig fortifications for the so-called  Bosnia-Herzegovina army. According to Croatian sources Muslim  forces in the area plan to use the imprisoned Serbs and Croats  as a human shield in attempts to recapture certain positions  seized by the HVO.    According to the latest refugee accounts the position of  around 100 Serb families remaining in Zavidovici is extremely  difficult, Srpska republic army sources said. [passage omitted]    Serbs remaining in Zavidovici area are threatened with death  on a massive scale if international, particularly humanitarian,  organizations do not intervene urgently on their behalf, sources  close to the Srpska republic army warned.</p>

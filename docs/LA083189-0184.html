			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AUSTRALIAN PILOTS STRIKE RUINING TOURISM  </P> <P> Australia's tourist industry, starved of domestic airline services for the past  week, is facing ruin because of widespread cancellations by nervous overseas  visitors, operators said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Resorts and hotels reported a slump in occupancy rates since the weekend, when  travelers realized that the dispute, which has grounded all domestic airlines  since last Thursday, was set to continue for some time.  </P> <P> "Everybody's bleeding here at the moment," said Gaynor Cooper, marketing  manager of the Yulara Resort in the shadow of Ayers Rock in the central  Australian desert.  </P> <P> "We would expect to be 100% full at this time of year, but our occupancy rate  is very low. People are canceling because they are afraid they won't be able to  get back home," she said.  </P> <P> Tourism is Australia's most important foreign exchange earner and reaped $4.9  billion from about 2.2 million visitors in the last financial year.  </P> <P> "We've had quite massive cancellations from abroad. There's been a huge loss of  confidence," said Owen French, manager of a string of island resorts off  Queensland. "Overseas travel agents are just taking Australia out of the  schedules."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Help Wanted Ads  </P> <P> About 1,600 pilots resigned en masse last week after the three largest domestic  airlines refused to consider their demand for a 30% pay raise, bringing chaos  to the transport system of the continent.  </P> <P> The airlines said they had received more than 800 responses from pilots to job  advertisements they placed in newspapers around the world. But they warned it  would take about four weeks for the applications to be processed and new pilots  to be trained.  </P> <P> Although a few charter flights still serve tourist hot spots such as Ayers  Rock, most foreign travelers come to Australia on multi-stop tickets, which are  no longer feasible.  </P> <P> "It's suddenly got worse since yesterday, and we're now around 20% to 30% down  on normal," said Yvonne Singleton, public relations manager at Sydney's Menzies  Hotel.  </P> <P> "We're getting a lot of cancellations of groups, mainly Japanese, for  September." she added.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Francoise Crouigneau in </F> China: "Dissident Issue Tarnishes French-Chinese Reunion"]    [Text] The French prime minister's four-day visit to China  was slightly marred by the arrest of some dissidents, and hence  will not turn out to be as successful as expected. Nonetheless,  it does mark the return to normalized French-Chinese relations,  and leaves room for hope that some major contracts might be  wrapped up this summer.    By making an official visit to Beijing and Shanghai, the  prime minister knew he was indulging in a perilous undertaking.  The aim was to give official confirmation of French-Chinese  reconciliation and to create a political environment that might  benefit French companies, without ceding any ground regarding  the respecting of human rights. Beijing's determination to  press home its "different" point of view, compared with values  which it deems overly Western and, in fact, dangerous for a  state that is deeply divided, put an end to this hope.    The return to calm which Edouard Balladur was praying for  turned into an actual escalation of the situation when two  dissidents were arrested in Beijing and three more were detained  in Shanghai. Called upon to explain themselves, the Chinese  authorities minced their words and duly denied that the arrests  had taken place. And on Sunday morning, after Edouard Balladur  had left, one of the "non- arrested" dissidents was released,  only to be placed under close surveillance in Shanghai.  Diplomats unconvincingly pointed out that the Chinese often  resort to this system of arrests to coincide with official  visits by foreign leaders. However, the damage had been done.  The French prime minister who had repeatedly emphasized that  success in this area would depend on discretion and a lack of  publicity could only watch as he fell into the trap that he had  thought he could avoid. The same trap into which U.S. Foreign  Secretary Warren Christopher had stumbled more cruelly in  mid-March. By openly linking human rights with most-favored  nation status, he ran up against a wall of rejection deemed to  have dealt the United States a stinging blow. In fact, it has  pushed Washington to the point today of looking into the details  of a most-favored nation clause that would apply solely to U.S.  private companies or investments in China.  <H5>  Upcoming Economic Tests </H5>   Today, France is avoiding any such contortions. However,  even if the results of economic reconciliation are confirmed  over the coming months, any such rapprochement will now be  politically tainted. And the international authority that  Edouard Balladur might have hoped to gain from his trip to China  will have been considerably lessened. It remains to be seen  whether the Chinese leaders are ready to prove concretely that  any link between human rights and business is, as they like  putting it, as outdated as the Cold War. If this is the case,  then the minor advances made during Edouard Balladur's visit in  cultural and economic terms will not have been made in vain.    In a country where the French language occupies a marginal  position, the opening of a pedagogical cultural center in  Beijing is not of negligible importance. The promise to create  a post dedicated to economic expansion in Canton, where the  consulate was closed as a punishment for French sales of Mirage  2000-5 aircraft to Taiwan, should enable France to start off on  the best footing again. At the same time, France has  non-negligible chances of being "awarded" the contract for a  second nuclear power station in Daya Bay, for reasons of  "loyalty." Which is music to the ears of Framatome, the French  manufacturer of nuclear reactors, which completed Daya Bay I  last year, together with Spie Batignolles.    And without harboring overly high hopes of a 2,500-km TGV  [high- speed train] link between Beijing and Shanghai actually  going ahead, the Chinese leaders have placed too great an  emphasis on the common interests of both countries in this  respect to abandon all hope regarding the results of the  electricity minister's next visit to Paris, or the mission that  Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet will lead in  the early summer. Only then will we be able to assess how  successful the trip by the French prime minister really was.  And know how far Paris is prepared to go to support new  contracts thanks to the financial protocol which has to be  completed by that time. Leaving aside the Daya Bay II project,  valued at something like 15 billion francs, or the Elf refinery  due to be built near Shanghai.    On the other hand, if Beijing continues to make an indirect  link between human rights and economic dossiers in an attempt to  raise the stakes, then we might well wonder about the  significance of the invitation to visit France which Edouard  Balladur confirmed to President Jiang Zemin, on behalf of  Francois Mitterrand. One thing is certain. France cannot  implement any Asian policy that does not take China into  account. Obviously, if Beijing wants to avoid confining itself  to two dialogue partners (the United States and Japan), but also  seeks to play Europe, then it simply must have the French card  at its disposal. However, what was supposed to mark a new phase  in French-Chinese relations could take on all the allure of a  long, hard march...unless a shift in French foreign policy is  confirmed, and the defense of human rights is openly uncoupled  from diplomatic and strategic imperatives.</p>

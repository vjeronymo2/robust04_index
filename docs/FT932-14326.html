			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Swiss outlook Switzerland's decision not to join the European Economic Area will probably be less damaging to its economy than originally feared, the Basle Business Cycle Research Group said yesterday, Reuter reports. It reported that the economy was likely to contract by around 0.4 per cent this year, before recovering in 1994 with 1 per cent growth. But it thought the growth gap with the rest of western Europe would be only 0.6 percentage point, compared with the 1 per centage point it estimated last October.</p>

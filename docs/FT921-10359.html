			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): BT may impose redundancies in building services BT is considering compulsory redundancies in the running down of its building services division, according to a management discussion document. BT has so far avoided compulsory redundancies in its programme, which started in April 1990, aimed at cutting the 220,000-strong workforce by more than 30,000. The internal memo now says that, to contract out more building work, an 'enabling tool' will be required from the personnel department to allow compulsory redundancies for grades covered by the National Communications Union, the main BT union. BT has never formally ruled out compulsory redundancies. But it has a comprehensive voluntary redundancy agreement with the NCU which provides for generous severance terms. Nevertheless, the company has been having difficulty in reaching its redundancy targets voluntarily. It has also refused to refrain from compulsorily retiring 4,000 male workers aged 60 or over, although the NCU says it has improved severance terms. The NCU believes that the 30,000 redundancy target has now been raised to 50,000. The union says the company may seek a further 18,000 redundancies this year. Mr Billy McClory, an NCU official, said yesterday that the pressure for compulsory redundancies was growing and said that areas of BT that were seeking labour, such as personal communications, were not taking it from those which were trying to shed it, such as business communications. Plans to shed 1,500 cleaning jobs were also disclosed yesterday. The move is part of the effort to dispose of 'non-core' activities by selling businesses or contracting out services. Six years ago BT had 4,000 cleaning staff - numbers have been reduced by contracting out and the process is due to be completed within the next two years. BT said that, in a similar exercise in 1990 involving 3,000 catering staff, 80 per cent of the employees involved took up jobs with the catering company that won the contract. BT says it is likely the cleaning jobs will follow a similar pattern. A voluntary redundancy package is on offer for those who do not go to work for private contractors, but enforced job losses have not been ruled out. The Union of Communication Workers, which represents most of the cleaners, has failed to win contracts for cleaning co-operatives. It now fears that some cleaners may end up taking a wage cut if they work for private contractors. BT pay is Pounds 3.63 an hour but the UCW says it has found some contractors paying as little as Pounds 2.50 an hour.</p>

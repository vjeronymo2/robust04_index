Foreign Minister Trivimi Velliste is to be replaced by the  current defense minister, Juri Luik. Trivimi Velliste himself  will be sent to the United Nations as Estonia's permanent  representative. The post of defense minister is to be ceded to  parliament member Indrek Kannik. Finance Minister Madis Uurike  is to be replaced by Kheyki Kranikh, a member of the liberal  faction in the State Assembly, while Economics Minister Toomas  Sildmae will give way to Toyvo Yurgenson, a deputy of the State  Assembly. T. Sildmae's dismissal, however, has been opposed by  representatives of Estonian entrepreneurial circles. Coming  together for a hasty meeting on 3 January, they sent a joint  letter of protest to the republic's president and prime  minister. All the supposed candidates for ministerial posts are  members of the ruling coalition in the State Assembly. A final  decision is expected to be made before the first parliament  session this year, scheduled for 10 January.</p>

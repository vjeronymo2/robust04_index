			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / St Petersburg cab threat President Boris Yeltsin may find it difficult to enter St Petersburg's city hall this week if cab drivers carry out a threat to surround the building with thousands of taxis to protest against rising fares, Reuter reports from Moscow. Local journalists said about 1,000 taxi drivers had already arrived in the city in their cars to demand that authorities bring down fares by tomorrow when Mr Yeltsin is due to meet Mayor Anatoly Sobchak at the city hall. The drivers said 7,000 taxis would surround the building at the heart of St Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, if their demands were not met by then. Taxi fares went up 10 times at the start of the year as part of plans to introduce a free market economy.</p>

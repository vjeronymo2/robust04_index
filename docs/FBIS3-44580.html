The move, to be taken from January 11 to 17, is designed to  protest against a November 25 government decree which increased  the printing costs by five times.    The boycott was announced today at a press conference by  editors- in-chief of these newspapers, including IZVESTIA,  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER) [INDEPENDENT  GAZETTE], TRUD and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, as well as weekly  magazine MOSCOW NEWS.    Outraged by the government decision, press leaders had  written to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on December 29,  complaining that neither the newspapers nor their subscribers  could afford the price hike.    Some editors-in-chief pointed out at the press conference  that the government decision is essentially designed to  suffocate the press.    Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Russian Press  Association,  said that they are forced to take the step. He added, however,  that a final decision will be made according to the response  from the government.</p>

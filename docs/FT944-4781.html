			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Nolan to probe NHS and House of Lords The Nolan committee on standards in public life will include National Health Service trusts and the House of Lords among three 'key areas' in its first report, to be published next spring. They will be examined alongside the more widely expected subjects of the lobbying and financial interests of MPs, and the rules governing the conduct of ministers and civil servants. The committee, established by Mr John Major after October's 'cash for questions' row in the House of Commons, will take written and oral evidence in the new year. Lord Nolan, a law lord, said he expected the oral hearings to be in public, and the committee intended to study overseas practice - particularly recent moves to regulate abuse of public office in France, the US, Ireland and Australia, especially Queensland. He said the three main areas to be covered by the first report would be: Parliament, including 'cash for questions' in the Commons and the role of lobbyists. In October controversy about this caused the resignation of Mr Neil Hamilton and Mr Tim Smith from the government. Ministers and civil servants - notably the acceptance of gifts, possible conflicts of interest, and employment on leaving office, issues raised by cases of former ministers and civil servants taking jobs with companies for which they were responsible in government. The 'big spending quangos', including NHS trusts, where the committee will examine methods of appointment, possible conflicts of interest and standards of conduct. The inclusion of NHS trusts in the first report reflects sustained controversy in the past year about the appointment of leading Conservatives to the boards of NHS trusts, and their level of remuneration. The inclusion of the House of Lords was less widely expected. One member of the committee, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, a former Labour minister, said the committee would examine the case for obliging peers to enter their outside financial concerns in a register of interests akin to that used in the Commons. By convention peers declare relevant financial interests at the beginning of speeches in the Lords, but the upper house has no formal register. A move to introduce one would be highly controversial, particularly among Tory peers, many of whom are company directors. The committee yesterday published a note raising the questions it intended to address. It noted on the issue of MPs' pay and outside interests that the level of parliamentary salaries 'is in itself not a matter for us', but added: 'Our task is to consider whether the present relationship between MPs' parliamentary responsibilities and their outside interests gives rise to difficulties, and if so whether changes are needed.' Lord Nolan said the committee would not tackle areas such as local government, universities and the honours system until the initial report was completed.</p>

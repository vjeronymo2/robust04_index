Kirillova*,  Novosibirsk Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Siberian Branch,  Russian Academy of Sciences; *Institute of Biophysics, Ministry  of Health, Moscow, Russia; UDC 577.113.4/6]    [Abstract] Homogenous phosphotriesterase synthesis was  employed for the preparation of oligonucleotides derivatized on  the 5'- or 3'-ends with DDP or Fe(III)DDP in 15-30 min in yields  approaching 95%. Both agents were effective in modifying  DNA,  particularly Fe(III)DDP in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.  The reaction mechanisms involved covalent adduct formation  adjacent to a guanosine duplex, direct scission of the DNA, as  well as molecular lesions that led to DNA cleavage after  addition of piperidine. In analogy to porphyrins, the  derivatized oligonucleotids also bound to HeLa, bone marrow and  Krebs-2 ascitic carcinoma cells. These observations support the  contention that oligonucleotides derivatized with DDP and  Fe(III)DDP may have applications in modifying gene expression.

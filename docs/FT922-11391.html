			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Sport: The rotten truth behind the five-ring circus or 20, or 200. But let us stick to two, lest madness overtakes us. The first way is to accept the propaganda peddled by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Lausanne and imagine, just for a moment, that the Olympics really are about youth, sport, peace, brotherhood and moral uplift. The IOC - 90-odd members drawn randomly from 75 countries - are the people who actually own the Olympics. Their president and pontiff, Spain's Juan Antonio Samaranch, is the undisputed king of world sport. In Samaranch's view, the Olympics are the world's 'most important contemporary social movement', and his beloved IOC 'the world's leading authority on competitive sport.' The second way to view the Olympics is the one that has gained ground since the tawdry and cut-price Games of 1984, in Los Angeles, which, to most folks' surprise, were run at a profit. According to this viewpoint, the Olympics are hopelessly bloated and cynical. They have been besmirched by drugs, corrupted by commercialism, over-run by greed and hi-jacked by a secretive and powerful cabal, led by Samaranch, which is known as The Club. Between them, members of The Club run world sport. The Club comprises Samaranch and his IOC members, plus the presidents of the international federations that control the 25 Olympic sports, pre-eminently Primo Nebiolo of athletics, the key Olympic sport, and Dr Joao Havelange of soccer, the world's most popular sport. In the view of many, the Olympic Games are now a great and raging beast virtually out of control. In the view of some, the Games' most insidious role is to serve as marketing vehicle for some of the pagan gods of international commerce - Coca-Cola, Kodak, Brother, National Panasonic, Ricoh, Philips, Time, Mars, Bausch &amp; Lomb, Visa, what have you. In the view of a few, the stench of commercialism that overhangs the Games is so strong that Samaranch and his IOC must be lanced, like a boil on the face of sport, if the Olympic movement is to survive and renew itself. So which view of the Olympics - sport, youth and joy, or power, money and drugs - is closest to the truth? The parlousness and precariousness of the Olympics under Samaranch are about to receive cruel exposure in a book, The Lords Of The Rings, by Vyv Simson and Andrew Jennings of Granada TV's World In Action team, which Simon &amp; Schuster is publishing, in 11 languages, on Monday. To show the mess in which Samaranch finds himself, one cannot do better than quote Simon &amp; Schuster itself. 'Traditionally', it says, 'Olympic year sees a torrent of glossy books, articles and TV films about the beauty and purity of the Olympic ideal. In passing, they refer to the Lausanne-based International Olympic Committee and its benign president, Juan Antonio Samaranch. The Lords Of The Rings explodes the carefully cultivated myths of the IOC. The authors reveal: ' The secret past of Juan Antonio Samaranch, today's guardian of the Olympic ideal. For nearly 40 years Samaranch was an active fascist, becoming sports minister under the Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco. Samaranch signed official correspondence with the greeting 'I salute you with my arm raised.' ' How under Samaranch the Olympic movement appears to have taken on many characteristics of the dictator Franco's fascist Movimiento. Samaranch is now the unchallenged dictator of the Olympic world. ' How Samaranch won his place at the head of the Olympic movement with the help of the boss of the world's biggest sportswear manufacturer (Horst Dassler of Adidas, who died five years ago). Three years later his friend was granted the Dollars 200m Olympic marketing contract. ' How The Club lives a fabulous lifestyle of five-star hotels, first-class air tickets, endless presents and hospitality at the expense of sport and cities who want to stage the Games. ' How some IOC members demand even more - and the rackets and graft that is covered up. ' How the organisers of bids to win the Olympics, desperate to see their cities succeed, stay silent about the attempts to shake them down for money in case they alienate IOC members. Who gets the Games is decided by just the 94 members of the IOC. They are answerable to nobody . . . Bidding cities spend around Dollars 40m to woo them. ' How, under Samaranch, the IOC has turned from a non-commercial organisation led by worthy part-timers who defended the ethics of amateur sport into a professional, full-time business enterprise. ' How Dollars 20m of sponsors' money has ended up in an off-shore bank account controlled by just one man. ' How a leading member of Kuwait's royal family bribed sports officials to keep Israel out of world sport while the Olympic leadership turned a blind eye. ' How the Olympic leadership has spoken out against doping - but done little  -and how it has covered up the failure of its anti-drug measures. Drug scandals have been suppressed in order not to frighten off the sponsors.' So much for Simon &amp; Schuster. What about the book? The most useful task the authors have performed is to have gathered all the Olympic dirt they could find and stack it in one great pile, where it is accessible. They are good on Samaranch, fast-winding us forward to the opening ceremony of the Barcelona Games this summer as the IOC president steps forward to invite King Juan Carlos to declare open the Games of the 25th Olympiad. 'Watch the president's right arm', they say, 'is it stirring, is it twitching, is it taking on a life of its own, compelled by some visceral force to rise to an angle of 45 degrees from his shoulder? . . . (Samaranch) rose to become a fascist parliamentarian, a fascist member of the Barcelona city council, fascist president of the Catalan regional council and, for a while, fascist sports minister. In his own words, Samaranch was '100 per cent Francoist'.' Simson and Jennings are good on the machinations of The Club and the IOC. They are good on Dassler of Adidas, and how he developed The Club. In the view of Patrick Nally, Dassler's former business partner and right-hand man: 'Horst became the puppet-master of the sporting world, pulling the strings to create massive changes, the pinnacle of which is his legacy of control of the modern Olympic Games. Horst got a tremendous buzz from controlling and manipulating.' They are good on the Eastern bloc and its rump of discredited IOC members who still have power and influence. They are good on the backstage dramas at the Seoul Olympics in 1988, and how the Seoul Games were 'conceived from a desire by a military junta to obscure their brutal image and to find new markets for their dynamic economy.' They are good on drugs. Good on cheating. Good on scandal. And good on the racketeering that underpins the selection of cities to stage the Games - the gifts and free-loading, and the escalating sums spent by candidate cities to climb aboard the wagon. The authors of The Lords Of The Rings are even good in many of their conclusions, and especially good when indicting Samaranch and Nebiolo. 'There seems to be little philosophical difference in their approach to stage-managing our world of sport', the authors state. 'They have hoisted themselves above their fellow officials to levels of absolute power previously unknown in the democratic world of sport. All that divides them is who should wield absolute control. 'They come together in this Olympic year in Barcelona at what may be the turning point for the Olympic movement and for world sport. Many people outside the complacent membership of The Club feel that too much has been conceded to the demands of the media and the multi-nationals. The spectators and the participants have never been consulted about 'communication tools' and 'exclusive categories' of product merchandising. The TV viewers around the world increasingly believe that many of the stars are junkies, puffed up into chemical champions. In the scramble for more money, more perks, more self-indulgence, more TV viewing hours and more dubious world records the fundamental rights and concerns of the worldwide, silent majority outside The Club are ignored.' But there are various defects in the arguments advanced by those who claim to be sickened by the Olympics in their modern, corporatist guise  - one of which is the inability to juggle with opposites and contradictions. For a start, almost no critic of the Olympics seems capable of wrestling with the inevitability of money, drugs and commercialism. Sport was always bound to grow into a billion-dollar business. Yet most of the time, secure in their naivety (or the pose of naivety - a standard sportswriters' trick), critics of the Olympics speak as though television could be uninvented, sponsorship could be uninvented, Coca-Cola could be uninvented, cheating could be uninvented, steroids could be uninvented, professionalism could be uninvented - as though all the world, and all of sport, could have been kept pristine and savoury and goodie-goodie, free of corruption, clear of the Fall. I have attended four summer Olympics, Mexico, Montreal, Los Angeles, Seoul. I will not be going again, not because the Olympics remotely offend me but because there are other things to write about, other fish to fry. Certainly the Olympics have grown big and cumbersome. Certainly they have become part of the global marketing-media-entertainment complex. Certainly they are a magnet for those who want to sell sticky beverages or copiers or contact lenses. Certainly some competitors pop pills and shoot up in a sad and desperate lunge for records, medals, millions. But the Olympics are still about sport, still about friendship, still about bridge-building. They still do good, even while doing bad. Forget about the silly ideals with which the Olympics are alleged to be concerned, the namby-pambyism of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who revived the Olympics a century ago - amateurism, valour, the importance of taking part, all that stuff and baggage. They are nothing of the sort. The Olympics are about winning. It is as simple, and as complex, as that. In the meantime, however, it looks increasingly the case that the IOC in Lausanne has slipped as far down the slope as it ought to think of venturing. The IOC needs fresh leadership, a determined change of direction. It is time to purge the pontiff. The Lords Of The Rings, Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 14.99.</p>

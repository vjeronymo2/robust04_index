			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Sun Chengbin (1327 2110 2430)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 7 May (XINHUA) -- Lu Ping, vice chairman  and secretary general of the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of  the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region [HKSAR], said today: The disputes over  political structure between China and Britain will definitely  not affect China's policy toward Hong Kong's public servants.  We hope Hong Kong's public servants will continue to work for  the HKSAR Government after 1997. The HKSAR Government will  certainly act according to the Basic Law, and the interests of  the public servants are protected by law.    This morning, mainland members of the PWC held a discussion  with the principal responsible persons of seven Hong Kong public  servants' organizations, hearing their opinions and suggestions  on matters related to public servants. The seven organizations  are (?the Association of Hong Kong Government Employees of  Chinese Descent, Hong Kong Retired Public Servants Welfare  Society, Hong Kong Public Servants Federation, Hong Kong  Government Employees Association, Hong Kong Federation of Public  Servant Unions, Hong Kong Retired Public Servants Association,  and Hong Kong Local Public Servants Association.)    After attentively listening to the views of the responsible  persons of these seven organizations, Lu Ping said: The current  disputes between China and Britain will definitely not affect  China's policy towards public servants. In other words, the  articles in the Basic Law concerning public servants will  definitely not be affected and will be carried out as they are  currently stipulated. Hong Kong public servants may rest  assured in this. He urged those responsible persons present at  the meeting to publicize his reassurance among the members of  their organizations.    Lu Ping stated: According to the Basic Law, the principal  officials of the HKSAR Government shall be Chinese citizens who  are permanent residents of the region, and who shall be  nominated by the chief executive and appointed by the central  government. Besides the principal officials, we hope all other  public servants will remain and continue to work at their  present posts after 1 July 1997. He reassured the public  servants that the break of the Sino- British talks will  definitely not affect their future, although the two countries  could no longer cooperate in Hong Kong's political structure.    Lu Ping said: Some people are worried whether the financial  strains of the HKSAR Government will affect the public servants'  retirement pensions after 1 July 1997. I would like to reassure  you we have already taken the matter into account. Besides,  according to the Basic Law, the HKSAR Government shall strive to  achieve fiscal balance and "keep expenditures within the limits  of revenues." However, the budgeted expenditures must include  the retirement pensions of public servants.    He emphasized: The retirement pensions of public servants  after 1997 are clearly stipulated in the Basic Law and are  protected by that law; they will not be affected by the  Sino-British disputes.    Lu Ping added: Of course we also support your proposal on  establishing a pension fund before 1997. The British Hong Kong  Government has proposed to establish a HK$7-billion pension  fund. The amount is of course far from sufficient. However,  even if the pension fund is not established, the HKSAR  Government will surely pay your retirement pensions, and those  pensions are guaranteed. Please rest assured in this regard.  This is Chinese Government policy and has been stipulated in  the Basic Law. We will certainly act according to the law.    Lu Ping said: Some people have suggested that a consultancy  group for public servant issues be established within the PWC's  Political Affairs Subcommittee. This is a good suggestion. It  is important to establish a formal channel of communications,  constantly exchange views, and avoid unnecessary  misunderstandings between the PWC and public servants. He said  the PWC would study the suggestion.    Lu Ping also stated: Besides the PWC, there are many other  channels of communication available. For instance, within the  Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA News Agency there is a special  department handling public servant issues. He hoped Hong Kong  public servants will not hesitate to bring their questions to  that department.    According to Lu Ping, the British Hong Kong Government is  not very enthusiastic about contacts between the public servants  and the PWC, and sometimes purposefully creates obstacles.  Citing an example, he said: The PWC has extended an invitation  to officials of the departments concerned within the British  Hong Kong Government to come and explain the draft regulations  for the new airport administration. It is a simple matter, but  the British Hong Kong Government issued an order prohibiting  them from contact with us. To facilitate coordination over  railroad construction and connection, responsible persons of the  Guangzhou-Jiulong Railroad Company were supposed to attend a  discussion with members of the PWC's Economic Affairs  Subcommittee this morning. The meeting is for a good purpose,  and both the time and place have been set, but they changed  their mind at the last minute. Lu Ping stated: These tricks  are completely unnecessary. We are very willing to establish a  constant channel of communication between us and the public  servants. For the sake of a smooth transition and to reassure  public servants, and for the sake of normal operations of the  HKSAR Government in the future, we still hope you will keep in  touch with us, despite the British Hong Kong Government's  deliberate obstruction.    Lu Ping added: After 1997, public servants will not be  required to express their political attitude. The suggestion  made earlier by the PWC's Political Affairs Subcommittee is  merely for the purpose of reminding any public servant who does  not want to stay and work for the HKSAR Government in 1997 to  give the government notice beforehand so that a replacement can  be found to facilitate normal operation of the HKSAR Government.    In the afternoon, the members of the PWC's Political Affairs  and Economic Affairs Subcommittees held a discussion with more  than 20 district advisers.</p>

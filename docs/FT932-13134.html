			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / The Long View: Gilt buyers beware NEWS item one: British government borrowing reached an astonishing record for a single month of Pounds 9.5bn in March. News item two: the Bank of England has begun actively promoting government securities to private investors - for instance, by distributing 360,000 copies of a small investors' guide to gilts, and by placing special application forms in the newspapers to encourage private buyers' subscriptions to its monthly auctions of new gilts. The latest of these comes next Wednesday, a Pounds 3bn offer of five-year bonds. We are not yet being asked to tell Sid, but it might come to that. Plainly, the Bank of England has done its sums and decided that it must market government debt more energetically to the personal sector. It has over Pounds 40bn of gilts to sell this financial year; and although the life assurance companies might invest Pounds 15bn, the pension funds, which have hardly any cash inflows at present, will not be significant buyers. That leaves foreigners (who are, in most cases, unpredictable speculators), and the banks, which will not buy on any serious scale until money market rates are cut to 5 per cent or less - an event which, effectively, depends on further rate reductions by the Bundesbank. This is because the government fears that any weakness in sterling will ruin its chances of holding inflation below its self-imposed 4 per cent ceiling, so it will cut short-term interest rates decisively only if the continentals have moved first. The Bank of England's easy option in the short term is, therefore, to go after private investors - at least, until the building societies start kicking up a bigger rumpus over unfair competition. Although, late in the 1980s, the personal sector was unloading gilts at the rate of around Pounds 2bn a year (at a time when the government was buying back its bonds for cancellation), last year it bought Pounds 3bn worth on top of Pounds 5bn invested in National Savings. According to the Bank, as many as 60,000 eager savers have requested the new gilts booklet personally. 'Gilts,' they will read therein, "is short for gilt-edged securities. The stock market has given this name to British Government securities because of their reputation as one of the safest of investments. The British Government, over hundreds of years, has never failed to meet the interest and capital payments as they fall due.' Dodgy grammar apart, smart savers also will be uncomfortably aware that the Bank is being a little economical with the actualite. None of the following episodes constituted legal default, but they left investors badly bruised. In the 1888 conversion of the national debt, for example, holders of 3 per cent Consols were faced with the choice of a half-point cut in the coupon or repayment at par, which was a long way below the former market value. After the second world war, inflation was the hazard, so that an investor foolish enough to buy the notorious undated Daltons (Hugh Dalton was the Labour chancellor who forced long-term interest rates down to 2.5 per cent in 1946) would have lost 96 per cent of his purchasing power over the next 30 years. Finally, high income taxes and investment income surcharges have been used to penalise investors, climaxing in the 27s 3d in the pound tax rate on wealthy people's investment incomes imposed by Roy Jenkins in 1968. But the motto of the successful investment salesman is - sometimes give a sucker an even break. In 1992, the gross rate of return on long-dated gilts (adding capital appreciation to income) was 17 per cent, and it had been very similar in 1991. It certainly beats the Halifax. Moreover, every now and then, gilts have a truly wonderful year as the market realises that real interest rates are much too high. The last was in 1982 as yields tumbled from 15.6 to 10.9 per cent, giving rise to a total return of 54 per cent for the year. Gilt-edged bulls enthuse now at the prospect of another such bonanza as long yields collapse from 8.4 to, perhaps, 6 per cent. If that were to happen quickly, it could generate a one-year return of around 40 per cent. Remember, though, that the 1982 gilt-edged miracle followed Sir Geoffrey Howe's vicious 1981 Budget in which he confronted the borrowing problem grimly: the PSBR fell from Pounds 12.7bn in 1980-81 to Pounds 8.6bn in 1981-82. Moreover, unemployment was continuing to rise steadily in 1982, from 2.63m to 2.95m - always a comforting trend for bond holders. In contrast, we must now contend with the flabby policies of Norman Lamont, with the PSBR forecast to jump from Pounds 36.5bn to Pounds 50bn. Unemployment, surprisingly, has begun to fall. The bygone era of personal investment, in which Consols formed the bedrock of every middle-class portfolio, will not return quickly. The soundness of gilts rested fundamentally not so much upon the creditworthiness of the government as on the underlying link of the currency to gold. After that safeguard went in the 1930s, and especially since sterling floated freely from the beginning of the 1970s, gilts became much more risky. The modern equivalents of Consols are index-linked gilts, which are safe but rather boring. Fixed interest gilts, on the other hand, have become casino securities, moving increasingly under the influence of the global bond fund managers who trade billions in a shadowy and rootless market in which government securities of different countries are given nicknames like oats, bunds, and JGBs. Coupon-clipping British small investors must appear much more attractive to the Bank of England than the global bond men, who will sell gilts short without mercy at the least sign of trouble. But when you overspend at the rate of Pounds 9.5bn a month, the loyal private punters are a side-show. You must solicit the international moneylenders and await your fate. At least they will not need a booklet. Private investors urged to buy gilts, Page IV</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Conakry, June 29 (AFP) -- Guinea is to send a  "military contingent" to reinforce the United Nations Mission to  Rwanda toward the end of next month, the Guinean foreign  ministry disclosed late Tuesday [28 June].    A ministry statement said Guinea was preparing "to take part  in humanitarian actions under the aegis of the United Nations by  sending a military contingent there." Some 5,500 UN troops are  expected in war-ravaged Rwanda by the end of July.    The ministry added Conakry understood the need for the  French-led Operation Turquoise humanitarian mission and wished  to underline its "concern in the face of general genocide" being  practised between rival Rwandan ethnic factions. Guinean forces  are already engaged in UN peacekeeping missions in Liberia,  Sierra Leone and Western Sahara.</p>

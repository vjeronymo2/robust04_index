			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. TEACHER SALARY DISPUTE  </P> <P> In my experience with the public schools, teachers have been talented,  dedicated and caring. I've come home from working in my children's classroom  for four hours, exhausted in awe of the teacher's skill and ability.  </P> <P> But the pesky teachers want more money! How dare they ask for a wage that is  comparable to the work they do! Of course, no one would just give it to them!  They have to apply pressure. Because of this, they are accused of being  selfish, not doing their duty, neglecting the children. It's interesting to me  that whenever a traditionally female profession demands a fair wage, the word  selfish gets thrown around.  </P> <P> Teachers are expected to uphold standards of excellence and professionalism and  be satisfied with low salaries. If they are not content to work for the joy of  it and little else, people like Del Olmo make accusations of selfishness and  shortsightedness.  </P> <P> The teachers that I have observed are not selfish. If they were, they'd be in  another profession. It is we who are shortsighted. If we expect to attract  quality people to teach our children and keep the ones we have, then we must  pay them a decent wage. You do get what you pay for.  </P> <P> MELINDA WRIGHT  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

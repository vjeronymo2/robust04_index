			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jiri Leschtina and Petr Novacek: "Havel's </F> First Year in Office: A Political Figure in Reserve"]    [Text] A bomb alert, a skirmish between the Republican  leader and reporters in a toilet, and assaults by extreme  right-wing deputies addressed to Vaclav Havel over the  microphone--this was the atmosphere in which the first Czech  president was elected by a close majority in the Chamber of  Deputies. Commentaries appeared immediately saying that Havel  would become a lonely figure without political weight. However,  the fact that he has been elected president is evidence that he  is not politically negligible at all.    Several days before the presidential elections, various  representatives from Klaus's party had indicated that they could  accept the idea that one of the most popular Civic Democratic  Party politicians--Jan Strasky--would assume office at the  Castle. The former federal prime minister, for whom the  opposition would vote just to make Havel angry, was not  completely without chances. Moreover, this enlightened and  educated technocrat is a much more typical representative of  Czech society than an exceptional dissident, creating in the  world a rather distorted picture about ourselves. However, one  of the Civic Democratic Party's highest officials admitted that  the party executive committee had arrived quickly at the  conclusion that Havel, as a living legend, is "less dangerous as  president than as nonpresident."  <H5>  Havel and the Foreign Minister </H5>   The first conflict between the Castle and the Foreign  Ministry broke loose only two days after Havel's election. The  president said that the "Czech Republic should support the idea  of an international military intervention in Bosnia." Then he  added that the country's binding standpoint would be discussed  at his meeting with the foreign minister. Josef Zieleniec,  bringing the text of the Constitution with him, visited the  Castle. He drew the president's attention to the fact that the  president may represent the Republic, but the Republic's foreign  policy is formulated by the government.    Nevertheless, in April, during Vaclav Havel's visit to Bill  Clinton in Washington, he said: "One possibility of achieving  peace in Bosnia is to make air strikes on Serbian positions."  Three days later, Vaclav Klaus reacted: "To recommend someone  to intervene, and to stay aside, seems very difficult to me."  This was an exchange of opinions that has become a framework  for political duels regarding foreign policy: The president's  generally correct moral standpoints versus the realism of the  government policy based on the world's complicated relations in  which the Czech Republic's voice is only one of many.    At that time, Vaclav Havel and Josef Zieleniec used to dine  together almost once a week. The minister very decently  explained the Cerninsky Palace's diplomatic intentions to the  president. At the same time, he strictly insisted that, unlike  in Dienstbier's time, each of them will be active in a clearly  delimited space.    On the other hand, the newly elected leaders, too, began to  understand, on their foreign visits, that the president's fame  abroad is no fiction. One of our diplomats admits that "the  same way Milan Kundera writes for the British or the French,  President Havel delivers speeches abroad that the foreign  officials want to hear. As the wise ruler in The Little  Prince, he invites someone to do what he wants to do  anyway. When he does it, it even strengthens Havel's authority."    Owing to the mediating role of Alexander Vondra, Zieleniec's  first deputy and Havel's former adviser, relations between the  Cerninsky Palace and the Castle have gradually improved.  Clinton's visit to Prague was already under the influence of  Cerninsky Palace's skillful maneuvers and Vaclav Havel's  personal diplomacy. After Josef Zieleniec allowed Budapest to  become Warren Christopher's host city last year, Havel, by a  suggestive letter, could invite the U.S. president to Prague.  He, as well as his predecessor Bush, has understood that it is  advisable to appear, from time to time, on the television screen  with Havel, the philosopher and intellectual.    According to eyewitnesses, the president, the prime  minister,  and the foreign minister acted unanimously during Clinton's  visit. Impressed by this cooperation, one of Havel's advisers  said: "Clinton would not arrive if Havel were not the president,  but he would equally not arrive if our economic transformation  were on the Romanian level."  <H5>  Havel and the Prime Minister </H5>   Since his arrival at Prague Castle, Vaclav Havel has become  a  close collaborator with Vaclav Klaus. Someone has said that,  particularly in the first six months of his rule, the president  seemed to be fascinated by the prime minister's exceptionality.  This, however, is a problem that Klaus's partners must sort out.  "The most difficult thing is to survive the first three years  with Klaus, then everything becomes O.K.," one of the prime  minister's friends says.    Between the prime minister and the president, there are few  disputes about the concepts. However, they sort of kick one  another's ankle, in the name of political prestige. Of course,  in this sort of duel, Klaus is more inclined to attack. This is  a result of the prime minister's aggressiveness and also of his  political instinct for self-preservation. Unlike the president,  who has been elected by parliament for five years, party leader  Klaus must everyday collect points for himself and for his party  for the coming communal election and for the parliamentary  elections later on.    Vaclav Klaus has not missed any opportunity to let the  public know who is the number-one man in our politics.  Permanent pressure on the president has occasionally assumed an  impolite form toward the head of state. For example, some  ministers recall that the prime minister let Vaclav Havel wait  in the antechamber for several minutes when the president came  to a government meeting.    Maybe Havel, who is always polite, realized later that he  should have left immediately. Apparently, one year is too short  a time for Havel to get accustomed to the rules of the power  struggle that belongs to the party-oriented policy in stable  democracies. Whoever can prove that he is able to exert vehement  pressure on his milieu and to react promptly to the attacks of  his partners wins.    The fact that Vaclav Havel has avoided direct confrontation  with the prime minister has thus provoked the most embarrassing  episode of the year: The disrespectful dispute after the visit  by Salman Rushdie, whose visit was quite desirable otherwise.  Irrespective of the fact that this was a private visit on the  incentive of the International Helsinki Committee, the president  knew about it and should have discussed it with the prime  minister. Today it is a known fact that the top echelons of the  Interior Ministry and the Foreign Ministry knew about the visit  two weeks in advance but did not report it to Klaus.    When there was a verbal dispute between the president and  the  prime minister, in which both issued politically improper  statements, no one was willing to admit a mistake. It is quite  symptomatic that, after a three-hour debate behind the Castle's  closed door, involving the president, the prime minister, the  foreign minister, and the interior minister, Havel finally gave  up. The result was a farce in the form of a communique that  described the president's spokesman, Ladislav Spacek, as the  culprit who committed the faux pas.    With the exception of Rushdie-type affairs, both political  protagonists have kept their personal disputes under wraps. On  the other hand, there is no reason for them to hide their  disputes regarding their concepts and opinions originating from  their different political beliefs. Who else than the president  and the prime minister should set an example of how to conduct  ethical discussions in which one participant tolerates the other?  <H5>  Havel and Parliament </H5>   In the era of his federal presidency, relations between  Vaclav Havel and parliament represented a stumbling block.  Today, however, the communication between the president and the  Chamber of Deputies has lost the tension it previously had.  This is also due to the fact that the Constitution allows the  president to return bills to parliament but not to present them.  Vaclav Havel used his right to veto the bills when he returned  to the deputies the immoral bill on customs by which the  legislative body granted unjustified advantages to deputies as  regards customs control.    Otherwise, it seems that the president has gradually adopted  one of the principal methods of practical policy, which he had  demonstrably despised in relations with the Federal  Assembly--that is, cultivating official contacts and also  contacts behind the scenes, with the influential representatives  of both the coalition and the nongovernment parties. His  activity culminated by the end of last year when he met with all  of the clubs of deputies within several hours, with the  exception of Sladek supporters, debating the politically "hot"  and topical subject of the reform of the state administration.    Otherwise, it seems that the president is seeking to  establish contact with the chairmen of two coalition  parties--Josef Lux and Jan Kalvoda, prominent Civic Democratic  Party personalities in parliament--and also with several  representatives of the opposition. It is impossible to question  the fact that Havel, Kalvoda, and Lux have similar opinions, but  it would be a simplification to say that an anti-Klaus coalition  is being created here. "The president is only searching for  possible allies, and he is also consulting other people, which  he did not do before," one of the People Party's deputies says.  <H5>  Havel and People </H5>   One of the most sensitive problems, persisting from the time  of Havel's federal presidency, is the problem of our "settling  accounts with the past." There is no doubt about the fact that  the president raised the hopes of the people when he said on 21  August 1990 that we have to continue the revolution and to  finally destroy the power of the communist mafias. However,  Vaclav Havel has never specified how such a cleansing process  should be performed. However, he strictly rejected any unlawful  settling of accounts with the past, including the published list  of the State Security collaborators.    Last spring, in an interview for the Polish paper GAZETA  WYBORCZA, Havel said that the screening law and the illegally  published list of agents in NECEZUROVANE NOVINY had caused human  tragedies. "I know about people who committed suicide and about  children who jumped out of the window when they learned that  their father was on the list," the president said. Later on,  when he was sued by Peter Cibulka, one of the NECENZUROVANE  NOVINY editors and a Charter 77 signatory, the president spoke  in front of the court about attempted suicides only.    It is possible to agree with those who say that the  controversy between Havel and the vulgar Cibulka in the  courtroom is a private affair between the two former dissidents.  On the other hand, it is impossible to ignore that some people  were maliciously happy to watch the conflict between former  "prisoners of conscience."    Daniel Kroupa, Civic Democratic Party deputy chairman, is of  the opinion that the president should abstain from  disputes--disputes between parties, in particular. "Vaclav  Havel should focus on great presidential topics," Daniel Kroupa  says. "We should not moralize, but we should support values in  politics."    It seems that Vaclav Havel began behaving in that manner by  the end of his first year in office at the Castle, when he  summarized in his New Year's speech his opinions about civic  society and applied them to real political problems,  particularly the territorial division. He presented  controversial opinions that provoked the prime minister's  reaction but caused only a mediocre discussion in the press. It  will depend on the president himself whether he will be able to  present more detailed plans, embellish them, and present them to  the attentive part of the public in such a form as to make them  the predominant topic the next year.  <H5>  Havel in His Role </H5>   The German paper GENERAL ANZEIGER has written about Vaclav  Havel recently: "The president is on his way to becoming what  he was when he was a dissident--a man striking his head against  the wall, while being surrounded by a sea of indifference. The  fact that mostly old wives and children are waving hands when  the president is traveling within the Republic does not mean  much. Other people have to make their living and do not have  time to applaud wise speeches of statesmen. However, Havel has  won 70 percent of the popular vote in public opinion polls,  which suggests that people want to have someone in the Castle  who is protecting the general principles of society. The  president has certainly passed this test.</p>

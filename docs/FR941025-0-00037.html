This amendment is prompted by a report indicating that, subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an accident involving a transport category airplane, some passengers experienced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficulty in attempting to release the buckle on their lap belts. The actions specified by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this AD are intended to prevent the inability of passengers or crew to egress from their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seats during an emergency situation, due to problems associated with the lap belt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assembly.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective November 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 25, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pacific Scientific, HTL/KIN&hyph;TECH Division, 22715 Savi Ranch Parkway, Yorba Linda,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California 92687.

That action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed to require the removal of certain lap belt assemblies and restraint systems, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement with another design assembly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters support the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the intent of the proposal, but suggests that it should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been issued as an immediately adopted rule, without prior notice and time for public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment. The commenter considers that the subject lap belts pose a serious and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate threat to passengers and crew who could encounter difficulties in releasing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> belts during an emergency situation. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion. In developing this rule and its associated compliance time, the FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered not only the degree of urgency associated with addressing the subject unsafe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition, but the availability of necessary parts and the practical aspect of accomplishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the required actions during normal maintenance schedules. Additionally, the FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered the fact there has been no adverse service history within the last two years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to the 27,000 subject belts currently in service. In light of all of these items, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA could not find that it was impracticable to provide for prior notice and time for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment on the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 27,002 lap belts of the affected design installed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft and rotorcraft worldwide. The FAA estimates that, of this number, approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10,000 are to be installed on U.S. registered aircraft and rotorcraft. It will take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately .5 work hour per lap belt to accomplish the required actions, at an average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will be supplied by Pacific Scientific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Company at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on U.S. operators is estimated to be $275,000, or $27.50 per lap belt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

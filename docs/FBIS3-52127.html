Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi said  the law, as issued, is well-balanced considering the amendments  that have been made to it. He explained that the government was  responsive to all the views offered by the deputies. He added  that a high-level committee chaired by the justice minister will  amend all relevant legislation to bring it into line with  current circumstances.    People's Assembly Speaker Dr. Ahmad Fathi Surur asserted  that  the new law, which was discussed at length, contains no  contradictions of Islamic shari'ah.    After passing the new bill, the People's Assembly adjourned  until 8 January 1994. The Assembly approved articles 85, 87,  and 88 pertaining to tax exemptions for families. It also  approved Article 90, which specifies the tax rates as follows:    Section 1: 20 percent on income of up to 2,000 pounds.    Section 2: 27 percent on income greater than 2,500 pounds  and up to 7,000 pounds.    Section 3: 35 percent on income greater than 7,000 pounds  and up to 16,000 pounds.    Section 4: 40 percent on income greater than 16,000  pounds and up to 27,000 pounds.    Section 5: 45 percent on income greater than 27,000  pounds and up to 68,000 pounds.    Section 6: 48 percent on income greater than 68,000  pounds.    Regarding income from salaries and similar and other revenue  [as heard], the tax rate on them will be the same as that in  section 1 -- 20 percent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three species of introduced plants threaten  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D. undulata. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The historic native flora of Hawaii consisted of about 1,000 species, 89 percent of which were endemic. Of the total native and naturalized Hawaiian flora of 1,817 species, 47 percent were introduced from other parts of the world and nearly 100 species have become pests (Smith 1985, Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). Naturalized, introduced species degrade the Hawaiian landscape and compete with native plants for space, light, water, and nutrients (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Some of these species were brought to Hawaii by various groups of people, including the Polynesian immigrants, for food or cultural reasons. Plantation owners, alarmed at the reduction of water resources for their crops caused by the destruction of native forest cover by grazing feral animals, supported the introduction of alien tree species for reforestation. Ranchers intentionally introduced pasture grasses and other species for agriculture, and sometimes inadvertently introduced weed seeds as well. Other plants were brought to Hawaii for their potential horticultural value (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Wenkam 1969).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Passiflora mollissima <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (banana poka), a woody vine, poses a serious problem to mesic forests on Kauai and Hawaii by covering trees, reducing the amount of light that reaches trees as well as understory, and causing damage and death to trees by the weight of the vines. Animals, especially feral pigs, eat the fruit and distribute the seeds (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Escobar 1990).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> P. mollissima <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is a threat to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D. undulata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and its habitat (J. Giffin,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Senecio mikanioides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (German ivy) is another vine that poses a serious threat to mesic and dry forests on Hawaii. It is becoming established on Maui as well.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Senecio mikanioides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  may be capable of establishing itself over vast areas of the island of Hawaii, including most of Hualalai. The vine covers the forest canopy, which can result in structural damage and the reduction of available light.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Senecio mikanioides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  also can form a significant ground cover in native forests of the southern Kona region of Hawaii where it may limit native plant reproduction (Cuddihy and Stone 1990).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Senecio mikanioides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  threatens  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D. undulata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and its habitat (J. Giffin,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pennisetum clandestinum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Kikuyu grass), an aggressive, fire adapted, perennial grass introduced to Hawaii as a pasture grass, withstands trampling and grazing and has naturalized on four Hawaiian Islands in dry to mesic forest. It produces thick mats which choke out other plants and prevent their seedlings from becoming established. It has been declared a noxious weed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (7 CFR 360) (O'Connor 1990, Smith 1985). Because Hawaiian plants were subjected to fire during their evolution only in areas of volcanic activity and from occasional lightning strikes, they are not adapted to recurring fire regimes and are unable to recover well following a fire. Fires may result from natural causes, or they may be accidentally or purposely set by people. Vegetation on the slopes of Hualalai is particularly vulnerable to fire due to the extensive invasion of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> P. clandestinum. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Alien plants are often better adapted to fire than native plant species, and some fire-adapted grasses have become widespread in Hawaii. Native shrubland can thus be converted to land dominated by alien grasses. The presence of such species in Hawaiian ecosystems greatly increases the intensity, extent, and frequency of fire, especially during drier months or drought. Fire-adapted alien species can reestablish in a burned area, resulting in a reduction in the amount of native vegetation after each fire. Fire can destroy dormant seeds as well as mature plants and seedlings, even in steep or inaccessible areas. The only known individual of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D. undulata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  occurs in an area heavily grazed by cattle, and is offered some protection from fires since the cattle reduce the fuel load of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> P. clandestinum. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  However, fire remains a potentially serious threat to the only known individual of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D. undulata, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  its potential regeneration, and other suitable habitat (J. Giffin,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D. undulata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D. undulata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as endangered. Only one individual of this species is known to exist, and it is threatened by habitat degradation by feral ungulates and alien plants, fire, and lack of legal protection. Small population size makes this species particularly vulnerable to reduced reproductive vigor and/or extinction from stochastic events. Because this species is in danger of extinction throughout all of its range, it fits the definition of endangered as defined in the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

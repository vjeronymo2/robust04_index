			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Basic pay increases drop to low level BASIC PAY increases fell to a median of 2.6 per cent in the three months to April, probably the lowest level since the late 1960s, Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay research company, said yesterday, Lisa Wood writes. The figure partly reflects the effect of the 1.5 per cent ceiling on those public-sector pay rises with April review dates. The research says pay settlements in private-sector organisations were continuing to fall and further falls seemed likely. Basic pay rises in the private sector fell from 3 per cent in the three months ending March to 2.75 per cent in the three months ending in April. The figure was 4.2 per cent the year before. The research says a quarter of pay awards in the three months to the end of April were worth 1.5 per cent or less. The research says there is little likelihood of a significant pick-up in private-sector deals in the next few months. Pay and Benefits Bulletin 329. IRS, 18-20 Highbury Place, London N5 1QP.

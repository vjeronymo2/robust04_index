			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMMIGRATION CHIEF NELSON IS EXPECTED TO BE REPLACED  </P> <P> Alan C. Nelson, who has presided over the government's massive program to give  legal status to illegal aliens, will be replaced as commissioner of the  Immigration and Naturalization Service, despite his concerted effort to hold on  to the post, Administration sources said Monday.  </P> <P> The disclosure of his expected departure comes in the wake of a recent Justice  Department audit that was highly critical of management practices in the  agency.  </P> <P> Sources said that Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, whose department oversees the  INS, is eager to bring "new blood" to the service.  </P> <P> A Justice Department spokesman said that President Bush "has indicated he would  like to see major turnover of people in the Administration to reflect his views  and priorities.  </P> <P> "The attorney general has been engaged in the process of interviewing people  for major positions," said the spokesman, David Runkel. "No determination has  been made with regard to INS."  </P> <P> Other sources said, however, that although the search is under way for a new  commissioner, no decision on a replacement is expected this month.  </P> <P> Nelson has been the target of strong criticism for the agency's plan to dig a  four-mile-long ditch on the Mexico-California border near San Diego to deter  smuggling, and for the agency's response to the influx of Central American  refugees.  </P> <P> Nelson, who did not return a reporter's call Monday, was incensed over an  internal Justice Department audit last week that charged that his agency was  riddled with mismanagement. The audit cited such problems as missing documents,  massive backlogs of cases and failure to conduct background checks on many  applicants for citizenship.  </P> <P> When asked about the plans to replace Nelson, Greg Leo, his chief spokesman,  said: "We're not in a position to confirm or deny that. To the best of my  knowledge, he has not been told that. I just talked to him."  </P> <P> One INS official who favors Nelson's retention said that the audit by the  Justice Department's management division was designed to undermine his efforts  to stay in the job. Since Bush's election, Nelson has been lobbying transition  officials to keep him in the position.  </P> <P> "It's a hatchet job," the official said of the audit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Series of Audits  </P> <P> However, Justice Department officials said that Thornburgh's management  practice relies on such audits to evaluate the performance of agencies  responsible to him. They noted that he made frequent use of such audits when he  was governor of Pennsylvania and that audits of the INS and Marshals Service  are only the first in a series of such assessments.  </P> <P> Several immigrant rights activists said they were not surprised that Nelson  would be ushered out. "There are enough people out there who want him out to  start a club," said Mario Moreno of the Mexican American Legal Defense and  Educational Fund.  </P> <P> Nelson's handling of the agency has been controversial for several years. A  former San Francisco attorney who took over the job in 1982, he oversaw the  implementation of the landmark 1986 immigration reform law and was sharply  criticized by alien advocates for allegedly being slow in informing the public  about the measure's provisions.  </P> <P> Nelson, whose friendship with former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III dated back to  their days in California, weathered that storm.  </P> <P> However, acrimony flared anew with disclosure in January of INS plans to  construct the $2-million border ditch. Many critics likened it to the Berlin  Wall, complaining that it reflected insensitivity to the concerns of immigrants  who cross the border seeking a better life in the United States. The government  of Mexico has told the Administration of its opposition to the ditch.  </P> <P> Nelson and Thornburgh also have had differences since Thornburgh assumed the  top Justice Department post late in the Ronald Reagan Administration, several  immigration experts said. "There's no love lost" between them, one said.  </P> <P> Charles Kamasaki of the National Council of La Raza said that Nelson "started  with a disadvantage. He not only was a holdover; he was particularly identified  with Meese, and Thornburgh and Bush don't have any particular affinity for  Meese."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Has Ally in Simpson  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Nelson has had a strong ally in Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), a  principal author of the 1986 immigration law.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Simpson said that the senator "has indicated to everybody that  he can that he supports Alan. But his support is no guarantee of a job in this  Administration."  </P> <P> The spokesman recounted a conversation in which Simpson expressed his support  and Bush replied: "OK, Al, thanks; it's important for me to know what you  think."  </P> <P> Although several people have been mentioned as possible successors to Nelson,  no front-runner is now apparent, Administration sources said.  </P></p>

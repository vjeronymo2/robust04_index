			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DRIVERS AT PADRES' OPENER COULD FACE PARKING SHUTOUT  </P> <P> Walk in. Shuttle in. Parachute in. But, for Heaven's sake, think twice about  driving into San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium tonight for the Padres' opening game  of 1989.  </P> <P> Although the stadium parking lot is the third-largest in the United States --  Meadowland Stadium's in New Jersey and the Houston Astrodome's are larger --  the numbers still add up to a sellout crowd of 60,000-plus ticket holders and  about 20,000 parking spaces. These figures have driven ACE Parking, the company  that has handled stadium parking for 22 years, to strive for greater parking  harmony this year.  </P> <P> "The kinds of problems we're going to have will happen after 6 p.m.," said  Scott Jones, president of ACE Parking. "If people can just try to plan to come  early and come where the husband does not have to drive from work to meet the  wife coming from home. Too many cars and not enough spaces . . .that's when the  problem goes out to Friars Road.  </P> <P> "People need to understand we've got a good luxury here," he added. "We've  gotten spoiled. With normal games, you can leave half an hour before game time  and breeze right in. With bigger games, we need more self-discipline."  </P> <P> The parking lot will open at 1 p.m. and the stadium gates will open at 5 p.m.,  Jones said. Tailgaters who set up in more than one parking space must give up  the extra space an hour and a half before the game, he said.  </P> <P> The Padres square off against the San Francisco Giants at 7:20 p.m.  </P> <P> ACE has also created 2,000 more parking spaces by asking Padres management to  eliminate the traditional opening-day fireworks. In past years, part of the lot  had to be cordoned off to allow for fireworks fallout, Jones said.  </P> <P> More than 100 cashiers and attendants will be on hand with eagerly outstretched  palms to collect the $3 parking fee. ACE Parking officials will also be  available at a customer-service window near Gate F to address any questions or  concerns, Jones said.  </P> <P> San Diego police will begin directing traffic at 4 p.m., an hour earlier than  in years past, Jones said. Police will divert traffic from Mission Village  Drive and help alleviate commuter traffic on Friars Road.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shuttle-Bus Service  </P> <P> Further efforts to alleviate the parking crunch include an overflow lot at Taft  Junior High School, 9191 Gramercy Drive, about half a mile from the stadium.  Parking there is free.  </P> <P> Shuttle buses will leave from Taft half an hour before the game starts and will  leave 20 minutes after the game is over, Jones said.  </P> <P> San Diego Transit will provide shuttle service to the game from several  locations around town, beginning at 5 p.m. and making a last round one hour  before game time. Pick up locations include the Downtown/Hillcrest area, east  San Diego, La Mesa, El Cajon and North County.  </P> <P> For specific locations and times, call San Diego Transit at 234-3004. In the  North County-coastal area, call 722-6383, and in the North County-inland area,  call 743-6383.  </P> <P> In San Diego, shuttle fare is $2 one way and $4 for a round trip. From North  County, the fare is $2.50 one way and $5 for a round trip.  </P></p>

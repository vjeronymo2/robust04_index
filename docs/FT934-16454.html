			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Fine Decor marginally ahead of forecast with Pounds 1.33m FINE DECOR Group, the wallpaper designer, manufacturer and distributor, yesterday announced interim results marginally ahead of its own forecasts made when it came to the market in June. Actual trading figures revealed pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 871,000) for the six months ended July 31 while at the operating level there was a surplus of Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.32m), ahead of its prospectus forecast of Pounds 1.62m. The board declared a 1p interim dividend, again meeting its flotation forecast, out of earnings per share of 8.1p (5.8p). The board is maintaining its prospectus promise to recommend a total for the current year of not less than 7.5p on an annualised basis and an actual value of 4.7p. Mr Roger Regan, chairman, said that 'the board are satisfied by the continuing trend of sales during the second half in the light of prevailing economic conditions'. Mr Regan, who is also chairman of Spring Ram, said trading conditions in the first half had been 'difficult' in the UK and elsewhere for the company, which exports to 30 countries. Total sales rose to Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 17m). Exports rose 14 per cent to Pounds 7.48m (Pounds 6.56m) with 'significant progress' achieved in North America. Interest charges dropped to Pounds 333,000 (Pounds 447,000). At the half way stage the company had net borrowings of some Pounds 4m for gearing of 49 per cent. This compared with net borrowings of Pounds 8.24m and gearing of 437 per cent, reflecting the company's origins as a management buy-out. Net cash inflows from operating activities dropped drastically to just Pounds 47,000 (Pounds 1.26m). The company said the change reflected stronger than expected sales in July which pushed up the level of debtors, a seasonal build up of stocks and the launch of some new products ahead of schedule.</p>

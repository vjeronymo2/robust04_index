			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gerard Nirascou: "Balladur in Nice"] </F>   [Excerpt] Nice -- The prime minister went to Nice yesterday  to attend the opening ceremony of the 27th General Assembly of  the Asian Development Bank. Edouard Balladur took advantage of  the opportunity to forcefully reaffirm France's interest in that  continent and the desire of our country and Europe to have a  greater presence there. "The stakes are considerable," the  prime minister explained, "in the political sphere, the European  countries and their Asian partners have prime responsibility for  the security and stability of these continents...and in the  economic sphere, Europe is the world's leading trading partner  and is one of the most prosperous markets."

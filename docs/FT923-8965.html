			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Brussels rebukes airlines over fares FOUR European airlines have been rebuked by the European Commission for increasing fares last summer in breach of EC law. The Commission condemned fare increases introduced by British Airways, Alitalia, Luxair and Iberia on 22 routes - all but one involving British airports. The Commission decided the increases were not 'reasonably related' to the airlines' long-term costs. The Commission has not punished the airlines, which increased the fares during the Gulf crisis when the regulatory regime was temporarily relaxed. Instead, it has warned governments that they cannot use the prices as a reference for future increases. The European Commission yesterday gave PepsiCo and General Mills, US multinationals, the go-ahead to create Europe's largest manufacturer of snack food products. Brussels' competition authorities cleared the joint venture - which will have sales of Dollars 640m (Pounds 335m) - after a one-month investigation. The US groups said in May they intended to merge their operations in six continental European countries. A Commission spokesman said the fragmentation of the EC snack food business meant the enlarged company would command less than 10 per cent of the market.</p>

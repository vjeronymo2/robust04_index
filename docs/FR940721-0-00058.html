			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nissan suggested that each manufacturer be allowed, at its discretion, to include or not include additional information or explanation relevant to that manufacturer or particular carline. It stated that introducing a new percentage on the label that is calculated from a different base will only add to the consumer's confusion. Nissan stated that if the agency decides to require a statement, it suggests the following language: ``The parts content percentages identified here do not value similar parts equally nor reflect the value of final assembly labor or parts or distribution expenses, all necessary aspects of determining the ultimate value of a vehicle.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AIADA stated that it supports the proposal to include a statement on the label to indicate that parts content of a vehicle does not represent the total value of the vehicle. That organization stated that it believes the statement should include a mention of what is not included, specifically labor and distribution costs. That organization also argued that the agency should go further than providing a simple note. It argued that the label should explain such things as roll-up, roll-down for outside suppliers (roll-up, roll-down is discussed later in this preamble), and whether or not the vehicle is domestic or import for CAFE purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering all of the comments, and noting that none of the commenters provided information concerning the range of parts content as a percentage of wholesale cost, NHTSA has decided to require a brief explanatory note to explain the meaning of parts content. Since consumers are not likely to be familiar with the concept of parts content, the agency is concerned that they are likely to confuse parts content with overall vehicle content without such a note.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA is persuaded by the comments, however, that the note should not provide a range for the ratio of parts content value to wholesale dealer cost for a typical vehicle. The agency agrees that such a statement might confuse consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has decided to require the following explanatory note at the end of the label: ``Parts content does not include final assembly, distribution, or other non-parts costs.'' NHTSA believes that the same note should be provided for all vehicles, to ensure brevity and clarity. With respect to GM's comment concerning authority, the agency notes that section 210(c) provides the agency with authority to prescribe the form and content of the required label. The agency also notes that manufacturers choosing the option, discussed earlier in this preamble, of providing additional information for carlines assembled in both the U.S./Canada and other countries, would be required to include it at the end of this explanatory note.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Place of final assembly.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Toyota stated that the city of assembly should only be required for vehicles assembled in the U.S. That manufacturer argued that vehicles assembled in other countries should be labeled only with the country, not city, of final assembly, since the names of many cities in foreign countries in which automobiles are assembled are likely to be unfamiliar to many if not most consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA notes that section 210(b)(1)(B) expressly states that the label must indicate ``the final assembly point by city, State (where appropriate), and country of such automobile.'' Therefore, the agency does not have the discretion to permit the names of foreign cities to be excluded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Procedure for Determining U.S./Canadian Parts Content (Section 583.6)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in the NPRM, in order to calculate the percentage U.S./Canadian parts content (the first item of information on the label), the vehicle manufacturer must know:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) the U.S./Canadian content (by value) of each item of motor vehicle equipment used to assemble the vehicles within the carline;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) the total value of each such item of equipment, i.e., the price it will pay for each such item of equipment; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) the unit volume of each such item of equipment for each carline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency stated in the NPRM that, in calculating the U.S./Canadian parts content for each carline, the manufacturer must reasonably project the installation rates for all equipment offered on that carline. For example, if a carline with a standard manual transmission is offered with an optional automatic transmission, the manufacturer must project the sales of each transmission in advance of the model year. This also applies to all other equipment options or choices for the vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Much of the information that manufacturers use to calculate the first item on the label must come from parts suppliers. These calculations are made once for each model year, prior to the model year. As discussed later in this preamble, the agency is requiring suppliers to provide information to manufacturers concerning the content of the parts they supply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA proposed a specific procedure in &sect;583.6 of the proposed regulation for determining U.S./Canadian parts content. Section 583.6(b) set forth a procedure for determining the value of items of equipment. It provided that the value of an item of equipment is generally the price paid by the manufacturer for the equipment as delivered to the final assembly point, and that the value of an item of equipment produced at the final assembly plant is the fair market price that a manufacturer of similar size and location would pay a supplier for such equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 583.6(c) set forth a procedure for determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the value of equipment. It set forth different procedures for outside and allied suppliers, to reflect the fact that the statutory ``roll-up, roll-down'' provision applies to outside suppliers, but not allied suppliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 583.6(d) set forth a procedure for determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the total value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment. This procedure involved adding up the total value of all of the equipment to be installed in that carline during the next model year, dividing the value of the U.S./Canadian content of such equipment by the total value of the equipment, and multiplying the resulting number by 100.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Determining the value of items of equipment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AAMA commented that 583.6(b) puts the valuation emphasis on where material is received as opposed to from whom it is purchased. That organization stated that for equipment purchased from outside suppliers by either a vehicle manufacturer or allied supplier, valuation should be based on the price that exists in the financial records at the time the content is calculated. AAMA stated that for equipment purchased from allied suppliers, valuation should be based on the established practices of the manufacturer, which could include a transfer cost or transfer price methodology. That organization stated that if a transfer price is used, the price should be consistent with customs valuation or that used for internal management. AAMA also noted that &sect;583.6 does not address determination of value for items of equipment delivered to allied suppliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

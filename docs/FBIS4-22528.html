			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P.K. Shtepenko and M.A. Katser, VElNII AO: "A </F> New Designator System for Mainline Electric Locomotives"]    [Text] By order of the minister of Railways, No 22Ts,  of 15 May 1984, a digital system for designation of rolling  stock was introduced for computer processing of information on  its operation. Today it is functioning along with the accepted  designation of the series. An article by V.A. Rakov (see ETT  [ELECTRICHESKAYA I TEPLOVOZNAYA TYAGA] No 3, 1985), told how the  existing system was formed. It did not, however, reflect the  shortcomings of the designations of mainline electric  locomotives. Suggestions for a new system were brought into the  published article in the form of a discussion.    We know that in 1932, in memory of V.I. Lenin, series of  electric locomotives began to be designated by the two letters  "VL." The first domestic mainline electric locomotive was given  the designation VL19-01, where the number 19 designated the  pressure of the wheelpair axle on the rails in tonnes, and 01 --  the ordinal number.    An analogous procedure was extended to the following series  as well: VL22, VL22M. In the future, locomotives began to be  designated N8, NO, N60, N80, where the letter "N" attested that  the machines were manufactured at the Novocherkassk Electric  Locomotive Building Plant. The remaining figures and letters  designated: "eight-axle direct current," "single-phase,"  "six-axle single-phase," "eight-axle single-phase." Electric  locomotives built at the Tbilisi Electric Locomotive Building  Plant had in their name the letter "T," for example T8 --  eight-axle direct current electric locomotive.    In 1963, at the demand of the MPS [Ministry of Railways],  the  letter designations of electric locomotives manufactured earlier  were replaced by "VL." Moreover, it was ordered that direct  current locomotives be designated by numbers up to 39, and  alternating current -- from 40 up. Electric locomotives of the  last few years had the designations VL10, VL11, VL15, VL41,  VL62, VL65, VL84, VL85 and VL86. The existing system, therefore,  has no real meaning, except for the type of current.    In reality, direct current electric locomotives VL10 and  VL11  are eight-axle, and VL15 -- 12-axle, i.e., there is no  information on the difference in the number of axles. The  situation is the same with direct current locomotives, where the  numbers 6 and 8 formerly designated "six-axle" and "eight-axle."  After the output of 12-axle electric locomotives VL85 and VL86,  this meaning too was lost.    Specialists of the VElNII AO [All-Union Electric Locomotive  Building Scientific Research Institute Joint Stock Company]  developed and have proposed for discussion a new system of  designating mainline electric locomotives. It is notable for its  simplicity and bears a meaningful load: the type of current and  service, the number of axles, the distinguishing features of the  design of the tractive motors and the form of modernization. The  symbols of the new system are presented in the table.

The system of designating mainline electric  locomotives takes into consideration the current level of  structural execution of locomotives and the prospects for  further development of electric locomotive building.    We will give a few examples of the designations: S12 --  freight, 12-axle direct current electric locomotive with  commutator traction motors; P8 -- freight, eight-axle direct  current locomotive with commutator traction motors; SP6A --  passenger, six-axle alternating current electric locomotives  with asynchronous traction motors; D8 --freight, eight-axle  dual-feed locomotives with commutator traction motors.    When necessary, there can be a letter designating the  manufacturing plant before the designation of the electric  locomotive series, as for example, "N" -- Novocherkassk.

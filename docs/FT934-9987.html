			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Observer: Generation game The choice of David Robins, 44, as chief executive of UBS in London will, in the very nature of things, put a number of noses out of joint. It must, for instance, be somewhat galling for Hector Sants, vice chairman and head of equities, who was made a partner at Phillips &amp; Drew at a particularly tender age. Although Sants is Robins' junior by some six years, there is still bound to be more than a little sibling rivalry between two men who cut their teeth in the close-knit world of UK research at P&amp;D. Leaving aside big fish elsewhere in the UBS network, there are quite enough well-developed egos in the London office who could vote with their feet. It remains to be seen, for instance, what Richard Briance, head of debt and treasury, or corporate finance boss Stephen Brisby, will make of the new generation of management that has just been signalled.</p>

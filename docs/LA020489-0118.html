			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 MORE CARCASSES FOUND;  </P> <P> FISHING NETS LINKED TO SEA LION DEATHS  </P> <P> Three more dead sea lions washed ashore Friday in Orange County, bringing to 34  the revised total since the unexplained string of deaths began Jan. 21, the  U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service reported.  </P> <P> The three carcasses were found at Newport Beach, Huntington Beach and  neighboring Bolsa Chica State Beach.  </P> <P> The dead sea lion at Newport Beach washed up about 3 p.m. near 22nd Street on  the city's Balboa Peninsula, said Lifeguard Rob Wyatt. Another carcass beached  near M Street earlier in the day, he said, but that carcass had been reported  to federal authorities on Thursday, when it was still floating offshore.  </P> <P> "I'm beginning to believe the sea lions are dying through interaction with  fishermen's nets out at sea," said Joe Cordaro, a wildlife biologist with the  National Marine Fisheries Service office in Los Angeles. "I have no proof yet,  but we are coming to this conclusion because everything else seems to be ruled  out."  </P> <P> Cordaro said necropsies performed Thursday on two dead sea lions found in  Orange County revealed no evidence of gunshot wounds, parasite infections or  illnesses. He said the federal agency previously ruled out the possibility that  the sea lions were being killed by natural predators, such as sharks.  </P> <P> The carcasses had washed ashore in Huntington Beach until Thursday, when four  appeared on Newport Beach shores.  </P> <P> "Maybe the currents have changed," Wyatt said.  </P> <P> Authorities "don't know where out in the ocean the sea lions are dying,"  Cordaro said. "We don't know if it's some point off Huntington Beach because  the currents could be carrying them for miles before they come ashore."  </P> <P> Officials might not be informed about all of the beachings. For instance,  William A. McGilligan of San Clemente said that an ill mammal, which he  described as a seal, washed ashore near his home on Buena Vista on Tuesday  afternoon. Cordaro, however, said Friday that his office had never been  notified of an ill mammal beached in San Clemente.  </P> <P> Federal officials have said they know of no coordinated effort by local, state  and federal agencies to solve the mystery.  </P> <P> Paul Wilkinson, an aide in the Washington office of Rep. C. Christopher Cox  (R-Newport Beach) said Friday that "so far we haven't received a single call or  letter from a constituent about this matter."  </P></p>

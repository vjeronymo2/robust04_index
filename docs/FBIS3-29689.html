There are no obstacles  at all. Vietnam's membership is not the issue now, he told  reporters who approached him and Vietnamese Foreign Minister  Nguyen Manh Cam as they emerged from a three-hour meeting at the  Government Guest House here Monday evening.    When a reporter pressed on whether in that case, Vietnam  could even join ASEAN today itself, Ajit Singh said the issue  now was the question of timing. Cam interjected and said the  timing of Vietnam's entry was for further discussion by ASEAN  member natioms -- Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the  Philippines, and Brunei.    Ajit Singh was also asked whether ASEAN felt that the  lifting  of the United States' trade embargo on Vietnam early this month  made it necessary more than ever for the communist country to  join the grouping. He replied that ASEAN has always regarded  Vietnam as part of the region and its granting of an observer  status to the country was a recognition of this fact.    Cam was asked whether there was consensus among Vietnam's  traders that their country should join ASEAN immediately. He  replied by referring to Vietnam Communist Party  Secretary-General Do Muoi's statement in Thailand last year that  Vietnam would join ASEAN at an appropriate time. This means  that the timing of Vietnam's entry into ASEAN depends on the  agreement between Vietnam and ASEAN, he said During his  six-day visit to Vietnam, the first by an ASEAN  secretary-general, Ajit Singh is also scheduled to tour Dalat,  Hue, and Ho Chi Minh City.</p>

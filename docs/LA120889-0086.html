			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRANS-SOVIET FIBER-OPTIC VENTURE TO INCLUDE US WEST  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, US West Inc. and seven other telecommunications companies  plan to form a venture to develop a fiber-optic line linking Japan, the Soviet  Union and Europe, it was announced Thursday.  </P> <P> The 12,000-mile line would be the longest fiber-optic line in the world,  crossing the Soviet Union and making undersea connections to Denmark, Italy and  Japan, US West said.  </P> <P> The Englewood, Colo.-based communications company, a regional telephone company  for much of the West, estimated that the project will take three to five years  to complete once construction begins and will cost $500 million. US West said  it hopes to begin construction in the second half of 1990.  </P> <P> The line will serve growing demand for communications capacity between the  Pacific Rim and Europe and provide long-distance connections between Soviet  cities.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will participate in  the venture, called Trans-Soviet Line Development Corp.  </P> <P> Other principals include Kokusai Denshin Denwa, Societa Finanziaria Telefonica  of Italy, British Telecommunications PLC and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom and  Australian and Danish firms.  </P></p>

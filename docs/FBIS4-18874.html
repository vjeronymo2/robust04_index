			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to information provided by  the Foreign Ministry Monday noon [11 April], 11 Germans are  still stuck in the Deutsche Welle relay station near the Rwandan  capital Kigali. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Michael Geerdts  stated that the hostilities were continuing nearby and that the  access road was mined. At the moment one was examining several  options to evacuate the trapped Germans, one of which was to  rescue them by air by helicopter.    The Foreign Ministry has thus confuted reports that the 11  Germans -- seven engineers, three spouses, and one child -- had  already been flown out of the station by U.S. soldiers. This  had been said by the director of Deutsche Welle, Dieter Weirich,  in Cologne earlier today.</p>

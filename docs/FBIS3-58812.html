			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Norbert Mayer and Thomas Mayer: "EU Locomotive at </F> Full Blast"]    [Text] Vienna, Brussels -- On Friday [21 January], Austria  and the European Union [EU] reached agreements on another two of  29 chapters, namely competition policy and free trade in  services. This means that 15 of the 29 chapters have now been  ticked off. The major part of the remaining issues is to reach  the agreement stage by the beginning of February. This means  that from next week on, the accession locomotive will be running  at full blast.    Chancellor Franz Vranitzky stressed the "enormous  importance"  of his visit to Greece, which currently holds the EU Presidency.  The "big chunks" -- agriculture, transit, and second homes --  will become central issues. The Social Democratic Party's  foreign policy spokesman, Peter Schieder, told DER STANDARD: "We  will find a solution to all of these issues."    Vienna is preparing for the following compromise solutions:  transit agreement to run throughout its envisaged period but  including East European and domestic transport; domestic and  foreign transport to be treated equally; no "sensitive regions"  but nationwide applicability; increasing weight limit from 38 to  40 tonnes. For agriculture and second homes, transition periods  of four to five years are envisaged. The talks on foreign trade  policy were slowed down by Austria during Friday's negotiations.  As Austria sees its brown coal mining endangered by imports  from East Europe, it aims at a five-year transition period,  which has been rejected so far by Brussels on the grounds of EU  antidumping regulations. The chapter on customs union has also  been completed apart from expiration dates on Austrian forms.  The customs union will do away with country of origin  regulations, which have been a great problem to Austrian  exporters and have obstructed across-the-border processing.    In Brussels, a new working group has started formulating the  first final agreements in order to avoid bottlenecks later on.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Clarke regime gives mandarins more time for lunch - Peter Marsh explains how the chancellor's relaxed approach has won him friends at the Treasury Asked about how life has changed since Mr Kenneth Clarke took over as chancellor, the Treasury mandarin patted his stomach. Even with the strains of preparing the first Budget covering both tax and spending, top officials have found more time for lunch. They have taken their cue from Mr Clarke, who has brought a new air of self-confidence to a government department heavily criticised for economic policy mistakes in recent years. A government official said: 'Clarke has been good for the Treasury. He has a view about everything and has refused to get bogged down in economic jargon. Unlike (former chancellor) Norman Lamont, who identified with the Treasury, Clarke really does not care about the place as an institution. The relationship is healthier.' Since replacing Mr Lamont six months ago Mr Clarke has abandoned the Treasury tradition of barely talking to the outside world in the pre-Budget period. One former Treasury official witnessed Mr Clarke earlier this month discuss at a City lunch the possibility of imposing extra taxes on pension funds in tomorrow's Budget. He said: 'It took my breath away to see the chancellor discussing potential victims, rather than hide from sight.' While morale at the Treasury has been helped by signs of economic recovery after the traumas of the recession and sterling's devaluation, another important factor has been Mr Clarke's personality. A government official said: 'People talk about Clarke as a future prime minister. This is bound to affect the confidence of the people working for him.' Another official said: 'He's better at reading his briefs than Mr Lamont and better organised.' This means fewer set-piece meetings in the chancellor's office to talk about such issues as monetary policy or European affairs. While Mr Lamont often called two such meetings a day, each of them involving up to 10 officials whose workloads were consequently stretched, Mr Clarke makes do with about two a week. The generally positive view about the chancellor - a political heavyweight who came to the Treasury after a succession of cabinet jobs including home secretary and secretary for health and education - is shared by several outside the department. Mr James Bruxner, chairman of the Scotch Whisky Association, which has regular contacts with the Treasury, said of a recent meeting with Mr Clarke about the Budget: 'Unlike Mr Lamont, who played his cards very close to his chest, Mr Clarke came across as eager to have a dialogue.' Mr Clarke appears to be attracted by the political rather than the technical aspects of the chancellor's job. One person who talked to him recently about the Budget said: 'His eyes flashed when I suggested he could pull off a coup by increasing taxes now, only to bring them down again later in what could be a vote winner ahead of a 1997 election.' Some believe Mr Clarke has not done enough to get on top of economic issues. He has left such details to two of his top civil servants - Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, and Mr Alan Budd, the department's chief economic adviser - with whom he has struck a friendly though not particularly close relationship. One person close to the Treasury said: 'My fear is that he does not know enough (about economics) and that at some point this could trip him up.' On broad political questions the chancellor relies on Mrs Tessa Keswick, his political adviser at the Treasury, who worked for him at his other cabinet positions. Mrs Keswick is a former Conservative councillor in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and sister-in-law of Sir 'Chips' Keswick, chairman of Hambros Bank. She is fiercely protective of Mr Clarke and fond of referring to him as 'my man'. One insider says of Mrs Keswick: 'She's a sensible middle-aged lady who has a good political feel.' Not everyone at the Treasury has a wholly positive view of Mr Clarke. Some officials concerned with public spending and economics are said to have been put out after being subjected to 'aggressive' questioning from the chancellor. One person close to him said: 'Clarke can be brusque but he's hardly ever malicious. He's used to getting into a new department and asking enough questions until he's on top of his brief.'</p>

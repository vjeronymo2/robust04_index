			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (2): Westminster lifts the lid - Christine Moir reflects on where politics ends and planning begins Lady Porter now spends a lot of time abroad and the notorious Designated Homes sales programme may have abruptly halted. But the scandal of how the Tory Westminster Council strove to buy votes by turning the disaffected into home owners on the cheap still rumbles on. The Unitary Development Plan for the city has now been re-examined by the District Auditor and by Mike Laws, a retired County Planning Officer for Shropshire, to see if the entire housing policy has been flawed by what are described as 'contaminated motives' ie gerrymandering. Their reports are expected shortly. Meanwhile, it has recently emerged that Porter's administration may have had a fine sense of self preservation in trying to buy votes. Boundary changes may soon threaten the Tories' age-old hegemony over Westminster, turning the district into a potential marginal. But it would be wrong to dismiss Westminster's housing policy out of hand. Long before Porter all Westminster's local governors laid special emphasis on maintaining a strong residential element in every part of the city. The most recent requirement - that developments involving increased office space must provide matching amounts of self-contained residential units - is compatible with the post-war history of planning in Westminster. Westminster's approach to planning has always been very different from the City's. The latter welcomes offices so long as they meet design criteria. Some retail provision is the only extra the developer need consider. Westminster has never seen itself primarily as an office location. Its planning priority is urban renewal and it believes that this means mixed uses even in its core area, the so-called Central Activity Zone. The concept goes back to the late 1950s when the then council insisted that Temporary Office Use permits were just that - temporary. Companies had been permitted to take over houses in Mayfair as wartime headquarters, but the council insisted that they revert back to housing when the TOUs expired, mostly by the late 1980s. In Covent Garden and Soho, the local authority became even more insistent that housing should be an integral part of the mix. The concept has won international praise as a benchmark for urban regeneration. For close on 50 years, therefore, the presumption has always been that all new developments would be a mix of housing, shops, offices and even workshops. Moreover, this applies in every sub-district, including one, like Paddington, designated a Special Policy Area and a preferred location for large-scale offices. What is new in the current Unitary Development Plan is the explicit commitment to owner-occupation and the resistance to converting houses into flats in desirable areas such as Belgravia, Pimlico, Knightsbridge and Bayswater. According to Mike Straw of Richard Ellis's planning department, one question the examiners will be asking is whether this council is as fully committed to affordable housing as to residences for Conservative voters. Developers have a separate objection to the current formulation of the housing policy: its inflexibility. Not all office developments are suitable for incorporating self-contained flats with a separate entrance; the site, the location, the immediate outlook may not recommend themselves to residential occupation. They believe the council should lay down the residential requirement for a neighbourhood and leave them to parcel that in the most convenient way. History suggests they may eventually be heard. In the 1960s, Camden Council had a similar plan which forced Harry Hyams to provide a handful of flats in the penthouse of Centrepoint, his controversial office tower at the junction of Charing Cross Road and Oxford Street. The requirement made a mockery of Camden's housing policy, which was quietly modified. Controversy - but without the overtones of impropriety - also surrounds another aspect of planning for the West End: transport policy. It is a fraught issue everywhere, as central and local government are each responsible for different aspects of it. In central London, matters were made worse by the abolition of the GLC which left no one body with an overview of the region's needs. One example suffices: the Heathrow Express Railway, a joint venture between British Rail and the British Airports Authority, went back and forth to central government during its planning phase with no one to judge whether it was good for London. Instead, different local authorities bickered among themselves: while districts near the airport wanted traffic taken off their roads, Westminster opposed it on the grounds that it would suck in traffic to the proposed terminal at Paddington. Westminster lost. HER is going ahead. Westminster is reduced to trying to limit the inevitable increase in traffic in Paddington by forcing the two giant commercial developments which will feed on the express to reduce the car parking they provide. The transport programme which would have had a really positive effect in driving West End traffic off the roads - CrossRail  -was in central government's gift and now lies gathering dust.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Kharlamov report: "The President Will Control </F> Counterintelligence"]    [Text] At his meeting with journalists yesterday, Sergey  Stepashin described the Russian president's edict abolishing the  Russian Federation Ministry of Security as an "expected  surprise." But in a private conversation with me an acquaintance  of mine, an employee of the abolished ministry, provided a  different description of this edict -- "a taming of shrews."    Who, then, will take the place of the former Ministry of  Security? To all appearances, Russia's Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FCS], directly subordinate to the  president, will now become "the motherland's shield." In  addition to combating foreign special services, it is also  entrusted with functions such as combating terrorism, illegal  arms trafficking, the drug mafia, and armed bandit formations.  Economic and military counterintelligence remains under the FCS  wing.    The investigative apparatus passes to the Russian General  Prosecutor's Office, special subunits pass to the Federal Agency  of Government Communications and Information and the Main  Administration of the President's Guard, while the notorious  "Lefortovo" passes to the jurisdiction of the MVD [Ministry of  Internal Affairs].    The Russian Federation Border Guard Troops have also been  detached and transformed into the independent Federal Border  Service with the rights of a separate ministry.    The staff of the counterintelligence organs has been reduced  -- to 75,000 employees in the provinces and 1,500 in the  management apparatus. In the opinion of Sergey Stepashin, first  deputy director of the FCS, such a reorganization will not  affect the quality of the special services' work. But those who  wish to stay will have to undergo recertification at the  president's request, which will drag on for approximately one  month.    The question of the transfer of the "Alfa" and "Vympel"  subunits to the FCS has not yet been raised, but, bearing in  mind the struggle against terrorism, the counterintelligence  service will still have to acquire its own special-purpose  subunit.    The Main Administration of the President's Guard and the  MVD,  which is increasingly turning into a supermonster like the sadly  memorable GPU-NKVD [State Political Administration-People's  Commissariat for Internal Affairs], will most likely tackle  "internal intelligence" or, roughly speaking, political  surveillance of the opposition and of political parties.    There is another "expected surprise." Yuriy Baturin was  appointed the Russian president's assistant for national  security. He seems to be becoming one of the most influential  figures in Boris Yeltsin's entourage as controller of all the  country's power structures.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Selin Caglayan report: "Ankara Warns European Union on </F> Cyprus"]    [Text] Ankara--While Greece maintains its pressure on the  European Union [EU] to have south Cyprus admitted into that  organization as a member, Ankara has warned the EU countries  that they "will have to accept the consequences of south Cyprus  becoming an EU member and that such a development will mark the  end of the negotiating process in Cyprus."    It has been reported that the messages Ankara has conveyed  to  the EU countries at various levels can be taken to mean that the  TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] will unite with  Turkey if the Greek Cypriot side is admitted into the EU as a  full member. Turkey defends the view that the Greek Cypriot side  becoming an EU member will mean the de facto annexation of south  Cyprus to Greece.    Meanwhile, a number of officials in Turkey have maintained  that several points in UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's report on Cyprus, which has elicited strong  reaction in Turkey, can be justified. A Turkish Foreign  Ministry official has said that the fact that Butrus  Butrus-Ghali has agreed that the Cyprus problem has continued  for 30 years is "a very positive development." The Greek  Cypriots have maintained that the Cyprus problem was created as  a result of Turkey's intervention in the island in 1974.  Furthermore, Ankara has regarded Butrus-Ghali's view that "the  limited UN resources may be used to resolve other disputes" as a  positive suggestion.</p>

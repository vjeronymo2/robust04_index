The results  showed that Na,K-ATPase activity in cerebral tissue was  significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.01) after 60 min ischemia and 80  min reperfusion of the brain. The animals were in comatous and  hypoactive state. Convulsion and seizures occurred occasionally.  After treatment with 101.3 kPa or 253.25 kPa pure oxygen, the  activity of Na,K-ATPase increased to approximately the normal  value (no significant difference between 101.3 and 253.25 kPa).  The results indicated that the mechanism of HBO in treating  cerebral edema in gerbils might be closely related to the  recovery of Na,K-ATPase activity in cerebral tissues.</p>

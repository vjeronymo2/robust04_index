			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / International Company News: AGF profits show little change ASSURANCES Generales de France (AGF), the French insurance group which has run into controversy over its investment in Aachener &amp; Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB) of Germany, reported profits of FFr2.69bn (Dollars 477m) for 1991, little changed from the FFr2.7bn of 1990. AGF is the latest in a line of French insurance groups to announce lacklustre results for 1991. Axa, the largest private sector insurer, disclosed a 28 per cent drop in profits to FFr2.4bn on Wednesday. Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) which is, like AGF, a state-controlled concern, reported an 11 per cent fall to FFr3.77bn on Thursday. The French insurers have been hit by intense competition within their own domestic market and by the poor performance of some of their international operations, particularly in the UK and Italy, where AGF is present. AGF saw revenue rise by 20 per cent from FFr46bn to FFr55.3bn in 1991. The rate of sales growth was slightly lower, at 9.7 per cent, on a comparable basis. It made nearly 40 per cent of its sales outside France where it reported a good performance from its businesses in Spain, Switzerland and Germany. The group saw earnings per share fall from FFr51.13 to FFr48.34 last year. The board proposed an unchanged dividend of FFr13.70 a share.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Imre Szekeres, executive chairman of the </F> Hungarian Socialist Party, by Pal Szombathy; place and date not  given: "Today Is a Decisive Day for the Coalition"]    [Text] No one has won and no one has been defeated. With  the guarantee agreement, we have drawn up a solution that allows  us to make joint decisions, to govern jointly, and to share  responsibility, Imre Szekeres said among other things.    [Szombathy] At the coalition talks on 20 June, agreements  were reached that were characterized by both sides as progress.  What are your views on these coalition agreements?    [Szekeres] In my view, the agreement on the governmental  structure is a conditional agreement. Some questions on the  governmental positions and structure have remained open, and it  depends on these questions whether the agreement of 20 June will  remain in force. We have achieved agreements on certain points  but the final agreement can only be interpreted within the  complete package. The open issues will be decided at the  meeting on 22 June. We suggest that we agree on the members of  the new government, their tasks, and what kind of ministries we  will have, and we should also settle the issue of national  authorities, bodies, and offices. In my view, the governmental  structure and the issue of positions is the less important,  organizational side of the whole coalition agreement. The  government program itself is much more important and it will be  discussed today for the first time. I think it is a mistake  that the government program has not been at the forefront of  talks up to now. Society is more interested in the government's  goals and ideas than in the bargaining mechanism of the  partners. Therefore, the essence of the coalition talks will  come on the agenda on 22 June, in other words, this is the  decisive day in my view.    [Szombathy] The full government structure was revealed on 20  June. What else can be open issues?    [Szekeres] Although we have only left two or three points  open, the whole agreement will only be valid when these are also  settled. The fate and operation of the offices dealing with the  country's internal security have not yet been clarified. We  have not yet decided, either, what role the county-level  governments should have in the regional governmental structure,  which is another important issue of power sharing. These issues  have a serious effect on the agreement on the Interior  Ministry's operation.    [Szombathy] Observers appreciated the SZDSZ's success in the  guarantee agreement and that the MSZP gained positions in the  government structure. What is your view on this agreement?    [Szekeres] I do not agree with either statements because the  observers were not able to look into the process of  negotiations. No one has won and no one has been defeated. With  the guarantee agreement, we formed a solution on the basis of  which we will make joint decisions, govern jointly, and share  responsibility. Other models would also have been possible, but  we decided on this one. We have lifted the coalition  coordination council out of the governmental structure because  it does not legally fit into the government's work. Time will  tell whether this model of operation is correct. No one has won  in the allocation of governmental positions, either, because it  is obvious that the various ministries have different effect on  the country's life. The distribution of positions is not a  purely quantitative, mathematical issue. The SZDSZ has acquired  reasonable positions in areas that have significant influence on  the country's life. However, the obligation of coordination  also applies to the SZDSZ's ministries.    [Szombathy] Yesterday, both the SZDSZ and the MSZP were  preparing for the talks on 22 June. What did the Socialist  delegation agree on?    [Szekeres] We reviewed the materials of the special  committees and tried to harmonize the differences. I met the  MSZP's county chairmen and we drew up the schedule to follow the  completion of the coalition agreement. On 24 June, we will look  at the coalition agreement at the meeting of the national board  of directors, and a proposal will be made on the parliamentary  group's leadership. At the 25 June meeting of the national  committee, the parliamentary group will also express its  preliminary opinion on the agreement. We will choose the  parliamentary group's leadership and delegate members to the  parliamentary committees at this meeting. We will hold a  ratifying congress on 26 June.    [Szombathy] Can debates be expected on the coalition  agreement?    [Szekeres] I expect a clarifying congress, and we will  definitely have debates. The only question that we can ask is  whether the congress will accept or reject the agreement. In  the MSZP and among our electors, many people have been  expressing their reservations regarding the coalition agreement.  The worries can be dispelled when they learn about the details  of the talks.    [Szombathy] Your name has also been mentioned as  parliamentary group leader for the MSZP. If you are elected,  would you resign as executive chairman?    [Szekeres] No. If I am nominated to head the parliamentary  group then I will occupy both positions until our congress in  October. We wish to renew the party's entire leadership in  October but, until then, we have to concentrate the  parliamentary and party forces and tasks.</p>

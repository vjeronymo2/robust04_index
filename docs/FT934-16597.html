			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: SAS directors reaffirm support for Alcazar project THE directors of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) were forced yesterday to reaffirm their support for the Alcazar project to combine forces with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines following media reports in Scandinavia alleging opposition to the alliance at the highest levels in SAS. SAS said the Alcazar negotiating team, led by Mr Jan Carlzon, who resigned as SAS president and chief executive last week, had the full support of the board and new management. 'SAS's position in favour of Alcazar is unchanged. The organisation changes made by SAS last week combine the purpose of completing the Alcazar negotiations in a manner satisfactory to SAS and the purpose of improving SAS's profitability,' SAS said. Newspaper reports in Denmark, Norway and Sweden have suggested Mr Carlzon was pushed out because of SAS's poor financial condition and scepticism over the viability of the Alcazar project. They have alleged splits between the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish camps within the three-cornered airline. Specifically, they alleged that Mr Tage Andersen, the Danish chairman of SAS, had been at odds over Alcazar for some time with Mr Carlzon, a Swede and one of its most enthusiastic proponents. SAS blames the reports on mischievous attempts to exploit tensions between the different nationalities within the airline.</p>

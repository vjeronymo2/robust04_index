			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Moscow, April 20 (AFP) -- President Boris  Yeltsin chaired Wednesday a meeting of his top advisers in the  Russian Security Council expected to focus on the Bosnian  conflict. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, the Russian newspaper SEGODNYA reported Wednesday  that Moscow had decided to recall its ambassador to Belgrade  Gennadiy Shikin for consultations, heralding a possible severing  of relations with the rump Yugoslavia.    The paper, quoting a reliable source at the Russian Foreign  Ministry, said that Moscow "no longer believes in the  possibility of an adequate political dialogue with the Bosnian  Serbs.    "The theories according to which (Bosnian Serb leader)  Radovan Karadzic no longer controls his troops are false. It is  obvious that there is a deliberate intention (on the part of the  Serbs) to prevent any constructive dialogue between the warring  sides," the paper said.    The Foreign Ministry would neither confirm nor deny the  SEGODNYA report. [passage omitted]</p>

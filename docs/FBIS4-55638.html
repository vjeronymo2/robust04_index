			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 16 (CTK) -- Matica Slovenska [Slovak  Heritage Foundation] considers disturbing the efforts of the  present government coalition to meet ethnic minority claims and  adhere to Slovakia's commitments to the Council of Europe (CE)  by changing the language law and the law on the country's  administrative and territorial set-up, and adopting a new law on  registers of births and deaths, Matica representatives declared  today. Matica Slovenska is a cultural and educational  organisation founded in 1863.    Matica's secretary, Stanislav Bajanik, said that mainly the  government bill to provide for bilingual names of almost 600  towns in Slovakia's regions with mixed population, which is soon  to be presented to parliament, "threatens state sovereignty and  recalls the Horthyan occupation" (Hungary, ruled by regent  Miklos Horthy, occupied a considerable part of Slovakia's  south-eastern territory in winter 1938-39).    Bajanik said he insisted on minority claims to be solved  only  after the autumn elections, otherwise they could be subject to  pre-election machinations. According to Bajanik, the names of  the almost one-fifth of Slovak towns to have multilingual names  should be decided in a referendum.    Matica is resolutely opposed to the re-naming of the towns  carrying the names of significant figures of Slovak history and  culture. "Nor does it want that originally Slovak towns and  villages, which were Magyarised over the past century, bear  Hungarian names," he stressed.    Matica urges parliament to adopt a law which would enable  the  minorities to use only the towns' Slovak names transcribed into  their mother tongue, and only in the communities where  non-Slovak population form a simple majority. Matica also  demands that all official documents be consistently written in  Slovak, which is the "state language".    The Slovak Government has already approved amendments to  relevant laws providing for bilingual names of towns and  villages in the regions where the ethnic minority forms more  than one-fifth of the population, in line with minority claims  and Slovakia's commitments to the CE. The government has also  approved the bill enabling ethnic minority members to use  Christian names and surnames in their original form, and the  free of charge official change of these names from their Slovak  version.    The two legislative changes, now to be discussed by  parliament, rank among Slovakia's most important commitments to  the CE undertaken before the country was admitted to the Council  last June. Their fulfillment is to be evaluated by the CE  Secretariat in Warsaw on May 17.</p>

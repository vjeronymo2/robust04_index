			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / BTR to appeal against Brussels competition fine BTR, the British industrial conglomerate, is to appeal against the European Commission's decision yesterday to impose an Ecu5m (Pounds 3.55m) fine on its subsidiary, Dunlop Slazenger International, for hampering competitive exports of its tennis and squash balls. Mr Stanley Williams, BTR's company secretary, admitted yesterday there had been a 'technical breach' of EC competition rules, because Dunlop Slazenger had at one point asked a British wholesaler not to export its tennis balls to continental Europe. But he added: 'We believe that the size of the fine we have been given today is out of proportion with what has happened.' He said BTR's lawyers would be examining the Commission decision to check that proper procedure had been followed. The Court of First Instance, the EC's lower judicial body, recently quashed a Commission fine on the grounds that short-cuts had been taken by Brussels, but an official said yesterday that the Commission had scrupulously observed its rules in this case. The Commission has punished Dunlop Slazenger for restricting exports to protect its sole distributors in other EC countries. BTR argues that the Brussels competition authorities have misunderstood the market. Mr Williams added that BTR only took over Dunlop Slazenger in 1985, and therefore could not be held wholly responsible for restrictive practices which began in 1977 and ended 10 years later. A Commission official said: 'If you buy a company, you buy it with all its (legal) liabilities.' The Commission also imposed a fine of Ecu150,000 on Dunlop Slazenger's distributor in the Benelux countries, All Weather Sports, for collaborating with the British group in restricting other exports. The Dutch builders' federation, facing a Commission fine for operating an illegal contract cartel, repeated its intention to maintain the system until the European Court decides whether the Brussels decision should be suspended. The Commission said on Tuesday that it could impose penalty payments if the cartel was not stopped immediately.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Markets Report: Pound falls on profit taking Surprise news last Tuesday that base rates in the UK were finally coming down after 10 months had the surprising effect of boosting sterling writes Peter John. The pound rose sharply against the D-Mark as investors who had already hedged their positions against lower rates responded positively to the possible boost to growth rather than the direct impact of lower interest rates on the currency. However, by Friday, the gains were looking overdone and the pound finally succumbed to profit-taking to close at DM2.5325. The dollar continued to move in a tight range against the D - Mark of between DM1.68 and DM1.72 but dealers said it was persistently showing 'upside pressure'. Much depends on key non-farm payroll data for November due on Friday. The jobs figures are considered to be the most important pointer to US economic trends and economists are looking for a rise over the month of up to 200,000 jobs. A higher figure could see the US currency heading for DM1.74.</p>

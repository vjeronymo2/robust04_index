			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Pounds 9.4m aid to halt Jaguar move abroad The government is to pay Pounds 9.4m in grant aid to Jaguar, the luxury car subsidiary of Ford, to deter the US carmaker from moving the assembly of the next generation Jaguar XJS sports car from the UK to Portugal. The European Commission, which approved the aid yesterday, said that 883 jobs would be safeguarded at Jaguar by 1998 through the granting of regional selective assistance. Jaguar will also receive up to Pounds 1.8m in assistance in kind for training from the local authorities in Coventry and Birmingham. It is understood that Ford, which acquired Jaguar in late 1989, had closely considered transferring the Pounds 187m sports car project to its plant at Azambuja, close to Lisbon, where it assembles the Transit van. The Portuguese authorities had bidded for the project with an attractive rival aid package. Jaguar is due to begin production of the car, code-named X100, in 1996. It will replace the ageing XJS grand tourer coupe and convertible range, which was launched in 1975. The commission said that Jaguar planned to invest Pounds 187m in the X100 project during the four years from 1993 to 1997. Jaguar intends to install a new low-cost, low-volume production facility in its plant at Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, where the body for the new range will be welded and painted. The project will mark a new stage in the integration of Jaguar into the Ford production network. The body panels for the X100 will be stamped at Ford's plant at Halewood, Merseyside, while a new range of V8 engines, code-named AJ26, will be produced at Ford's engine plant at Bridgend in south Wales. Jaguar is investing about Pounds 100m in the new engine range, which will be launched first in the X100. The commission said yesterday: 'Given that the new project requires the replacement of the old body and car assembly line of the XJS, the company has actively examined various alternative locations for this project.' It is understood that Ford also looked initially at possible locations in the US, but the aid package made Portugal the main rival to continuing assembly in the UK. The grant will be paid in instalments from this year until 1997 and there is a provision for withholding or clawing back aid if there is 'under-achievement' in safeguarding employment. The first stage in the renewal of Jaguar's range will be reached this summer, when it begins production of the new generation XJ6, code-named X300, in which it is investing about Pounds 150m.</p>

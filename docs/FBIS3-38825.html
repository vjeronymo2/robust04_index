The task, if carried out, will fall on NATO, which  is to discuss air strikes at Wednesday's [9 February] meeting.  Antonio Esteves Martins reports from Brussels.    [Martins] Following five hours of difficult discussions, the  EU's only demand was an end to the siege on Sarajevo. The  twelve foreign ministers, who do not rule out air strikes  against Serb positions besieging Sarajevo, have left the final  decision to the extraordinary meeting of the North Atlantic  Council. This decision hardly hides the difficulties and the  difference of opinion between the French, who advocate air  strikes, and the British who oppose any type of military action.    [Begin recording] [Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao  Barroso]  The objective cannot be merely revenge, or punishment. It is a  show of force resulting from our indignation at what appeared to  us to be a highly condemnable act of violence. It is within  this context that a decision will have to be taken in close  consultation with our allies and bearing in mind, above all, the  opinion of those who have soldiers and considerable forces on  the ground. [end recording]    [Martins] In other words, an ultimatum was not issued today  as the French wanted, but the use of force was not ruled out.  Therefore, the message emerging from here could be seen by the  Bosnian Serbs as a sign of weakness.    [Begin recording] [Barroso] We are conscious that this  position may appear in some way condescending, but I should  recall that we have always said that this conflict was not an  easy one, and when a problem is not easy then there are no easy  solutions either. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Ford in sales call to Toyota Toyota, Japan's largest carmaker, has been asked by Ford to sell the US car group's vehicles in Japan. writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. Mr Shigeji Tsuji, Toyota's managing director, said that Ford's Japanese unit had approached Toyota and opened talks with Toyota sales affiliates in the Tokyo area. Toyota's decision last year to sell 20,000 General Motors cars annually through its Japanese dealerships, from 1996, marked an important stage in the car industry's attempts to defuse US criticism that Japan was closed to imports.</p>

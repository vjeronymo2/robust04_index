			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FOR THE BIRDS  </P> <P> Walt Disney World is facing charges involving the abuse and killing of wild  birds, the Orlando Sentinel reported Sunday.  </P> <P> Investigators said workers at the Florida theme park's Discovery Island fired a  rifle at hawks, beat vultures to death with a stick and destroyed the nests and  eggs of egrets and ibises. The workers said the supervisor at the 11-acre  zoological park sanctioned the alleged abuses.  </P> <P> The two-month investigation has resulted in 16 state and federal charges  against Disney and five employees, most involving the deaths of vultures  crammed into a tiny, overheated shed for days with limited food and water.  </P> <P> Disney had no comment Sunday on the report.

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Alleged illegal payments to players by former Coach Bud Middaugh, perhaps as  much as $70,000 over a period of years, could result in the University of  Michigan's baseball program being placed on three years probation and other Big  Ten Conference sanctions.  </P> <P> Money from the sale of football programs was allegedly used to pay players,  some in the form of improper scholarship aid. The money should have gone  instead into athletic department coffers.  </P> <P> It would be the first blemish of any kind on any Michigan athletic team in the  university's history. Middaugh was 465-146-1 at Michigan with six Big Ten  championships and four College World Series berths.  </P></p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Russia draws up legislation to regulate monopoly industries The Russian government is preparing radical legislation to regulate monopoly industries, such as energy and utilities, which threaten to distort the country's fragile economy. The law will aim to protect the consumer, counteract inflationary pressures, and help ease the inter-enterprise debts crisis. The draft law, which will be introduced to parliament this autumn, envisages the creation of several powerful independent regulatory agencies to police the natural monopolies - defined as 'commodity markets in which demand is effectively satisfied in the absence of any competition'. The draft law covers oil and gas pipelines, the production and transmission of electricity, rail and air transport, and public utilities, such as telecommunications. Officials worry that monopoly abuses in these 'commanding heights' could damage the development of the broader economy. The fear is that such monopolies can stifle the emergence of effective competition and push through price rises fuelling inflation and worsening inter-enterprise debts. The mass privatisation programme, which has transferred 85 per cent of the country's enterprises into private ownership, has concentrated enormous economic power in the hands of a few industrial managers but has not yet stimulated sufficient competition to check their ambitions. The federal agencies would have considerable powers to devise and implement suitable regulatory frameworks for each targeted sector and would report to the government every year. They would be responsible for supervising all transactions affecting a natural monopoly's position in the marketplace and any share purchases in other enterprises. They would also scrutinise big capital investment projects and any sales or transfers of assets. Under the proposed legislation, the regulators would have unrestricted access to information affecting the natural monopolies and would have considerable powers of enforcement. They could reverse any act deemed to be illegal and could impose fines or penalties on companies infringing the law. The agencies will contain up to seven members who are specialists in the appropriate field. The head of a federal agency would be appointed for a three-year term by the president on the government's recommendation. They would take over responsibility for regulating the natural monopolies from various ministries. The development of such a potentially stiff regulatory regime is bound to spark a heated debate. Some economists - and more self-interested industrial managers - have argued that monopoly powers are essential in the early stages of capitalist development to ensure companies can amass sufficient profits to reinvest in big infrastructure projects. But one western economist welcomed the principle of stricter regulation and a more effective competition policy. 'In countries which are trying to shed a tradition of collusive behaviour it is particularly important to take steps to change the ground rules and create a real framework for competition rather than collusion,' the economist said. 'But it will be critical to see how quickly and how well they can follow through with it, given a lot of interested parties will be opposed to arms-length regulation.'</p>

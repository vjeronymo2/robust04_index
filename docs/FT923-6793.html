			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: VIAG sales and profits growth slow sharply PROFIT and sales growth at VIAG, the energy-based German conglomerate, slowed sharply in the first six months of this year. Net profits rose 2 per cent to DM193m (Dollars 130.40m) on sales up only 3.4 per cent at DM12.1bn. The rise in turnover was due in part to the effects of acquisitions, the company said in an interim report published yesterday. The company was cautious about the prospects for the rest of the year and said that the full year's profits should increase provided weaknesses in domestic markets did not worsen and international markets showed clear signs of recovery. VIAG's sluggish progress underlines the delicate condition of most German companies although it is not as dramatic as the 89 per cent profits slump reported earlier this week by the Mannesmann engineering group, The group, which in June suggested a further increase in the dividend was possible this year, made no mention of pay-out prospects yesterday. The dividend for 1991, when profits rose 20 per cent, was raised 50 pfennigs to DM9 - the eighth consecutive increase. With more than half its earnings coming from energy generation and distribution, the group is protected to some extent from the slump in foreign and export markets which have hit pure manufacturing companies so hard this year. However, it is understood to be experiencing difficulties in aluminium, which accounts for 23 per cent of sales. Net profits at Flachglas, the Gelsenkirchen glass maker controlled by Britain's Pilkington group, fell by almost a third in the year to the end of March. Earnings of DM66 compared with DM97m last time on sales up 3.3 per cent at DM2bn, the company said yesterday. Flachglas reduced its workforce by 1,000 people to 11,000.</p>

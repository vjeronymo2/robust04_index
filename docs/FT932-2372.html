			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Attali proposes EBRD shake-up MR Jacques Attali, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is proposing to create three new senior posts at the bank and radically change the functions of a fourth, in a far-reaching management reorganisation. His most radical proposal, contained in a paper submitted to the bank's board this week, is that the development and merchant banking departments should be merged and then split into three 'operations departments', covering north central Europe, south central Europe and the former Soviet Union. It would be supported by an operations services group which would deal with co-operation funds and technical co-operation, co-financing, loan syndication, education and training and the environmental appraisal group. Each operations department would report to a new senior vice-president, who would also have the title of chief operating officer. On Monday Mr Attali told the 23 directors representing the 54 countries and agencies which own the bank that Mr Ernest Stern, the World Bank's number two, had 'agreed in principle' to be chief operating officer. The board is deeply divided on whether to press ahead with the reorganisation, and how quickly to do so. Some directors are concerned that Mr Attali and board representatives from France, Germany and the UK want to pre-empt a debate about whether Mr Attali should remain president. Under Mr Attali's plan, one of the new operations departments would cover north central Europe, with responsibility for Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. A south central Europe department would cover Hungary, Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, Croatia and Slovenia. The third department would deal with Russia, Armenia, Georgia and the six central Asian republics. Mr Attali said the streamlining would have a number of benefits: It would eliminate some duplication of activities between the current merchant banking and development banking departments. It would help the bank 'identify and ..respond to clients' priorities by creating a clear interface with private enterprises, government and public enterprises'. It would 'ensure a more balanced allocation of effort and staffing resources among countries'. At present the EBRD's merchant banking arm concentrates on financing private sector projects, while the development banking department deals with improving the infrastructure of central and eastern Europe. However, a review recently commissioned by Mr Attali complained that there was overlap between the two departments and that too little attention was paid to the needs of each country in EBRD assessments of projects. Mr Attali also wants to create a second senior vice-presidency in charge of the budget process, personnel and administration. This would probably be filled by Mr Mario Sarcinelli, vice-president in charge of development banking. The vice-president in charge of finance, Mr Anders Ljungh, would thus lose responsibility for the budget and policy planning activities but retain the treasury, credit and financial control functions. Mr Attali also wants to create a new vice-presidency for external and economic relations in an attempt to 'improve the bank's image and create a favourable and supportive climate of political and public opinion'. Mr Stern was asked whether he would become EBRD chief operating officer by the senior finance officials from the G7 leading industrial countries. The directors representing the European members of the G7, France, Germany and the UK, argued on Monday that the reorganisation should be pushed through as quickly as possible. However, most other directors resent what they see as the G7's high-handed intervention. They believe any decision should be delayed until after July 15, when the bank's audit committee reports to the board on charges that the bank failed to control expenditure on furnishing its London headquarters and other items. Many directors are concerned the EBRD will evolve into the European arm of the World Bank. They believe it is losing its unique identity of sponsoring private sector development in the former Soviet bloc. They say the reorganisation is a general policy decision needing two-thirds approval by shareholders. The G7 countries control 54 per cent of the shares.</p>

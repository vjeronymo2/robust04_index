			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the February 26, 1993 proposal, EPA clarified its definition of WIP as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;projects under construction in 1990 and projects which were contracted for and which will be completed in time for the refiner to comply with the regulatory requirement&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 76 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 76 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> From &sect;80.91(d)(5) of the February 1993 proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This language was included to ensure that the WIP was completed in a timely manner, since the WIP was ostensibly being done to comply with a regulatory requirement. Less than timely completion would indicate that the regulatory requirement was not a driving factor in initiating the WIP. However, EPA is not promulgating such a completion requirement because if the WIP project was not completed in a timely manner, the refiner is likely to be losing money since it cannot produce a certain fuel or meet certain emission requirements, etc. The contractual requirement discussed below will ensure that the refiner was committed to the WIP project. Additionally, EPA is specifying that an adjustment will only be allowed for WIP projects involving installation or modification of one or more gasoline blendstock- or distillate-producing units in the refinery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated, EPA also proposed (and is promulgating) that WIP shall include projects under construction in 1990 and projects for which contracts were signed prior to or in 1990 such that the refiner was financially committed to permanently changing refinery operations. Clarification was requested as to what types of contracts would be considered to have committed the refiner to the WIP. EPA believes that the contracts should have committed the refiner to purchasing materials and construction of the WIP. As such, a process engineering design contract does not commit the refiner to actually implementing the WIP and would not be considered a WIP contract under this provision. Other suggestions included allowing WIP adjustments for work not necessarily associated with a regulatory requirement, including WIP which would have a beneficial effect on a refinery's overall environmental performance. Again, WIP adjustments were intended to apply only to specific situations, i.e., those relatively costly projects undertaken for mandated environmental betterment. Thus, it would not be appropriate to expand the criteria (as suggested) for qualifying for a WIP adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 26, 1993, EPA proposed allowing either the ``10 percent'' criteria from the April 16, 1992 proposal or a $10 million minimum cost of the WIP to satisfy the capital-at-risk criteria. Some commenters suggested that the requirements be more stringent_one suggested a threshold value of $50 million. Others suggested reducing the threshold value to $5 million (possibly a more appropriate value for small refiners) or 5 percent, or eliminating any ``dollar'' amount because no one should be penalized because its investment fails to meet arbitrary time or cost criteria. EPA believes that such criteria must be specified in order to prevent a proliferation of adjustments for other than true hardship cases. Additionally, the proposed criteria are fairly stringent requirements, and more stringent requirements could threaten the viability of some refiners. EPA could have relaxed the criteria, i.e., set a lower dollar amount. However, as stated, the WIP provision was included to provide relief for those projects that would significantly financially impact the refiner, and not for inconsequential modifications. Thus either the ``10 percent'' criteria or the $10 million criteria will be allowed to satisfy this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many comments and suggested language were received concerning EPA's February 26, 1993 proposal that a WIP adjustment would simultaneously cap a refiner's anti-dumping emissions and sulfur, T90 and olefin values at five (5) percent over the corresponding statutory baseline values. Most commenters opposed such simultaneous caps. EPA also proposed that a refiner whose WIP-adjusted baseline emissions exceeded 105 percent of anti-dumping statutory baseline emissions did not have to reduce its emissions further (to 105 percent of the anti-dumping statutory baseline) if its WIP-adjusted baseline emissions were less than its pre-WIP baseline emissions. EPA believes though that some limit on the adjustment must be included to minimize environmental harm. The limit must apply to all who are allowed a WIP adjustment. Thus, EPA is limiting WIP increases in baseline exhaust benzene, exhaust toxics and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions and sulfur, olefins and T90 values to the larger of (1) the unadjusted individual baseline value of each emission or fuel parameter or (2) 105 percent of the corresponding anti-dumping statutory baseline value. Note that sulfur, olefins and T90 are only constrained when compliance is determined using the simple model. When compliance is determined using the complex model, the WIP-adjusted values of these three fuel parameters are not subject to the caps. Given EPA's discretion in even granting WIP adjustments, EPA believes this provision provides an acceptable balance between allowing WIP adjustments and ensuring that increases in emissions over 1990 levels are minimized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

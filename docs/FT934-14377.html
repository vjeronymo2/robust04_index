			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Books: Savage appeal - The life of the dissolute 18th century poet DR JOHNSON AND MR SAVAGE by Richard Holmes Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 19.99, 260 pages THE LAST we heard of Richard Holmes was that he was engaged on a massive life of Coleridge. The first volume - Coleridge: Early Visions - appeared a couple of years ago to a bevy of appreciative reviews including the one in this newspaper by the present reviewer. Having got Coleridge poised in mid-career, Holmes seems to have temporarily deserted him to take a little holiday. Holmes's idea of a holiday being to write a book, a shorter book that required much less research - and the result is Dr Johnson &amp; Mr Savage. One might be tempted to call it a quickie, but like everything Holmes does, it is carefully written and argued. The material mainly comes from printed sources, the chief being Dr Johnson's Life of Richard Savage. In popular editions of Johnson's Lives of the Poets, such as the Worlds Classics, this Life appears as one among many. The bulk of them were written on commission by Johnson when he was famous as prefaces for an edition of the English poets' works in several volumes. But the Life of Savage was written and published more than 30 years earlier than the others, in 1744. Johnson wrote it the year after Savage died - at the behest of Edward Cave, the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine, the journal that printed work by both Johnson and Savage. It was in Cave's office above the medieval arch at St John's Gate in Clerkenwell (still there) that Johnson and Savage probably met. Johnson was then an obscure young man of letters recently married; Savage at 41 an established poet, capable at short notice of turning out ringing panegyrics in rhyming couplets on anything under the sun. A bond of friendship soon formed. Both were penniless. They were so poor that they would spend the night pacing the streets of London in animated literary discussion until dawn. Savage also had more disreputable friends with whom he would go pub-crawling. On one of his late-night visits to a tavern in the their company, Savage became involved in a brawl in which a man was killed during a sword-fight. Johnson was not present but gives an account of this in the Life. Savage was subsequently tried at the Old Bailey and convicted of murder. It was only after a vigorous campaign by his friends in high places that a royal pardon was obtained. And it was after his release from prison that Savage's career really took off with poems like 'The Bastard' - Savage claimed he was the illegitimate son of the Countess of Macclesfield - and 'The Wanderer', enshrining his basic fantasies about himself. Then after a period of glory his life took a turn for the worse again and he died disgraced. Savage was one of those impossible people who possess enormous, irresistible charm until they become completely stoned when they turn into colossally aggressive bores. He emerges in Holmes's account as a singular instance of the Poet as both Charmer and Sponger, a kind of 18th century Dylan Thomas. And Holmes reveals how thoroughly the young Johnson surrendered to Savage's appeal. Disappointed at not being made poet laureate by George II, Savage appointed himself what he called 'Volunteer Laureat' to Queen Caroline and wrote an annual poem in her honour - a splendid example of Savage's chutzpah, in reward for which the Queen, who had a weakness for poets and flattery, granted him an annual sum. But on her death this was discontinued, and Savage was on his uppers again. A group of well-wishers and poets led by Pope, generous in his private dealings, banded together to make up the deficit on condition Savage left London for good and took up residence in rural Wales where - they vainly hoped - he would keep out of mischief. Exhibit B in Holmes's exhumation of the relations between Johnson and Savage is Johnson's 'London: A Poem' (printed by Cave in 1738, the poem with which Johnson first began to make a name for himself among the literati). In it the poet laments the departure of a friend - one Thales - from London to Wales: 'Tho' Grief and Fondness in my Breast rebel/ When injur'd Thales bids the Town farewell . . .' Much scholarly ink has been expended on the question of whether the hero of the poem may be interpreted as being Savage. Holmes thinks he is and he sees the poem as the forerunner of the Life of Savage. But in his Life of Johnson, Boswell denied that Savage was Thales. The Boswellians point to the poem's Latin original - the Third Satire of Juvenal. The original contains a figure called Umbricius who leaves Rome in disgust at its mores to reside in the country and Thales, they say, is merely a fictitious equivalent. Holmes sees this as an attempt by the Boswellians to cover up Johnson's early friendship with the scapegrace bard. Johnson had studiously not revealed that he was the indigent nocturnal friend in his Life of Savage. It was a youthful episode now best forgotten, incompatible with Johnson as the stern moralist, the judgmental father-figure. John Wain endorses the lasting influence of Savage on the young Johnson, in his biography of Johnson, but says he 'cannot see that 'London' would have been any different if Johnson had never met Savage'. Holmes does us a double-service - firstly by reviving interest in the raffish yet attractive figure of Savage who died in 1743 in Bristol's Newgate jail; and secondly in positing a rather different, a more radical and bohemian Dr Johnson, to complement the traditional figure of the Great Tory Cham. But in his final claim that Johnson's Life of Savage also makes him the founding father of the modern literary biographer, Holmes presses his case a little too far. Unlike those contemporary biographers who are able to set aside years of their lives to complete their tasks, accumulating overwhelming detail, Johnson was a literary journalist working severly against the clock. He relied heavily on the 18th century tradition of anecdotes and is on record as saying: 'I wrote forty-eight of the printed octavo pages of the Life of Savage at a sitting; but then I sat up all night'. With respect - the correct lineage is not Johnson, Holroyd, Holmes, Glendinning; but Johnson, Sainte-Beuve, Strachey, Nicolson, Connolly.</p>

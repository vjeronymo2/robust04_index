			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF:  </P> <P> ** 1/2 Mary-Chapin Carpenter, "Shooting Straight in the Dark," Columbia.  Carpenter's third album harks back a bit to the lengthy, finely detailed  character studies of her debut while retaining the greater pop accessibility  that made her second such a leap forward, commercially and artistically.  </P> <P> Too often she limits herself to straight reportage in her missives from the  battlefields of love and life; you wish she'd delve more into analysis and  commentary. But at least you always get the sense there's a lively, probing  mind at work. Carpenter is interviewed on Page 67. RANDY LEWIS  </P></p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Chrysler follows the trend with Dollars 598m loss CHRYSLER, the financially stretched US motor manufacturer, yesterday continued the American industry's dismal set of first-quarter results by announcing a net loss of Dollars 598m. Mr Lee Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, said bluntly: 'The quarter was abysmal. Industry volume simply collapsed and, as a result, we suffered our worst car and truck retail sales since the first quarter of 1983.' The US industry has been hit by a sharp downturn in consumer demand, due to the Gulf war and recession, at a time when it was already suffering from overcapacity. On Tuesday, General Motors announced a first-quarter loss of Dollars 1.17bn, excluding special items, and Ford reported losses of Dollars 884m. Chrysler, the smallest of Detroit's Big Three, is financially most vulnerable to the downturn. It requires heavy capital expenditure over the next two years to introduce a new range of cars which are needed to bolster its market share. The loss, representing Dollars 2.66 a share, compared with net income of Dollars 71m, or 32 cents a share, in the same period last year. The loss was Dollars 341m when the company excluded a one-time charge for a change in accounting methods, but this lower figure was also affected by special factors - on the negative side, Dollars 199m of costs for cuts in the company's salaried workforce, and on the positive side a Dollars 242m after-tax credit for a reduction in costs associated with its acquisition of American Motors in 1987. Revenues dropped from Dollars 7.63bn to Dollars 5.8bn. Mr Iacocca said retail buyers had simply dropped out of the market during the quarter and the company was forced to take on rental business which required very expensive marketing incentives. Chrysler's assembly plants ran at less than half capacity during the quarter, and it built 115,600 fewer units during the period than in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>

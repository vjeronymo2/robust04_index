			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Brazilian oil group to explore in Cuba PETROBRAS, the Brazilian state oil monopoly, is to sign a contract next week to begin exploration in Cuba. Mr Ernesto Weber, the company's president, said yesterday the decision was part of a new policy to increase its international operations, resulting from this month's government reshuffle. According to Mr Weber the company's aim was no longer to be self-sufficient in oil but to produce at competitive cost. 'Investments should be made in terms of return and we will import or explore overseas rather than produce domestically at high cost.' The company was maintaining its heavy investment programme of Dollars 15.8bn over the next four years, with the aim of lifting production from 600,000 to 1m barrels per day mainly through deep sea drilling, he said. Brazil's consumption is 1.15m barrels per day. Petrobras, one of the largest companies in Latin America with revenues last year of Dollars 13bn, is under police investigation over an alleged network of manipulation of awarding contracts and misuse of the company's pension fund. The Brazilian Congress is due to vote this year on a constitutional amendment to end the state monopoly over production and exploration.</p>

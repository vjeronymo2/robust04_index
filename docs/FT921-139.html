			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Bolivar slide hits Interalumina INTERALUMINA, Venezuela's sole producer of alumina - aluminium oxide - reported net earnings of USDollars 22m for 1991 on sales of Dollars 319.2m. In terms of Venezuelan currency, the company - owned by the Venezuelan government as majority partner and Alusuisse - had higher sales and profits figures in 1991 than the previous year. But, due to a 23 per cent decline last year in the value of the Venezuelan bolivar against the US dollar, Interalumina's financial performance was down slightly from 1990 in dollar terms. The net profit in 1990 was Dollars 22.8m, while sales revenues were Dollars 319.9m. Interalumina recently completed a Dollars 200m expansion that raised alumina capacity to 2m tonnes per year from 1.3m. The government is studying a new production line that would increase capacity to 3m tonnes. Interalumina last year produced around 1.5m tonnes of alumina and exported 10 per cent of the total.</p>

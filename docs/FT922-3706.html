			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Foreign Affairs: The benefit of the doubt - Mexico has many of the features of a one-party state, but Salinas remains its only credible leader One cannot always be in the right place at the right time. Last Tuesday, while the Danish voters were joyfully consigning their free copies of the Treaty of Maastricht to the shredder, I was in Mexico, forming part of the comitiva (entourage) of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, on a visit to the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas. Why Mexico? I had gone there, as readers of last week's Foreign Affairs may remember, at the invitation of the InterAction Council, the little-known trade union for retired heads of government. Having got there, I was keen to meet the president, having heard his policies praised as the model Latin American success story during my pre-Earth Summit excursion to Brazil. In Brazil, as it struggles with chronic stagflation, they speak of Mexico with envy, even grudging respect. Mexico was where the great debt crisis started in 1982, but today it is clearly under control. While I was there, the finance minister was able to announce that he had reduced Mexico's public debt to 38 per cent of the gross domestic product: a lower proportion than in the largest industrial countries. Inflation is in the middle teens (less than Brazil's monthly rate) and falling; privatisation and deregulation are well advanced; foreign investment is pouring in; negotiations for a free trade area with the US and Canada are almost complete; and growth has resumed - although critics are quick to point out that in per capita terms it is little more than 1 per cent. President Salinas is proud of the fact that population growth has fallen to 1.9 per cent per year. But even at that rate Mexico has to run very fast to stand still. The population has more than tripled in 40 years, and here, as throughout the Third World, the increase takes the visible form of improvised shanty towns wherever there was vacant land in or close to the big cities. Several of the president's engagements during his tour of Tamaulipas were meetings in these shanty towns, organised by the National Solidarity Programme, which he launched the day after he took office in 1988. It sprang from his Harvard PhD research in the 1970s, when he found that local variations in support for the ruling party could be correlated, not with gross social spending but with the direct involvement of the local population in planning and implementing social programmes. In essence it is a system of matching grants, whereby the state agrees to provide resources for projects - schools, clinics, housing, potable water and sewage systems, electrification, etc - which groups of poor people propose and carry out themselves. In a period of cuts in state expenditure, it aims to allocate scarce resources so that they stimulate and reward local initiative. The comitiva comprised some 20 or 30 people: local politicians, junior ministers, senior civil servants, private sector businessmen, a historian from the Colegio de Mexico and a scientist who had done research on Aids. On the platform at each meeting, whether in town square, factory or under the trees of a remote farming community, each of us found a chair bearing a typed label with his or her name on it. From this privileged vantage point I could read the messages directed at the president, thanking him for his support with this or that project, but also imploring him to solve problems, uphold the rights of a Solidarity committee against local bureaucrats or, in the oil port of Tampico, promise to build a new refinery. (He showed his political skill by withholding that promise - a decision for the board of Pemex, the state oil company, to take on strictly economic criteria - and yet making the crowd cheer his assurance that 'your friend, the president of the republic' would personally watch over their interests.) Occasionally one could see the banners of a small opposition party. But conspicuous by its invisibility was the party to which Mr Salinas himself belongs, and which has ruled Mexico almost unchallenged since its foundation in 1929: the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). On the flight back to Mexico City I put it to the president that this was strange. In any other country one would expect his own party to be in the lead in welcoming the head of state when he tours the country, especially if (as is clearly the case with Mr Salinas) he has some popularity to cash in on. Yes, he said, that 'used to be the tradition' in Mexico too, but party meetings had become 'very rigid, with a lack of interest among the people . . . because they had almost no relation with what was going on'. By contrast, he explained, the people at the meetings I had witnessed were 'those directly related to what is going on, and are mobilised through Solidarity committees, which are not party-related, because we are convinced that these committees reflect the pluralistic composition of the population, and they do not want the parties within the committees . . .' There is no doubt that the PRI is active behind the scenes in the Solidarity programme, as in almost everything that happens in Mexico. A colleague told me how he came by accident on a squad of PRI militants in the midst of the countryside, toiling to finish a school building which Mr Salinas was due to inaugurate the following day. Mexico still has many of the features of a one-party state. The press remains weak, the television respectful, and the number of journalists who meet violent deaths (not all, ostensibly at least, for political reasons) has aroused the anxiety of PEN, the international writers' lobby. The opposition has clearly lost ground since the 1988 presidential election, which many believe Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas would have won if the votes had been honestly counted. Mr Salinas worries about such things, too, or anyway about the effect they have on Mexico's image. He has set up a National Human Rights Commission, and he says he 'would like to see more modern political parties'. At the same time he is acutely defensive about Mexico's national sovereignty, evidently fearing that any qualification of it might be exploited by the US, for instance by attaching political strings to free trade. So far the US has abstained from doing so, evidently considering that Mr Salinas is by far the best Mexican leader it is likely to get and that nothing would be gained by rocking his boat. 'Generally Americans like to link economic issues with democracy and human rights,' says one disillusioned Cardenas supporter, 'but there are three exceptions to that: China, Mexico and Kuwait.' To such critics the good press that Mr Salinas gets at home and abroad, and especially the willingness of foreign liberals to give him the benefit of the doubt, is infuriating. 'Why should what he says be taken on trust, any more than what Bush or Major or Kohl says?' the same person asked. The answer is that of course it should not. But the question is the wrong one. What one should ask is whether there is an alternative leadership and an alternative programme more likely to move Mexico in the direction of greater prosperity and greater freedom; and there the answer can only be that if there is one, it is not yet in sight.</p>

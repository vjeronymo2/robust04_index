			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Reduction in sales hits French builders THE downturn in the French construction industry left a number of the country's largest building and building materials groups with reduced sales last year. Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the utility group that has been plagued by problems at its Dumez construction subsidiary, mustered turnover of FFr89.15bn (Dollars 16.63bn) last year, compared with FFr87.67bn in 1991, a fall in real terms. Lyonnaise recently warned of a fall in net profits of between 60 per cent and 70 per cent from 1991's FFr1.17bn. Lafarge Coppee, the world's largest building materials supplier, has also been affected by the problems of the construction sector. It saw sales fall to FFr30.45bn last year from FFr31.65bn in 1991. It has been hit hardest in the US and in the French cement market. Guintoli, one of the construction companies embroiled in the scandal of Ciments Francais' off-balance sheet dealings, saw its sales fall by 3.3 per cent to FFr1.5bn in 1992 from FFr1.55bn in 1991. Guintoli was taken over by the Paribas banking group late last year after it emerged that Ciments Francais had secretly raised its holding in the company. The problems of the construction sector were underlined by the announcement that Formica plans to cut costs by shedding 45 of its 400 employees in France. Its French plants have been on short-time working since October.</p>

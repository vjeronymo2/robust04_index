			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CAPITAL SHOOTINGS KILL 4, WOUND 5  </P> <P> In a continuation of violence in the District of Columbia, four people,  including a well-known gang member, were killed and five others were wounded by  gunfire during a 9 1/2-hour period that ended early Saturday, police said.  </P> <P> The slayings, most of which occurred in drug-trafficking neighborhoods, brought  the number of homicides in the district this year to 107, nearly double the  number killed in the equivalent period of 1987.  </P> <P> Homicide detectives said the pace of the attacks, which averaged one shooting  an hour -- was unusual. The death toll exceeded that of Feb. 14, when three  people were killed and 10 others were wounded within 24 hours that officials  called the bloodiest episode in memory.  </P></p>

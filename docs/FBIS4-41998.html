			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "Exclusive" report No. 26 of 29 June] </F>   [Text] SHAYMIYEV: TATARSTAN SHOULD REVITALIZE ECONOMY  TOGETHER WITH RUSSIA    Top leaders of Tatarstan often appear on Interfax-Exclusive.  The interest in the politicians is quite understandable:  political analysts believe that the relationship between Moscow  and Kazan, which for over two years demanded a special status in  the federation, as well as their treaty on the separation of  powers signed at the beginning of the year can serve as a model  for the revival of the Russian Federation. This time Interfax  interviews the president of the republic Mintimer Shaymiyev.    INTERFAX: Five months have passed since the signing of the  treaty between Russia and Tatarstan. Do you think it has  influenced processes in Russia as a whole and the attitude of  the federal government to territories?    SHAYMIYEV: Yes, undoubtedly. The treaty with Tatarstan  reduced to naught the prospect of Russia developing as a  unitarian state. This is an important political asset, first of  all for Moscow itself. Now everyone believes that the  federation can be asymmetrical. This is not just somebody's  whim, but a reality. The federal government has started signing  treaties with republics. Moreover these are not standard  agreements, they take into account the specific features and  possibilities of each republic. These differences prompt the  level of dividing powers and the nature of relations between the  federal government and territories.    But we still will have to evaluate the true meaning of the  treaty. When Russia starts working to harmonize the  constitutions of the republics with the federal constitution and  the matter is raised in relations with Tatarstan, then we are  going to see the strength of the treaty. It was signed on the  basis of the recognition of two constitutions, which means that  Kazan has the right to demand the adjustment of certain articles  of the federal constitution to its own. That is why I think  that when future agreements are going to be signed with  republics special attention is going to be paid to harmonizing  constitutions on the basis of mutual compromise.    INTERFAX: Do you think there has been any decentralization  of power in the Russian Federation or the voice of local leaders  remains inaudible and insignificant?    SHAYMIYEV: There has been a change of the situation in this  respect too. Local leaders are now being heeded. Probably the  explanation to this is that in the absence of a clear concept of  economic reforms, territorial or ethnic policies local leaders  had to assume responsibility for the construction of a  law-governed state. Today they are no less experienced in this  than the federal authorities and offer their own versions of  economic programs which are no worse.    INTERFAX: Before signing the treaty with Moscow Tatarstan  tried to notably amend, if not openly dissociate itself with  Russian economic reforms. Now, on the contrary, the leaders of  the republics more and more often speak of the need for close  interaction with Russia. Programs that used to be local, such  as the construction of an oil refinery or a bridge across the  Kama or the reconstruction of an airport, are becoming joint  programs. Why?    SHAYMIYEV: The main reason is the high degree of integration  of the Tatar economy in the federal one which we have never  denied. When two years ago Tatar leaders chose their own  strategy of reforms, they stressed that the republic is not  leaving the common economic space, therefore sooner or later it  Tatarstan going to face the same difficulties as the rest of the  federation. We managed to prevent a total economic collapse but  it was impossible to avoid general economic difficulties. The  main thing is that we prevented the pauperization of the  population.    The stage of "softly" entering the market is over and today  Tatarstan faces the need for radical changes which does not mean  the renunciation of social programs. And now the federal  leadership is determined to take more resolute steps in  reforming the economy and our views largely coincide.    The latest package of economic decrees of President Boris  Yeltsin is aimed primarily at livening up production which is  also our strategic task. A series of Tatar decrees is in the  making and their idea largely coincides with the federal one.    However, Kazan can afford even more radical steps: to  support government-owned as well as private companies, impose  softer taxes and revise the credit policy. Expensive federal  credits can be a temporary remedy, but they will inevitably make  the republic a debtor.    There is a true crisis of mutual debts in the Russian  Federation and Tatarstan now. Therefore we stake on the broad  use of promissory notes. They have proved useful guaranteeing  the turnover of means in the republic and holding back the  decline in production. But much as we would want we cannot  change the situation singlehanded.    Tatarstan should revitalize the economy together with  Russia.  And such prospects are appearing today: the federal government  intends to support our local programs by offering guarantees to  foreign investors and financing joint projects. This does not  undermine the interests of Tatarstan in any way. For instance,  the controlling interest in an oil refinery is going to belong  to Kazan while guarantees of the federal government will help  attract foreign investments and accelerate the reconstruction of  the facility.    The construction of YeLAZ (an auto plant in Yelabuga,  Tatarstan) implied the involvement of the federal government  from the very start. We can restore KAMAZ auto works after the  fire only through joint efforts. Russia is getting foreign  credits and Tatarstan has the right to count on a definite share  of them.    INTERFAX: Analysts believe that when Yeltsin launched  reforms, Russia started becoming less and less controllable.  Don't you think your radical steps can have the same result?    SHAYMIYEV: No. At the first stage Kazan intends to continue  government regulation of the market. In corporatized companies  the controlling interest will remain in the hands of the  government which is going to be able to influence their  operation.    While supporting small and medium-sized businesses the  government will control the situation, regulate tax rates and  help effective plants with credits, but not keep inefficient  ones afloat. In the future government control should be reduced  to credit and tax policies. We are gradually moving in that  direction.    On the other hand, the government does not think of  curtailing social programs even though it faces the difficult  task of combining the incompatible: easing the tax burden and  security budget spending.    INTERFAX: Are you sure your initiatives are going to be  regarded adequately and decrees carried out instead of being  blocked?    SHAYMIYEV: So far we have not had unimplemented decrees.</p>

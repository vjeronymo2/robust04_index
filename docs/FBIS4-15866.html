			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Orlov under the "Regional Elections" </F> rubric: "The People of the Volga Have Expressed Support for `The  Party of Power'"]    [Text] Niznhiy Novgorod -- Election fever has been raging  for almost two months in Nizhniy Novgorod. With what outcome?  The City Duma elections were declared valid in just 16 of the  34 districts. The enthusiasm of the city's inhabitants was  dampened by the postponement of elections for the mayor of  Niznhiy Novgorod and the referendum on the city's charter.    The results of the formation of the oblast parliament are  more indicative and objective. There were 206 candidates  running for 45 seats. The overwhelming majority of them were  not affiliated to any party. But, among the candidates as a  whole, quite a different affiliation, not registered anywhere,  "appeared" of its own accord -- the "party of power." It is  made up of officials from the executive structures: rayon and  city administration heads and department and administration  staffers.    One noticeable aspect of the Nizhniy Novgorod elections was  the appearance of the "Spring" Alliance. This association of  young entrepreneurs backed a large group of its colleagues to  run as candidates. The "Spring" Alliance, sparing no expense,  tested the suitability of Western standards of political  advertising on the Nizhniy Novgorod public. The entire election  campaign conducted by "Spring" was like a carnival. Air  balloons were launched, bright posters displayed, and "star"  concerts organized, and the opportunities offered by local radio  and television were used extensively.    The overall results of the elections for the Oblast  Legislative Assembly read as follows: 32 deputies out of 45  were elected. Of these, 19, or 42 percent, were administration  heads and their deputies ("party of power"); 7, or 16 percent,  were economic managers; and 6, or 13 percent, were journalists,  scientists, and trade union officials. People are tired of  fruitless political rhetoric. They want to live normal lives,  and pin their hope on people exercising actual power and  experienced in economic management, and it is for them that the  people of Nizhniy Novgorod voted.</p>

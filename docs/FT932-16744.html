			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / International Property: Major player quits the resort game - Trafalgar House is pulling out of Portugal TRAFALGAR House Europe Resorts (THER) paid Shell Portuguesa Pounds 21m in 1989 for a package which included a tourist village of 180 villas and apartments on the Quinta do Lago estate in Portugal's Algarve. Also in the package of 200 acres was a golf course and a building site. Shell developed the village, Vilar do Golf, in the 1980s for letting to holidaymakers but tired of it. THER was keen to get into the leisure market but did not want to spend years building a new resort. It set about refurbishing the Vilar do Golf units and improving the landscaping at a cost of more than Pounds 3m. David Calverley, managing director of Trafalgar House Property, said at the time: 'This major purchase underlines Trafalgar House's commitment to leisure as one of its core businesses. It is our intention to remain a major player in resort development.' But four years is a long time in property. At noon on Sunday, May 2, THER is auctioning on site more than half the Vilar do Golf villas and apartments at up to 47 per cent off prices asked previously. Other units are being offered separately. Minimum reserve prices range from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 100,000 for the one-bedroom apartments and villas with two to three bedrooms, all furnished. The auctioneer is the US-based firm Kennedy-Wilson, which claims to have sold Pounds 620m worth of property world-wide in 1992. The whole thing is being planned with the precision of a military exercise. An on-site information office is open daily and a series of 'how to buy' seminars is being held in the UK and around Europe so that potential bidders can see how an auction works. Arrangements are being made with travel companies to assist people who want to see Vilar do Golf before the auction. Bidders must register in advance and take a banker's draft for Pounds 10,000 (or the equivalent in escudos ) with them. Postal bids will be accepted but not telephone ones. Units that do not sell will be put on the ordinary market. The resort's facilities now include four nine-hole golf courses (for which owners get discounted green fees and golf rights), three swimming pools, a tennis centre with floodlit courts and a restaurant. And there is a letting programme through which owners can rent their properties when they are not there. As well as the 97 units being offered individually at the auction - which could bring in Pounds 7m if everything goes - a further 47 will be available beforehand in blocks of three to six units, or as a whole, for investors. The capital value of these blocks ranges from Pounds 282,000 to Pounds 430,000 and buyers must place the units in the rental pool for three years. Developers and property companies with their own stocks of unsold leisure homes will be watching the outcome with keen interest, especially as Trafalgar House now admits it is pulling out entirely from leisure development in Portugal. As well as Vilar do Golf, this means offloading two golf courses elsewhere and some undeveloped land. There are also another 40 units to build and sell at THER's Rocha Brava development on the Algarve. John Low, the chairman, says: 'As of now, Trafalgar House policy is just to focus on its core business. Resort development is no longer seen as core business.' But the company stresses that the interests of the owners on its developments will be safeguarded. For auction information in the UK, tel. 0800-886 633 or 071-499 6299.

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Letter: An adequate retirement income for all Sir, Your editorial ('Private pensions', July 13) suggests one solution to the cost of funding state pensions is to let them 'gradually wither on the vine'. That is what is happening. By the middle of the next century, the value of the state retirement pension will have shrunk to a mere 8 per cent of average earnings. It is this dark fact, combined with a current Pounds 35bn bill for providing inadequate pensions, which was the starting point for the Fabian pamphlet entitled Private Pensions for All, which Matthew Owen and I wrote and submitted as evidence to Labour's Social Justice Commission. Our proposals do not envisage - as you have reported - the scrapping of the state pension. The aim is to gain a mix of public and private pensions so that everyone gains two pensions and thereby an adequate retirement income. Our assumption here is that there is a limit to what individuals want to pay in tax. The proposals therefore combine tax, compulsory contributions from employers and employees, while leaving open the opportunity for people to make additional voluntary contributions. The reform package envisages: A substantial increase in today's pension financed by the scrapping of the tax concession on lump sum payments. The compulsory inclusion of all workers, including part-timers, in company or private pension schemes. The focus of taxpayers' money to finance the contributions of the unemployed, disabled and carers who are prevented from working. While everyone will continue to receive their state pension a clawback will operate on those with substantial private pensions. Each and every one of us will have a right to own our own pension fund assets. We hope the Social Justice Commission will poll voters on what they think of this plan. While any new idea is open to misinterpretation, Labour's aim must be to have an agenda to which the government is forced to react, and which voters will enthusiastically endorse at the next election.

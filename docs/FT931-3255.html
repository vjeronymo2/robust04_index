			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: MoDo stops payout after tumbling into loss of SKr1.7bn MODO, the Swedish forestry group, has cancelled its dividend after swinging to a SKr1.7bn (Dollars 216m) loss in 1992 from a SKr221m profit a year earlier. The result, which was worse than expected, was hit by SKr700m in foreign exchange losses and start-up costs for a new French mill, but highly competitive market conditions were the main reason for the decline. Excess of supply for most forest industry products continued during 1992, squeezing prices and capacity utilisation, despite higher demand, said Mr Bernt Lof, the group chief executive. Losses doubled in the final four months of the year from SKr811m at the eight-month stage, with the weakening of the krona from November coming too late to benefit the group. In 1991, the group paid a SKr7 dividend, which was down from SKr13 in 1990. Sales fell to SKr15.7bn from SKr17.4bn, and the group saw an operating loss of SKr135m after a SKr1.06bn profit in 1991. This was aggravated by higher financial costs of SKr1.3bn, against SKr841m. The main lossmaker was MoDo Paper, where operating losses deepened to SKr696m from SKr194m, but profits sank sharply at Holmen Paper to SKr40m from SKr496m. Mr Lof said the group's rationalisation programme, which resulted in 950 job losses, had saved the company more than SKr500m during the year, and he predicted a further benefit this year. The group said it expected its capacity utilisation, which fell to 85 per cent in 1992, to rise in 1993, helped by a better supply and demand balance and a successive rise in prices. It also said it would benefit from lower wood prices, a reduced energy tax, and the devaluation of the krona.</p>

Were they valid or  not? According to the oblast electoral commission this question  can be answered in the affirmative. Of the 47 seats in the  oblast legislative assembly 36 have acquired incumbents. And  that enables the assembly to function on a legal basis even in  this truncated form. In the remaining 11 districts the elections  were deemed invalid because of the low turnout.    Vladislav Shapovalenko, the president's representative in  Orenburg Oblast, broke the calm. He spoke on local television,  accusing oblast electoral commission chairman Yu. Andreyev of  arbitrariness and juggling with the election results. And he  urged the oblast prosecutor to deem the elections in eight  districts invalid. If his protest is satisfied the elections in  the oblast as a whole will be deemed invalid.    In V. Shapovalenko's opinion the statute on the elections  according to which the participation of 20 percent of the  electorate is necessary for them to be deemed valid has been  broken. But in the past the Central Electoral Commission has  sent a specification to the localities according to which the  percentage of turnout must be determined from the number of  valid ballot slips. But in practice there is always a large  difference between the number of voters and the number of ballot  slips deemed valid. And that difference could be fatal for the  eight districts. In terms of turnout they reached the necessary  level. But some were tens of a percent and others hundreds of a  percent short of the number of valid ballot slips required.    It should be noted that Yu. Andreyev was not acting alone.  On election day he telephoned the Central Electoral Commission  in Moscow several times and sought advice. As a result he was  given the go-ahead to deem the elections in these disputed  districts valid. The oblast legislative assembly thus become  fully empowered, reaching the necessary two thirds of its makeup.    It will soon become clear how the conflict will end. But  some people see in the position of the president's  representative a morbid reaction to the crushing defeat of  "Russia's Choice" and "Democratic Russia." Not one of their  representatives got into the oblast legislative assembly.  Actually, the bloc "against poverty, unemployment, and  corruption," which included Communists, agrarian experts, and  commodity producers and some others, did not win special laurels  either. The head of the local Communists and the chairman of  the oblast's union of commodity producers became deputies. It  is true that the list of those elected contains many former  party functionaries who were able to keep afloat. Despite the  appeal from V. Yelagin, head of the oblast administration, to  the leaders of rayon administrations not to submit their  candidacies, the latter did not heed him. As a result 11 have  become deputies. Even more seats were obtained by the directors  of industrial enterprises and chairmen of former collective  farms -- 19. The director of a commercial bank, the director of  a commercial firm, and two journalists successfully passed  through the sieve of the election campaign.    Elections to the Orenburg City Duma were invalid. Of 13  deputies' seats only four were filled. Elections were invalid  in a number of districts of other cities in the oblast. The  election campaign cost 2.5 billion rubles. If the question of  the contested districts is reviewed they may be considered to  have been thrown to the wind.</p>

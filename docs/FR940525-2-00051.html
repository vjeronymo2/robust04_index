Elucidation of such components will lead to the design of reagents which will interfere with HIV entry and/or tumor invasion. These reagents will subsequently be tested on animal models and in eventual clinical trials for their efficacy as therapeutic agents. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Proposals and questions about this opportunity may be addressed to Mr. M.W.

It involves phenomena such as intracellular sorting and secretion, cell division, fertilization, metastasis and viral entry into cells. The research goals of the Membrane Structure and Function Section of the Laboratory of Mathematical Biology (LMMB); Division of Cancer Biology; Diagnosis and Centers (DCBDC); National Cancer Institute (Dr. Robert Blumenthal, Chief) have in the past years been directed towards an understanding how viral envelope proteins mediate fusion of membranes. Dr. Blumenthal's group has developed new methodologies to examine the fusion activity of viral proteins. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The goal of this CRADA is to identify the biochemical components of the fusion complex involved in HIV entry into cells and tumor cell invasion. A photosensitized labeling approach will be employed for the identification of membrane fusion and cell adhesion molecules which may play an important role in HIV entry into cells and/or in metastatic cell invasion. The use of the photosensitized labeling approach may make it possible to reveal the biological components and proteins on cell surfaces (membranes) which could not previously be identified in any other way. Background information (including reprints) is available from the above-referenced address. Selected peptide components of the fusion complex will be purified and micro-sequenced in order to proceed with hybridization cloning of the accessary fusion molecules. Reagents such as peptides and antibodies will then be generated using information derived from their cDNA sequences. The reagents will be screened and tested for their ability to interfere with or block HIV infection and/or metastatic cell invasion using in vitro assays. Potent inhibitors thus identified will be further tested on animal models and in eventual clinical trials for their efficacy as therapeutic agents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HIV:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been shown that human CD4 inserted into non-human cells will not support HIV&hyph;1 entry into those cells. Protease-insensitive components of human cells are needed to overcome the block in HIV&hyph;1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated fusion of non-human cells. The plan is to identify those putative components using a new technique called photosensitized labeling. By this methodology, lipophilic aryl azides are photoactivated in situ by energy transfer from a variety of chromophores, using visible light. This approach has been successfully applied to the identification of proteins and lipids involved in multidrug resistance of tumor cells and the process of invasion of human erythrocytes by the Malaria parasite. Peptides derived from specific regions of gp 120 and gp 41 are labeled with fluorescein or other chromophores and photoactivated during their interaction with CD4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> + <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  membranes containing the radioactive probe [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 125 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I]-5-Iodonaphthalene-1-azide (INA). Since photoactivation occurs by resonance energy only, membrane components in the vicinity of CD4 will be labeled by INA. The putative accessory proteins forming fusion complexes with gp 120 and CD4 will presumably be labeled, identified on 2D gels and isolated. The elucidation of such protease-insensitive components will lead to the design of reagents which will interfere with or block HIV entry into cells. These reagents will subsequently be tested on animal models and in eventual clinical trials for their efficacy as therapeutic agents against HIV infection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Metastasis:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been shown that cytokine-induced pseudopodial protrusion is a prominent feature of actively motile cells in vitro and invading tumor cells in vivo. Following protrusion of the pseudopodia through the basement membrane, it has been postulated that fusion of adjacent pseudopods occurs. This is following by streaming of the cytoplasm beneath the basement membranes, migration of the nucleus and finally, relocation of the cell to the opposite side of the basement membrane. This process results in migration of the tumor cell towards the target tissue. The pseudopod fusion process is presumably mediated by membrane fusion-inducing proteins which are transiently expressed during cell migration across the basement membrane. For the identification of such proteins, a similar approach will be used as that for identification of accessory components in HIV&hyph;1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion: the chromophore will be placed on one population of cells and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 125 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> INA will be placed on another population of metastatic cell. Upon their penetration through basement membranes, the pseudopodia of adjacent cells may fuse with one another. Fusion of a chromophore-labeled membrane with an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 125 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> INA-bearing membrane will cause energy transfer between the chromophore and INA generating a measurable signal in the form of radiolabeled proteins located at the site of fusion. The membrane proteins involved in metastatic cell fusion and invasion will be identified on 2D gels and isolated. The elucidation of these proteins will lead to the design of reagents which will interfere with or block tumor invasion into cells. These reagents will subsequently be tested on animal models and in eventual clinical trials for their efficacy as therapeutic agents against tumor cell invasion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CRADA aims include the rapid publication of research results and the timely exploitation of commercial opportunities.

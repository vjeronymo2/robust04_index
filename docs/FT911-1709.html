			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK INDEX futures were unable to provide much of a lead yesterday and instead followed the tone set by the cash market and Wall Street. Some brokers believed the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the UK local elections left dealers unable to call the next move in share prices with any degree of confidence. The futures market had begun weakly on aggressive selling by locals and at one stage the June FT-SE 100 index contract had narrowed to a premium of just 18-20 points to the spot index, against 30 at the previous close. Institutional buying then pushed the market higher and June's premium widened to almost 30 points. However, the futures' gains had little effect on the stock market, which continued to track Wall Street off its highs. The June FT-SE closed at 2,552, up 26 on the day and 22 above the spot index. With fair value calculated at 15 points, the futures market is still expecting a rise in the London stock market. Turnover in traded options was lifted as James Capel hedged against the FT-SE index rising above 2,825 by the year-end. The deal involved the purchase of 250 December 2,525 Euro FT-SE 100 index calls, and the sale of the same amount of December 2,625 and 2,725 calls.</p>

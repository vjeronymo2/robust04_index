			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Norway cuts lending rate Norway's central bank cut its key overnight lending rate to 17 per cent from a six-year high of 25 per cent yesterday after fending off speculators who had bet on an imminent devaluation, Reuter reports from Oslo. Economists said fears of renewed turmoil were likely to prevent a cut to 10 per cent - the level in force before Sweden floated its currency on November 19, putting pressure on the Norwegian krone.</p>

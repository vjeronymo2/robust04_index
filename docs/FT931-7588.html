			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Japan Responds to Downturn: Matsushita chief quits in mid-term - Scandal and poor results force Tanii to resign THE surprise announcement by Matsushita Electric, the world's largest consumer electronics group and owner of MCA, the US film studio, that its president, Mr Akio Tanii, would quit immediately has sent shock waves through the Japanese business community and increased concerns about the state of the company. Mr Tanii who leaves his post in mid-term, will be succeeded by Mr Yoichi Morishita, the executive vice-president As Japanese companies usually take their time in preparing for the succession to the top post, the abruptness of Mr Tanii's departure has fanned speculation he was forced out to take the blame for the company's poor performance. Mr Tanii said he was taking responsibility for the involvement of National Lease, a subsidiary, in a financial scandal that rocked Japan in the summer of 1991. 'I felt it was important to clarify responsibility for certain unfortunate matters that occurred during my presidency,' Mr Tanii said. National Lease had extended loans totalling Y50bn (Pounds 292.39m) to Toyo Shinkin bank, a former branch head of which had made illegal loans to an Osaka restaurateur. The involvement of National Lease in the Toyo Shinkin scandal led the Matsushita subsidiary to post a Y20.9bn loan loss. Mr Tanii was expected to take responsibility for the scandal and resign last autumn, when the company's interim results were released. He raised eyebrows in Japan when he failed to do so, and criticism of the group has intensified as it has struggled to put behind the bad news and direct its energies toward improving battered fortunes. Yesterday's announcement failed to explain the timing of his resignation and it heightened concerns that unless the group takes drastic measures it could find itself in serious trouble. The group reported dismal third quarter results for the three months to December 1992. Its consolidated third quarter results showed pre-tax profits were down 60 per cent to Y50.2bn in the three months to December. Sales were 6 per cent down to Y1,882.8bn. Net income fell by 76 per cent to Y12.6bn from a previous Y52.4bn. In the nine months to December, the group saw pre-tax profits fall 63 per cent to Y118.1bn (Y322.7bn). While all consumer electronics companies have been hurt by the downturn in consumer spending worldwide, Matsushita has also been rocked by the impact of defects that were found in 700,000 of its refrigerators in addition to the National Lease scandal. The company has been restructuring its operations in an attempt to increase profits while sales remain flat but this has added to grumblings from disgruntled retailers unhappy about new tight-fisted measures by Matsushita. The consensus however has been that more needs to be done. 'The organisation is bloated, there is a lack of vertical and horizontal communication,' one industry analyst said. 'The question being asked is what is the company going to do from now on?' Hope was expressed yesterday that Mr Morishita would be able to breathe some fresh air into the company. The new president, who is 57 this year, has risen rapidly up the ranks, having just been promoted to executive vice-president in December, and is known as a man who can get things done.</p>

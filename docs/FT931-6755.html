			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / International Company News: Repsol plans Dollars 1bn worldwide share issue REPSOL, the Spanish state-controlled energy group, is to raise close to Dollars 1bn in an international share issue following a surprise government announcement yesterday authorising the conglomerate to double the amount of shares it had originally intended to place on the market. The placement, probably between mid-March and mid-April, is likely to be one of the biggest international distributions of any share issue this year. The decision to double the potential income from the placement appears to underline an urgent need by the government to increase gains from the disposal in order to reduce the budget deficit. Lazards is advising in the share offer, and, in a move that reflected the scale and complexity of the transaction, Repsol appointed Goldman Sachs as a separate global co-ordinator of the issue earlier this month. A government spokesman said Instituto Nacional de Hidrocarburos, INH, the state holding that owns 54.5 per cent of Repsol, had been authorised to sell up to 40m shares. Such a share offering, if taken up, would raise Pta109bn (Dollars 931m) at current market prices. In January Repsol had indicated it would only be placing 7 per cent of INH's equity in the market when it said it was seeking to raise Dollars 500m in a circular to institutions that invited bids to lead the placement. Dealers said they expected great demand for Repsol paper. Repsol's sharesrose by Pta40 to Pta2,745 in Madrid yesterday.</p>

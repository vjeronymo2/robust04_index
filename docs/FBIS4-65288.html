			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the Defense Ministry, two persons died  when a Portuguese military plane crashed between the beaches of  Almadrava and Cala Montjoi [in Catalonia].    A colonel and a captain who were taking part in the NATO  "Dynamic Impact-94" maneuvers died.    The plane had come down in a "black spot" where radio  communications were difficult and there was a lot of fog.    Another fighter plane, a Spanish Harrier came down in the  sea  this morning, and its pilot has been rescued unhurt near Palma  de Mallorca [in the Balearic Islands]. The Harrier was based on  the Principe de Asturias aircraft carrier.</p>

The prime  minister is currently speaking at the Cinematheque in Tel Aviv.  Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports:    [Begin recording] [Segal] The prime minister said that 1994  will be a watershed. This year will determine whether the  Middle East is headed toward peace, Rabin asserted. Prime  Minister Rabin made several important statements here with  regard to Syria. He revealed that the Americans have reached  the conclusion that Syria is prepared to make peace according to  the Egyptian model. Israel hopes to avoid repeating the  Egyptian precedent, Rabin said, at least with regard to  withdrawal from territories.    [Rabin] This government, on the basis of its election  platform, is prepared to make a territorial compromise on the  Golan Heights. Whoever says we lack a mandate to do so is  simply talking nonsense. It appears in our platform; we said it  out loud, despite the pain it entailed. I pray that we will be  able to avoid repeating -- and we will make absolutely every  possible effort in this regard -- the price we paid for peace  with Egypt. I would like to say that in this regard, the  Egyptian precedent -- or the price we paid for peace with Egypt  -- is on the mind of every Arab leader. I have not still not  received any definite sign that Syria accepts our definition of  peace, and it goes without saying that we are far from accepting  the full and painful price it is demanding in exchange for peace.    [Segal] Prime Minister Rabin said that his decisions on  significant territorial concessions will be made on the basis of  a national referendum. He refused to define at this time what  he means by significant concessions. Prime Minister Rabin said  that at present, he still does not know whether the fundamentals  of a peace agreement can be worked out with Syria. Once he is  confident that this is feasible, a law will have be passed on a  national referendum so that the Israeli public can vote on the  issue. With regard to Syria, Rabin said that when one refers to  the Egyptian model of peace one is also speaking about the other  aspects of that peace or, in other words, peace with  normalization and security arrangements.    Rabin also addressed the Palestinian track and explained  that  no progress has been made in the current negotiations with the  Palestinians. This, Rabin asserted, is because PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat is still demanding the symbols of national  sovereignty. Rabin reiterated Israel's demands with regard to  the border crossings and the jurisdiction of the Jericho area.  Rabin confirmed that agreement has not been reached on either  the size of the Jericho area or on the issue of the border  crossings.    As for the Gaza Strip, Rabin said that he would feel no  sense  of loss if Israel handed the Gaza Strip over to the control of  the Palestinian police. He also referred to the Gaza Strip in  the context of Israel's negotiations with Egypt in the 1970's.  Rabin said he does not remember the Egyptians ever asking for  the Gaza Strip.    [Rabin] I do not remember the Egyptians ever demanding the  return of the Gaza Strip in the course of the negotiations. I  can tell you now, and not on the basis of some wild assessment,  that if we were to offer the Gaza Strip to Egypt today, the  Egyptians would tell us to go choke on it by ourselves.    [Segal] Rabin also alluded to Lebanon and Jordan. With  regard to Jordan, the prime minister assessed that Amman will  not sign a separate peace with Israel unless progress is made on  the Syrian track. This is an important statement in the wake of  the assessments made by Foreign Minister Peres and Foreign  Ministry staffers that Jordan could indeed sign a separate peace  agreement. As for Lebanon, Rabin said that country is obviously  totally dependent on Syria. Thank God, Rabin said, that no one  had sought to establish settlements there. [end recording]</p>

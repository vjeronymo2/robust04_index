			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES ETHICS BILL  </P> <P> I was greatly disturbed to hear of the tragic fate of Los Angeles Councilman  Michael Woo's ethics bill in City Council chambers (Jan. 19, 20, 22). To hear  how council members stripped and weakened the bill in order to keep the perks  of their positions was both revealing and shocking.  </P> <P> This is a time of moral crisis of leaders in business (Ivan Boesky, Michael  Milken, et al), religion (Jimmy Swaggart, etc.) and government (the Keating  Five and Mayor Tom Bradley). Yet the problems of ethics in government is  possibly the most damaging and insidious. Ours is a democratic nation where  politicians are given the responsibility to lead and represent all  constituents.  </P> <P> It would be hoped that the Los Angeles City Council would have the foresight,  thoughtfulness and leadership to take a strong stand on ethics. Instead, we  read how council members argued about amendments concerning gifts of  "calendars, ballpoint pens and candy."  </P> <P> BERNARD C. LEE  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

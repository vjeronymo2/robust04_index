			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Local government review may be speeded up THE GOVERNMENT is likely to speed up the review of local government structure in England, Mr David Curry, the new local government minister, said yesterday. Both Sir John Banham, the chairman of the Local Government Commission, and local authority associations have called for the government's policy guidelines to be changed. Mr Curry says this could be done by allowing districts themselves to propose amalgamations and by making clearer the government's requirements on cost-effectiveness. Mr Curry, speaking after giving a speech to the conference in Bournemouth of the Association of District Councils, dismissed calls to abandon the review process as 'not a real option'. But he added that the guidance would be changed if that would help all interested parties to reach agreement and if it speeded up the review, which is predicted to last until 1997. He said that such a long process 'really would be difficult to live with'. Mr Curry added: 'I am willing to try to come up with a formula which most people are prepared to live with. Sir John himself is saying he would like to review the way the commission goes forward.' The commission's initial recommendations include controversial proposals for unitary authorities in Derbyshire and Somerset, but Mr Curry said there was quite a strong chance that the 'final shape may be some distance' from the original suggestions. Mr Curry emphasised in his speech to the conference that he had an open mind on the review. But he repeated warnings made by Sir John that district councils should be realistic and avoid disputes with county councils about the future structure of local government. He said: 'The purpose of making local government as effective as possible is to deliver the services that people want at the price they want to pay. It is not about the competing claims of vested interests.'</p>

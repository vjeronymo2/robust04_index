			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / The Long View: Wayward watchdogs CAN British investors and pensioners sleep more soundly in the knowledge that the regulators are protecting them ever more securely? Investors may have read about Thursday's recommendations of the Goode Committee, the group of experts set up to advise the government on how to avoid a repetition of the Maxwell corporate pensions disaster. They may not have noticed, however, the more obscure manoeuvrings at the Personal Investments Authority. This is a new (indeed, still only half-formed) body, which by the middle of next year is supposed to be taking over the protection role for non-deposit retail investment - embracing various kinds of packaged investments ranging from unit trusts to personal pensions and life assurance. The sudden departure of its chairman, Sir Gordon Downey, last week and the installation of Joe Palmer, a former Legal &amp; General boss, as his successor was an indication of serious strains. In political terms, investment regulation in the UK tends to be a game of pass the parcel. On the one side the politicians are desperate to avoid scandals, and bailouts financed out of the public exchequer, but are reluctant to take responsibility for problems they do not understand. They are also unwilling to pay the costs of regulation. So they shuffle the problem over to investment practitioners who organise themselves into self-regulatory bodies but often fail to deliver the hoped-for degree of investor protection. Back goes the parcel. The only factor that promises an end to this unsatisfactory stalemate is the growth of an entirely new class of professional regulator. Once the job was usually done by civil servants, who regarded it as a posting to the section of living death. Now, enjoying several times the pay rates, new bureaucrats have appeared who are not forever itching to be transferred to something more exciting, like company registration. Significantly, the Goode Committee has opted for a statutory regulator for occupational pensions. There is no hint that a body of pensions self-regulators should be established (though the regulator is to be advised by a committee of experts). Moreover it is suggested that the regulator should be paid for by the government (although what the government will have to say about this remains to be seen). I wonder whether this recommendation of a statutory regulator may reflect the general shift of opinion away from self-regulation that has taken place over the past ten years or so, since the Financial Services Act 1986 was being developed. For investment generally, however, the argument is not an either / or one about whether there should be statutory regulation or self-regulation, but a judgmental one about where the dividing line should be drawn. Self-regulation works where a fairly small and coherent group of practitioners can see a trade-off between the public interest and its own business interests. The old Stock Exchange worked like this, as a kind of club, but it could not cope with the arrival of big international banks as members along with the City gents and country brokers. Self-regulation can also succeed where the customers are as professional and well-organised as the practitioners and can therefore look out for themselves. Some pretty dirty things go on in the Eurobond market but it is regarded as part of the game. Self-regulation cannot work where large and conflicting groups of practitioners are dealing with an ignorant and vulnerable (and too often greedy) public. Unfortunately this is a precise description of the PIA. It is more than a year since the plan to replace several other regulators such as Lautro and Fimbra with the PIA was announced (it was originally supposed to have started operations in July this year). Sir Gordon Downey's departure is widely presumed to reflect the dissatisfaction of the Treasury and its senior investor protection agency, the Securities and Investments Board, with the slow progress. Palmer, a director of the SIB until he joined the PIA, is presumed to have taken the role of agent of Andrew Large, the SIB chairman. As recently as last May, Andrew Large spelled out, in a special report to his bosses at the Treasury, why a two-tier system of regulation must be made to work, with the SIB supervising the various regulators but not running them in a hands-on way. The strong suspicion has persisted, however, that the main reason for persevering with the two-tier approach lay in the Treasury's unwillingness to update the underlying legislation in the Financial Services Act. Now we see the practical difficulties persisting at the PIA, which has emerged as the SIB's chosen instrument for the next stage of regulatory development. If the SIB is being forced to manipulate the board of the PIA (and the chairmanship switch comes after a still unresolved row over the size and constitution of the board) then self-regulation must largely be a sham. Now the financial intermediaries, banks and insurance companies that make up the potential membership of the PIA are being told by the Treasury to get on with the formation process (over which they have at least some degree of control) or face some kind of alternative regulatory body which might be rather nasty to them. Quite a few practitioners, though, are wondering whether the official bluff should be called. The parcel has not yet stopped moving to and fro. In opting for investor protection through self-regulators in the 1980s the government chose a soft option. If it worked, well and good. If it did not, the failure could be made to look like the fault of the practitioners. But investors have not been well served by this approach. False starts have delayed the process of forming the right institutions and building the necessary expertise within them. Perhaps it was unrealistic to think it could be done within much less than 10 years, anyway. So if you wake in the middle of the night, you should worry just a little.</p>

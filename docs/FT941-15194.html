			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Accountancy firms voice optimism Accountancy firms in London are beginning to express cautious optimism about economic recovery and its impact on their business. Mr Michael Fowle, senior partner for London and the south-east for KPMG Peat Marwick, said: 'I think things are beginning to turn up, although we are lagging comment in the papers.' Mr Michael Boyd, head of the London office of Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'Overall it's going to be another tough year, but we will hold our own.' Most firms have reported almost static fee income in their most recent results, compared with substantial growth in the late 1980s. Consulting suffered particularly heavily, while audit and tax work have been stable against a backdrop of growing competition between the firms. In the last few months the compensating fillip provided by income from insolvency work has begun to decline, reflecting the drop in the number of company failures. Both KPMG and Ernst &amp; Young said corporate finance and investigations work were beginning to pick up, in line with the recovery in corporate transactions and rise in the equity markets.</p>

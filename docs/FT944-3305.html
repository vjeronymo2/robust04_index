			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Nadir hopes to draw line under five-year debacle: John Barham explains how political changes could resolve the fugitive businessman's problems and lead to his comeback Fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir may be close to resolving his difficulties with the north Cyprus government. This would involve striking a deal with his British creditors, opening the way for a comeback in 1995, five years after his Polly Peck International (PPI) group collapsed. Mr Nadir often says the charges against him will be dropped soon and he threatens a battle for compensation. He was charged with theft and false accounting after Polly Peck failed in 1990. Mr Nadir, claiming he would not get a fair trial in Britain, jumped Pounds 3.5m bail last year and fled to north Cyprus. Recently, though, Mr Nadir and his long-time patron, President Rauf Denktas of north Cyprus, have clashed in public, raising speculation that his political protection is ebbing away. Mr Denktas has demanded that Mr Nadir either pay Dollars 11m (Pounds 6.7m) in back taxes or face arrest. Earlier, street protesters, apparently encouraged by Mr Nadir, had taunted Mr Denktas outside his office. They jeered that he was a homosexual, the most damning insult in Turkish. At the same time, administrators of PPI, unable since 1990 to make any headway in recovering company assets in Cyprus, are finding that they have the government's ear. In a report to creditors published recently, the administrators struck an optimistic note on developments in north Cyprus while warning that political shifts had repeatedly upset progress on getting hold of PPI assets in the breakaway republic. However, the latest political shift in north Cyprus does at last appear to be ending the years of government stonewalling. A coalition government took office in January, led by Mr Denktas's conservative DP party, with the leftwing CTP party as the junior partner. The CTP wants to end the Nadir affair, hoping this will clean up north Cyprus's image of a rogue republic recognised by no one but Turkey. A CTP official said: 'We want to show that the Turkish community is a legal, democratic community.' The party's finance and tourism ministers have recognised the British administrators' right to manage two state-owned hotels run until recently by Mr Nadir. They could also be close to reaching settlement over Sunzest, a citrus company run by Mr Nadir but claimed by the administrators. Although these businesses are profitable, Mr Nadir owes Dollars 11m in unpaid taxes, social security contributions and rent on the hotels. Now he has offered to surrender Sunzest, valued at Dollars 19m last year, to the government if it waives its tax demand. A source close to PPI's administrators said: 'We are interested in a political settlement between Nadir and the government and us.' This would obviate the need for a ruling in the courts, which have consistently supported Mr Nadir. The administrators have always recognised that PPI has legitimate debts in north Cyprus. The government would use cashflow from the companies to pay off Mr Nadir's debts and then allow administrators to sell them. He said they 'should accept this deal and get out. You never know in this country what will happen tomorrow.' Still, the administrators may turn down the proposals. Many Cypriots doubt that politicians, who owe Mr Nadir many a favour, will assent to any deal he does not like. It would be awkward for a government to be seen to be backing British creditors against Mr Nadir - still a popular man in north Cyprus - with campaigning for presidential elections due to start in the spring. Mr Nadir's tabloid newspaper Kibris, north Cyprus's most read paper, relentlessly drives home the message that he brought jobs and money to a country blighted by under-investment and unemployment caused by its pariah status. 'I would say that Asil is a great man, a really great man for Cyprus,' said one man. Mr Erdogan Ulgen, a shopkeeper, added: 'We are always close to Mr Nadir because he brought a lot of business to our country. He is no thief. His problems come from the Greeks and the British.' Occasionally Mr Nadir is rumoured to be considering a political career, especially since Mr Denktas, for 20 years north Cyprus's strong man, says he will not stand for re-election. Yet one man, asked if he would vote for Mr Nadir, replied:'Nadir is a businessman, not a politician.' And his opponents insist his hero status is no more than the reflexive support of one islander for another, put on for the benefit of outsiders. In fact, they claim, public perceptions are changing as the facts of the Polly Peck affair penetrate Mr Nadir's propaganda barrage. Increasingly, they insist, Mr Nadir is seen as a thief, a tax dodger and a man who has disgraced north Cyprus. One opposition lawyer says Mr Nadir should be punished for offences committed in Cyprus. But should he be handed over to a British court? 'No, of course not. We have no extradition agreement with Britain and Britain has no agreement with us. 'Nadir is a citizen of north Cyprus, he cannot be kicked off.'</p>

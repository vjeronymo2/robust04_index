			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Growth to exceed Treasury forecasts Economic growth this year and next will be stronger than the Treasury expects, but inflation will rise to the top of the government's target range of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research says, Philip Coggan writes. The institute predicts that gross domestic product will rise 3.1 per cent this year and 2.9 per cent in 1995, compared with Treasury forecasts of 2.75 per cent for both years. It believes that inflation will 'begin to rise a little by the end of the year, helped by higher demand pressures and input costs'. It forecasts that underlying inflation - excluding mortgage interest payments - will increase to 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year and to 3.8 per cent by the end of 1995. Headline inflation will reach 4.5 per cent at the end of next year, the institute says. The Treasury is predicting underlying inflation of 2.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year, rising to 2.75 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1995. The institute says that 'one reason for the lack of credibility of the stated aim for inflation is uncertainty as to who is really in charge of monetary policy'. It adds: 'As interest rates rise, it would be good to see the government making it unambiguously clear that the responsibility for raising them belongs to the government itself.' One risk to the forecast is that credit demand might expand more than predicted in the latter half of the decade. The institute says that if this expansion occurs, with base rates unchanged, output and inflation will grow rapidly until inflation peaks at just less than 6 per cent. Alternatively short-term rates could respond, climbing to 10.5 per cent by 1997.</p>

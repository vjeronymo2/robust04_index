			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (11): Bohinj is still far from the battle - Prospects for the tourist in what remains an area of unspoilt beauty SNOW-SPECKLED slopes slide into the shores of a crystal lake. Wooden chalets dot mountain pastures. Giant evergreens and silvery birches line mountain paths. Is this Switzerland? No, it's Lake Bohinj in Slovenia. Nestled in the Julian Alps under Triglav, Slovenia's highest peak, Bohinj, like nearby Bled and Kranjska Gora, boasts unspoilt beauty and year-round outdoor activities, from hiking to sailing. It is easily accessible by car, aeroplane or rail and foreigners should be flocking to enjoy the Slovene Alps at prices some 30 per cent below those in neighbouring Austria. But just about everyone in the tourist industry complains that the nearly 90,000 beds are not filled to capacity except at the height of the summer season. Getting tourists to come back to Slovenia is a high priority. The country would appear to be a natural winner because from the Alps to the tiny stretch of Adriatic coast, Slovenia offers good value for holiday makers. Tourism was the single biggest earner in 1992, officially amounting to Dollars 670m, but in fact well over Dollars 1bn when private transactions are taken into account. But Mr Joze Mencinger, an economist at the Ljubljana law faculty, believes that tourism will probably never account for more than 10 per cent of Slovenia's hard currency earnings. 'The mountains are too low - but at the same time they are too steep for real skiing. The 46-kilometre coastline is too short and Koper, Slovenia's only port, takes up 10 kilometres and needs to be developed further,' he says. Before the break-up of Yugoslavia, Slovenia was awash with tourists. In 1990, some 55 per cent came from abroad and the remainder from other parts of the country. Slovenia was often included in foreign package tours. British tour operators, for example, used to book up hotels at Lake Bled for holiday makers en route to Croatia's Adriatic coast. Coach operators stopped in Slovenia as part of tours from northern Italy through to Austria. Everyone in the tourist industry complains that Slovenia is nearly unknown. If it is known, foreigners shy away, associating it with the bloodshed in former Yugoslavia. Mr Miro Mulej, head of the Lake Bled tourist association, describes the surprise of foreign visitors when they visit Bled, a mini-Lake Cuomo. 'They envision tanks rolling down the streets. They don't understand we have a proper border with Croatia. Slovenia has had no violence since the 10-day war in June 1991. 'When foreigners arrive, they see we have everything. From natural beauty to exclusive shops,' Mr Mulej says of Lake Bled, which offers a wide range of activities from casinos to golf. 'But building a new image for Slovenian tourism is an expensive business,' he adds. The high quality of the tourist information material put out by the industry and its operators reflects the effort to attract foreign holiday-makers. But Slovene tour operators are aware that their sophisticated, well-designed brochures will yield little until foreign partners realise that Slovenia is no longer part of Yugoslavia and that it is far away from the war. Slovenia is listed in the Thomson tour catalogue, but so far there have been few advance bookings. In 1988, Slovenia was a favourite charter spot for some 700,000 British tourists. 'We must forge a completely new identity: Slovenia as an alpine country. It is the opposite of the image of Yugoslavia with an Adriatic coast and islands,' says Mr Mulej looking out at Lake Bled, which boasts Slovenia's only island, dominated by a beautiful Baroque-steepled church. Tourist officials have taken steps to forge a new image for Slovenia. Mr Bogo Umek, under-secretary for tourism, says: 'About 52 per cent of Slovenia is covered with forests. We have the alps and spas, the Adriatic sea coast is decoration.' Mr Umek believes Slovenia's membership of the pentagonal Alpine Commission was an important step for tourism. Lake Bled last year was featured on the cover of the Commission's brochure. Slovenia is eager to emphasise individual tourism rather than the mass tours of the past. Mr Janko Humar, marketing director of Alpinum, which owns and operates six hotels around Lake Bohinj, says: 'Bohinj has some 1,000 beds. We do not want mass tourism, but individual visitors who want to enjoy the spectacular surroundings.' Over the past five years, Alpinum has upgraded its hotels, emphasising the quality of service, which was so often lacking for foreign visitors to the former Yugoslavia. 'We teach the staff that service is a profession to take pride in,' he adds. The staff at the charming Hotel Jezero, set on the shores of Lake Bohinj, is courteous and hospitable. Rock-climbing and white- water rafting may interest some holidaymakers at Bohinj. The less adventurous can walk on the well-marked paths in Triglav national park or enjoy the annual festival - the dance of the cows - which marks the time when peasants take their stock up to the mountain pastures for the summer. Kozolci, Slovenia's wooden hayracks - a tradition dating back to the 17th century - distinguish Lake Bohinj from Switzerland. But here, when holiday makers tire of swimming, skiing, or trout-fishing, they can hop in the car and after just an hour's drive, arrive at the short but lovely Adriatic coastline.</p>

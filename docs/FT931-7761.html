			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Crime grates on the electorate's raw nerve - Signs of a limited consensus seen between the two main parties on law and order WITH unbridled chutzpah Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, wrote last night to the Home Office suggesting that his document, Getting to Grips with Youth Crime, could form the basis of government policy. It would be churlish of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, to throw it straight in the bin. Labour and the Tories are at one on several points. They agree that tackling juvenile crime has to be a priority, the government has to take a lead in ensuring the community distinguishes between 'right' and 'wrong', and that offenders beyond redemption should be locked away. But to state that much is far from spotting an outbreak of consensus. The political noises and the apparent sparks of originality on crime policy - intensified by last week's murder of a two-year-old in Liverpool - reflect more a shift in the centre of gravity in the debate on law and order. Mr Blair, a very able frontbencher appointed to his present post last summer, has taken a policy area in which Labour is traditionally weak. Extending the work of his predecessor, Mr Roy Hattersley, he has put a greater emphasis on part of the party's message that matches the convictions of Labour's target voters - the middle classes and aspiring working classes: that crime is bad, criminals are nasty and something has to be done. Although a connection is denied, Mr Blair has echoed President Bill Clinton to the extent that he is enunciating what a majority of the population - and the electorate - believes. The message is two-pronged, however, for Labour has not abandoned its long-held belief that addressing causes is as important as condemning criminals. 'We need to tackle this problem in a concerted way; tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime,' Mr Blair said at the launch of the policy document. So while Mr Blair backed more secure accommodation for teenage offenders and agreed there may be a gap in the law that prevents persistent young offenders being imprisoned, he also wanted measures to cut drug abuse and improve education. He opposed the setting up of private-sector-operated special institutions for young offenders, preferring instead an expansion of the secure homes run by local authorities under the health department's budget. Similarly, Mr Blair used a speech last Friday to emphasise the importance of morality, but stressed that 'the breakdown in order is intimately linked to the break-up of community.' He is adept at exploiting Tory weaknesses. After 14 years in power, the debate among Conservatives is becoming more fluid. The rightwing 'hanging and flogging' MPs remain, pressing Mr Clarke last night to take strong action soon. Some now openly call for the castration of rapists. Many support corporal punishment. But Mr Clarke recognises the need for the government to 'lead society' and of giving youngsters a sense of purpose. Concepts of 'society' and 'community' are returning to ministers' speeches. Mr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, will tomorrow urge churches to take more of a role in educating people in social issues such as Aids. There is a sense of failure. Initiatives have been and gone, but the crime rate has risen inexorably. 'Beware of politicians who speak loudly on crime. They promise a lot and do little,' said Sir John Wheeler, former Tory chairman of the Commons home affairs committee. Many of the Tory backbenchers fear the party is in danger of losing still more political ground over law-and-order issues to Labour. Amid this maelstrom, Mr Clarke is trying to agree details of his juvenile crime initiative and respond to pressure for action from Tory ranks. A crackdown against persistent teenage offenders was announced at last October's Conservative conference. Promises of tougher penalties for offences committed on bail were in the Tory election manifesto last April. But parliamentary time for the necessary legislation unlikely until the autumn, has still to be agreed. If Mr Clarke does not fill the vacuum, Mr Blair will not be afraid of trying himself.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSTSCRIPT: 'PEOPLE WANT TO COME TO SOMETHING IN THE BARRIO THAT'S NICE. AND  THIS IS NICE.'  </P> <P> When the restaurant named after renowed Mexican artist and muralist Rufino  Tamayo opened last year, it was billed to be more than just another ritzy  Mexican restaurant. The Los Angeles area certainly has enough of those.  </P> <P> But this one was different, its backers argued, because of where it was -- on  the Eastside.  </P> <P> Officials at the East Los Angeles Community Union, a community development  corporation that spearheaded the nearly $4-million venture, gambled that East  Los Angeles -- viewed by most outsiders as a place too violent to live in or  visit -- could support a chic eatery.  </P> <P> "People want to come to something in the barrio that's nice," said TELACU  President David Lizarraga. "And this is nice."  </P> <P> Few expenses were spared to turn an old barn of a structure in the 5300 block  of East Olympic Boulevard into a pink stucco showcase. Imported floor tiles and  marble, three mini-waterfalls and several oversized tapestries of the famed  master's works were made part of the structure that at various times housed the  California Highway Patrol and the Brown Berets, the 1970s Chicano militant  group.  </P> <P> And the menu featured Mexican regional cuisine, a far cry from the traditional  Sonora dishes that are usually associated with food south of the border.  Selections ranged from huachinango flameado (whole marinated red snapper  roasted in an open pit) to pollo pibil (chicken marinated in many spices and  orange juice, wrapped in banana leaves and baked in the hearth ashes).  </P> <P> But in 15 months of business, the grand experiment, as Lizarraga refers to the  restaurant, has struggled.  </P> <P> Business, particularly on weekday nights, has been slow. On many evenings, the  harp player, hired to bring a touch of elegance while diners linger over their  meals, plays to a virtually empty dining room that seats 165 people.  </P> <P> While the restaurant seemed to hold its own with its lunches and catered  events, the weekends also proved disheartening. Few patrons found their way  into the Eastside establishment.  </P> <P> Losses were such that Stanley Kandel, a developer who helped establish the  glitzy celebrity-favored Spago restaurant, decided last December to pull out of  the partnership that headed up the restaurant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Overly Optimistic'  </P> <P> "I think I was overly optimistic, considering the location," he said.  </P> <P> Lizarraga and TELACU officials admit to strategy errors that probably  contributed to Tamayo's slow start.  </P> <P> Prices ranging up to $22 were probably too high for area residents, and too  much effort may have been made to attract Westsiders.  </P> <P> Also, the thing that supposedly set Tamayo apart, its location, may also be  part of the problem. One Tamayo insider said it would be a "huge roaring  success" if located on the Westside.  </P> <P> But Lizarraga, ever the optimist, is not about to throw in the towel.  </P> <P> Under a new management team, the menu's selections were broadened earlier this  year to include burritos, enchiladas, carnitas and other familiar dishes. And  prices were cut -- $17.95 for the marinated and grilled baby goat is the most  expensive plate.  </P> <P> Also, residents in Montebello, Monterey Park, Commerce, Pico Rivera and other  surrounding communities will be targeted in a still-evolving marketing  campaign.  </P> <P> "Maybe I'm just a dreamer," Lizarraga said, "but I really believe there is a  need for Tamayo to be here. We believe in the long-term development of East  L.A." GEORGE RAMOS  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Particulate Matter Test Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is adopting by reference the PM test procedures adopted by California in Sections 2420&hyph;2427, Chapter 11, title 13 of the California Code of Regulations, ``California Regulation for New 1996 and Later Heavy-Duty Off-Road Diesel Cycle Engines.'' California developed its test procedures by combining portions of the June 2 and June 30, 1992 versions of the test procedures being developed by the International Standards Organization as ISO&hyph;8178 test procedures recommended practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining the PM test procedures to adopt in the final rule, EPA considered the need for harmonization and enforceability. EPA determined that the California PM test procedures meet these two needs. First, this procedure ensures harmonization with the State of California, allowing manufacturers to design one engine for both the California and federal markets. The California procedures include the full range of the ISO&hyph;8178 recommended practices as published in June 1992, providing wide latitude for the conditions and methods used for PM measurement. EPA is not concerned with allowing the engine manufacturers to use the full latitude of ISO&hyph;8178 for certification testing because, as previously discussed, no PM emission reduction benefits are being claimed, and EPA has the ability to perform in-use compliance testing over the entire range of the ISO&hyph;8178 procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is confident that its ability to perform compliance testing using any procedure within the boundaries of ISO&hyph;8178 will ensure that engine manufacturers use good judgment in selecting their specific PM test procedures. At the same time, EPA recognizes the potential burden of liability for emission compliance over the entire range of conditions specified in ISO&hyph;8178. This burden results from an engine manufacturer's responsibility to comply with emission standards under any test conditions specified by the test procedures. Historically, when a range of test conditions exist, manufacturers choose to test with the conditions which are worst-case for emissions performance. To the extent that a manufacturer is unable to determine with certainty the worst-case conditions, it may be necessary to perform a number of emission tests which bracket the range of test condition combinations within the ISO&hyph;8178 procedures to ensure that the worst-case emissions are accounted for. Thus the burden to the manufacturer is increased testing dictated by the level of risk that a particular engine family would fail EPA testing (compliance or in-use) due to an unaccounted-for test condition specified in ISO&hyph;8178. However, EPA believes that the overriding concern expressed in the comments for harmonization outweighs the potential burden of liability to comply with a broad test procedure. Furthermore, the Agency does not have an alternative test procedure option that would ensure harmonization at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is satisfied that the adopted PM test procedures are implementable and enforceable. The Agency is prepared to review any proposals from the nonroad manufacturing industry to modify any portions of the PM test procedures that would narrow the scope of test conditions while maintaining the integrity of the procedures. EPA is not prepared to make its own proposal to tighten the test procedure specifications at this time as it might negatively impact harmonization for an emittant for which EPA is claiming no emission benefit in this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA considered adopting a modified version of its current on-highway engine test procedures for particulate contained in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N. This would address the flexibility issues regarding the ISO&hyph;8178 procedure, because subpart N has tighter measurement tolerances and specific methodologies and procedures for emission measurement. However, EPA did not have an effective means to address the various needs of the different manufacturers (that originally led to the broad range of options in ISO&hyph;8178) in the time frame of this rule without adversely affecting some manufacturers more than others. Additionally, this approach presented some risk that the test procedures developed from EPA's current regulations would contain some elements not in harmony with California and Europe. Since EPA believes the California PM test procedures will meet its needs and ensure harmony, development of its own procedures based on subpart N was determined less desirable at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, EPA considered, but rejected, adoption of the most recent United Nation draft version of ISO&hyph;8178. This draft represents the most current development of these test procedures and is compatible with current European plans. However, the United Nation's draft version of ISO&hyph;8178 must still go through a review process that could result in a number of additional changes and will likely take one to two years before being adopted. If EPA adopted the draft United Nations version, the Agency could eventually find itself to be in harmony with neither the California version nor the final adopted European version of ISO&hyph;8178.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Smoke Test Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters requested that EPA revise the on-highway smoke procedures in 40 CFR 86, Subpart I, which were proposed for this rule. The same revisions were requested under a separate EPA action that specifically focuses on technical clarification on the subpart I procedures. Since part 89 regulations directly reference the part 86 subpart I procedures, EPA will not consider these comments in this rule. Any revisions adopted under the separate EPA action of technical amendments to part 86 subpart I procedures will likewise apply to engines certified under part 89.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers point out that this test was specifically designed for on-highway truck engines and is less applicable to nonroad engine usage, but agree that this test is the best available at this time. In their comments, engine manufacturers agreed to use the on-highway smoke test procedures until more representative and globally harmonized smoke test procedures can be developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Transport officials defend BR sell-off plan 'A BUREAUCRATIC night-mare' is how Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour transport spokesman, described the bill for the privatisation of British Rail, published yesterday. Department of Transport officials rejected the accusation, pointing out that the bill's 158 pages left it looking relatively flimsy next to the 419-page tome that paved the way for the privatisation of the water industry in 1989. Even so, there is little doubting the complexity of the government's proposals. The chosen method of privatisation introduces three new quangos - Railtrack, which will own the tracks; a Rail Regulator to act as a watchdog; and a Franchise Director to franchise out the passenger services - and provides for a network of relationships between these and the private-sector train operators entering the rail market. As envisaged in the white paper published last July, the effect of the railways bill will be to split British Rail into two. Railtrack will own the tracks, and the other part will run the trains. The freight operations will be sold and the passenger services will be franchised. In addition, the railway tracks will in principle be open to any private-sector operators wanting to run new freight or passenger train services in competition with existing ones. However, the government has shown signs of retreating from this commitment in the face of hostility from would-be franchisees. Some idea of the government's motivation for privatising the railways can be gleaned from the preamble to the bill. It says subsidies will go on being paid to support lossmaking train services even after privatisation, so there will be no significant cuts in public spending in the short term. But it goes on to say: 'It is, however, anticipated that private-sector operation should, over time, allow railway services to be provided at lower cost to the Exchequer than would otherwise be the case'. The implication is that the private sector will be rather more efficient at operating trains than British Rail. The preamble also reveals that the rail regulator's office will employ up to 100 staff and cost up to Pounds 5m a year to run, while the franchising director's office will employ up to 175 staff and cost up to Pounds 10m a year to run. The bill itself provides for the setting-up of the rail regulator, the franchising director and the rail users' consultative committees - the new rail passengers' watchdogs - before going into the detail of how rail operators will be regulated. Companies wanting to run a train, station or maintenance depot will have to apply for a licence, it says, and anyone wanting to object to the application will have the right to do so. There are also tough rules to make sure that would-be train operators get access to all the tracks, stations and depots they need to operate a service. Every agreement between train operators and facility owners will have to be notified to the regulator for approval, together with any subsequent changes. The regulator will be able to force companies to open their facilities to other train operators if they do not do so willingly. Much of the rest of the bill is concerned with the technicalities of translating the ideas contained in last year's white paper into law, but some new information emerges. For example: One clause provides for franchisees to take control of the tracks in the franchise area as well as the trains if the franchising authority thinks it appropriate. The rail regulator and the franchising director will have the power to fine operators who breach the conditions of their licences or of their franchises. All UK public-sector bodies - including British Rail, London Underground or local authorities - will be excluded from becoming franchisees, but there is no mention in the bill of public-sector bodies from other countries. Consumer protection will be given added force by extending the Fair Trading Act to the railways. In times of national emergency the secretary of state will be able to re-assume control of the railways, directing the use of railway facilities as he or she wishes. The bill is expected to get its second reading early next month and to win Royal assent in October.</p>

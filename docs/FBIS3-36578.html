The crew's working programme for the period from February  5-7  included some astrophysical and medical experiments. The  cosmonauts also had to unload the "Progress M-21" cargo vehicle.  Several observations of the stellar sky were carried out in  accordance with the international "Roentgen" programme to study  extra-atmospheric astronomy.    A regular cycle of experiments was carried out with the use  of the "Maria" magnetic spectrometer. One of their tasks was to  determine the possible interconnection between the intensity of  the flow of elementary high-energy charged particles of cosmic  origin and the seismic activity on our planet.    A radio session is expected to take place today afternoon  between the crews of the Russian "Mir" space station and the  American "Discovery" vehicle.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Observer: Chairman talk There seems to be a bit of a shortage of chairmen of Britain's pharmaceutical companies. SmithKline Beecham did not have too much trouble persuading Sir Peter Walters to take its chair in April, but Zeneca seems to have taken its time to find a replacement for Sir Denys Henderson, and Fisons and Glaxo are both looking for figureheads. Fison's Patrick Egan wants to be gone within the year and Glaxo's Sir Paul Girolami quits in November. Of the two jobs, that at Glaxo is far and away the most appetising. So why the delay in filling the slot? Sir Sydney Lipworth, the former chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, has ruled himself out by taking Zeneca; Lord Kingsdown, the former governor of the Bank of England and Glaxo director, is a bit too old and Sir Peter Holmes, 61, the former boss of Shell, doesn't sound like he is interested. Pity the general election is a good two years away, because there would be no shortage of ex-Tory politicians looking for a safe berth. Of course, there is always that hardy old perennial Sir John Cuckney, a vice-chairman of Glaxo. But then he is even older than the outgoing Sir Paul.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO'S NEW VISION;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE CITY BY THE BAY IS SHEDDING ITS ISOLATIONIST AND ANTI-BUSINESS  ATTITUDES, AND JOINING ITS NEIGHBORS IN THE REGION TO CONFRONT GROWTH ISSUES.  </P> <P> Stung into awareness in the 1980s that it was no longer the undisputed  financial grande dame of the West, San Francisco heads into the '90s with much  of its gentility intact but with more of a team player mentality.  </P> <P> Long regarded as a haughty isolationist, San Francisco is suddenly asking not  what its region can do for it, but what it can do for the Bay Area, which has  boomed even as the city's job and population growth have stagnated.  </P> <P> San Francisco's newspapers recently devoted plenty of ink to the new Bay Vision  2020 Commission, an unprecedented public-private partnership with a one-year  mandate to halt the region's bickering and to chart a mutual course for  resolving crises in housing, transportation, land use, and air and water  quality.  </P> <P> And, in a switch from the past, San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos and other Bay  Area leaders traveled together last May to Asia to court Pacific Rim business,  and they plan further joint marketing efforts. By contrast, his predecessor,  Dianne Feinstein, was noted for her frequent solo travels to Asian nations to  pitch the merits of San Francisco.  </P> <P> Many San Franciscans say it's about time.  </P> <P> "San Francisco (has been) a terrible neighbor to the rest of the area, very  self-righteous," said Michael S. McGill, executive director of the Bay Area  Economic Forum, another new group seeking to broaden San Francisco's  perspective. "People realize that there's a need for a regional approach."  </P> <P> "That absolutely is the key to San Francisco's future," Agnos agreed. "There's  no way that our balkanized approach to doing business is going to succeed in  the 1990s."  </P> <P> Problem is, many San Francisco watchers acknowledge, this politically  fragmented, often fractious city seems uncertain about what exactly its role  should be -- advocate or adversary of growth within its own boundaries,  competitor or compatriot of Silicon Valley and the East Bay.  </P> <P> "It's a city in search of its future," said Joseph A. Wahed, senior vice  president and chief economist of Wells Fargo Bank.  </P> <P> In the past, San Franciscans have tended to become mired in narrow,  neighborhood issues, taking a regional-economy-be-damned approach.  </P> <P> As a result, the transition is bound to be rocky as San Francisco faces up to a  multitude of challenges: corporate job loss, costly housing, middle-class  exodus, clogged highways, strained public transit, pollution, competition from  Los Angeles and other West Coast cities and an image tarnished by the October  earthquake, the homeless, the AIDS crisis and a lingering reputation for being  anti-business.  </P> <P> Despite the litany, no one forecasts a Detroit-like economic breakdown for this  affluent city, especially in light of the grit and determination it  demonstrated in the aftermath of the Oct. 17 quake and its exemplary handling  of the AIDS epidemic.  </P> <P> Thanks to the growth of small businesses and specialized service jobs,  observers point out, the San Francisco economy remains vibrant. This is despite  the loss of as many as 50,000 corporate positions during the past decade  because of corporate parings, mergers and relocations.  </P> <P> In November, the city's unemployment rate was an enviable 3.2%, below the  statewide figure of 4.9% and 0.4% below the October figure. (A city research  analyst noted that much of the reduction was accounted for by a change in the  computation method.)  </P> <P> San Francisco is increasingly a center for "high value-added services" such as  law, accounting and consulting. It still provides most of the financial and  government services for the Bay Area. Although tourism dropped off markedly  after the quake, a full recovery is expected.  </P> <P> The city is also, the mayor said, putting renewed emphasis on clothing  manufacturing, film and TV production and the fishing industry, which are  expected to generate more jobs in the 1990s.  </P> <P> And it remains a mecca for free thinkers and entrepreneurs.  </P> <P> "San Francisco will undoubtedly lead the way in innovating many of the  businesses of tomorrow . . . with a lot of money behind them," said Alan D.  Mutter, a partner in a San Francisco-based media investment firm and former  city editor of the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper.  </P> <P> "But the future of San Francisco proper depends more and more on what happens  outside San Francisco. The future of San Francisco is Walnut Creek, Concord,  San Jose, Santa Rosa."  </P> <P> Such an idea might have seemed preposterous 20 years ago, when San Francisco  seemed to hold all the marbles.  </P> <P> Until the late 1960s, the city was relatively self-contained and fully  diversified, with a strong manufacturing base, dozens of headquarters offices  and a healthy tourist and retail trade. With its favorable climate and  attractive surroundings, San Francisco drew a gamut of businesses, from  financial institutions to wholesalers to lumber, food and transportation  companies.  </P> <P> Bank of America's 52-story headquarters, completed in 1969, started a swift  "Manhattanization," with skyscrapers dwarfing what had been a quaint skyline  punctuated by hilltop landmarks.  </P> <P> Driven by corporations' voracious appetites for space, San Francisco developers  for a time were putting up a whopping 1.6 million square feet of offices a  year. Vacancies hovered at just above zero, and rents for prime offices  skyrocketed.  </P> <P> The boom brought an influx of workers and cars -- and a backlash among  residents concerned about congestion and declining quality of life.  </P> <P> Under pressure from slow-growth advocates, the city in 1984 adopted a Downtown  Plan that sought to impose some limits on building, but frequent exemptions  granted to developers outraged opponents. Two years later, voters passed a  ballot proposition calling for permanent limits.  </P> <P> Simultaneously, businesses nationwide were facing other far-reaching phenomena:  deregulation, which forced cost-cutting moves, and the wave of mergers and  hostile takeovers.  </P> <P> Thousands of workers were laid off at such established San Francisco companies  as Crocker National Corp., which was swallowed up by Wells Fargo; Crown  Zellerbach, bought by corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith, and Southern  Pacific Co., which merged with Chicago's Santa Fe Railway. Bank of America and  Bechtel, big city-based employers, fell on hard times.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, some major employers -- notably Chevron, Pacific Telephone and Bank  of America -- chose to keep their headquarters in San Francisco, perhaps for  the prestige, but moved large numbers of back-office and technical workers to  office parks springing up in the East Bay, where land was plentiful and rents  were cheap.  </P> <P> (After soaring for a time to more than 20%, the current downtown vacancy rate  is 15.3%, according to Coldwell Banker Commercial, compared to 13.4% in Los  Angeles and nearly 20% for cities nationwide.)  </P> <P> San Francisco was ill prepared for the sudden economic transition. Workers  moved into ever more distant suburbs and began commuting in a haphazard manner  that even the region's highly touted but piecemeal transit system could not  begin to accommodate.  </P> <P> Middle-class migration left San Francisco with a polarized collection of  affluent white-collar professionals and poorly paid service workers.  </P> <P> As the East Bay, Silicon Valley to the south and Marin County to the north  flourished, San Francisco became the "hole in the doughnut of the economy,"  according to Walter E. Hoadley, former chief economist at B of A and now a  senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution in Stanford.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, opportunities have been lost in the last decade or two to pull  together," Hoadley said, decrying the lack of cohesive leadership in the  nine-county, 98-city region. "The future depends upon avoiding conflicts and  capitalizing on the economic dynamism that runs across boundaries."  </P> <P> The region at large has accounted for job and population growth of late, even  as San Francisco proper has stagnated. According to the Palo Alto-based Center  for Continuing Study of the California Economy, the number of jobs in San  Francisco has remained flat since 1985, totaling 567,300 in 1988. During the  same period, the region has added half a million jobs.  </P> <P> Population in the city has grown by only 50,000 to 731,000, whereas in the  region it has spurted to 5.8 million from 5.1 million. Last year, San Jose, a  fruit-canning town turned high-tech center, surpassed San Francisco to become  the nation's 12th-largest city.  </P> <P> In the 1990s, the region is expected to add 700,000 jobs and 1 million people.  </P> <P> With the growth in outlying areas, executives say, a major regional issue is  land use planning. Housing, not job location, now dictates where people live.  Many workers migrate to outposts such as Vacaville, 50 miles northeast of the  city, or Modesto, 80 miles east, and commute an hour or more to offices in  Livermore. That, in turn, strains highways and defies a quick fix with public  transit.  </P> <P> Hoadley foresees that "we will build solid between here and Sacramento in the  next 10 years."  </P> <P> This sprawl, disparagingly dubbed "Los Angelization," prompts a comparison to  clogged Southern California that San Franciscans find distasteful. Yet the  trend continues.  </P> <P> B of A, for one, recently announced plans to build a $125-million office  complex on a 100-acre alfalfa field in Vacaville for as many as 2,000  employees.  </P> <P> Richard A. Clarke, chairman and chief executive of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric,  acknowledges that San Francisco businesses "probably have not done a good job"  of putting the jobs where people live.  </P> <P> As a result, he said, one challenge of the '90s will be "preserving the quality  of the environment while managing and dealing with the congestion."  </P> <P> In compact San Francisco (at 46 square miles, the city is about the size of  Long Beach), homes are among the nation's most expensive, and affordable  housing strikes many as an oxymoron. But environmentalists and community  activists keep trying to force the construction of housing, even if it comes at  the expense of business development.  </P> <P> "San Francisco assumes that we'll export our housing needs to the suburbs,"  said Sue Hestor, an attorney and an influential advocate for rehabilitating  buildings in Chinatown and other sections to provide affordable housing. She  contends that the city has been "irresponsible."  </P> <P> One problem is that any significant development in San Francisco faces a long,  costly approval process.  </P> <P> Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp., for example, claims finally -- after nearly 10  years of planning -- to be on the verge of an agreement with the city for  development of a former rail yard into a $1.5-billion office, residential and  light manufacturing complex called Mission Bay.  </P> <P> The 315-acre development, south of Market Street, must pass muster first with  city officials and then with voters, possibly in November.  </P> <P> The project has required "sensitive and delicate negotiations," Agnos said, on  such issues as the amount of moderately priced housing and the disposal of any  toxics that might be uncovered.  </P> <P> Many such efforts have been stymied or delayed by a lack of cooperation between  business and government, said James K. Ho, deputy mayor for business and  economic development. "The public and private sectors have not worked well  together," he said.  </P> <P> Similarly, neighborhood and slow-growth groups have resisted a Newport Beach  developer's plans to turn an up-and-coming section of the bayfront into a yacht  harbor and hotel, which would be the first on the waterfront. Meanwhile, port  officials are eager for the commercial development because they need the income  that it generates to continue improving maritime facilities, which, along with  Oakland's, have seen a dramatic loss of market share to other West Coast ports.  </P> <P> San Franciscans have repeatedly "divided up into little camps" over growth  issues, to the detriment of the city's economic well-being, said Kent O. Sims,  president of the San Francisco Economic Development Corp., a business-funded  group.  </P> <P> Sims created some shock waves around City Hall with a provocative "white  paper," published the morning of the earthquake, that cited single-issue  politics and a lack of widely embraced leadership as major constraints on  economic growth.  </P> <P> But Ho said progress in building business for San Francisco and the Bay Area is  being made. After the visit of Agnos and other Bay Area leaders to Asia, a  prominent group of Pacific Rim nation executives decided to hold a major trade  and finance symposium in San Francisco this September. Previous gatherings  sponsored by the group were held in Sydney and Hong Kong.  </P> <P> San Francisco, Ho added, is increasingly realizing that it needs to bury its  rivalries with other Bay Area communities and promote cooperation, particularly  when it comes to marketing the region as to the Pacific Rim.  </P> <P> "Why compete with each other?" he said. "If San Jose gains, we gain. If we get  hurt, everybody gets hurt. The (Bay) Bridge came down, we got hurt, too."  </P> <P> Agnos noted that emphasis will be on making presentations that sell the Bay  Area, not just San Francisco, as a market for Asian goods and as a source for  products and services.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> APARTMENT LAW MODIFIED  </P> <P> In a modification of its crackdown on illegal additions and bootleg apartments,  the City Council decided this week that violators who turn themselves in during  the three-month amnesty period may delay correcting the violation until their  property is sold or transferred.  </P> <P> The council in February adopted a program to enforce various city codes in an  effort to combat an increasing number of bootleg units, such as converted  garages.  </P> <P> Residents were given a 90-day amnesty period, until June 30, to report their  violations. They were not fined and were given three years to bring their  property into compliance.  </P> <P> On Monday, however, the council heard testimony from more than a dozen property  owners who complained that the crackdown was forcing them to pay for code  violations they did not know about when they bought their properties.  </P> <P> City Atty. Eleanor Egan told the council that it could not enact a "grandfather  clause" to pardon past offenses without allowing present homeowners the same  leeway to violate the codes.  </P> <P> The council voted 4 to 1 to extend the original amnesty period by three months  and to postpone enforcement until the property is sold if violators report  themselves. In such cases, city officials said, homeowners would be able to  continue renting the bootleg apartments, provided there are no health or safety  violations.  </P> <P> Homeowners who do not turn themselves in during the amnesty period will be  given a year to bring their properties into conformance.  </P> <P> Councilman Jim Boulgarides, who said he favors stricter enforcement, voted  against the motion.  </P></p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shephard says probe of French pig aid does not go far enough UK agriculture minister Mrs Gillian Shephard yesterday welcomed European Commission moves to investigate alleged illegal state aid to French pig producers but said they did not go far enough. Speaking at the farm council in Brussels, Mrs Shephard said: 'Although the French authorities announced two schemes, for FFr30m (Pounds 3.5m) and FFr300m in September and October last year, the commission action appears to be against only the first scheme.' Britain's National Farmers' Union, complaining to Brussels last week, said the French payments were causing the UK pig industry to bleed to death. Urging swift action by the commission, Mrs Shephard said pig producers throughout the European Union had suffered for the past year from oversupply, because of an expansion in pig herds in most member states. 'France is as much to blame as anyone,' she said. 'By introducing its own national measures, the French government adds to the problems in every other country, and rewards its own producers who have contributed to the oversupply and current market difficulties.' Special aid is not the only form of financial support for continental pig producers that encourages expansion and puts British producers at a disadvantage, according to a report by the UK Meat and Livestock Commission. Corporate tax arrangements are more flexible in Denmark, France and the Netherlands than in Britain, it says. 'The main areas of flexibility that could be encouraged in Britain are in the depreciation of capital investment, the ability to average net income over a three- to five-year period and the use of tax credits for training.' Institutions lending to pig farmers see them as a lower risk on the continent than is the case in Britain, and price stabilisation schemes also help, the report says. It adds that 'a striking feature of the Danish, French and Dutch pig production systems is the degree of producer co-operation, normally encouraged by respective governments.' This provides strong links between producers, processors and retailers, improved power when buying supplies, and an ability to negotiate advantageous loans. 'Whereas almost 100 per cent of pig production in Denmark, France and Netherlands is covered by collaborative arrangements, the coverage for Britain is only about 40 per cent.' The report says a British ban on the use of sow tethers and stalls in 1999 will bring extra costs for producers compared with their European counterparts. 'This change is a watershed and may result in major disinvestment by a significant proportion of the industry,' it concludes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GH: "Belgium To Give 100 million Belgian </F> Francs in Emergency Aid for Rwanda"]    [Text] Tomorrow [17 June] the cabinet will approve the  earmarking of 100 million Belgian francs [BFr] to alleviate the  misery of people hit by the Rwandan civil war. Naturally in the  first place this will concern Rwandan refugees, but Tanzania,  which has the largest refugee camp on its territory, can also  count on aid.    The aid has already been approved in principle, but will now  be paid out in practice. Four organizations (Doctors Without  Frontiers, Caritas, the Red Cross, and Oxfam-Belgium) will  assign the funds. Since they have already incurred considerable  expenses before the money has reached their bank accounts, the  government is also promising to reimburse any bank interest  charges.    In addition to the large amount of BFr100 million in direct  aid, it has also been decided to release BFr14 million in order  to rebuild Tanzania's food stocks. These strategic stocks have  recently fallen very sharply. The aim is to supply the  equivalent of some 4,000 tonnes of grain which will be used for  both the Tanzanian population and Rwandan refugees.    A similar amount will be spent to dig water wells in the  regions where the refugees are located. By sending aid to the  local population and the refugees, the organizations hope to  avoid tension between the two groups.    The State Secretariat for Development Cooperation has  announced that further emergency aid will be approved as soon as  new project proposals have been received. The money will be  taken out of the existing emergency aid fund (which increased to  BFr500 million in 1994) and the structural aid fund to Rwanda.  The State Secretariat believes that this trend toward increased  emergency aid spending is regrettable, but that it can not be  avoided at this moment.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Restricted growth at Allied Textile FALLING INTEREST rates restricted first half pre-tax profits growth at Allied Textile Companies, one of the UK's biggest textile manufacturers. The company reported a pre-tax figure of Pounds 5.32m (Pounds 5.21m) for the six months to March 31, representing growth of 2.1 per cent. The textiles part of the business saw pre-tax profits rise from Pounds 3.51m to Pounds 4.26m. But profits from the financial activities, including rental property and a cash pile of more than Pounds 27m, fell from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.06m. The fall in financial income 'reflected the substantial reduction in interest rates,' said Mr Peter Honeysett, chairman of the Huddersfield-based company. He was optimistic on the textiles side, stating that trading performance would continue to improve. 'Sales volumes have still to respond fully to the better trading sentiment experienced in some areas of the business,' he said. The figures would also be helped as the benefits of capital spending in 1991-92 took effect. The full year figures, however, would be affected by the timing of property disposals 'which cannot be determined with any accuracy,' said Mr Honeysett. Since February, the company has won planning permission to change the use of two of its industrial sites to housing. Earnings per share rose from 12.38p to 12.57p and the interim dividend is raised from 4.5p to 4.6p.</p>

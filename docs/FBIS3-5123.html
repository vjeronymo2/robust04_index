Miguel Puentes said the South Korean puppets could not break  the indomitable faith and will of Yi In-mo despite all their  attempts to make him recant his belief.    The indomitable fighting spirit shown by Yi is a precious  example for the revolutionaries of the whole world, he stressed.    Yi said he is leading a happy life to his heart's content as  he has the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    He expressed thanks to the fraternal Cuban people who had  vigorously conducted the solidarity movement for his  repatriation.</p>

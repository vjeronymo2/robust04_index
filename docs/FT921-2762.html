			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Decline in property markets behind losses at Wimpey THE DEEP recessions in UK and US property markets were the main reason for Wimpey's decline into the red last year. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, said trading conditions in both countries were the worst in 'living memory.' Group operating profit, before exceptional write-downs of Pounds 46.4m mainly on US and UK housing land, tumbled from Pounds 97.6m to Pounds 59.4m. Interest charges, however, fell from Pounds 41.5m to Pounds 29.1m reflecting the group's efforts to reduce borrowings through disposals. A divisional breakdown of Wimpey's performance in 1991 showed: Contracting: This was the only division to record an improvement, with profits rising from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 11.2m. This was after a Pounds 12m provision to cover its share of potential losses on the Channel tunnel construction contract. Mr Dwyer said that he still expected to make a profit on the contract which would enable the provision to be clawed back. Contracting profits last year were helped by a strong performance by the offshore oil and gas fabrication businesses before they were sold to a subsidiary of Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction, mining and engineering group. At the end of last year the construction order book stood at Pounds 700m compared with Pounds 1.15bn at the end of 1990. Homes: Housebuilding, mostly in the UK and US, saw profits almost halve from Pounds 51.7m in 1990 to Pounds 26.2m last year. House sales in the UK rose from 6,263 to 6,380. Averfrom Pounds 67,200 to Pounds 65,500 as margins continued to be squeezed. Sales of homes, worldwide, fell from 8,747 to 8,061. However, Mr Dwyer said that housing markets in the UK and in northern California and Florida had recently shown signs of improving. The group, following recent land purchases, owned 14,720 plots with planning permission in the UK, equivalent to about 2 1/2 years' supply at current rates of production Minerals: Profits from minerals fell from Pounds 26.3m to Pounds 17.4m. Aggregate sales in the UK held up well, although prices and margins had come under pressure. US operations had suffered from the general recession in construction and also from moratoria which had been placed on infrastructure spending in a number of states. Property: Sales of properties helped to generate profits of Pounds 4.5m compared with Pounds 18m. More important was the impact of sales on cashflow, which was Pounds 107m to the positive last year after disposals. This enabled the company to reduce net debt by Pounds 99m to Pounds 206.4m. Still to come this year is the cash from the sale for Pounds 110m of the 50 per cent stake of the Little Britain office development in central London and from the Pounds 45m sale of St Alphage House, also in central London. The group has written down the value of its investment properties by Pounds 28m. This has been more than offset by a revaluation surplus of Pounds 45m on operational properties occupied by the group.  ------------------------------------------------------ WIMPEY DIVISIONAL SALES AND TRADING PROFIT (POUNDS M)  ------------------------------------------------------                      Turnover       Trading profit                    1991    1990   1991         1990  ------------------------------------------------------ Homes             585.4   658.0   26.2         51.7 Contracting       777.2   917.0   11.2          3.2 Minerals          290.6   297.9   17.4         26.3 Property           40.4    54.0    4.5         18.0 Technology/other   59.6    50.1    0.1         -1.6 Total           1,753.2 1,977.0   59.4         97.6  ------------------------------------------------------ Source:Wimpey  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

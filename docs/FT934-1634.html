			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: PhoneLink loss widens to Pounds 0.3m PhoneLink, the USM-quoted computing services company, said yesterday that its development of an 'information supermarket' was on course for a launch in 1994. Announcing a pre-tax loss of Pounds 301,000 in the six months to September 30 against a Pounds 2,000 deficit last time, the Birkenhead-based company said its performance was in line with market expectations. It warned that development costs of its unique Tel-Me system, which extracts information from commercial computer databases faster and more economically than existing technology, was about to enter its most expensive stage. In spite of the large-scale investment necessary to launch the system, PhoneLink said its losses had been contained by increased oper-ating efficiency at its Prenton plant near Liverpool. Mr Trevor Burke, chief executive and founder of the company, said savings of almost Pounds 2m at Prenton resulted in lower than expected operating losses of Pounds 484,000, compared with a Pounds 7,000 profit last time. Development costs for Tel-Me were offset by improved turnover in the DataCare business, a bulk database service for large corporations. DataCare was wholly responsible for a 79 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 586,000. It also generated gross profits of Pounds 359,000 (Pounds 212,000) before operating expenses associated with Tel-Me. Losses per share emerged at 0.8p. PhoneLink's shares, which rose sharply earlier this year after IBM decided to market Tel-Me, closed 5p higher at 325p. They were placed in May at 155p.</p>

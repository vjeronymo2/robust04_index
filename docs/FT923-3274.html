			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Top Tory may be invited to TUC MRS Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, or even Mr John Major, the prime minister, may be the central attraction at next year's Trades Union Congress in Brighton. Yesterday, as this year's congress closed, several union leaders were floating the idea of inviting a senior cabinet minister next year. The most memorable moment of this year's congress came when Mr Howard Davies became the first director-general of the Confederation of British Industry to address the TUC. A controversial invitation would stave off the growing public indifference towards the annual congress and serve to underline the unions' increasing independence from the Labour party. Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, welcomed the idea of inviting a senior member of the government. The two events that had attracted the most positive attention for the TUC in recent years were the address in 1988 by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and that by Mr Da-vies this year, he said. 'It would have many advantages,' Mr Edmonds said. 'We are confident of our own ideas and values and I don't feel threatened by hearing contrary views.' Mr Tony Young, leader of the NCU communications union, said an address by a cabinet minister was a good idea. Governments and unions should have more dialogue, he added. The AEEU craft union is already planning to invite Mrs Shephard to address its executive later this year, but Mr Gavin Laird, the union's general secretary, said that such an invitation to the TUC might be a 'step too far'. Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, leader of Nupe, the public-services union, struck a cautious note. 'I would like to see more change in the government's position on trade unions before giving it more serious consideration,' he said. Mrs Shephard might find an invitation to the TUC hard to resist. Although she is pressing ahead this autumn with another round of tough legislation - inherited from her hardline predecessor Mr Michael Howard - she has also announced that the 'war' with the unions is at an end.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Bangkok driven potty as traffic jams grow longer DON'T LEAVE home without one  - a potty, that is  - drivers in Bangkok have been warned. The Thai government also said they should take emergency supplies of food and water. This alarmist advice follows a week in which Thailand's capital, famous for its traffic jams, excelled itself. Nightmare snarl-ups paralysed the city for hours, stranded children at school until after midnight and delayed international flights, prompting the government to advise drivers to carry rations and chamber pots  - just in case. Commuters took up to six hours to drive a few miles; on most routes there is no alternative to road transport. At a school in north Bangkok parents started arriving to collect their children at 11pm on Wednesday  - the last pupil left at 2am. The jams played havoc with airline schedules because passengers and aircrew were unable to reach the airport. The immediate cause of the chaos was the monsoon rain, but the real culprits are successive Thai governments which have doggedly refused to plan the capital's growth or build public transport networks. Wednesday evening's congestion, exacerbated by the flooding of the airport road and by cars running out of petrol after hours of crawling through the streets, was possibly the worst in the capital's history. Bangkokians have developed a peculiar culture to deal with the physical and mental strains of their predicament. Even people of relatively modest means employ a driver and use the back seat of the car as a secondary office, complete with newspapers, a mobile telephone and sometimes a television. An invitation to lunch is followed by a period of delicate negotiation. Each party attempts to name a restaurant close to their office, and the loser is permitted to be late and to boast of the appalling traffic jam which trapped them. Traffic lights often add to the misery. Many are operated by hand, and one set has been known to take 18 minutes to change. Motorcycle taxi drivers have developed a lucrative trade, weaving in and out of lines of stationary cars and buses. But on Wednesday night, some commuters simply stopped at the nearest restaurant and enjoyed an unscheduled meal while waiting for the roads to clear. Bangkok's traffic congestion threatens to choke the country's dynamic economy. Some expatriates have moved to the more efficient and less polluted island of Singapore, rather than struggle to reach meetings in Bangkok. Work on two mass transit projects  - both including elevated railways - is expected to start shortly, but it will be several years before they relieve the congestion on the roads. In fact, the construction work will make matters worse.</p>

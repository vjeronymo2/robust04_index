The Committee, a consultative  forum which meets every 18 months and involves essentially  economic experts from the Union and ASEAN, spent much of its  latest meeting hammering out ways of improving trade, industrial  cooperation and the possibilities of direct European investment,  technology transfer and financing.    The meeting agreed that market access should be widened in  areas such as intellectual property and services, a point on  which EU officials had voiced particular concern, as they did  over the lack of progress made by the members of ASEAN in  reducing their nontariff barriers despite the commitment the  latter made to do so during the Uruguay Round multilateral trade  negotiations. The Europeans are also keen to see a more  concerted ASEAN approach on tariff reductions, which vary widely  from one country to another.    On the ASEAN side, much was made of the difficulties of  access to the European market for products such as tinned tuna.  "These concerns could be lessened by regular consultations  designed to clarify specific problems, coupled with assurances  from the EU that its market would remain open to ASEAN  products," declared the ASEAN spokeswoman, Delia Albert. Things  may not prove as straightforward as ASEAN would like, as one of  the main obstacles to market access for ASEAN products is EU  quality requirements, according to the European Commission's  Director-General for North-South Relations, Juan Prat. The EU,  which is ASEAN's third largest trade partner after Japan and the  United States (bilateral trade amounted to 54 billion dollars in  1993), nonetheless remains committed to supporting the 15-year  free trade programme just launched by the six members of the  Association (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,  Singapore and Thailand).</p>

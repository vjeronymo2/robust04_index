			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by economics department reporter Naoya Tsuchiya] </F>   [Text] An official at a U.S. bank in Japan makes no attempt  to conceal his discontent, saying, "The Tokyo offshore markets  are replete with restrictions." Overseas short-term financial  markets are flooded with high-tech financial instruments such as  swaps, but the Tokyo offshore market deals only in the trading  of limited capital instruments. It is said that "foreign banks  cannot even deal in bonds or commercial paper."    The unofficial U.S. Government itemized listing of requested  deregulating actions made public in the latter part of May  included a request for further deregulation of the offshore  markets. Ministry of Finance [MOF] officials display an air of  calmness, saying, "We have not received any specific requests,"  but they are unable to conceal a bit of bewilderment at the  sudden surfacing of the topic of deregulating offshore markets.  This is obviously a case where the wishes of U.S. banks in Tokyo  have been conveyed to the U.S. Government.    An offshore market is defined as one in which the  procurement  and management of capital by nonresident entities such as  foreign governments and firms is allowed. In December 1986, an  offshore market in the format of an international banking  facility (IBF), separate from domestic transactions in Japan,  was established.    Offshore transactions are exempt from the burden of reserve  deposits as well as withholding taxes. Such features provide for  capital transactions that are appealing because of lower costs.  Offshore transactions are used to fill overseas investor needs  for yen capital. According to MOF International Finance Bureau  officials, they were initiated with fanfare given to the goal of  "globalizing the yen and nurturing Tokyo into an international  market."    As far as residential entities such as Japanese firms and  individuals are concerned, only foreign exchange banks can  participate in the offshore markets. Further, because of the  fear that domestic transactions will be routed to offshore  transactions since the latter are not subject to tax withholding  actions, Japanese banks are required to establish special  accounts to handle offshore transactions.    Specific methods prescribed to segregate domestic and  offshore transactions include 1) measures to prevent excess  receipts on a monthly basis on the domestic side on  disbursements and receipts of capital between offshore and  domestic transaction accounts, and 2) limiting the daily amount  of capital gathered from offshore markets into domestic  transaction accounts to 10 percent of the average operating  balance for nonresident entities in the prior month.    In the offshore markets of New York which have required  similar segregation of domestic and offshore transactions, the  only requirement is an obligation to establish a reserve account  even if capital is gathered into domestic accounts. There are no  quantitative limitations such as in Japan, placing Tokyo in a  category where strict regulations still exist even from an  international perspective.    In reality, the Tokyo offshore market is plagued by slow  growth. It grew at the rate of $200 billion a year for three  years after initiation based on asset balances reflected in  Japanese banks' offshore accounts, but growth since then has  been very slow. Recently, yen-denominated transactions have  grown faster than dollar-denominated transactions and  dollar-denominated assets have grown because of the strong yen,  but according to city bank sources, the real situation is such  that "markets have hardly grown at all."    The Tokyo offshore market is notorious because of a  proliferation of restrictions, but there was a time when  regulations were relaxed. Limitations on daily capital gathered  into domestic accounts were doubled in 1989. However, that  action did not lead to a subsequent expansion in market scale.    The foremost goal of foreign capital in the area of  deregulation is the abolishment of segregation in capital flow.  There are those who claim that Bank of Japan [BOJ] manipulation  of financial markets will not be completely effective unless  capital transactions are segregated, but many foreign banks  point out that "BOJ methods for market manipulation are  sophisticated to the degree where there should be no adverse  impact from abolishing capital segregation from offshore  markets." Even within the BOJ, there is the view that "there is  no need to insist on capital segregation."    In fact, the MOF's Tax Bureau opposes the direct abolishment  of regulation. It fears that "such a move may lead to talk of  abolishing tax withholdings on domestic capital transactions and  there is the atmosphere that they don't even wish to discuss the  matter because of a serious situation being confronted in the  form of inadequate tax revenues.    Failure of the Tokyo offshore market to grow symbolizes the  stalemate in the globalization of the Tokyo market. Deregulation  of offshore markets is indispensable in the stimulation of  markets. It is only a matter of time before foreign pressure  increases, even if strong resistance is posed by supervisory  authorities such as the MOF. Success or failure of further  market opening actions can be considered as serving as a test in  determining whether Tokyo markets can respond to another demand  for globalization.</p>

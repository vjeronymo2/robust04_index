			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor </F> Krejci; place and date not given: "The Decline in the Balance  of Trade Is a Peripheral Occurrence"]    [Text] [Krejci] Following the government session, you  said that the majority of economic indicators are favorable.  However, according to the Czech Statistical Office's figures,  the balance of trade--that means the difference between exports  and imports--is worsening. This means that the export and  import curves are more and more divergent. In your view, what  has caused this occurrence?    [Klaus] This is merely a partial occurrence. Last year, we  had an absolutely enormous and unexpected increase in exports,  which far outstripped the increase in comparable countries and  the increase in exports in Europe, where stagnation continued.  Compared with the large increase in 1993, the figures for 1994  are positive, it is true, but, in view of their immense starting  point, they are far lower than last year. Moreover, the balance  of payments and other elements of our financial, commercial, and  other exchanges abroad--and not only as far as goods are  concerned--are a more important indicator than the balance of  trade. You know very well that tourism plays a major role.  There are countries in which it is so strong--Austria, for  example--that their imports are always greater than their  exports. This difference is covered in the long term by income  from tourism. So, in my opinion, it is wrong to infer any more  far-reaching conclusions.    [Krejci] In this context, views are being expressed that the  government's approach toward supporting exports should be  changed.    [Klaus] We have discussed this in the government many times,  and it is not the majority view. This involves a quest by the  exporters, who are lobbying and going around all of our  institutions to obtain certain further advantages for exports.  I do not know of any export company, however, for which the  state could in some fundamental way conjure up a place in the  sun so that, on this basis, it can gain a foothold on world  markets. It is primarily the company itself that must do this,  and the role of the state in all of these matters really is just  a peripheral and supplementary one. This is the fantasy of  enterprises that in the past were used to something else.    [Krejci] The government has discussed an amendment to the  banking law. You have said, in this context, that the matter of  insuring bank deposits is a secondary issue that should be  resolved only in the future. Why?    [Klaus] I did not say "a secondary issue." The draft  amendment had two elements. The first concerns the extent to  which the central bank may intervene directly in the  independent, private commercial banks. The second concerns  whether and how to start insuring deposits. In this connection,  I said that we consider the issue of the banks' possible  supervision and regulation to come first and that of insurance  to come only second.    We really see no reason to stitch together a law with a hot  needle because we had a problem with a few small banks.  Insuring deposits is a problematic issue, because, in  principle, it is up to the individual to decide where to deposit  his money. This forms part of the decisionmaking of each of us,  and the simple and guaranteed insurance of deposits would mean  wiping out an individual's responsibility for where he has  deposited his money.    Second, this would mean a massive reduction in the  responsibility of bankers as such. For them, not only the fact  that they lose some of their capital is a punishment. The fact  that they cause difficulties for thousands of depositors is also  a punishment. Such bankers are consequently written off for  good, and they have not the slightest chance of ever again being  able to operate in this branch. It is necessary to put extra  pressure on bankers. That is, they behave far more  circumspectly if they do not have the certitude of the generous  insurance of deposits and have to strive at all costs themselves  to bolster the finances entrusted to them. On the other hand,  there is an undertaking to protect the citizen-saver. And,  somewhere on the borderline between these two interests, it is  necessary to find a perfectly balanced form of insuring deposits.    [Krejci] As far as supervising the Czech National Bank is  concerned, the point was that the ownership rights of private  people could have been infringed. What kind of guidelines  should there be here? Where should supervision extend, and  where should it not extend?    [Klaus] We do not want to infringe the rights of private  entities. Therefore, we are a little reluctant about giving any  extraordinary powers to the central bank. However, making money  is something completely different from making watches or ties.  When the tie manufacturer fails, nothing happens. When the  money-maker fails, this has serious consequences for the whole  of society. In this case, it is very difficult to find the  right borderline. The fact that we have not approved the  amendment to the banking law does not mean that we do not want  to get tough and deal with this issue.    [Krejci] The Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak  People's Party [KDU-CSL] has called upon the other governing  parties to discuss the situation within the coalition, with the  proviso that this would involve a kind of assessment after two  years of coalition government. How do you or the Civic  Democratic Party [ODS] view this proposal?    [Klaus] If I want to conduct an assessment, I have to begin  with myself. The KDU-CSL would do well to think about how much  it contributes to the coalition squabbles or how much someone  else contributes to it, inasmuch as whatever unsettles the  public and the coalition are the issues that this party drags  out. I would begin here, and I would not ask for a sweeping  assessment. The ODS decided at its political board meeting that  of course it accepts this activity by its coalition partner and  that it will attend such meetings. Nevertheless, it itself will  not prepare any written material on this subject in advance. We  do not feel the need for such an assessment, and, moreover, we  feel that improving relations within the coalition does not  depend on whether we put something down on paper. That is to  say, I do not know how such a paper can erect a dam against the  various utterings of the gentlemen deputies from the Civic  Democratic Alliance, the KDU-CSL, or the Christian Democratic  Party.</p>

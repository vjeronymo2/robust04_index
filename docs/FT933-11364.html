			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Third foreign bank may join Ferfin talks as consultant FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the Italian holding company staggering under total borrowings of about L31,000bn, (Dollars 19.6bn) may be facing increasing difficulties in persuading banks to keep open lines of credit, in spite of expressions of support by foreign bank creditors earlier this week. A meeting yesterday of the five big Italian banks working on a rescue plan for the group, which also lies at the heart of a growing storm concerning alleged bribes to politicians over the Enimont chemicals venture, is believed to have proposed bringing in a third foreign bank as a 'consultant'. Citibank could join Societe Generale of France and UBS, which have already been asked to act as advisers to the Italian five-bank committee and to the Ferruzzi group, according to one banker present. The suggestions that Ferfin may be facing serious financing difficulties came as Mr Guido Rossi, its new chairman, was questioned by Milan magistrates monitoring the rescue plan. The interrogation is believed to have concerned Ferfin's plans for Fondiaria, the big insurance company it controls through the quoted Gaic holding company. In recent weeks, minority shareholders in Gaic, which is controlled jointly by Ferfin and heirs of the late Mr Camillo De Benedetti, have been complaining about a proposed Fondiaria rights issue, which could see control of the insurer pass from Gaic to Ferfin's five main creditor banks. Whereas the Societe Generale and UBS are believed to have a substantial exposure to Ferruzzi group companies, Cititbank's lending is thought to be about L100bn. The decision to bring in a third foreign bank is to quell anxieties among some of Ferfin's foreign bank creditors, which have lent around L6,500bn, regarding the rescue plan, due to be presented by end-August. Some banks, uneasy about the group's financial position and suspicious about the rescue, are believed to have sharply reduced their credit lines, affecting Ferfin's operations.</p>

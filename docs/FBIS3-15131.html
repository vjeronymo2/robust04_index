Are they going in the right direction? What  has already been done in this sphere, and what is planned in the  very near future? These are not easy questions. Answers to  them were given at a news conference held by the Russian  Federation Defense Ministry Information and Press Directorate.  It was addressed by Colonel General V. Zhurbenko, first deputy  chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff;  Lieutenant General G. Ivanov, chief of the Russian Federation  Defense Ministry Military Building and Reforms Directorate;  Lieutenant General G. Bochayev, first deputy chief of the  General Staff Main Organization and Mobilization Directorate;  and representatives of other directorates of the General Staff  and Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation.    The occasion for this was the Russian president's message to  the Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian State." As  is known, one of its sections is devoted to an analysis and  assessment of the reforms in the Army and to what the Russian  Armed Forces should be like in the very near future.    "The Armed Forces are going through a very complex stage in  their development today," Col. Gen. Zhurbenko pointed out. "It  is necessary simultaneously to implement measures to create the  Russian Army and to withdraw troops from East and Central  European countries and also the Baltic countries."    Naturally, all this cannot fail to leave its mark on the  processes taking place in the Army. Not a single army in the  world is thought to have tackled such large-scale and complex  tasks. And yet not so much time has elapsed since it started to  be reformed. The building of the Russian Armed Forces began 7  May 1992 -- with the promulgation of the president's edict on  the creation of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. During  this time the Ministry of Defense has been formed, the actual  state of the Armed Forces has been analyzed, the concept of  their building has been elaborated and approved by the  president, directive instructions on combat and mobilization  readiness and on operational and strategic planning have been  drawn up, a number of legislative acts on military questions  have been prepared....    Nevertheless, as the president's message pointed out, the  set  tasks have been fulfilled in the Armed Forces. The reforms in  the Armed Forces are going according to plan. If they had also  been backed up with the necessary funding, I believe that many  questions would have been resolved far more quickly.    In conclusion, one more figure: Since 7 May 1992 the  authorized strength of the Armed Forces has been reduced by  457,000 men.</p>

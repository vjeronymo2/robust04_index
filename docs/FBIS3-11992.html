The evidence found  links Velandia to the arrest, disappearance, and murder of Nidia  Erica Bautista, a woman who was an M-19 member. Several men  arrested Nidia on a Bogota street the day her son made his first  communion in August 1987.    [Begin Janet Bautista, Nidia's sister, recording] The  deposition given by former Officer Bernardo Alfonso Garzon, who  was then an active member of the 13th Counterintelligence  Brigade, is very clear. He said the brigade commander at the  time, Velandia, knew of and approved the plan to murder Nidia.  [end recording]    Based on several testimonies, the guerrilla's body appeared  at the Guayabetal Cemetery three years later. The Attorney  General's Office is saying today Velandia, who was a colonel and  the commanding officer of the Chavez Solano Intelligence  Battalion at that time, knew of and authorized those events.    [Begin Erick Arellana, Nidia's son, recording] This is the  first step we have seen after waiting for so long and suffering  so much. I feel it is important, because for so many years  nothing was done. [end recording]    The investigation has also implicated Sergeant Julio Roberto  Ortega in this case. It is charged he played an active role in  Nidia Bautista's disappearance. Now, the soldiers will be able  to present their defense, which will be evaluated by the  Attorney General's Office before giving its final assessment.</p>

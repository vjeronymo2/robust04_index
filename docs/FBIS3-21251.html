			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Science and Technology Director-General Eda's report  on the 1993 Nuclear Energy Safety White Paper was acknowledged  at a Cabinet meeting on 30 November. The white paper focuses on  the use of plutonium in nuclear power plants, an issue that has  gained international attention, and gives a detailed account of  the safety measures set forth by the Nuclear Safety Commission  (Yasuyoshi Togo, chairman) for light water reactors (LWRs),  advanced thermal converter reactors (ATRs), and fast breeder  reactors (FBRs). The paper notes that plutonium use in power  plants already has a good safety record and cites the fact that  plutonium, converted from uranium, has been burned inside  nuclear power plants and accounts for 30% of Japan's  atomic  energy.    (Summary on p 7)    The Nuclear Energy Safety White Paper consists of three  parts. The first part describes the Nuclear Safety Commission's  activities over the past year and its safety policies. The  second part is a special edition about ensuring the safety of  nuclear reactors that use plutonium for fuel. The third part  contains data.    In addition to presenting the Nuclear Safety Commission's  policies, the first part of the paper also brings up the  problems with Russia: nuclear energy safety measures there, its  dumping of radioactive wastes into the ocean, the explosion at  the Tomusk-7 military recycling plant, and so forth.    This is the second time that the Nuclear Energy Safety White  Paper features a special edition on the plutonium issue; last  year, the paper discussed the nuclear fuel cycle. The Nuclear  Energy White Paper also aims to reinforce, from the aspect of  safety, understanding about the government's policies on  plutonium use, which has caused apprehension in other countries.    [p 7]    [Text] ``Ensuring Safety in the Use of Plutonium in Nuclear  Power Plant Facilities'' is the special edition in the 1993  Nuclear Energy Safety White Paper. While last year's paper took  up the issue of plutonium production in the nuclear fuel cycle,  this year's paper discusses the safety of plutonium use in the  LWRs, ATRs, and FBRs of nuclear power plants. There are three  basic policies on ensuring safety: to reduce the amounts of  radioactive substances, to provide multiple forms of protection,  and to isolate facilities that use plutonium from the public.  The paper also introduces the characteristics of plutonium and  explains that, although plutonium emits alpha rays and weak  gamma rays, the alpha rays only escape about four centimeters  into the air; the gamma rays are weak, too, so there is not much  of a safety problem if simple shielding is provided.    Regarding the effects when plutonium is taken into the human  body, examples from past accidents have indicated the danger of  cancer occurring due to the long-term effects of radiation in  the body when plutonium is drawn into the lungs and then  accumulates mainly in the lungs, liver, and bones. For that  reason Japan is aiming for safety with the establishment of  standard radiation dose values for bones (2.4 sieverts), lungs  (3.0 sieverts), and the liver (5 sieverts), in addition to the  conventional levels of radiation exposure.    The paper also emphasizes that there are already results  from  the use of plutonium in nuclear power plants: because plutonium  is produced inside reactors when uranium absorbs neutrons,  plutonium is burned within reactors now. Owing to that, about  30% of the energy generated by LWRs is produced by the  plutonium that is modified within the reactors. In other words,  there is essentially no difference with the nuclear reactors  that use uranium-plutonium mixed oxide fuel (MOX). Therefore, by  taking into account the amount of plutonium that will be  handled, safety measures can be maintained adequately.    Based on such results, the paper notes that safety can be  maintained in FBRs, which use plutonium only, by adequately  implementing inspections of those parts of the FBRs that differ  with LWRs.    The paper takes up technical topics such as sodium as the  FBR's coolant material and operation under high temperatures,  breedable reactor cores that use MOX fuel, and the cover gas  that isolates the surface of the liquid sodium from the air,  then points out that FBR inspections covering that which differs  from LWRs are implemented. The measures taken in dealing with  sodium coolant, for example, involve verification of the  suitability of the structural design of the equipment used for  the sodium, and incorporating into the design safety measures to  prevent chemical activation of the sodium by means of an inert  gas, leakage detection, and suppression and reduction of the  thermal effects of combustion.    In addition, in an assessment of the completed Monju FBR,  the  paper presents an analysis of a hypothetical accident in which  large amounts of radioactive substances are released. According  to that analysis, if a a big accident such as leakage of the  primary coolant or a hypothetical accident were to occur, the  public would be separated far enough from the exposure dose.    The Fugen ATR, which has already been in operation for 15  years, has not produced a single failed fuel element. Measures  have also been taken to improve its void coefficient--the  reaction when the coolant boils and many steam bubbles are  formed--which had been considered a problem. As a result,  nuclear reactor control with enough margin is now possible.    As for LWRs, the paper states that loading one-third of the  reactor core with MOX fuel will not affect the characteristics  of the core. The reasons are that, in comparison with uranium,  there is little drop in reactivity when MOX fuel is used, and  that the nature of the reactor is such that if the reactivity  rises it will then drop on its own. On the other hand, there is  also a problem in that the control rods tend to lose their  effectiveness and the output can grow large locally. Although  there are items that need to be addressed in the design, the  safety of [plutonium use in] LWRs was confirmed in demonstration  tests using the No. 1 reactor of Kansai Electric Power Company's  Mihama power plant.    The paper also uses a question-and-answer format to explain  in simple terms about social problems, e.g., Russia's dumping of  low-level radioactive waste into the ocean, nuclear reactors and  earthquakes, and the issue of acknowledgement of power plant  workers' accidents involving leukemia.</p>

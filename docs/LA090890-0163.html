			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USDA INVESTIGATING DEATHS OF 25 PUPPIES LEFT UNATTENDED ON JET  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Friday it is investigating the deaths  of more than 2 dozen purebred puppies found dead aboard a United Airlines  flight from Chicago to San Diego.  </P> <P> When Flight 141 landed at Lindbergh Field about 3 p.m. Thursday, 24 dead  puppies were found in the cargo area, said Rob Doughty, a United spokesman in  Chicago.  </P> <P> Another puppy died later at a San Diego veterinary clinic.  </P> <P> Airline executives suspect that the puppies might have died from overheating.  The plane was delayed because of a mechanical problem for two hours, and no one  unloaded them, Doughty said.  </P> <P> Temperatures in the upper 90s were reported in Chicago on Thursday, and near  the plane the mercury hovered near 100 degrees, Doughty said.  </P> <P> The puppies were part of a shipment of 27 puppies and two kittens going to a  kennel in San Diego. Officials would not release the name of the kennel.  </P> <P> Flight 141 was scheduled to take off from O'Hare International Airport shortly  before 11 a.m. Chicago time Thursday, but an engine heating problem kept the  DC-8 on the ground.  </P> <P> When the plane returned for repairs, it went to a different gate, and the  original ground crew that handled the animals was not there and did not know  the plane had never taken off, Doughty said.  </P> <P> During the repairs, he said, proper airline procedures apparently were not  followed. They would have included opening the door to ventilate the cargo hull  or checking to see if animals were on board.  </P> <P> "If our procedures had been followed, this should not have happened," Doughty  said, adding that United ships more than 60,000 animals a year.  </P> <P> Normally, Doughty said, animals are unloaded from a plane and taken to a cool  holding area if the delay is longer than 45 minutes.  </P> <P> The remains of six of the puppies were turned over Friday to the office of the  San Diego County Veterinarian for necropsies, said Denise Bradley, an animal  health technician for the county veterinarian.  </P> <P> The six, no more than 8 weeks old, were a husky, a Labrador retriever, a  Shetland sheep dog, a Shih Tzu, a poodle and a beagle.  </P> <P> Results of the necropsies will not be available for a couple of weeks, Bradley  said.  </P> <P> It will also take a couple of weeks for the Department of Agriculture to  complete its investigation, said Dr. William DeHaven, a sector supervisor for  the department's animal care division in Sacramento. The department enforces  the Animal Welfare Act, which includes regulations for shipping animals in  airplanes.  </P> <P> According to the act, the temperature where animals are kept should not be  higher than 85 degrees or lower than 45.  </P> <P> Dogs can become overheated when the temperature around them grows hotter than  about 110 degrees, because they cannot cool their bodies effectively by  panting, Bradley said.  </P> <P> Overheating is the common cause of death for animals who are left in  unventilated cars during the summer.  </P> <P> If United Airlines is found at fault, penalties can range from a warning letter  to suspension of their registration to carry animals, DeHaven said.  </P> <P> But he backed away from any speculation on the case.  </P> <P> "I am not pointing the finger and not saying anyone is guilty at this point in  time."  </P></p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Histadrut movement decides to go ahead with one day strike Israel's Histadrut labour movement has decided to go ahead with a one-day nationwide public-sector strike today which could paralyse the country, despite a government promise to freeze its privatisation programme for up to four weeks pending further talks with unions, Julian Ozanne writes from Jerusalem. The move came as a restructuring plan for the financially-troubled Israel Aircraft Industries, Israel's largest employer, was agreed, which should release hundred of millions of dollars of government aid in a rescue package. Up to 100,000 workers in government-owned companies, including electricity, telephone and water, state-controlled radio and TV, and postal and airport services have been asked to obey the strike call. But later, a Tel Aviv court ruled that postal and airport workers were forbidden to take part. The unions want greater involvement in privatisation plans.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> GRASS-ROOTS PRIVATE TRUSTS FILL GAP IN WILDERNESS PRESERVATION  </P> <P> Preserving the wilderness once was left largely to the government. Now, private  trusts are buying up land across the country in an effort to save the unplowed,  the undrained and the undeveloped.  </P> <P> That much is obvious on the northern border of Michigan, on a spur of land that  locals call the beginning of the world and tourists say is the end.  </P> <P> Free-lance naturalist Jim Rooks, trudging deep into the stand of towering  Estivant pines on a recent day, suddenly stopped and pointed with the  exuberance of a child. "There!"  </P> <P> He almost toppled over as he arched back to gaze up at the giant before him. It  is a Gargantuan white pine, 300 or more years old.  </P> <P> Then Rooks pointed out 19 wide table tops of cut stumps, now turned black. He  had come upon them in June, 1987.  </P> <P> "Oh, my God, my heart," Rooks said, recalling the warm, sickening day with its  buzz of saws. "Every tree was a drop of blood."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extensive Stand  </P> <P> Rooks and other Michigan environmentalists say that these giant pine trees of  the Keweenaw Peninsula by Lake Superior are the largest, most extensive stand  of unprotected white pine in the eastern United States.  </P> <P> The logging company that owns the land is ready to harvest the trees, but, for  varied reasons, neither the U.S. Forest Service nor the Michigan Department of  Natural Resources has tried to save the stand. The federal government is  concentrating on filling in gaps in existing national forests while the state  never has formally considered saving the pines, officials with both agencies  say.  </P> <P> Instead, the battle for the Estivant pines, named for the French merchant who  bought much of the local land in 1857, has fallen into private hands, paid for  by anonymous donors, blue-collar philanthropists and grade-school students.  </P> <P> It is, conservationists say, typical of new preservation efforts throughout the  nation.  </P> <P> "If the job is going to get done, we're going to have to roll up our own  sleeves and do it as private citizens," said Russell van Herik, vice president  for the national Nature Conservancy's Midwest region in Minneapolis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nature Conservancy  </P> <P> The Nature Conservancy is one of a growing number of private land trusts that  are buying up land and protecting endangered species as quickly as donations to  cover the purchases come in.  </P> <P> A survey by the national Land Trust Exchange, a coordinating body in  Alexandria, Va., turned up 743 nonprofit land trusts across the United States  last year, up from 535 only three years earlier. Half of them have no staffs  and less than $10,000 a year to spend. Together their memberships amount to  640,000 people.  </P> <P> They range from the newly formed Kachemak Bay Heritage Land Trust in  wilderness-rich Homer, Alaska, to the 98-year-old Trustees of Reservations in  crowded Massachusetts.  </P> <P> "It's an amazingly rapid-growing movement," said Jean Hocker, executive  director of the exchange.  </P> <P> "What's happened is a sense of real dismay of what's happening in communities  -- a feeling that the people who live there have to take care of it," Hocker  said. "As development pressures increase on the land, people are realizing that  protection of open land is the responsibility of all of us."  </P> <P> Although private trusts also guard land for scenic views and playgrounds, the  strongest interest is in preserving ecologically important areas, Hocker said.  Some trusts manage the sanctuaries on their own, while others turn them over to  government agencies for public parks and forests.  </P> <P> Van Herik said the Nature Conservancy considers itself "the Noah's ark of this  country." The national trust, which centers its efforts on endangered species  and ecologies, has set aside 3.5 million acres of land, including 396 preserves  in 12 Midwestern states.  </P> <P> Despite their growth, private land trusts will not replace government land  programs, a U.S. Forest Service official said. "To us, they are complimentary,"  said Harold Bolt, acting regional land director for the Forest Service in  Milwaukee, Wis.  </P> <P> The Forest Service has budgeted $2 million this year to buy land within  national forests in Ohio and Illinois. It plans to spend more than $20 million  for the entire Northeast.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Government Slower to Act  </P> <P> But when it comes to land outside the national forests, it takes an average of  10 years to identify, study, propose, debate and designate land for federal  acquisition, said Jane Elder, head of the Sierra Club's Midwest offices in  Madison, Wis.  </P> <P> "Land trusts can move more quickly, less expensively, and sometimes people will  consider selling to private individuals when they won't even talk to the  federal government," Hocker said.  </P> <P> And, Elder added, there is the worry that public designation as a wilderness  area is a kiss of death to the virginity of land surrounded by population  centers.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of fear in the Midwest that once land is designated, it will get  loved to death," by backpackers, trail bikes and others using it, she said.  </P> <P> Land trusts have cropped up in Arizona, Wyoming and New Mexico, but they remain  concentrated in the East and Midwest, where there is much development and  little in the way of federal wilderness areas.  </P> <P> Ohio has only 77 acres of federally protected wilderness, Elder said. Iowa has  none.  </P> <P> In these areas, private trusts are finding their land in small packages,  nestled among cornfields and smokestacks.  </P> <P> "It doesn't look like Yellowstone and it doesn't look like Yosemite," Elder  said. "But you can find quiet and solitude and virgin white pine. And you can  even get lost."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unspectacular Vistas  </P> <P> It takes a sophisticated citizenry to donate money for the seemingly  unspectacular: Michigan's buggy swamps, Illinois' hilltop prairies and Iowa's  freakish cool air slopes, where snails from the Ice Age dwell.  </P> <P> "Ten years ago, the idea of an important natural area was something that made  you say 'Oh!' It had to be 1,000 feet high and there had to be waterfalls," Van  Herik said.  </P> <P> Rooks didn't gamble on such sophistication in 1971 when the Estivant pines  first were timbered. He told corporate landowners that their loggers were  felling the oldest trees in the Midwest.  </P> <P> "They could have been. Nobody knew," Rooks admits now.  </P> <P> Either way, the logging stopped long enough for the Michigan Nature Assn. to  buy 200 acres for $42,145. The next 80 acres cost $100,000 this May and the  association is negotiating for another 97 acres.  </P> <P> Later, Rooks discovered among the pines the Leaning Giant, a tilted monolith of  a white pine that won Michigan Botanical Society and national honors as the  second-largest white pine in the East before teetering to the ground in  October, 1987.  </P> <P> The Michigan Nature Assn. since has learned the hard way that its remote island  of trees is as vulnerable as the timber forest surrounding it. A logger  wandered into the Estivant pines two years ago, felling giant after giant,  before he realized that he was in the wrong place.  </P> <P> Now, the Lake Superior Land Co. says it will return to timber the rest of the  virgin forest. It's either buy or cut, said Gary Willis, a commercial forester  and a volunteer for the association.  </P> <P> "Economically speaking, the stand should be cut," Willis said. But, "simply  put, we'll never see it again, in our lifetimes, anywhere."  </P> <P> Preservation versus development isn't the issue, said Lake Superior Land Co.  President Bob Grasseschi.  </P> <P> "It's simply economics. The stand is mature. It's a natural resource like any  that should be used in a responsible way," Grasseschi said. "It's just a  question of paying for that resource."  </P></p>

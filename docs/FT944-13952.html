			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Rate rise lends support to Australian dollar The Australian dollar was yesterday firmer after the central bank's decision to raise short term interest rates by 100 basis points, writes Philip Gawith. Although higher rates had been expected, the decision to lift cash rates to 6.5 per cent came earlier, and was larger, than the market had expected. The Australian dollar closed in London at Dollars 0.7366 from Dollars 0.7316 on Friday. Traders said its inability to break through the Dollars 0.74 barrier left the Australian dollar vulnerable to a correction. Elsewhere, the US dollar traded in a narrow range. It gained some support from good German inflation data which renewed market speculation that the Bundesbank council might lower German interest rates when it meets this week. The dollar closed at DM1.497, from DM1.4954, and at Y97.215 from Y96.995. The sterling index was unchanged at 80.4. After a firmer start, with the pound rising above DM2.44, it later lost ground to close at DM2.437, from DM 2.4345. Against the dollar it was unchanged at Dollars 1.628. In Europe, the Swedish krona was the star performer on the back of a successful bond auction. The krona finished at SKr4.748 against the D-Mark, from SKr4.758. The Australian dollar has risen from around Dollars 0.65 at the end of last year to its present level, buoyed by rising commodity prices and the prospect of higher interest rates. Some observers see this trend continuing, but others believe a correction may be in order. Mr Joe Prendergast, analyst at Paribas Capital Markets, commented: 'From here, given that commodity prices may weaken, with the increasing focus on the balance of payments, and the CPI out this week, I would not be surprised if we saw the 'Ozzie' fall to Dollars 0.73 this week. It is not going through the technical levels, so the market is looking to the downside in the short term.' The focus is on the release tomorrow of the second quarter CPI figures. There is some concern that these figures will show why the RBA tightened policy as much as it did. If these suggest that the RBA is playing 'catch-up' in combatting inflation, there is a risk of the 'Ozzie' going the same way as the US dollar. The broad market consensus is that the US dollar will remain weak until at least some further tightening of monetary policy is seen. In the absence of this, it remains vulnerable to a sell-off on the publication of strong economic data. In this regard, both the employment cost index today, and the durable goods orders tomorrow, will be closely watched. Although the dollar remains very weak, it appears that the absence of central bank intervention may actually have helped. Commenting on the dollar's very narrow trading range, Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London, said: 'It may be more effective letting the market worry about potential intervention than actually buying dollars publicly.' Mr Hawkins said he believed the market was also 'pretty short' of dollars now, and this accounted for the slow trade, in the absence of new information to trade on. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at Abn-Amro, said the loss of liquidity in financial markets this year was another factor explaining the subdued trading volumes. 'There are not that many big investors prepared to take a bet and go with it,' he said. The catalyst for the firmer krona was a successful bond auction which was more than two times oversubscribed. Weakness in the bond market has occasionally undermined the currency in recent months. The Finnish markka ended at FM3.046 to the D-Mark, from FM3.0525. Dealers reported the Bank of Finland had earlier bought small amounts of D-Mark for markkas. Mr Prendergast commented: 'The Bank of Finland has in the past month been on both sides of the market. The bank is not protesting against particular levels of the markka; it is just seeking to calm some sharp market moves.' He said he was sceptical of whether the trend that has seen the markka rise by 21.5 per cent against the dollar this year, could continue. The overnight rate traded between 5 1/4 and 7 per cent as the Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 251m assistance - Pounds 175m in the form of late assistance - after forecasting a Pounds 450m shortage. Three month LIBOR was unchanged at 5 15/16 per cent.</p>

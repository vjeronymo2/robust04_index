			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / ITC to clear Tyne Tees TV The Independent Television Commission will today give Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television a clean bill of health on how the merged ITV region is being run. The commission launched a formal investigation after Ms Ann Clwyd, the shadow heritage secretary, complained that Tyne Tees was in effect being run by Yorkshire from Leeds and was being destroyed 'as an autonomous and independent broadcaster'. The commission, which has sought to preserve the autonomy of Tyne Tees with its own separate regional licence, is happy with both the business and programme commissioning structures now in place. But it warns that it will continue to monitor the performance of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees to ensure that there are no moves towards unacceptable integration. Board changes announced at the company probably helped the commission take a conciliatory approach. Mr John Fairley has been appointed managing director of Yorkshire Television, the subsidiary holding the licence for the Yorkshire region, and Mr John Calvert will remain managing director of Tyne Tees Television, the wholly-owned subsidiary for the Tyne Tees area. Earlier this year the ITC rejected a Labour complaint that Granada Television was in breach of its broadcasting obligations. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television.</p>

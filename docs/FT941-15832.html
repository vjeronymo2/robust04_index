			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Government rules out early cut in base rate The government yesterday ruled out an early cut in British bank base rates from the 5.5 per cent level set just before the November 30 Budget. Speaking after yesterday morning's monthly monetary discussions between the Treasury and Bank of England, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary of the Treasury, said there would be 'no change for the time being' in UK interest rates. In an interview with Channel Four's House to House programme, Mr Nelson said the government was 'content with the present monetary stance'. There had been a very significant cut in rates during the past year, he said. That had been of great benefit to industry and would be of 'tremendous benefit' in the next few months to people whose mortgage rates are changed annually. The present level of interest rates was satisfactory in terms of continuing to bear down on inflation. A rate cut was 'unlikely'. Yesterday's meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, and their senior officials lasted less than an hour. The Treasury's monthly monetary report, prepared for the discussions, said the latest monthly indicators painted a picture of further economic recovery and subdued inflation in Britain. It also noted that inflation expectations had fallen since the December report. UK producer price inflation remains low while short-term price expectations as reported by the Confederation of British Industry are at their lowest recorded level. However, the task of the chancellor and Bank governor was to look into the future as well. Assessing the path of the economy is more difficult because of the big tax increases planned for April. Officials at the Bank and the Treasury are concerned that the tax increases due in April could put a break on economic growth.</p>

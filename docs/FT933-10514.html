			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Brunei to invest Dollars 9bn in Vietnam A BRUNEI company controlled by the younger brother of the country's sultan said it had won approval to invest up to Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) in Vietnam, Reuter reports from Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei. Primal, headed by Prince Sufri Bolkiah, said in a statement the Vietnamese government had approved 19 projects, mostly in oil and gas exploration, over a 20-year period. Primal will also venture into gold mining, build roads and bridges, and set up a petrochemical plant, the company said. The deal was signed at the weekend with officials from the Vietnam State Committee for Co-operation and Investment, Primal said. Western diplomats said it would be Brunei's single largest investment in Indochina. Brunei, the tiny oil- and gas-rich sultanate on Borneo Island, has been stepping up overseas investments to help reduce its dependence on oil.</p>

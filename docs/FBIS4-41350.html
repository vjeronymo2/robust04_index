			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mykhaylo Soroka: "Open Dialogues With People"] </F>   [Excerpts] A day after a visit to Luxembourg, where, as  everybody knows, an agreement on partnership and cooperation was  signed between Ukraine and the European Union, Leonid Kravchuk  visited Odessa Oblast, and on Friday -- Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.  [passage omitted]    Following are certain typical questions and Leonid  Kravchuk's  responses. [passage omitted]    [Question] Does it make sense to hold presidential  elections, given the fact that decisions made by the current  Supreme Council have practically reduced the president's role in  the state to nothing?    [Kravchuk] I would answer this question as follows: Certain  deputies' view is to make the president absent from our state's  political structure. This is their right. But, while stating  this, they are simultaneously voting to hold the presidential  elections. Where is the logic? Now, I will really answer your  question. If the election is held, and the president is elected  in accordance with the current law, meaning that he is elected  head of the state and executive branch, this will mean that the  people have voted for a presidential-parliamentary state. This  will be a peculiar referendum, confirming that the people want a  president -- a guarantor of independence, social protection, and  the Constitution. Addressing the Supreme Council, I said that  when the president is finally elected, all subsequent attempts  to reduce his powers will fail, because the president will act  in the name of the people. From this viewpoint, the presidential  elections will make sense.    [Question] Why did you propose Vitaliy Masol for the office  of prime minister, even though you had been against him prior to  that?    [Kravchuk] No, I had not been against Vitaliy Masol. He was  dismissed when the Soviet Union still existed, and when the  Communist Party of both the Soviet Union and Ukraine was fully  in power. Vitaliy Masol was then invited to the Central  Committee, and it was recommended that he step down, taking the  existing situation into account. He sought to obtain support  outside Ukraine's borders (he can personally confirm that), but  he did not find any. Thus, I was working with Vitaliy Masol,  though not directly, but as the Ukrainian Supreme Council  chairman. I believe that he is an educated, experienced man.  His program indicates that he has altered his way of viewing  Ukraine's problems and economy. I would like him to achieve  everything, and that nobody hamper him. Other candidates for  the office of prime minister, as far as I understood the  situation, would not have been supported by the parliament.  Currently, Vitaliy Masol satisfies the interests of many people.    [Question] What are your personal relations with Boris  Yeltsin currently?    [Kravchuk] My relations with Boris Yeltsin are normal, just  as between people who have known each other for a long time, who  know their strong and weak sides, and even when it is better to  phone each other. Yet, obviously, the Russian president  protects the interests of Russia, because otherwise, the  Russians would not need such a president. Unless the Ukrainian  president protects the interests of Ukraine, defends its  integrity, sovereignty, and statehood, Ukraine does need such a  president either. Thus, we both protect the interests of our  states. However, this protection must not lead to the suffering  of both peoples. This is an art, the art of political  leadership. So far, we have been successful. [passage omitted]</p>

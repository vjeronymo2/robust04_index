			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Time to debate worker rights This week's UK government climbdown on the matter of part-time worker rights raises two important worries. The first concerns the ruling itself, which may imply short-term adjustment costs for both employees and employers. A much larger concern, however, relates to the way the regime-change came about, and the government's unduly negative approach to the question of worker rights. Uncertainty about future regulatory changes distorts employment decisions more than the changes announced to parliament on Tuesday. Recent changes in the structure of employment have made the UK labour market more flexible, but they have also bred understandable fears about job security and equitable treatment of employees. The country urgently needs a constructive debate about the framework of worker rights, which could make the two demands - flexibility and fairness - more visibly compatible. Neither the government's resistance to part-time rights, nor back-door legislation by the law lords, provides a worthy substitute. Granting redundancy, unfair dismissal and other statutory rights to all part-time workers who have been employed for over two years may have negative effects for part-time workers. Some argue that companies, especially small ones, will now decide to employ, say, one full-time worker instead of two part-timers, because employing the latter is no longer as advantageous. Ironically enough, this would hit women hardest, although it was a case brought against the government by the Equal Opportunities Commission that triggered the Law Lords Ruling in the first place. Legitimate worry There is a legitimate worry here, but it can be over done. The only workers who will be immediately affected will be those who have worked at the same company for more than two years but fewer than five. This represents only about 750,000 of the UK's 6.5m part-time workers. Many of the remainder already enjoy equal treatment. This is either because they have put in the five years previously required for those working 8-16 hours, or because they work for one of the growing number of employers who have voluntarily opted to treat part-time and full-time workers more equitably. These considerations may partly explain why the Confederation of British Industry and many employers have greeted the ruling with more equanimity than the government. Another explanation would be that the two-year eligibility requirement provides a way to avoid these restrictions. Greater flexibility Mr Michael Portillo, the employment minister, made clear on Tuesday that the government resented being forced to change tack. Excessive regulation, he argued, threatened to undo the greater flexibility achieved in the UK labour market in recent years. Part-time work may, for many companies, be a way of improving their efficiency. But, as long as there are arbitrary legal and tax distinctions between part- and full-time workers, it will be impossible to judge how far part-time work represents greater flexibility, and how far it is a response to regulatory distortions. The proportion of part-time female employees working fewer than 16 hours a week rose by about a third between 1979 and 1990: the fact that these very low-hour jobs have grown considerably faster than part-time work overall may owe much to their different fiscal and regulatory treatment. Mr Portillo is right that Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome is an inappropriate instrument for wide-scale changes to UK labour legislation. The notion of indirect discrimination does have disturbing ramifications. For all that, it is a pity that the government decided to use the ruling as an excuse to win political points with Conservative Euro-sceptics rather than as an opportunity to lay out a more positive approach. A workable framework of employee rights will not be achieved while the debate is polarised between extreme 'deregulators' and supporters of all-encompassing regulations. The lack of a 'feel-good' factor in the recovery so far owes much to the unease felt by those whose terms of employment are changing. Such insecurities need to be addressed.</p>

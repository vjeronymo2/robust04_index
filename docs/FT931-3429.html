			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Claremont Garments advances to Pounds 8.47m CLAREMONT Garments (Holdings), which last summer expanded its business with Marks and Spencer through the purchase of J&amp;J Fashions, increased pre-tax profit by 35 per cent, from Pounds 6.28m to Pounds 8.47m, over the 12 months to December 26. The share price gained 5p to close at a new high of 345p. It has climbed from 154p in July 1991, the month that Claremont demerged from Alexon, the retailer. J&amp;J and Alexander Milnes, a much smaller buy, added Pounds 27m to turnover, which increased 60 per cent to Pounds 81.5m (Pounds 50.9m) - of which about 95 per cent goes to M&amp;S. The acquisitions were included for five to six months. Claremont has about 10 per cent of the M&amp;S ladies wear market, according to Mr Peter Wiegand, chairman. A 2-for-5 rights issue raised Pounds 22.1m towards total spending of about Pounds 29 on acquisitions. The extra equity limited the advance in earnings per share to 19 per cent at 16.4p (13.8p). Mr Wiegand said three of J&amp;J's factories had been closed and some of its work transferred to Claremont factories. About 400 jobs had been shed. Much of J&amp;J's senior management had gone, he said. The group also parted company with Mrs Jenifer Rosenberg, one of the founders, in an out-of-court settlement involving the payment to her of roughly Pounds 100,000. Mr David McGarvey, managing director, said the manufacturing side of J&amp;J had been neglected. It had been a turnover and design-led company rather than 'exploiting the profitability that comes from volume'. J&amp;J's pre-acquisition operating margins had been about 4 per cent compared with 13-plus at Claremont. It was hoped to get the combined group average up from about 8.5 to 10 per cent this year. Net debt rose by Pounds 1m to Pounds 3m. On expanded shareholders' funds gearing stayed at about 15 per cent - lower than expected at the time of the acquisition. A proposed final dividend of 3.95p makes a total of 7.25p (6.5p). COMMENT Claremont has benefited both from the resilience of M&amp;S and from its own management rigour in wringing impressive margins from that business. The tantalising prospect of similar discipline being imposed on J&amp;J has helped drive the share price forward. The only surprise in yesterday's results was the pleasant one of cashflow being much stronger than expected. Most of the acquisition debt plus Pounds 1.9m of reorganisation costs were rapidly cancelled out. For the future, apart from J&amp;J, the main scope for organic growth seems to lie in exports to the continent. The corporate wear business has promise but is small and the M&amp;S cocoon becomes a bit of a straitjacket when the group considers selling to other retailers. A more serious prospect for medium-term growth is that Claremont will acquire further M&amp;S suppliers. A conservative pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 11m this year gives a prospective p/e of nearly 19 times. This is well up with events, but it remains worth holding as a quality stock.</p>

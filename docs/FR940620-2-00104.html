			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is proceeding on two funding tracks_(1) during fiscal year 1994, the initiative is being funded under current legislative authority in the Job Training Partnership Act and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act; and (2) for fiscal year 1995 and beyond, it will be funded under the recently enacted ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994.'' However, since programs begun in 1994 will be continued in fiscal year 1995 and beyond, the Departments have modeled the proposed grant program, to the extent possible, upon the recent legislation. The funds will be made available through a grants program administered cooperatively by the Department of Education and the Department of Labor that consists of_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) State Development Grants, which have been awarded to each State for developing a statewide School-to-Work Opportunities plan; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) State Implementation Grants, awarded competitively to States that can demonstrate substantial ability to begin full-scale operations and implement the Statewide plan (the first round of State Implementation Grants are expected to be announced in June, 1994); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Local Partnership Grants, awarded competitively to localities that are prepared to implement School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives (the first round of Local Partnership Grants are expected to be announced in early July, 1994); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Urban/Rural Opportunities Grants, as announced in this notice, awarded competitively to local partnerships to support the development and implementation of School-to-Work Opportunities programs in urban and rural areas of high poverty;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Grants for Territories and for Native American programs, to support School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives in the territories and for Indian youth, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Local partnerships are eligible for direct Federal funding to implement programs throughout their entire local area and in high poverty areas, through separate competitions, in the current program year. The intent of this funding strategy is to begin implementation of local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives in ``leading edge'' communities and to provide supplemental resources to selected local partnerships serving youth residing or attending school in high poverty areas, even if the States in which they are located are still in the systems development phase. This will allow a State in the development phase to learn from innovative local partnerships in their own State and in others and will build incentives for States and localities to work together to maximize funding within the State. Local partnerships may apply for or request extensions of Urban/Rural Opportunities Grants serving high poverty areas even if they receive School-to-Work Opportunities funding through State grants or through direct Federal funding. The Urban/Rural Opportunities Grants are in addition to other funds for which the local partnership may be eligible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A local partnership applying for a Urban/Rural Opportunities grant under this competition should consult with the State at the earliest possible time. These consultations will permit local initiatives to be designed so that they are, or will be, consistent with State plans for a comprehensive statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system. The current funding strategy could result in a State, a local partnership, and a local partnership serving youth who reside or attend school in a high poverty area each receiving a competitive implementation grant award in 1994. Therefore, the possibility exists that an Urban/Rural Opportunities Grant may be awarded to a partnership serving youth residing or attending school in a high poverty area that is located within the jurisdiction or a larger local partnership and within a State that each receive Implementation Grants. Thus, consultation and coordination among the grantees are essential to the creation of a comprehensive statewide system that provides opportunities for all students to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives that meet the same high standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part II. Program Description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> a. Objectives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The School-to-Work Opportunities initiative provides for a substantial degree of State and local flexibility and experimentation, but all State systems and individual local initiatives will share several common features and basic program components as required by the ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994.'' A local School-to-Work Opportunities initiative under this competition must include the following common features and basic program components: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The basis of the School-to-Work Opportunities system is_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The integration of school-based learning and work-based learning; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

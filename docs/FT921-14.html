			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar recoups Friday's losses THE DOLLAR edged a little higher in London yesterday, recouping some of Friday's losses, ahead of a welter of economic statistics due out this week. It crept up to a close of DM1.6500 from a DM1.6430/40 start and a DM1.6400/10 New York finish on Friday. It firmed to Y133.45 from Y132.95/133.05 and Y133.00/07. Traders said the buying interest was enough, in a thin market, to overcome the negative effect of poorer than expected data on new home sales in the US. Sales declined 2.7 per cent in February after economists had predicted a rise of 2.1 per cent. Meanwhile, January home sales were revised down to an 11.1 per cent monthly rise from a provisional 12.9 per cent. However, analysts pointed out that positive revisions to past numbers meant the actual level of sales, at an annual 613,000 units, was fairly consistent with forecasts. Furthermore, many still expect the rest of the week's data to provide evidence that the US economy is picking up and hence to favour the dollar. In late Asian trading the dollar had been a shade lower against the yen but slightly firmer against the D-Mark. In New York yesterday it opened  3/4 pfennig higher at DM1.6480/85 and ended at DM1.6460, after Friday's weak close of DM1.6400/10. Dealers said there was some interest in the French franc amid intense speculation that Prime Minister Edith Cresson was on the verge of stepping down. Since the ruling Socialist party's bad showing in recent local elections, rumours of her resignation have stalked the markets. The franc hovered around last week's seven-month high of DM3.39. It closed at DM3.3906/08. The uncertainty left the currency markets unruffled. Dealers said the markets were counting on Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, and his tight economic strategy to weather the storm. The pound remained mired in political uncertainty after weekend opinion polls failed to give either of the two main political parties a clear lead. By midday sterling was stuck at DM2.8559/76 after a DM2.8548/81 start. It closed at DM2.8570. It fell to Dollars 1.7315 from a previous Dollars 1.7380, but firmed in New York to a Dollars 1.7360 close. A sterling trader commented: 'The prospect of a minority or coalition government is hardly one that endears itself to investors who value stability above all else.' Continued strength in German interest rates underpinned the D-Mark, which ended slightly firmer against most key currencies. Dealers said the market's confidence that German rates would remain high was backed by comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, who said on German television that the central bank would maintain current monetary policies.</p>

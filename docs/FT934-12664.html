			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Ex-MoD official on bribe charges A FORMER director of ammunition procurement at the Ministry of Defence yesterday denied 12 charges of corruptly accepting bribes to help companies win arms contracts. Mr Gordon Foxley was accused at Snaresbrook Crown Court of accepting money 'as an inducement or reward' from three international arms companies - Fratelli Borletti of Milan, Italy, Gebruder Junghans of Schramberg, Germany, and A S Raufoss, of Gjovik, Norway. Mr Foxley, of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, was alleged to have taken bribes between 1979 and 1984. Each charge alleged that Mr Foxley, acting as an agent for the MoD, corruptly agreed to accept money as an inducement or reward for showing favour in relation to the placing of contracts for the supply of ammunition equipment. The trial is expected to last at least two weeks.</p>

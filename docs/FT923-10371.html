			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Honecker homecoming may reopen old wounds CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday washed his hands of Mr Erich Honecker and suggested others do the same. The political work was done, he said. The former communist leader of East Germany had been delivered into the arms of the law. Politicians had no further cause to be involved. Not so much a warning, more a sigh of relief after months of uncertainty, the chancellor's sparse comments were matched by restrained reactions from all parties. The most expressive response, reflecting popular concerns only belatedly taken up by politicians, came from Mr Wolfgang Botsch, a senior member of the Christian Social Union. 'The charge that the little people hang while the big ones go free is disproved,' he said. Such accusations surfaced during the trial of four former East German border guards who had implemented Mr Honecker's alleged shoot-to-kill policy against East Germans fleeing west. The trial could last two years or longer. Some commentators suggested the court case could help clear the air and ease the suspicions and superstitions still clouding relations between the people of eastern and western Germany, others felt it could make matters worse. Airing crimes and antagonisms which most people would rather forget - if yesterday's popular reactions are any guide - could reopen old wounds and slow the already sluggish process of healing and unification. The possibility of Mr Honecker implicating others, westerners as well as easterners, in the alleged misdeeds of himself and his administration was widely discounted in Bonn yesterday. But the risk remains that his testimony could embroil the government in controversy. Among the general public, the most common preoccupation among the young on both sides of the country yesterday was the potential cost of a protracted trial. In sum: Mr Honecker should have been left in Moscow with his memories. However, some older groups, particularly in the east, suggested the trial would demonstrate where the real guilt lay and relieve them of lingering feelings of guilt by association. A recent poll in the east showed 50 per cent wanted him brought back for trial, compared with 40 per cent in the west. Demands for revenge were rare. Even though Mr Honecker faces a maximum term of 15 years' jail on the manslaughter charges alone, a taste of his own medicine was considered a more fitting punishment for the 79-year-old, already deprived of the companionship of his wife, Margot, who flew into exile in Chile yesterday. 'They should put him in one of those little flats he gave us and give him the pension we had,' said one elderly woman in Chemnitz.</p>

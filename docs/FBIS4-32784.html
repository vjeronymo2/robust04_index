			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 26 May (PL) -- Cuba's ambassador to  Colombia, Jesus Martinez, affirmed today that Colombia is  engaged in an international opening process and that in this  context it is giving important consideration to its relations  with Cuba.    The Cuban diplomat told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba's ties with  Colombia, renewed in October 1993, are very positive and  intense, especially in the cultural, commercial, and  bilateral-cooperation fields.    He explained that the two sides have the will to strengthen  relations and that his country also gives priority to its  relations with Colombia.    When asked about the celebration of the fourth  Ibero-American  summit in the Colombian city of Cartagena de Indias on 14 and 15  June, the ambassador said that the Colombian authorities view  that summit as the most important international meeting of the  past few years.    Ambassador Martinez said that the fact that there were no  high level meetings before the summit is very positive for this  fourth Ibero-American summit.    He said that this Colombian initiative was viewed positively  by the Ibero-American family. He noted that the idea is aimed  at making possible more intense discussions among the chiefs of  state in the context of the summit.    Regarding violence in Colombian streets, the ambassador said  that the local Colombian authorities have said they will adopt  strict security measures to prevent incidents that would mar the  image the government wants to enhance.    He noted: That country is interested in demonstrating that  violence and drug trafficking are not Colombia's most  outstanding features, that since the adoption of the new  Constitution there is a new Colombia, very different from what  it was in the past.    The ambassador added: Colombia has always worked intensively  in the framework of international organizations, but it is  evident that during the government of President Cesar Gaviria  there has been a will to intensify those efforts.    In the ambassador's opinion, the celebration of elections in  Colombia this weekend will have no negative effect on the course  of the presidential summit, which has been held in Mexico,  Spain, and Brazil in the past.</p>

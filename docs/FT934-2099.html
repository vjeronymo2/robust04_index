			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Paramount opens sale contest to highest bidder The board of Paramount Communications has formally opened an auction of the film and publishing company to the highest bidder, signalling an end to efforts over the past three months to conclude a friendly takeover by Viacom. However, the Paramount directors left the job of weighing up rival bids in the hands of the full board, rather than setting up a committee of non-executives to review offers. The Delaware supreme court ruled on Friday that Paramount's board, led by Mr Martin Davis, had been wrong to reject a rival offer from QVC Network without considering it. This forced Paramount to open the bidding, and led to suggestions that the job of assessing bids should be taken out of Mr Davis' hands and given to a committee of non-executive directors. 'The board saw no reason to set up a (separate) committee,' Paramount said. Nor had the court ruling led to any changes in Paramount's financial advisers, led by Lazards, it added. Paramount said it would conduct a single round of bidding, with all offers to be submitted by December 20. It said it would favour bids comprising cash or fixed-income securities. If shares are offered, the board said it would prefer bidders to provide a floor under the price so the securities did not fall in value in future. It was also looking for guarantees that former Paramount shareholders would not be 'squeezed out' of the new combined company after the deal was completed. The Viacom and QVC offers comprise a mixture of cash and shares at present. Neither company would become heavily indebted under the terms of their current offers, suggesting there may be scope for them to increase the cash component or raise the overall value. Paramount said it would select the bidder which provided 'the greatest value to shareholders'. However, it said the shareholder rights' plan overturned by the Delaware court would be waived for all bidders, leaving shareholders free to pick which offer they preferred. Paramount's after-tax profits in the three months to the end of October fell to Dollars 96.8m from Dollars 102.4m in the same period of 1992 because of a rise in its financing costs. Operating income from publishing rose to Dollars 132.1m from Dollars 124.5m, while income from entertainment fell to Dollars 45.3m from Dollars 53.9m after a weak quarter for film releases. Net interest and investment expenses climbed from Dollars 400,000 to Dollars 8.1m as a result of acquisitions and increases in working capital.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By FAZHI RIBAO reporter Xu Lai (1776 0171) and XINHUA </F> reporter Zhang Yinshu (1728 6892 2562)]    [Text] Hefei, 29 May (XINHUA) -- At a third national  criminal prosecution conference which ended today, Liang  Guoqing, deputy procurator general of the Supreme People's  Procuratorate, stressed: Procuratorial organs at all levels  across the country must practically give first priority to  maintaining political and social stability, strictly enforce the  law, vigorously investigate and handle cases, sternly punish  those committing acts of corruption and bribery, and crack down  on various criminal activities according to the law in order to  provide a favorable legal environment for reform and economic  development.    It has been learned that from January to April,  procuratorial  organs at all levels across the country prosecuted at people's  courts 5,634 cases of economic crimes, including cases of  corruption and bribery, involving 6,738 persons of whom 115 were  cadres at or above the county or department level.  Procuratorial organs in various localities also promptly  arrested and prosecuted a number of gangster-robbers, rapists,  and other gang criminals according to the law. At the same  time, procuratorial organs at various levels promptly arrested  and prosecuted a number of highwaymen and train robbers who had  done great harm to society, thus initially changing the  situation for the better in some key areas and key sections of  highways and railways. Cases of smuggling by units were  investigated and handled. From January to April, 35 major cases  of smuggling involving legal persons were directly investigated  and handled by procuratorial organs.    Liang Guoqing pointed out: Political and social stability  now  prevail in our country. However, public order has yet to be  strengthened in some localities. He said: Social evils are  often accompanied by grave crimes, serious acts of fraud --  especially financial and commercial fraud -- and crimes  committed by legal figures that seriously jeopardize public  order. Criminals often collude with members of some units, and  the latter go along with the former in their evil deeds. He  called on procuratorial organs at all levels to link the effort  to crack down on serious crimes with the struggle against  corruption. He also called on them to vigorously prosecute  cases of economic crimes, including cases of corruption and  bribery, and crack down on such criminal activities.    Liang Guoqing stressed: In the near future, procuratorial  organs should select a number of major, influential cases for  prosecution at people's courts in order to create a strong  momentum in cracking down on criminal offenses and crimes of  corruption and bribery.    At the conference, leaders of provincial, autonomous  regional, and municipal people's procuratorates also discussed  questions such as arrests, prosecutions in court, and protests  by procuratorial organs.</p>

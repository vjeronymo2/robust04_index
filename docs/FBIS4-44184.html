			<p>BFN     [Text] Saarbruecken (DDP/ADN) -- Following the state  parliament elections in Saxony-Anhalt, SPD [Social Democratic  Party] leader Rudolf Scharping feels his party is on the way up  again. The "very, very good result" would "spur on" the SPD,  Scharping told Saarland Radio today.    The Bundestag election in October was now completely open.  The motto of the SPD federal party conference in Halle, "Now  we're off," had proved to be well-founded. The CDU/FDP  [Christian Democratic Union/Free Democratic Party] government  coalition in Saxony-Anhalt, on the other hand, had suffered a  "disastrous setback" with losses of almost 15 percent. If this  trend were to continue there would be "an exciting 16 October  [date of Bundestag election] and quite certainly a change of  government in Germany too," the SPD's candidate for the  chancellorship said.    Scharping ruled out altogether a coalition between the SPD  and PDS [Party of Democratic Socilists] after the Bundestag  election. His party did not want to enter into debate about  other possible coalitions. In the second half of August at the  latest, Scharping said he would announce how an SPD-led  government would look.</p>

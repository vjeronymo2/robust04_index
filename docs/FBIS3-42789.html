Financing of deliveries will  be done through special accounts that the Foreign Relations  Department of the Government of Moscow will open in foreign  banks. An agreement is expected to be reached with the Central  Bank of Russia before 1 February on the matter of opening the  guarantee fund's special accounts in foreign banks for a period  of one year and transferring into them R100 billion in U.S.  dollars at the Central Banks of Russia exchange rate. The  Government of Moscow intends to give foreign banks the right to  use the fund's deposit accounts as guaranteed collateral for  1994 purchases and deliveries to Moscow of foodstuffs and food  processing equipment.</p>

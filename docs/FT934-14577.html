			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zimbabwe 'to rival SA platinum output' ZIMBABWE'S PLATINUM mining industry will grow in the next ten to 15 years to rival output by South Africa, the world's biggest producer, predicts Mr Peter Vanderspuy, chairman of Delta Gold, an Australian group. Three of the world's biggest mining groups, Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) of Australia and the UK-based RTZ Corporation, as well as Delta, are in talks about pooling their interests on the so-called Great Dyke in Zimbabwe. This is geologically similar to the Bushveld Complex of South Africa, the world's largest repository of platinum group metals. The fastest-growing use for platinum is for car anti-pollution catalysts. Mr Vanderspuy suggests that the big consumers, particularly the US car manufacturers, would welcome a second major source apart from South Africa, which at present accounts for 72 per cent of supply. 'The Great Dyke area has the potential to support operations producing up to 600,000 (troy) ounces of platinum a year, with a reserve life in excess of 50 years,' says Mr Vanderspuy. 'However, development to this size would necessarily be staged over a ten- to 15-year period.' BHP has an option to earn a 67 per cent interest in Delta's Hartley joint venture by completing a feasibility study and committing itself to develop and finance a platinum mine. RTZ and Anglo American subsidiaries each own 38 per cent of the nearby Mhondoro platinum joint venture, with Delta having the remaining 24 per cent. Mr Vanderspuy says that, whatever the outcome of the four-sided discussions, the Hartley project will not be delayed. A recently-completed feasibility study shows mining of the Hartley, using conventional, 'narrow reef' underground mining methods practised in South Africa, is technically and economically viable. Metal can be recovered economically, even at today's depressed prices, by conventional processing methods. He claims production costs will be lower than those of every South African producer apart from the new PPRust mine. Hartley is forecast to cost USDollars 200m, which includes a base-metals refinery and infrastructure to be built by the joint venturers. Construction should begin early next year with full production in mid-1996. The planned initial annual production rate is 150,000 ounces of platinum, 110,000 ounces of palladium, 11,500 ounces of rhodium, 23,000 ounces of gold, 7m lb of copper and 5m lb of nickel. Hartley would represent less than 3 per cent of present world annual platinum output, so would not depend on unusual demand growth to find markets, Mr Vanderspuy suggests. Hartley alone will increase output to 300,000 ounces a year in stages, at which point a platinum refinery will be built at the mine site. However, if Delta's three partners agreed to pool operations, output would reach 600,000 ounces.</p>

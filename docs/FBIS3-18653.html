			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Both the yes and no groupings have strengthened  their positions after Sweden's agreement with the EU [European  Union] was completed at the beginning of the week, according to  a poll by SIFO [Swedish Institute for Public Opinion Polls]  published in GOTEBORGS-POSTEN. The group opposing Swedish  membership is still clearly the largest, and it increased by 2  percent to 42 percent. The yes grouping increased by 3 percent  to 35 percent. The number of undecided voters fell,  consequently, and now totals 23 percent.    According to SIFO, different groups of voters have reacted  very differently to the negotiation result. Upper-middle-age  men are very satisfied, while younger voters have instead become  more negative toward Swedish membership in the EU.</p>

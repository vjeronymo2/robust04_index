			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Integro in Dutch expansion INTEGRO, the European arm of a group of investors which controls Investec Bank of South Africa, has acquired a small Dutch stockbroking firm, Th. Wouters en Zoon. The deal marks its second acquisition in the Netherlands' financial community since the late 1980s. Wouters, which has a staff of five, is to be integrated next year with Heerze, another small Amsterdam stockbroking firm acquired by Integro in 1989. Terms of the latest deal were not disclosed. The two stockbroking firms will retain their separate identities for the rest of 1992, before being integrated in 1993. Integro's next priority for European expansion is Frankfurt, where it is particularly interested in the options and futures markets, according to Mr Ian Kantor, Integro's chief executive director and single biggest shareholder, with 25 per cent of the group's shares. Integro has offices in Geneva, Zurich and London.</p>

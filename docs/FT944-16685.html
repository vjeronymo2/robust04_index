			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Sanofi Sanofi's sale of its bio-industries and rendering businesses to Viag of Germany kills two birds with one stone. It constitutes a strategic withdrawal from a low margin activity, at a fair price of 0.9 times sales and 12.5 times operating profits. It is also a logical move following the French group's acquisition in July of Sterling Drug's pharmaceutical activities. The purpose of that transaction was to give new direction to a group whose lack of focus had been heavily penalised by investors. Management then promised to finance the purchase with asset sales; had these not taken place there would have been further damage to the group's credibility. As it is, the Sterling deal is now likely to enhance earnings by next year, as Sanofi forces through cost-savings in the area of overlap with its existing pharmaceutical business. The resulting earnings momentum should help tide Sanofi over until a new generation of promising drugs comes on stream in two to three years' time. Viag's desire to diversify is less easy to understand. It has no existing interest in bio-industries or rendering, and one might have expected it to be busy enough digesting Bayernwerk, the recently acquired Bavarian utility.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: A new look that sees beyond ships - The refocused Powell Duffyn which is searching for capital growth POWELL Duffryn's recent decision to get out of ship-owning is the latest stage in the group's continuing evolution away from its 19th century origins in the coal fields of South Wales. Cash from the Pounds 19m sale of Stephenson Clarke, one of the most famous names in British shipping, will be invested in the engineering, fuel and bulk liquid storage businesses which Powell Duffryn has concentrated on since the post-war nationalisation of the mines removed its founding product. Fuel distribution has never been a glamorous business, but it proved sufficiently cash generative for Powell Duffryn to escape a Pounds 170m hostile bid from Lord Hanson in 1985 - a trick which has proved beyond many more dynamic companies. The group maintained its independence by promising to continue paying high dividends - a pledge which has been kept, even though the share price has underperformed the FT-Allshare over the last six years. Mr David Hubbard, who stepped up from finance director to become chairman of Powell Duffryn after Hanson was seen off, said the takeover was not a wholly negative experience: 'Any activity like that is a catalyst for change - as ICI has discovered.' He and Mr Bill Andrews, the new chief executive, set about reducing the group's exposure to the construction indust-ry. The Pounds 20m proceeds from the sale of the group's timber business in 1986 helped fund five acquisitions made the following year in engineering, the sector chosen as having most growth potential. That focus seemed to be paying off by 1990, when engineering contributed 48 per cent of the group's trading profits. The impact of recession reduced that contribution to 36 per cent last year, but the group is still determined to concentrate more on engineering. Mr Andrews said the group had selected three areas where it has built at least a European position and potentially could become a world player - combustion technology, railway bogies and marine products such as pumps and compressors. The group's Hamworthy businesses install and manage burner installations in many of the world's biggest power stations. Mr Andrews said: 'A large part of pollution is coming from combustion, and there is a very positive opportunity to improve that with high-technology combustion management systems. If you look at the East European opportunity, it is almost horrifying, and yet it has all got be dealt with.' He added: 'We intend to grow that business, and acknowledge that it will not be grown sitting on our backsides in the UK - the next target market has got to be the Pacific Rim.' Hamworthy is also a leading supplier of marine equipment such as pumps and compressors. 'We have a worldwide distribution network, with heavy demand for spares, said Mr Andrews. 'The world's shipping fleet is nearly 15 years old, and quite clearly the rate of replacement of that fleet over the next decade is bound to rise.' Powell Duffryn's biggest opportunity - and current problem - on the engineering side is its railway business. It has invested heavily in building a freight wagon base - known as a bogie  -for use on both sides of the Channel. Mr Andrews said: 'We have the right product, but the potential customers currently don't have the capital capacity to place the orders.' Mr Hubbard said: 'This business is losing money for us at the moment, and there must be a question of a time limit on how long we are to go on doing that.' Powell Duffryn's fuel distribution business is now wholly in the UK. The group's biggest offshore investment is in its bulk liquid storage business, which is spread across five continents. The bulk liquids business has changed radically since the last oil price crisis, with increased computerisation allowing oil and chemical companies to manage their operations much more effectively, with less storage. Powell Duffryn has responded by specialising in the storage of more difficult products and by providing more services - in the US it packages 16m gallons of anti-freeze for the retail market. Mr Hubbard said: 'All of the time we are looking for higher value-added services in this sector, because that is where the future is going to lie.' The group has invested heavily to keep its storage terminals up with increasingly stringent environmental regulations, confident that such expenditure will be justified by enhanced profit margins when there is economic recovery. However, this demand for investment came at a time when Stephenson Clarke had not replaced any vessels for five years and was facing the need to buy new ships over the next four to five years. Mr Andrews said: 'You cannot sustain two businesses with that sort of appetite for capital within our particular group. I'm not saying they are mutually exclusive - they just were for us.' Despite its exit from ship-owning, the group remains interested in shipping-related businesses. It recently invested Pounds 13.7m in the consortium Powell Duffryn leads, which in December successfully bid Pounds 180m for control of the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority, the first major trust port to be privatised. The group's reshaping continues, with the sale already this year of its remaining foundry interests and further shrinkage likely on the construction materials side. One thing that had not changed - at least until this month's better-than-expected annual results - was the perception of Powell Duffryn as a rather boring yield stock. Mr Hubbard said: 'I believe that over five years, as we develop the group, we will be appreciated as more of a capital growth potential stock, and therefore less as an income stock. 'It's no use my going out to shareholders and saying forget about income, because they would ditch us tomorrow. The share price has kept the yield up by performing disappointingly. As the share price increases, the yield comes back into the 7 to 8 per cent range. That's still a jolly good yield for a stock with a bit of capital potential.' Just how much potential the new-look Powell Duffryn has for capital growth will depend on the pace of economic recovery and the performance of the engineering businesses in which the group has invested.</p>

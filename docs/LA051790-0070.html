			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MOTHER' GIVES MANUFACTURED FOODS A MEMORABLE, HOMEMADE TOUCH;  </P> <P> MARKETING: INDUSTRY EXPERTS SAY IMAGES OF MOTHERHOOD EVOKE WARM FEELINGS THAT  HELP SELL THEIR PRODUCTS.  </P> <P> There's no place like home and no cooking like Mom's. Whether it was a  double-rich chocolate cake or a burned batch of canned hash, mother's culinary  capers usually evoke warm feelings -- or at least amusing memories.  </P> <P> Just ask the makers of mother's macaroons, Mom's Apple Pie and Mama's Goodies  -- three of literally hundreds of products that are labeled with some form of  the word mother to convey a special home-quality goodness.  </P> <P> The use of mother in the name conveys a "home-cooked feeling, something  old-fashioned," says Kay V. Porter, owner of mother's macaroons.  </P> <P> That's one reason Porter -- whose business cards prominently note that her  cookies are "handmade with love" -- decided to keep the name "mother's  macaroons" when she expanded her business by opening a small bakery in  Arlington a year ago.  </P> <P> Initially, she planned to call it Harrison Street Bakery to reflect her  diversification into muffins, cookies, pies and other homey baked goods. But  after a few months she changed the name back to mother's macaroons, not only to  feature her star item but also to convey the cozy atmosphere and down-home  quality that is attracting an increasingly loyal following to her bakery.  </P> <P> "The imagery of mother is as good as it comes," says Clive Chajet, chairman of  Lippincott &amp; Margulies, a New York identification and image-consultant  firm. "The word stirs up the image of warm, loving and caring, good quality and  homemade. It's a symbol in the American culture of everything that's good."  </P> <P> That's not to say that the products with "mom" on their label are necessarily  better than others. Some are; many are not. It's just like mom's cooking --  some mothers do it better than others.  </P> <P> Even so, the image of motherhood is so attractive that companies large and  small find it hard to pass up -- from Mama's Goodies, operating out of a garage  in Manassas, Va., to Quaker Oats Co., which sells its grain products to natural  food stores under the "Mother's" label. All these firms are seeking to defy the  cautionary words of 20th-Century novelist Nelson Algren, who warned, "Never eat  at a place called Mom's, never play poker with a man named Doc."  </P> <P> Everyone knows that necessity is the mother of invention; in the case of the  Herndon, Va.-based Mom's Apple Pie, however, it was motherhood that prompted  the invention of the name.  </P> <P> It all began eight years ago with a flippant remark by the company's founder,  Avis Renshaw. She and her husband, Steven Cox, had been selling hot fresh apple  pies to the Reston Farm Market for some time. Every time Renshaw delivered the  pies, the owner complained that they didn't have a name. " 'You've got to have  a name for your product,' he kept telling us," Renshaw recalls. "I was very  pregnant at the time with my second child. Finally, I just looked at my stomach  and said, 'Fine. Call it Mom's Apple Pie,' The name ended up sticking."  </P> <P> Today the company has grown from a home-kitchen enterprise into a $1 million  business with a 9,000-square-foot bakery -- complete with a reconditioned pie  assembly line from a bakery in Iowa and a dough-mixing machine once used in  Mrs. Smith's pie factory. Between 500 and 2,000 pies (in 26 different flavors)  are made daily, with the most made in October; the least in the winter. An  additional 500 to 1,000 loaves of sunflower bread are turned out daily.  </P> <P> Looking back, Renshaw believes the company's name was appropriate. "It worked  out kind of nicely because the business is like a kid; you nurse it along until  it can take care of itself." Renshaw, 31, should know. She has four children;  the youngest, 2-year-old Tyson, likes to spend much of his day riding his  tricycle around the plant and playing hide-and-seek among the 50-pound bags of  flour.  </P> <P> More often than not, however, there is no real mother standing behind the name.  Porter, for instance, never met the mother of macaroon fame. She bought the  business four years ago from a secretary-turned-baker who had used her mother's  macaroon recipe to start up the company. Porter bought the company -- its name,  recipe and wholesale accounts -- and started to expand. In addition to its  bakery and increased line of goods, mother's macaroons now has 60 wholesale  accounts.  </P> <P> Similarly, Amena Rahman is not the mom of Just Like Mom's bakery in Reston. An  Afghanistan refugee who came to the United States nine years ago, Rahman is the  third owner of the small old-fashioned bakery that specializes in apple  fritters and doughnuts. "I liked the name so I kept it," she says. "It makes  people come in and feel like they are in their own home."  </P> <P> There is a mother, however, behind Mama's Goodies. Brenda and John Bolling had  wanted to start a business in their Manassas home and baking seemed a natural.  After all, Brenda Bolling had been baking for a school cafeteria in Manassas,  Va., for 15 years and, as she puts it, "yeast is in my blood."  </P> <P> When it came to naming the business, it was their daughter, then 19, who came  up with the title. "It was what I had always done -- baking goodies," Brenda  Bolling, 47, says. Initially, "I didn't think I would like it. It made me feel  like I was an older woman" when her customers called her Mama. "Now I don't  mind it a bit."  </P> <P> Corporate name experts such as Chajet say that Mother may not always be the  best name. For one thing, given the large number of companies that have mother  in their names, a business "may end up sharing its identification with any  number of brands," Chajet says.  </P> <P> The name Mom's Apple Pie for instance, is not as distinct as Mrs. Fields or  Famous Amos. "So additional money will be needed to promote" a product, Chajet  adds.  </P> <P> Perhaps of even more significance in this day of consumer cynicism, the very  name "mother" may produce an effect opposite to what was intended. "Consumers  are a little too sophisticated to believe the suggestion that there is actually  a mother who stands behind the goodness and purity of a product," comments Ira  N. Bachrach, president of NameLab, a name-consulting firm in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Renshaw found that out when she was delivering pies to Safeway two years ago.  As she was unloading the baked goods, she overheard a man say, "it's probably  just another general ruse by General Foods. There's not really a mom." As  Renshaw recalls it, she went up to the man and said, "No you're wrong, I'm the  mom. My husband and I really do this."  </P> <P> Disbelieving,the man went away. Perhaps it was the way Renshaw looks -- tall,  slender and more often than not clad in blue jeans. "People expect a plump  50-year-old woman with a smile on her face." But the man returned a few minutes  later. " 'You're serious, aren't you?' he said. He went back in and bought a  pie."  </P> <P> If the name "mother" works, how much better could "grandmother" be? That's what  Rhonda Oh will find out as she steps up her sales of "Nana's Shortbread."  </P> <P> A cardiology nurse, Oh began selling her shortbread -- made according to her  Scottish grandmother's recipe -- last Christmas after her friends urged her to  go into business. Initially sales were to corporations and professionals for  use as gifts to clients and colleagues during the holidays. Now, the New  Zealand-born Oh is starting to sell the melt-in-your-mouth buttery biscuits in  local stores, including Sutton Place Gourmet and Bradley Food &amp; Beverage.  </P> <P> The name of the product was a given from the day she went into business, Oh  says. "It was my grandmother's recipe and all my life I have always called it  Nana's shortbread. I just didn't feel I could change the name."  </P> <P> Successful or not, the 35-year-old Oh will nonetheless soon find out the true  meaning of motherhood. She is expecting her first baby.  </P></p>

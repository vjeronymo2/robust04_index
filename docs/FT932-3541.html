			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Price war by DIY chains 'cost Pounds 45m' THE price war between do-it-yourself retailers last year cost the four main chains an estimated Pounds 45m, says a report published today by Verdict, the retail market research group. But the apparent 'truce' since called between the DIY retailers could result in less volatile sales patterns, greater trust and understanding from consumers, and ultimately a recovery in profit margins in the sector, Verdict said. Some of the Pounds 45m cost last year was accounted for by increased advertising to promote the discounting campaigns of the DIY retailers, but most of it was a direct result of reduced margins. The DIY retailers lowered their prices in an effort to stimulate trade, but did not see the expected increase in sales volumes. Verdict believed Texas Homecare, the second-biggest DIY group, started the price war in autumn 1991 in the mistaken belief that economic recovery was imminent. Two chains, Homebase and Wickes, eschewed large-scale discounting, and Verdict said it was 'no coincidence' that these two were the only large DIY retailers to increase their profits and net margins. Verdict said the price war was evidence of the relative immaturity of the DIY industry. Convenience stores, which are grocery shops often open for long hours, now account for the equivalent of 10 per cent of all grocery sales in the UK with sales of Pounds 4.2bn last year, according to Corporate Intelligence, the retail research group.

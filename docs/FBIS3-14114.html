			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by President Husni Mubarak followed by his response </F> to a question from radio correspondent Muntasir Rahmi on 22  March; from the "The World on the Air" program--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Mubarak] Egyptian industry really needs no  testimony from me. A very high percentage of our private sector  and business sector factories could be exporting their products.  As long as they export their products, what better testimony do  they need? [passage omitted]    [Rahmi] Do the things you saw during your tour today reflect  the state of stability in Egypt?    [Mubarak] Egypt is stable. Incidents that occur here and  there are no big issue. Such things happen daily in the world.  But some parties blow things out of proportion. We also used  to exaggerate the issue. To increase their circulation, our  newspapers used to carry banner headlines about incidents not  worth such headlines. Every day I see incidents happen  everywhere that are hundreds of times more frequent than the  incidents in our country. I declare that Egypt is secure and  stable, despite the minor incidents, which, God willing, will  disappear. I hope that the youths who accept a little cash to  do these silly things will regain their senses and realize that  their actions do not serve the country's interests or their own  or their families' interests. All industry, investment,  tourism, and similar projects create jobs for people. When they  carry out these actions, they are costing people's livelihood.  Thank you.    [Rahmi] Thank you, sir.</p>

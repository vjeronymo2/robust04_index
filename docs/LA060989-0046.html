			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> New Yorker Philemona Williamson uses a exotic palette to paint enchanting  scenes that look like childhood or subconscious impressions filtered through  her sensual sagacity. Populated with cartoon-y folk art figures that are more  robust and tensile than those of Robert Colescott, her canvases depict a young  black girl awkwardly maneuvering one high heel and one bare foot, crawling over  furniture amidst curious toy puppets, always eyeing the antics of grown-ups who  often hide behind bizarre masks.  </P> <P> Works are painted in strident swaths of bold poppy yellows, Kelly greens and  lilacs partnered to optimize color's psychological reverberations. Williamson  tilts diagonals and sets action in tight, pressure cooker spaces so her images  have the vertiginous magic of Caribbean carnivals. Mysterious foliage and odd  objects popping up out of context blend indoors and out, past and present,  fantasy and graceful dignity.  </P> <P> In "Shore Road, Magnolia Mass," a nearly grown girl in pleated skirt and  loafers tumbles to the edge of a bright yellow and magenta precipice just as  her father, the chauffeur for a white family, stops the car to offer a powerful  helping hand. Confident, almost cagey, the pigtailed woman-child decides to go  it on her own. (Wenger Gallery, 828 N. La Brea Ave., to July 2.) MARLENA  DONOHUE  </P></p>

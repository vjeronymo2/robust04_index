			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> First, the Department recognizes that the price/marginal cost relationship can vary significantly across utilities. Given the national applicability of appliance standards, we will seek to estimate a price/marginal cost relationship that characterizes national average conditions. The rationale here is identical to that for focusing on national average emission impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the relationship between price and marginal cost may vary across appliances because of the differences in load shapes. For example, refrigerators that run continuously might be considered as contributing to ``base load'', while air conditioners, which are used most intensively on hot afternoons, contribute primarily to ``peak load.'' The Department solicits comment on the need to develop information on the relationship between price and marginal cost, relevant to each individual appliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, there are several different marginal cost concepts. Short run marginal cost may, in systems with excess capacity, include only fuel and incremental fuel and operation and maintenance costs. A long-run marginal cost concept would also include the capital costs of generating facilities. To the extent that transmission and distribution infrastructure costs also vary with marginal demand, these too can be included in marginal cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has not yet developed quantitative estimates of the relationship between price and marginal cost, or determined which marginal cost concept is relevant to the question of externality adders. Evidence that would be relevant to such a quantification includes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The gap between prices to industrial and residential consumers. Assuming that PUC's do not permit sales to industrial users at prices below marginal cost (to do so would force residential and commercial customers to pick up 100 percent of system fixed costs plus a portion of variable costs incurred for utility customers), the price of power to industrial customers with an adjustment for any difference in marginal transmission and distribution costs between the residential and industrial classes, could be taken as an upper bound on marginal supply costs to residential customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported national average electricity rates in 1992 for residential and industrial consumers of $0.082 per kilowatt hour (kWh) and $0.048 per kilowatt hour (kWh), respectively. For natural gas, EIA reports average rates in 1992 of $5.87 per thousand cubic feet and $2.82 per thousand cubic feet for residential and industrial consumers, respectively. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Monthly Energy Review <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , March 1993, Tables 9.9 and 9.11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) The capital and operating cost of incremental capacity. If meeting marginal demand requires new capacity, the relevant marginal cost should include capacity cost. Current estimates of fully-loaded marginal costs for natural gas combined cycle plants or pulverized coal plants are $0.035/kwh to $0.045/kwh. Again, marginal transmission and distribution costs, if any, would also need to be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The marginal cost of dispatching the least efficient capacity in systems with excess capacity. One insight into these costs can be gained by examining the operation and maintenance costs, on a per kilowatt basis, of combustion turbines used for peaking purposes on some systems. Another perspective may be provided by the cost per kilowatt hour of peak-shaving, demand-side management programs approved by various public utility regulatory commissions. Public comments providing information related to these measurement approaches and their qualification would be especially helpful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department solicits comment on the relevance of the categories of evidence cited above, as well as other types of evidence, in establishing a reasoned estimate of the relationship between price and marginal cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

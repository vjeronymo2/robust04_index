Chiang Wednesday [19 January] called on government agencies to  help smooth Taiwan's admission into the World Trade Organization  (WTO).    WTO will be inaugurated in January 1995 to replace the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Taiwan submitted  its application for GATT membership in 1990.    Taiwan must complete all preparatory work and map out a  solid  strategy for admission by the end of October, Chiang said during  a report to the ruling Kuomintang's policy-making central  Standing Committee.    In his report, Chiang said concerned government agencies  should review existing trade and economic practices, determine  which are not compatible with GATT rules and make proper  adjustments.    In the mean time, the government must accelerate its plans  to  open Taiwan to foreign services and crystalize its economic and  trade systems.    Chiang said that GATT or WTO membership would inevitably  harm  the interests of certain sectors and communication between the  parties concerned is a must.    "A remedy, including even subsidies, should be considered  for  those hard hit," Chiang said.</p>

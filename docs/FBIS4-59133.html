			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, May 8 (AFP) -- A majority of  Palestinians in the occupied territories believe their refugee  camps should remain in place until a final settlement is reached  with the Israelis, a survey published Sunday [8 May] showed.    More than 58 percent favoured maintaining the 27 refugee  camps over the scheduled five-year interim period of autonomy,  the Centre for Palestine Research and Studies found.    Half of those nonetheless wanted to see conditions improve  in  the overcrowded camps of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.    However 39 percent preferred to transfer the 430,000 camp  dwellers to new housing projects. The remainder voiced no  opinion in the poll carried out by the Nablus-based centre.    About one million Palestinians are registered as refugees  with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, but 60 percent  live outside the camps.    The April 19 survey found that nearly 37.8 percent of  Palestinians in the territories would vote for Yasir 'Arafat's  mainstream PLO movement Fatah if elections were held to an  autonomy council now.    In March, the centre's poll registered 36.4 percent support.    Backing for the Moslem fundamentalists was stable at about  16  percent in the latest survey, which questioned 2,006  Palestinians and had a three percent margin of error.</p>

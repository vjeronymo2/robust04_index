			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOLA, CAPITAN KIRK;  </P> <P> UNIVERSAL STUDIOS AND OTHER ATTRACTIONS HOPE TO TAP THE LATINO MARKET WITH  SPANISH-LANGUAGE SHOWS AND GUIDES  </P> <P> It was business as usual inside the Star Trek attraction at Universal Studios.  Volunteers from the audience had taken the stage dressed as Starship Enterprise  crew members, Klingons and other aliens. The Enterprise was about to be  attacked, as it is four to six times every Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> "Admiral, estoy detectando una nave Klingones (Captain, I am detecting a  Klingon spaceship)," a crew member said.  </P> <P> The Spanish-speaking director kept up a rapid-fire stream of instructions to  actors and jokes to the audience. In the dressing room backstage,  Spanish-speaking Universal staff members looked after costume and wardrobe  problems.  </P> <P> When the show was over -- "Hasta la vista, Kirk," said the Klingon commander --  the actors gathered at the stage apron. Clearly, they felt a post-performance  exhilaration.  </P> <P> "I saw that program many times at home and it was a lot of fun to be in it,"  Claudia Reyes of Los Mochis, Mexico, said through a translator.  </P> <P> The Spanish-language Star Trek adventure is part of a growing campaign by  Universal Studios Hollywood to attract Latino customers. Each weekend for the  past three years, several of Universal's tram tours have been conducted in  Spanish. The amusement park in Universal City drew large crowds with an  international mariachi festival in August and an appearance in March by stars  of telenovelas, or the Latino soap operas that appear on Spanish-language  stations.  </P> <P> Universal also built a theater for production of the television show "Hablamos  de Cine" ("Let's Talk About Cinema"), a program of movie reviews broadcast on  KMEX -- Channel 34. Park visitors can watch as the show is taped.  </P> <P> David Weitzner, worldwide head of marketing for Universal Studios Hollywood,  said the special attractions are working.  </P> <P> "Our Latino attendance so far this year is up 67% from the total for all of  1988, and we only expect that to increase," he said.  </P> <P> The potential for growth appears to be enormous. Last year, 65,000 of the  park's 4.2 million visitors were Latino, Weitzner said, a scant 1 1/2%.  Meanwhile, Latinos make up an estimated 2.6 million, or 30%, of Los Angeles  County's 8.5 million population. Weitzner expects the park to draw 5 million  visitors this year, with Latinos numbering 100,000, or 2% of the total.  </P> <P> With such a large market to tap, other amusement parks and attractions are  tailoring events and marketing to the Latino community.  </P> <P> This year the Joffrey Ballet, with help from the service organization Plaza de  la Raza, sent representatives to a meeting of a Latino business association to  promote its "Billy the Kid" program and distribute half-price ticket coupons.  The Joffrey held a cocktail reception at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for  those who attended the show.  </P> <P> "Four hundred people came," said Nancy Neal Davis, the Joffrey's West Coast  general manager. "That's how you build a following. They had a great time, and  they'll tell others."  </P> <P> The Joffrey also invited Latino schoolchildren to rehearsals, where principal  dancer Beatriz Rodriguez spoke in Spanish about the various jobs available in  ballet and theater.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Museum of Art offers tours in  </P> <P> Spanish by appointment and, as part of its "Sundays in the Museum" program,  buses in families from community centers in Latino neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Some attractions have not done extensive tailoring of programs to bring in  Spanish-speaking patrons. Magic Mountain in Valencia has only a Father's Day  promotion featuring Latino bands and disc jockeys.  </P> <P> "Our basic philosophy is we market the park to the Southern California  community and a lot of that community is Spanish-speaking," said Courtney  Simmons, the park's public relations manager. "We advertise in their newspapers  and on TV and radio."  </P> <P> The leader in the effort clearly is Universal, where admission is $21 for  adults and $15.50 for children 3 to 11.  </P> <P> Ron Bension, president of Universal Studios Hollywood, said the campaign began  because Latino visitors asked to take the tour in Spanish. Universal has  expanded its foreign-language program to include, by appointment, tours in  German, French, Japanese, Hebrew and American Sign Language.  </P> <P> In December, the park hired Valdes Zacky Associates, a Century City advertising  and public relations firm, to improve its Latino attractions and marketing.  </P> <P> "The Spanish language like any language has a unique culture and a unique  sensitivity, and you have to take that into account," said Dolores Valdes  Zacky, the firm's co-owner. "For the international mariachi festival, we did a  talent search for la nueva voz ranchera (the new ranchera voice). There are  many ranchera singers and their dream is to be accompanied by mariachis of top  quality."  </P> <P> Amateur singers performed with Mariachi Vargas from Mexico City, Los Camperos  from Los Angeles and other well-known groups. The mariachi festival's five  concerts drew 6,000 people.  </P> <P> Valdes Zacky said Latinos can be a boon to a theme park not only because of  their numbers, but also because of their life style.  </P> <P> "The Hispanics spend more money in general than the mainstream," she said.  "They want to have a good time now with their families. If you go to their  songs, they talk about today. They don't care so much about tomorrow."  </P> <P> As with the mariachi shows, the park used audience participation to draw  customers to its Novela (short for telenovela) festival. Patrons acted in  scenes with six soap opera stars.  </P> <P> The novelas are immensely popular. On a recent Spanish-language tour of the  park, a boy was chosen from the audience to play the part of Elliot in a  re-enactment of a scene from the movie "E. T." Asked by the emcee to name his  favorite screen character, the boy did not mention Elliot, E. T., Luke  Skywalker or the like.  </P> <P> "Rosa Salvaje," he said, naming a novela star.  </P> <P> Tour guide Patricio Flores said Spanish-speaking visitors ask the same  questions as  </P> <P> heir English-speaking counterparts -- "How are special-effects produced," "What  are stars like in person?" Some, however, react differently to the park's  earthquake attraction.  </P> <P> "I have seen people crying," he said. "You have people from El Salvador, from  Nicaragua, where there were bad earthquakes. But I think it helps by teaching  them to be calm. After they leave, they aren't so scared of earthquakes."  </P> <P> Marc Medina, head of the Spanish-language tour program, said the guides he  hires must be bilingual because English-speaking visitors often stop them to  ask questions. Medina, who started as a guide three years ago, said the strong  family orientation of Latinos is another reason the park is seeking them as  customers.  </P> <P> "It's a different type of group," he said. "Normally an English tour is two  people, four people. These people, they come with everybody. There's  grandmother and uncle, sometimes 20 people."  </P></p>

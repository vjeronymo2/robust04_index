			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Malaysia signs power contract - Contracts &amp; ventures Tarmac, one of Britain's biggest construction groups, is to take the lead role in a Dollars 250m contract to build a 1,000MW Malaysian power station which the British group says will be the largest in the country. The contract has been awarded to General Electric of the US but Tarmac is expected to be responsible for about three-quarters of the work. The ban by the Malaysian government on awarding public sector contracts to British companies, only recently lifted, meant that the successful bid involving Tarmac, Black and Veatch, the US power station designers, and GE only remained in the running if the contract was to be awarded to a non-British company. TBV Power, a joint venture between Tarmac and Black and Veatch, will design, construct and supply equipment for phase three of a power station complex at Kepar in Selangor state. GE is to supply the turbines. The power station is for the state power utility Tenaga Nasional Berhad and will supply electricity to Kuala Lumpur and the industrial Kelang Valley. Mr Neville Simms, Tarmac chief executive, said the contract formed 'part of the group's new strategy to concentrate our efforts towards the growing markets in the Far East and Pacific rim'.</p>

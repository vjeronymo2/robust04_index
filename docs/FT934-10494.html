			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Moynihan aims to put more bucks on bullets THE great American debate over crime and gun control moved into higher gear this week as a result both of Tuesday's elections and of initiatives and actions in Congress. The House of Representatives on Wednesday authorised funding for a package of measures along lines proposed by President Bill Clinton, including the recruitment of as many as 50,000 new police officers nationwide. This clears the way for consideration next week of the long-stalled Brady bill, which would require purchasers of handguns to wait five days before taking possession. The Senate, also putting crime on its agenda, is expected to vote by the end of the year on the bill, named after Mr James Brady, the White House press secretary severely wounded in the attempt on President Ronald Reagan's life in 1981. While agreement on an omnibus crime bill is far from certain, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, injected a significant new element into the political equation by proposing that Mr Clinton's healthcare reform bill include swingeing increases in the federal tax on handgun ammunition. 'It is time the federal government began taxing handgun ammunition used in crime out of existence,' he said. His proposal would certainly do this for the most destructive bullets. He asked for a general sales tax increase on bullets to 50 cents from the current 11 cents, with the annual licence fee for manufacturing ammunition rising from Dollars 10 to Dollars 10,000. But he also called for a 10,000 per cent increase in the tax on one Winchester cartridge, known as the Black Talon and advertised for its penetrative capabilities. This would lift the price on a box of 20 from about Dollars 24 to around Dollars 150,000. Senator Moynihan has recommended this approach before and it was picked up last month by Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, who emphasised she was speaking only in a personal capacity. But it was received cautiously on Wednesday by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, and immediately condemned by the National Rifle Association as just another 'egghead' notion. The NRA reckons it has had a very good week. Two of its toughest critics, Mr James Florio in New Jersey and Ms Mary Sue Terry in Virginia, were defeated in gubernatorial contests, while across the country state and local voters approved propositions calling for stiffer jail sentences, more prisons and more policemen. These are part of the current NRA anti-crime campaign which is designed in part to draw attention away from the issue of gun control itself. On the other hand, neither Mrs Christine Todd Whitman nor Mr George Allen, the victors, campaigned in favour of rescinding recent gun control legislation in both states. Mrs Whitman argued against anything that would make possession of assault weapons any easier, while Mr Allen focused most of his attack on toughening Virginia's parole laws.</p>

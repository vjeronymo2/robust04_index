			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Wm Low falls to Pounds 8.8m after 'one-off' costs WM LOW, the Dundee-based grocery chain which operates 68 stores in Scotland and northern England, yesterday reported a 23 per cent drop in profits after an accident-prone six months. Interim profits fell from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 8.82m pre-tax as the operating margin was eaten away by a series of one-off costs and increased promotional spending. Mr James Millar, chairman, said: 'We let slip a little on the control of costs and gross margin and in today's markets you cannot afford to do that. 'But we are back on track and in full control of our own destinies in the second half,' he added. Mr Millar's comments appeared to reassure the City and Low's shares rose 10p to 223p. Sales in the 28 weeks to March 21 rose from Pounds 198m to Pounds 222m, but operating margins were eroded from 5.55 per cent to 4.15 per cent due to increased promotional activity, store openings, and higher branch and head office costs. Mr Colin Mitchell, the former managing director who abruptly left the company in February, received severance pay of about Pounds 200,000. Five other executives who left in a cost-cutting campaign also received redundancy pay, resulting in a total exceptional charge of Pounds 330,000. Low is still searching for a new chief executive. A lower tax charge helped protect earnings per share, but they still slipped from 13.28p to 10.03p. The interim dividend is held at 2.7p. Low said underlying sales were running at 4 per cent ahead of last year. 'Within that figure we are seeing some real volume gains, with food inflation running at about 3.5 per cent,' said Mr Harvie Findlay, finance director. COMMENT The City was unnerved earlier this year by Mr Mitchell's departure and the profits warning that followed soon after. Although the events were unconnected, the company only sullied its reputation for reliability and investors shunned the stock. Yesterday's comforting noises on volume sales and costs suggested that some kind of rehabilitation was on the way as the share price rebounded sharply. And pre-tax profits of Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 23.6m) for the year, putting Low on a prospective multiple of 10, are hardly demanding. Low's management is still widely admired; its expansion programme will improve quality of space as well as quantity; and the food market is perhaps seeing the first glimmers of recovery. But having said all that the question nonetheless has to be asked: do investors want to be exposed to a stumbling second-line food retailer with only limited upside potential in an economic recovery and with an uncertain long-term future? The brutal answer is: probably not.</p>

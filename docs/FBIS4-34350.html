			<p>BFN     [Text] The sessions of the ministers of the Jonassaint  government have resumed in the Senate of the Republic, Sansaricq  branch. The minister of Health was received on 16 June by the  contested 18 January elected senators and some senators from the  Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion. In his presentation, Dr.  Jean Boirond insisted, at length, on the necessity for the  Haitian state to take control of public health throughout the  country. Moreover, he denounced the attitude of the  nongovernmental organizations [NGO's] and of the World Health  Organization [WHO] which attempt, according to the minister, to  replace the Haitian state in the health fields.    [Begin Boirond recording] The NGO's have taken advantage of  the political situation, with the complicity of the  international organizations in general, and the representation  of the health organizations, especially WHO, by attempting to  replace, and in some specific fields, in fact usurp, the  prerogatives granted to the Health Ministry by the Constitution  and the laws in effect. The objectives that we are aiming at,  since our appointment, are first: to reestablish the authority  and credibility of the Ministry of Public Health and Population;  second, to put in operation some central and outlying structures  of the Ministry of Public Health and Population; third, to  guarantee an acceptable level of care as much in quality as  quantity for the overall population and, especially for the  populations in difficulty; and fourth, to prepare the transition.    We have been giving ourselves priorities that I am going to  present for your judgment. First, we think it is necessary to  make primary medical care available, for which some assistance  is already available in the country at the level of primary  health care. Our second priority is still the hospital of  Haitian State University, the national point of reference. Our  third objective is the creation of ambulatory medical assistance  with the creation of a mobile surgery unit. [end recording]</p>

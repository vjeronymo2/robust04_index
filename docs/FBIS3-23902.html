			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Rabotnova: "Democrats by Conviction, </F> Rather Than by Profession"]    [Text] "All St.Petersburg" is an attempt to unite the  efforts of people who are realistically working for the good of  the city, the organizers of that pre-election bloc feel.  Speaking at a press conference at the Petergof Hotel, they  emphasized that "All St. Petersburg" is not a political  association. "We are democrats by conviction, rather than by  profession," Yuriy Derevyanko, Astrobank vice-president and  former deputy to the city soviet, explained.    In his opinion, the City Assembly, first of all, should  decide the problem of increasing the income part of the budget,  but this necessitates supporting in an organized manner  small-sized and medium-sized business and state enterprises.    "All St. Petersburg" assumes that the assembly will succeed  in refining its rights, but the Statute that is currently in  effect provides it with a sufficient amount of powers to begin  work. The bloc is in favor of having the deputies carry out  their activities on an unprofessional basis. According to  Derevyanko, any employed individual who has organized his job  normally will be able to set aside two days a week for deputy  activities.    At the press conference it was noted that the association  will nominate candidates, each of whom is a professional in his  area and who can analyze the consequences of the decisions to be  made. On the whole, however, the bloc leaders say that they will  view the results of the voting as a victory if 75 percent of the  mandates are given to intelligent persons -- not necessarily  from "All St. Petersburg."</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: News says its investment in Fairfax is short-term Mr Ken Cowley, chief executive of News Limited, the Australian arm of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, said the media group sees its investment in John Fairfax, a rival Australian newspaper publisher, as a fairly short-term holding. News created a flurry of speculation last month when it disclosed that it had acquired a 1.7 per cent holding in Fairfax, after the publisher sent out formal notices requesting details of share trading in mid-June. Fairfax subsequently confirmed the News holding had risen to more than 2 per cent. Speaking on television at the weekend, Mr Cowley seemed to downplay the situation. 'It is a passive investment,' he said. 'I don't see it as long term.' Many observers see the ownership situation at Fairfax, whose publications include the Sydney Morning Herald and the Financial Review, as inherently unstable. Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman, holds 15 per cent of the shares, but is unable to go higher under government media cross-ownership rules, while Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media tycoon, is approaching the 25 per cent shareholding limit imposed on foreign investors.</p>

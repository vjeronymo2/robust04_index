			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Today's FOMC meeting restrains region The Nikkei 225 average closed marginally softer after arbitrage buying offset earlier selling by overseas and individual investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index lost 22.91 at 19,261.45 after a day's high of 19,298.96 and low of 19,115.72. Arbitrage unwinding coupled with profit-taking by foreigners and retail investors depressed the index, but corporate and arbitrage buying helped share prices recoup losses later. Volume totalled 231m shares, against 290m. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 0.15 at 1,517.82 and the Nikkei 300 put on 0.20 at 278.70, but falls led rises by 555 to 388, with 228 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up 1.77 at 1,252.25. Traders said investors were cautious ahead of today's US Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which is expected to decide on an interest rate rise. Meanwhile, investors continued to focus on earnings announcements. Many analysts believed that most of this year's earnings growth had been discounted into share prices, as well as most of the profits rise for next year. However, Mr Jason James at James Capel said the profits growth for the whole economic cycle had yet to be factored into the market. The rise in the dollar against the yen supported export-orientated electricals. The US currency moved up to the Y98 level for the first time since October 18. Mitsubishi Electric rose Y4 to Y702, NEC Y10 to Y1,160 and Pioneer Electronic Y20 to Y2,500. Tokyo Securities, which announced a Y32bn extraordinary loss stemming from unauthorised derivatives trading, finished at an offered price of Y570, down from its Friday close of Y670. Nikko Securities, a leading shareholder in Tokyo, declined Y20 to Y1,000. Other leading brokers were mixed, with Nomura Securities unchanged at Y1,870 and Yamaichi Securities adding Y14 at Y699. Mitsui Fudosan, a leading real estate developer, retreated Y20 to Y1,000 following poor interim earnings announced last week. The company posted a 50 per cent fall in first-half recurring profits. In contrast, Mitsubishi Estate, another property developer, moved up Y4 to Y702. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 29.02 to 21,293.58 in volume of 114.5m shares. Roundup Today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting restrained a number of Pacific Rim markets, although others found domestic factors to take them higher. SEOUL saw broadly based advances in a technical rebound after last week's four consecutive declines, and the composite index rallied 12.34 to 1,128.57. A 28-times oversubscription of the state-owned Korea Telecom shares bolstered others in the sector. Korea Mobile hit its upper limit of Won12,000 at Won631,000 and Dacom added Won2,500 at Won126,500. TAIPEI turned back as short-term investors and speculators took profits and retreated to the sidelines in the belief that the market would stagnate in the two weeks before next month's elections. The weighted index ended 89.41 or 1.4 per cent down at 6,393.27 in turnover of TDollars 26.9bn. SYDNEY lost ground on expectations of higher US interest rates, and the All Ordinaries index weakened 25.5 or 1.3 per cent to 1,926.5, its lowest close since September 22, 1993. WELLINGTON was on hold ahead of the FOMC meeting. The NZSE-40 Capital index closed 22.02 off at 2,054.61 in light turnover of NZDollars 22m. Fletcher Challenge fell 14 cents to NZDollars 4.25. HONG KONG ended a lifeless session slightly higher, having reversed mild losses in late trade, boosted mainly by a jump in shares of Li Ka-shing's companies. The Hang Seng index put on 11.07 at 9,378.92 in turnover that fell to HKDollars 1.75bn, the lowest since July 5. BOMBAY was again led lower by falls in Reliance and Tata Iron and Steel. The BSE 30-share index dropped 37.71 to 4,020.99 on selling pressure from mutual funds busy mobilising funds for several forthcoming primary issues. Tisco fell Rs7.50 to Rs267.50 and Reliance Rs8.75 to Rs363.75. SINGAPORE blue chips closed mixed but Malaysian stocks traded over the counter found fresh demand from retail buyers. The Straits Times Industrial index firmed 4.35 to 2,326.94, while Malaysian situation stocks rose sharply, resulting in a 22.92 gain in the UOB OTC index to 1,182.59. KUALA LUMPUR was broadly higher in cautious trade and the composite index closed 14.44 ahead at 1,044.31, helped by gains in some key blue chip stocks. BANGKOK finished firmer on late buying of blue chips, after drifting in negative territory for most of the morning. The SET index added 11.62 at 1,477.84 in turnover of Bt5bn.</p>

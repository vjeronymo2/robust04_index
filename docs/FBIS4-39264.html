			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vasyl Ivanov, people's deputy of Ukraine and </F> member of the faction "Communists of Ukraine" by unidentified  reporter; place and date not given: from the "Current Interview"  feature]    [Text] VYBIR: How expedient is the election for heads of  regional councils by the direct voting in regions?    V.I.: The matter is that a regional council will elect one  head, and voters -- one more head, and I understand this is as  unsatisfactory to us. There is something alike presidential  emissaries in it. And it will cause unnecessary parallelism. We  have already had it and the system has not proved to work. For  strong power this power must be concentrated with one organ --  regional council.    We are worried that the heads of regional councils elected  by  the direct voting in regions may not volunteer to be subordinate  to the Supreme Council. A deputy is elected in electoral  district, and a head of regional council -- in the respective  region, so the latter may claim to have more powers.    VYBIR: What is your forecast as to the elections for the  president?    V.I.: We were against the post of President, but the  election  campaign is already going on, and we will support Oleksandr  Moroz as we consider he has the best chances. Nowadays people  understand that the life has become worse, that is why they hope  for us -- communists and socialists.    VYBIR: Why was the President's proposal to postpone the  elections rejected?    V.I.: To wait today with a hope that it will become better  in  future and connect it with the presidential elections is a  mistake. Presently Kravchuk is trying to postpone the elections  hoping that the popularity of the left-oriented forces will  subside, and his chances will grow.    VYBIR: How necessary is it to limit the presidential powers?    V.I.: It is necessary to cut them down as much as possible.  In general, presidential model hardly suits Ukraine.    VYBIR: Thank you.</p>

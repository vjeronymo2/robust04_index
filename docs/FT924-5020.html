			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions THE HUGE sale in Betterware dominates the week. With the bulk of the shares retained by the founding Cohen family, this disposal of 1.25m was executed by a trust of which the children of managing director Andrew Cohen are beneficiaries. The trustees are not members of the family and the sale was made to diversify the portfolio. Betterware interim results were far in excess of brokers' expectations. Shares in Etam, the high street clothing retailer, have outperformed the market over the past 12 months. Rodney East, the group managing director, has sold 120,000 at 240p, thereby reducing his stake to 880,000. Following on from last week's reported sale in Photo-Me International, Serge Crasnianski, of Imaging Systems, has sold a further 325,000 shares at just over 306p. Peter Stormonth Darling has sold 33,853 shares in Warburg at 482p. Stormonth Darling has just been succeeded by Hugh Stevenson as chairman of Mercury Asset Management the fund management arm of Warburg,  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              No of Company                 Sector       Shares        Value     directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Abbott Mead Vickers     Med             14,000           52        1 Betterware              Stor         1,250,000        2,062        1 City Centre Rest        H&amp;L            312,000          217        1* Etam                    Stor           124,381          298        2 Herring, Baker, Ha      Prop            58,021           73        1 MacFarlane Group        Pack           100,000          210        1 Marks and Spencer       Stor           131,428          422        1* Photo-Me Intl           Misc           325,000          996        1 Staveley Industries     OthI            22,084           45        1* Warburg (SG)            Merc            33,853          163        1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Ass Brit Consultnts     Misc           148,066           39        1 Beattie (James) 'A'     Stor            10,000           12        1 BTR (Nylex)             Chem            10,000   Adollars23        1 Capital Gearing         n/a             10,000           32        1 Greggs                  FdRe             2,700           10        1 HTV                     Med            100,000           17        1 Merivale Moore          Prop           200,000           10        1 Mirror Group            Med             50,000           38        1 Pegasus                 Elns            50,000           60        1 Relyon                  Misc            15,000           18        1 Wholesale Fittings      Elns            35,000           59        1 Wills Group             BuSe           200,000           22        1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in pounds000s.

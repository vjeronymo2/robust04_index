			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO ANSWER THE CRY FOR HELP;  </P> <P> * FOR NOW HUMANITARIAN AID IS BEST BET  </P> <P> The Soviet Union makes no secret of its urgent interest in getting aid from the  West. Its officials warn that without massive assistance the country's  stagnating economy could collapse, pulling down with it President Mikhail  Gorbachev and his plans for reform and crushing the great hopes that have been  raised for a calmer and more stable international order.  </P> <P> That argument has won a sympathetic hearing in Europe, especially in France and  West Germany, whose leaders plan to raise the aid issue at next month's  seven-nation Western economic summit meeting in Houston. President Bush, who  heretofore has scoffed at the notion of Western aid for Moscow, now indicates  he's at least ready to talk about it.  </P> <P> Certainly there's a case to be made that strictly in its own self-interest, the  West should do what it can to try to head off a Soviet economic collapse.  What's at issue is not saving communism, which is sick beyond any hope of  revival, but a chance to forestall threatened domestic turmoil and its probable  consequences, including the re-emergence of regressive rule in the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> Few would dispute the value of doing what can be done to help Soviet reformers  gain time to effect changes, especially given the probable alternative. For if  efforts to replace a thoroughly discredited system fail, if the reformers can't  deliver, there's little doubt that it would be the most brutal and reactionary  elements in Soviet society who would move to seize power, reimposing with  whatever violence was needed the full and terrible weight of state tyranny.  </P> <P> What exactly might be done by Western donors?  </P> <P> Firm ideas are scarce for now, although it's probable that at least a European  consensus could take shape by the time of the Houston summit. Any U.S.  contribution, given economic realities, would almost surely have to be limited  to food and other humanitarian help. Far clearer is what the Soviets must do if  they expect to invite significant outside aid. The major need is for bolder  steps toward a reasonably true -- not a "regulated" -- market economy. Without  such structural changes it's inevitable that much if not most of any foreign  aid given would be devoured by inefficiency and corruption.  </P> <P> President Bush is right in insisting on a second condition: It would make no  sense for Western donors to deliver money or resources through the Soviet  Union's front door, while out the back door an estimated $5 billion in annual  support continues to flow to Cuba. If the Soviets expect Western help, that  subsidy has to stop. Congress, which must repeal or suspend certain laws before  U.S. aid would be possible, undoubtedly shares that view.  </P> <P> What are the chances of a Western aid program for the Soviet Union? Better now,  certainly, than at any time since World War II. But there's still a lot to be  done on both sides before that idea becomes a reality.  </P></p>

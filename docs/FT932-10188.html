			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / The last wise man speaks out An ounce of emotion is worth a ton of facts, I was told by one of my first editors. It is a lesson that George Kennan seems to have learned well. His idiosyncratic new book, Around the Cragged Hill: A Personal and Political Philosophy* is delectably outspoken. It combines intensely personal reflections on the human predicament with a searing, yet good-humoured, critique of modern American society. Mr Kennan, a veteran diplomat and scholar, once earned the sobriquet 'America's last wise man.' Still best known for his role as a principal architect of the US's post second world war 'containment of communism' strategy, he has in his late 80s begun to turn his mind to domestic matters. He has two suggestions for solving US social woes, both of which are too bold to be taken seriously in Washington. The first is the division of the US into 12 largely self-governing republics, such as 'New England', the 'old south', the 'northwest' and so on. He argues that the US, along with the former Soviet Union, China, India and Brazil, is a 'monster country', ungover-nable because it is simply too big and diverse to be run from a single capital city. The states, on the other hand, are mostly too small to become viable independent units. He claims the false premise in all domestic debates - be it health care, drugs, abortion or whatever - is that any one policy either could or should suit all parts of the continent. Virtual dismemberment is the only long-run solution; it would have the advantage, he says, of allowing southern regions to merge into Latin America if that is what they want. (Actually this idea does have some support: in the Pacific northwest pundits have pondered the feasibility of hiving off a few states and creating a separate country called 'Cascadia'). Mr Kennan's other idea is to create a 'Council of State' consisting of nine distinguished citizens drawn from any walk of life except politics. They would be appointed by the president but he (or she) would be able to choose only from a panel of 100 people, selected strictly on merit and without political bias. Mr Kennan hopes that such a council, while formally only an advisory body, would eventually gain the same kind of clout as the Supreme Court. It would address the great domestic issues of the day, such as the budget deficit and health care, and try to determine what is in the nation's long-term interest. The great virtue of the council, Mr Kennan argues, is that it would be non-elected. In some measure it would thus compensate for the inadequacies of Congress and the presidency, bodies whose ability to act in the national interest have been fatally undermined by short-term political pressures. His personal and political philosophy is just as startling. He starts from the premise that man is an irredeemably flawed vessel. His crude innate impulses - especially the desire to prevail over others - are permanently in conflict with morality and the ideals of civilised life. Mortality and the cruel vagaries of chance, meanwhile, create an 'inevitable element of tragedy' in every human life. The only way out is through religious faith. Yet, in common with many others, Mr Kennan has found the concept of an all-powerful God impossible to reconcile with a world of arbitrary suffering. His novel solution is to believe in two Gods: a Primary Cause who brought the physical world into being and has no interest in our fate; and an entirely separate Merciful Deity, partly within us, to whom we can turn at a time of need. This latter deity has no control over the objective conditions of our lives but, for believers, provides a superhuman reser-voir of spiritual strength. Mr Kennan writes movingly of his contact with this deity. His political philosophy defies conventional categories. He roundly condemns America's 'intense commercialism' and fails to see anything desirable in economic growth per se. 'Would there not be something diseased, something cancerous, something open-ended and unstable, about an economy that had to be constantly growing to be seen as adequate to national needs?' Yet he has no time for left-wing critics of market economics either, largely because their utopian philosophies fail to come to terms with man's flawed nature. He castigates the lip service paid to egalitarianism, rejecting the claim that heavier taxes on the rich can possibly make anybody else better off. 'I find, in the liberal treatment of these questions, so much oversimplification, social jealously and intellectual posturing that I have no choice but to disassociate myself from it.' Indeed, he is sufficiently indifferent to fashionable opinion to lament the disappearance of domestic service, inviting the reader to imagine de Tocqueville, or any great writer, washing pans and emptying the trash. There is a disturbingly elitist and authoritarian undercurrent in much of Mr Kennan's book: at times he does not bother to hide his conviction that most people do not really know what is good for them. Yet there is also a bite and an honesty in his writing that is wonderfully refreshing. *Published by W W Norton, New York Dollars 22.95.</p>

The measure to mobilize an undetermined number of soldiers  was adopted this morning by the military garrison in Anzoategui  State, following the governor's request this morning to Garrison  Commander Miguel Aparicio Ramirez.    Police had been literally "run over" the past few days by  angry mobs and had been unable to prevent vandalism, which left  many supermarkets looted and several vehicles ablaze. Up until  now the authorities have not disclosed whether any arrests have  been made.    Violence unleashed by a group calling itself "Red Flag"  [bureau records show this organization was founded in 1970 by  Carlos Betancourt] had paralyzed activities in Barcelona,  capital of Anzoategui State, for about a week. Disturbances  also reached the nearby beach resort of Puerto la Cruz.    Even though both Barcelona and Puerto la Cruz woke up in  complete calm today, it was a tense calm because of the presence  of National Guardsmen patrolling the streets.    Meanwhile, transportation services, which had been  temporarily suspended, have been totally reestablished, allowing  students and workers to meet their obligations, the local  VENPRES wire service reported. Likewise, many businessmen  opened their stores.    Anzoategui Governor Ovidio Gonzalez gave assurances that the  situation had been normalized in the northern part of the state,  even though he would not admit that Barcelona and Puerto la Cruz  are "militarized." He said that street patrols by the Armed  Forces represent "a routine situation when there is violence."</p>

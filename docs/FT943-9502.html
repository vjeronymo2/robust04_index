			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / TB/HIV epidemic 'could hit Asia' As many as 12m lives could be saved in developing countries during the next decade if the industrialised world increased annual spending on tuberculosis programmes by between Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.6m) and Dollars 150m, the World Health Organisation said yesterday. The world's foreign aid agencies spend only Dollars 16m a year on controlling TB. The WHO itself spent only Dollars 7m on its TB programme this year. Yet it can cost as little as Dollars 13 to cure someone of the disease, Dr Arata Kochi, programme manager of the WHO's tuberculosis programme, told the 10th international conference on Aids in Yokohama. TB and HIV threatened to combine to create a huge epidemic in Asia that would dwarf that sweeping Africa and other parts of the world, said Dr Kochi. Annual TB/HIV deaths in Asia would surpass Africa by the end of the decade, he added. Over the next 10 years, the cost to the Asian economies of the Aids epidemic alone could reach Dollars 52bn, according to the WHO. Dr Tadao Shimao, president of the Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association, said that over the same period TB and Aids together would kill more people in Asia than the numbers equal to the combined populations of the cities of Singapore, Beijing, Yokohama and Tokyo. About a third of the world's population carried the TB bacilli, although most never become ill, said Dr Kochi. However, an HIV-positive person was 30 times more likely to develop TB than a non-infected individual, and was then capable of passing TB to non-HIV-positive family and friends. 'This raises the frightening prospect that the general population now no longer has nothing to fear from close proximity to HIV-positive people. They are at risk (of contracting TB) simply by breathing the same air as (HIV-positive) people with TB,' warned Dr Shimao. The WHO estimated that in some parts of Asia, such as Thailand, India and Nepal, as many as 70 per cent of Aids patients develop TB. The median life-expectancy of an HIV-positive TB patient is six months. TB already kills nearly 2m every year in Asia. The organisation estimates that an additional package of between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 2.9bn would be required each year to set up and maintain a basic programme for HIV prevention. Funding for the WHO's Global Programme on Aids has fallen from a peak of Dollars 90m a year to only Dollars 70m in 1994.</p>

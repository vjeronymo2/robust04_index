			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (3): Signs of overheating - The economy THE unofficial indicators of prosperity in eastern Mediterranean countries - weekend traffic jams, supermarkets filled with well-groomed shoppers and crowded seaside restaurants - are much in evidence in Cyprus. A heavy emphasis on consumer spending is one enduring consequence of the upheaval in 1974 when about 180,000 Greek Cypriots were driven from the north of the island, leaving behind hotels, factories and citrus orchards that represented more than 60 per cent of the island's resources. Another is the Greek Cypriot insistence on acquiring skills abroad, a reflection both of high unemployment in the early years of rebuilding and the sense of security derived from being able, if necessary, to earn a living outside the island. In fact, economic recovery came swiftly in the south, with priority given to short-term infrastructure projects financed through foreign aid and borrowing. It took only five years for incomes to return to pre-1974 levels. Exports rose as new, labour-intensive manufacturing exploited demand in the Gulf states during the oil boom, while services benefited from Beirut's decline as a business centre. When mass tourism took off in the south, the growth rate also soared, averaging more than 5 per cent in the late 1980s. However, the Gulf war dealt the tourist industry a harsh blow last year. Although bookings picked up as the season advanced, hoteliers were obliged to accept sharply reduced prices to ensure occupancy rates that would cover the year's costs. Exports were also affected with a number of small plants dependent on orders from the Gulf being forced to shut down, while port activity at Limassol, a regional transhipment centre, slowed down. As if this were not enough to contend with, a severe drought hit Cyprus last winter. With little water available for irrigation despite a sustained conservation effort, agricultural output fell by 10.1 per cent. The economy grew by just 1.5 per cent in 1991. Yet this appears to have been only a temporary setback, according to the government planning bureau. Projected growth for 1992 is 7 per cent, led by a recovery in exports and what seems likely to be a record year for tourism. But as Cyprus heads into an election year, signs of overheating are emerging. Inflation reached 6 per cent last year; the introduction of value added tax this summer may bring it to 7.5 per cent this year. While exports remained steady at CPounds 390m in 1991, imports surged by 20 per cent as consumers launched a spending spree in advance of VAT. This, coupled with a decline in tourism earnings, transformed a current account surplus of CPounds 40m in 1990 into a CPounds 110.8m deficit, equivalent to 3.8 per cent of GDP. With collective wage agreements in several sectors coming up for renewal this year, the unions will be asking for larger rises on top of index-linked increases twice a year. Their bargaining power is enhanced by a labour shortage which has forced employers to import short-term contract workers, mostly from eastern Europe. 'Real increases of 3-4 per cent a year are standard now, and the unions are a militant bunch. It will be hard to restrain demand in an election year,' says one analyst. The government has little room to manoeuvre, after being forced by Parliament not only to limit VAT to a single 5 per cent rate but to postpone its introduction for six months. In the meantime, a new tax package, including across-the-board cuts in income tax, had already come into effect. The resulting budget deficit amounted to 5.1 per cent of GDP, double the previous year's figure. But given the pre-electoral commitment to spending on high profile projects such as port and road improvements, the deficit is unlikely to shrink much this year. Still, whatever the imbalances in southern Cyprus, they pale into insignificance against the problems facing the self-styled Turkish Cypriot republic. The collapse in 1990 of the fruit-to-electronics empire of Mr Asil Nadir, a Cypriot by birth, cut short a brief period of optimism about the future. About 8,000 Turkish Cypriots, some 12 per cent of the workforce, were employed in a dozen companies he controlled in northern Cyprus, from citrus exporting to packaging, hotels and newspaper publishing. With three-quarters of Mr Nadir's employees now out of work, northern Cyprus again relies heavily on aid from Turkey, amounting to more than Dollars 60m yearly. Over the years, Turkish state banks have also financed construction of roads, two airports and expansion at Kyrenia port. Yet per capita income in the north is less than one-third that in internationally-recognised Cyprus and appears to be falling further behind. No official figures are available, but growth last year is thought to have been negative, after a 5.5 per cent rise in 1990. While crossing the Green Line that divides Cyprus is officially forbidden, several hundred Turkish Cypriots slip into the south daily to put in a few hours of work on a Greek Cypriot construction site. As in the south, tourism is the mainstay of the economy, with some 600,000 visitors from Turkey last year but only 42,000 foreign tourists. Northern Cyprus was also hit badly by cancellations due to the Gulf crisis. This year, a 30 per cent increase in foreign arrivals is forecast, the result of more effective marketing in western Europe, and receipts may rise to Dollars 25m. But sharing a currency with Turkey means that northern Cyprus imports a Turkish inflation rate of more than 70 per cent. Index-linking of wages now lags several months behind, adding to the gloomy mood. With each year that passes, it becomes clearer that without a political settlement, the economic gap between Greek and Turkish Cypriots can only continue to widen.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Epidemics threaten ex-USSR A wave of epidemics is threatening the former Soviet Union. One person has died of anthrax in Ukraine this week and there is a risk of a cholera outbreak in Moscow, where the disease has already claimed one victim. Health officials said 24 people suspected of carrying the disease escaped from police detention over the weekend after Moscow police had tried to hold a group of 67 visitors from the southern Russian region of Dagestan, the source of an epidemic which has affected 375 people and killed 12. Russia's deputy health minister has called for the entire republic of Dagestan to be put under quarantine. Five villages in the region have already been isolated. Over the weekend, health authorities in neighbouring Ukraine issued an anthrax warning. Fourteen people in Ukraine are known to be infected with anthrax.</p>

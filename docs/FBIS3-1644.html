Prospecting by the province's geological and mineral  departments has discovered 88 kinds of minerals, of which 59 are  worthy for industrial exploration.    Reserves of ten minerals, such as arenaceous quartz, natural  gas and iron ore, rank among the top in the country.    The province's deposits of iron ore take up more than 70  percent of the country's iron-rich ore deposits. The ore goes  to some 100 iron and steel plants in the country.    The province is also abundant in a great number of metal  ores, stone, coal and crude oil resources on land and under  nearby waters.    At present, the annual output value of the province's mining  and related processing industry is worth about one billion yuan  (114.9 million U.S. dollars).</p>

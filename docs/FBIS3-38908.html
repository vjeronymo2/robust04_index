			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>   [Text] The Cypriot Government has prepared a list of issues  and questions to discuss at the proximity talks. The list  includes issues of security and legal aspects that may create  danger from the pseudostate's direct or indirect recognition.  The United Nations has also submitted a list of issues in  preparing the agenda for the talks that will begin late next  week.    According to reliable I SIMERINI information, the government  will raise the following issues and questions:    First: The simultaneous opening of Varosha and Nicosia  Airport. The president will set a period of 18 months for the  implementation of these measures.    Second: There must be no occupation army around the  Famagusta  fenced-off area. This falls under the "security" aspect.    Third: Access to the fenced-off area must be possible from  the free areas. The Greek side wants a road through Dherinia  but there is also talk of a passage through the British bases  (in Ayios Nikolaos). This is also a security issue.    Fourth: The issue of travel documents. The passports that  the Turkish Cypriots will use when traveling from Nicosia  Airport and how they will be stamped.    Fifth: Who will have control of the sea area around Varosha?    Sixth: How will the Cypriot Government transfer control of  Nicosia Airport to the United Nations?    Seventh: The Cypriot Government will not pay even one cent  to  repair the airport and Famagusta's neighborhoods that will be  placed under UN control.    The United Nations yesterday submitted their own list of  issues. Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate  special representative in Cyprus, and UN Political Adviser John  Paul Kavanagh yesterday met President Glavkos Kliridhis and  Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas. The key points, as they  have described them, concern security issues raised by both  sides, access to the fenced-off area, movement from and to  Varosha, passports, stamps, authorities and how they will be  transferred to the United Nations, who will have the right to  land and take off at the airport (Turkish Cypriot Airlines), and  timetables.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Baird loss a setback for Clinton PRESIDENT Bill Clinton suffered his first big political defeat in the small hours of yesterday morning, his administration not yet 48 hours old, when Ms Zoe Baird withdrew her nomination as the next US attorney general. In his letter to Ms Baird and in remarks before his first cabinet meeting later in the morning, Mr Clinton said that he was 'saddened' by her withdrawal but he had not 'agonised' over accepting it. He described her as 'an exceptionally gifted attorney and a person of great decency and integrity'. Mr Clinton said he took 'full responsibility' for the fact that the extent of the problems she might face was not appreciated. Ms Baird, 40, would have been the first woman to head the justice department. She ran into severe criticism when it was revealed that she had employed two illegal immigrants for household work. In her letter to Mr Clinton she wrote that she was 'surprised at the extent of the public reaction' but concluded that the opportunity 'to reinvigorate' the justice department would be lost by the continuing controversy. In hearings this week, she confessed to breaking the law, for which she had subsequently paid social security taxes and a civil penalty. Mr Clinton promised to begin the search for a replacement immediately but the White House avoided a commitment to finding another woman nominee. Ms Baird's cause was lost with escalating speed on Thursday evening. The general reaction on Capitol Hill yesterday was that in the end the president and Ms Baird had little choice but to accept defeat. Senator Patrick Leahy, the Democrat from Vermont, said if Mr Clinton had exerted maximum pressure he might have got her confirmed, 'but this would have sent the wrong signal' about double standards.

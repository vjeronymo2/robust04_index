			<p>BFN     [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas delivered a  speech at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in  Strasbourg today.    In his speech, as expected, the Lithuanian president devoted  a great deal of attention to problems concerning  Lithuanian-Russian relations, Baltic News Service reports. At  the same time, Brazauskas urged the West to give stronger  support to Central and Eastern European states in their  aspirations to become members of the European Union. According  to the president, the maintaining of good relations with the  neighboring countries is a priority task for Lithuania, and so  far there are no serious obstacles for Lithuania to have  relations of good-neighborliness and cooperation with Russia,  Poland, and Belarus.    But the Lithuanian president drew attention to, according to  him, a feature that has emerged lately in Russia's relations  with its neighbors. Further events bear witness to the fact  that it is not easy to change the established stereotypes in  relations with smaller neighbors, stressed Algirdas Brazauskas.  In his opinion, Russia's relations with the neighboring  countries should correspond with universally recognized  principles of international law. Russia's respect for the  sovereignty of the Baltic states, the repudiation of the concept  of Near Abroad, and the implementation of international  agreements will accelerate a positive decision by the Council of  Europe on the membership of that country.    He said that it is especially important to Lithuania whether  the Kaliningrad region, the former military advanced post of the  Soviet Union, is gradually demilitarized and becomes an active  business zone. We feel positive efforts by Moscow and  Kaliningrad in this direction, but sometimes contrary tendencies  can be noticed, too.    Speaking of the expansion of the European Union, Algirdas  Brazauskas noted that the success of the integration by the  Baltic states is very dependent on Latvia's membership in the  Council of Europe. A unique ethnic composition of the  population created during the Soviet occupation has emerged in  Latvia, but problems connected with this should not be cause the  postponement of its full membership.    Brazauskas said that, in his view, Russia was able to  implement democracy and avoid the breakthrough of menacing  military forces. Therefore, the procedure for Russia's  membership started in the Parliamentary Assembly is a political  and moral support for the democratic forces in that country.  The withdrawal of the Russian Army from the territories of  Latvia and Estonia by 31 August will very favorably reflect  Russia's intention to peacefully regulate its relations with its  neighbors.    In his speech, the Lithuanian president assessed as a great  political success the initialled Lithuanian-Polish treaty, which  bears witness to the increasing mutual understanding of both  nations and puts a juridical full stop to the historical  disputes of both countries.    He explained Lithuania's stance on the Jewish genocide  during  the Second World War. I grieve because of the large number of  victims and regret that some Lithuanians took part in the  punitive actions. Therefore, I firmly state that all criminals  whom justice has not reached yet should be exposed and punished.  We are doing this consistently and invite all the interested  organizations and persons to cooperate. Maybe, not everything  has been said about those tragic events, but we are not afraid  to talk about this and with open hearts seek mutual  understanding both with Israel and with Jewish communities in  our and in other states.    Speaking at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of  Europe, Brazauskas said that so far, only the irrevocability of  the process of reforms has been assured in the country. But it  has not yet been achieved that the reforms become a source of  well-being and progress of all the citizens, Baltic News Service  reports.</p>

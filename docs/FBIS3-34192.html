He  returned to Cairo after holding talks with President Demirel and  several other officials on the same day. The press release  issued after his talks said the sides agreed on the need to  improve their mutual cooperation in every field. It said that  the sides agreed to make a joint effort to contribute toward the  establishment of peace in the Middle East and the Balkan region  and help Iraq maintain its territorial integrity.    President Mubarak was visiting Turkey for the third time  since 1985. His recent visit has unveiled the nature of  relations and contacts between Ankara and Cairo. Obviously, the  aim was to improve bilateral political, economic, cultural, and  military relations. The cooperation between Turkey and Egypt is  important because of their situation in the region and relations  with the Zionist regime. President Ezer Weizman visited Turkey  for four days last week. In a statement in Ankara, he said that  cooperation among Israel, Turkey, and Egypt will determine the  future of the Middle East.    Several political experts are convinced that the intensive  diplomatic contacts among the three countries may be a prelude  to the signing of an agreement on developments in the region.  Undoubtedly, the United States will support that agreement,  which will enable the leaders of Egypt, Turkey, and the Zionist  regime to establish a common policy to protect themselves  against threats. Undoubtedly, the main threat against Turkey,  Egypt, and the Zionist regime is the strengthening and spreading  of Islam and Islamic activities.    Another aspect of relations between Turkey and Egypt is  aimed  at creating the conditions required for the normalization of  relations between Israel and the Arab countries and the removal  of the Arab embargo on the Zionist regime. In view of that,  political experts are convinced that promoting and strengthening  relations among Egypt, Turkey, and Israel are aimed at placing  limits on independent policies and slowing down and reducing the  progress of Islamic movements in the region.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Management: Bridging the ethical gap - Values may differ widely from behaviour There is often a wide gap between companies' professed values and their actual behaviour, or at least the public's perception of it. That is the main conclusion to be drawn from two separate, but far from contradictory, surveys of senior business executives published this week. The importance of being ethical* - by Ashridge Management Research Group and the UK consultancy Integrity Works - concentrates largely on the views of non-executive directors of Britain's leading companies. All 119 respondents in the report felt business ethics was a significant issue, even if there was little consensus about what the term meant. But while the majority thought it 'very important' for business to be viewed as ethical, less than half felt this to be the case in practice. More than a quarter thought that the public views business as 'quite unethical'. That said, 54 per cent of respondents consider that company standards are better than they were 10 years ago - 22 per cent said they were worse - and 43 per cent disclosed that their firm operates an ethics code. Thirteen per cent have adopted the practice of 'ethics awareness training', while a further 8 per cent carry out an ethics audit. The findings of the Ashridge research reinforce the view that an organisation's conduct is largely dependent on the stance of its chief executive. Many of the conclusions, moreover, find an echo in the other study - Insights into values in business** carried out by the Helsinki-based consultancy Values into Action and based on responses from 70 senior executives 'in Britain, the Nordic countries, Europe and beyond'. Three in five said they conduct their business activities and practices according to a common code of values. But more than three quarters of these believed there was a gap between ethical values and actual behaviour, and one in five said that business necessity overrides such values. Values into Action adds that a study of more than 400 annual reports highlights the need to clarify use of the word 'value'. It makes the distinction between 'business values', which are situational and relative, and 'ethical values', which are universal and absolute. Corporate value codes - which often look more like corporate goals than value statements - should explain how they relate to each other. Values into Action says managers who want to check their companies' 'ethical health' should ask themselves whether the following are true or false: 1. People in the company conduct their business activities and practices according to the same code of values. 2. Because of the current (economic) situation, there is less time to show employees the consideration they deserve as individuals. 3. Survival depends on getting back to basics, cutting costs and reducing overheads. 4. Faced with a choice, business necessity overrides ethical values. 5. Sometimes there is a gap between ethical values and the way in which the company and/or people in it behave. 6. Management trusts employees and employees trust management. 7. Sometimes there is a discrepancy between what executives preach and what they expect their colleagues and employees to practice. 8. People willingly and genuinely want to put the values of the company into practice. 9. We accept and honour our responsibilities towards other 'stakeholders' (those who are taken into account when business decisions are being made, or who are affected by the outcome of business decisions) as well as customers, shareholders and employees. 10. Frank, fearless and critical dialogue both upwards and downwards in the company is actively encouraged and practised. * Price Pounds 40, available from Terrylynn Knott, Ashridge Management College, Berkhamstead. ** Price Pounds 15.

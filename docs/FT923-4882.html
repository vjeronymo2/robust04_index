			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Kinkel steps up campaign MR Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, yesterday issued a ringing appeal for a 'positive result' from the French referendum on European union, as Bonn stepped up its campaign to save the Maastricht treaty. The future of Europe was at stake, he said. The intervention of both Mr Kinkel and Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the French campaign underlines the growing concern in Bonn at the stumbling ratification process throughout the Community. Mr Kinkel reminded all EC member states of their commitment to press ahead with ratification. In Spain the government presented a draft bill to parliament proposing to speed up ratification. Parliamentary committees will decide next Tuesday whether to adopt the bill, which could rush the treaty through in a month or less. Italian leaders launched a campaign to press parliament into ratifying the treaty before the French referendum. The full Senate could ratify Maastricht four or five days before the referendum.</p>

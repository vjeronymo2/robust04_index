			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / World Trade News: 'No clear winners and losers' - Industry cautiously welcomes OECD shipbuilding deal The world's main shipbuilding countries and shipowners yesterday welcomed the multilateral agreement to scrap subsidies, but differed on who would be the winners and losers. Observers said that while anything that removed a distortion of free trade was a positive step, other factors such as the industry's manufacturing capacity and the state of the shipping market were more important influences on the supply and demand balance that dictated prices. 'We are very pleased. This is a solution that the US has been working to bring about for five years,' said Mr John Stocker, president of the Shipbuilders' Council of America. The agreement (which was negotiated at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) was not perfect, but would reduce government interference in shipbuilding and impose discipline on the industry. Large shipowners, he said, would benefit as marginal owners would not be supported by subsidised prices. On the other hand, overall prices would have to rise, as they would have truly to reflect shipyard costs. Shipowners accepted this was a likely consequence, but remained unflustered. The UK's Chamber of Shipping, which represents shipowners, said excessive subsidies caused too much ship-buying, which lead to 'over-tonnaging' - too many ships chasing too little freight business. Mr Nick Granger, director of the UK's Shipbuilders and Shiprepairers Association, said the effect on the UK shipbuilding industry would be broadly neutral, so long as the agreement worked as it should do. It would not have been in anyone's interests to allow a spiral of state aid to the industry, he said. 'But unless there is more or less a balance between supply and demand, you will not have conditions where zero subsidies can stick.' UK shipbuilders, therefore, were worried by the 'massive amount' of shipbuilding capacity increases being planned by South Korea. Mr Granger also warned that, unless countries were in the OECD, their ships would not be covered by the agreement's mechanism to prevent injurious pricing. 'The Chinese, Malaysians and others are all putting ships on to the market at cut-throat prices, which I don't think have much to do with reality.' According to Mr Simon Quarrell, a consultant at KPMG Peat Marwick and author of a 1992 report on the competitiveness of European Union shipyards, the winners in the European shipbuilding industry would be the low-cost, high-efficiency yards which could compete on a fair and equal basis with other yards, if that was allowed. 'These would be some yards in Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, and individual yards across Europe, including Italy and France, where some yards are world-class in certain market sectors. 'But there are other yards which are effectively being buoyed up by subsidies that should be given the chance to go bankrupt.' Kvaerner, Europe's biggest shipbuilder, saw itself as a winner from the deal. 'If this agreement is fully implemented, it will boost our shipbuilding potential significantly,' said Mr Diderik Schnitler, head of shipbuilding at the Norwegian company. Kvaerner claimed its competitive position would be enhanced because the average subsidy for its yards - six in Norway, two in Finland, Govan in Scotland and Warnow Werft at Rostock in Germany - was already considerably lower than many competitors. The Finnish yards, for example, in effect get no subsidies. However, the new regime could make the going tougher for Kvaerner's Govan yard, which has traditionally benefited from high subsidies. The group also said it believed the OECD accord would enhance prospects for stability in the notoriously volatile shipping markets, because generous subsidy levels would no longer entice shipowners to order new vessels in the face of adverse markets. There were contrasting views on what the agreement would mean for the US shipbuilding industry, which has been trying to reduce its dependence on defence work but has found it difficult to match subsidised prices offered by rival commercial yards. Mr Quarrell said the US shipbuilders had over-estimated the effect of subsidies on the market, but under-estimated the productivity gap between themselves and the world market level. So the removal of subsidies would not provide the US with a cure-all. But Mr Stocker believed the deal at last gave US shipbuilders - which had not received subsidies for the past 10 years - the opportunity to enter a market which is forecast to improve 'fairly dramatically' over the next five years. He contended that the agreement would radically shift the industry away from the Japanese shipbuilders which, with the added problem of a strong yen, would find it hard to keep making ships. But the view from Tokyo is different. The deal was expected to work in Japan's favour, as direct subsidies to the Japanese shipbuilding industry were virtually non-existent, a transport ministry official noted. At the same time, the anti-dumping code - together with specification of what constitutes dumping - is looked upon favourably in Japan as a measure that will help to prevent severe pressure on Japanese shipbuilders to reduce prices during recessions. However, the view is that the agreement would not necessarily act to the disadvantage of Japanese industry alone, since other countries also provide huge indirect subsidies, but would help to make the market fairer. The relaxed reception of the OECD agreement reflects the confidence felt in the competitiveness of Japan's shipbuilding industry. In the first six months of this year, the industry managed to increase orders by more than two-fold to 130 vessels. Additional reporting by Christopher Brown-Humes and Michiyo Nakamoto</p>

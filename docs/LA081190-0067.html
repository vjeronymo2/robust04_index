			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER KILLED; BOY, 2, LEFT IN CAR WITH CASH  </P> <P> At first they seemed separate incidents, half a day and more than 60 miles  apart.  </P> <P> On Thursday, residents of a Downey neighborhood alerted police that a little  boy had been found abandoned inside a blue Toyota Cressida parked on their  street. When Downey police took the 2-year-old into protective custody, they  quickly realized this was not a typical child-abandonment case. Concealed  inside the car's trunk was $149,780 in cash.  </P> <P> Shortly before midnight the previous evening, Riverside County sheriff's  deputies in Hemet had been called to a deserted area near Gilman Hot Springs.  There they found a 47-year-old Latina, severely beaten. She had crawled to a  roadway seeking help. Not far away, another Latina, 24, lay dead of a gunshot  wound.  </P> <P> It took several hours before officials realized the tragic connection between  the abandoned 2-year-old and the slaying scene. The toddler, identified as Jose  David, was the son of the dead woman, Claudia Ochoa of Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> "The boy's mother and a family friend were kidnaped Wednesday night," Downey  Police Chief D. Clayton Mayes said Friday. He said Ochoa's 1984 Toyota was left  behind in Downey with the child inside when two abductors, identified as Latino  men, took the women away in a dirty light blue van with no windows.  </P> <P> According to the Riverside Sheriff's office, the women were taken to a location  near Hemet, where Ochoa was killed. The 47-year-old survivor of the incident,  whose name has not been made public, was "beaten in the head with a blunt  instrument," according to police. She underwent surgery at an unidentified  hospital, and her condition was not disclosed.  </P> <P> "The investigation is continuing as to the identity of the suspects, the motive  for the apparent execution-style murder, and the reason the vehicle and toddler  were abandoned in Downey," Mayes said.  </P> <P> However, because of the amount of cash discovered in the Toyota's trunk, Mayes  said detectives believe the incident was drug-related.  </P></p>

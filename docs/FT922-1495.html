			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Statistical agency to give more details on retail sales THE Central Statistical Office is to bow to pressure from retailers and add new data to its monthly survey of the sector, which accounts for about one quarter of the economy. The monthly report by the government's statistical agency will in future provide a fuller breakdown of shifts in sales of specific items such as food and clothing. It may also give better warning of changes in consumer demand which have a bearing on broad economic fluctuations. The change follows pressure from some large retailers, who complained that the CSO had been slow in adding extra information to its survey. It also reflects the drive by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr Bill McLennan, the recently appointed head of the CSO, to improve Britain's economic statistics. The new figures will emerge from detailed questions to be sent by the CSO every month to about 50 large companies in 'mixed retailing' - including sales of food and non-edible items. Such stores, including Marks and Spencer, will be asked to break down total sales according to four categories: food, clothing and footwear, household goods and miscellaneous items. The extra data will be added to figures of sales in these four areas provided by other specialised businesses active in a single category of retailing. The new information should help the CSO to make its monthly survey more comprehensive. The agency expects the new data to become available around the end of the year. The plan still awaits final agreement from the stores on how the detailed information will be supplied to the CSO. However, the CSO is confident the retailers will support the project because of their past comments about the need to collect this kind of information. Separately, the CSO is reviewing its publication of cyclical economic indicators which are intended to give early warning of changes in demand. The indicators - based on individual sets of data such as housing starts and share prices - are published every month but have failed to capture the imagination of economists. Thus they are rarely used in efforts to plot ups and downs in activity. The work is part of the effort by the CSO to look at new ways of working out the path of the economy by studying short-term changes in specific indicators. Letters, Page 15</p>

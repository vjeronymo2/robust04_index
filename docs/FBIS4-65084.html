			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz by </F> Gudrun Harrer in Vienna; date not given: "Iraq Has Fulfilled  the UN Resolutions"]    [Text] [Harrer] You have come to Vienna to hold talks with  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), one of the bodies  that decides whether or not Iraq has complied with UN  Resolutions 687 and 715, on which the lifting of the sanctions  depends. The UN Security Council is meeting again in the middle  of May to discuss Iraq. What is the IAEA position toward Iraq?    ['Aziz] We have satisfactory, normal relations with the  IAEA.  The IAEA has noted the major progress we have achieved in  fulfilling the conditions, and we want this information to be  conveyed to New York.    [Harrer] The last time the Council met, in the middle of  March, it voted against the lifting of the sanctions vis-a-vis  Iraq.    ['Aziz] If a free, secret vote were to be held, the majority  of the Council would vote for the lifting, or at least a  relaxation, of the sanctions. Even in March, some Council  members were in favor of issuing a public statement recognizing  Iraq's progress. The U.S. side opposed the idea. But, for the  first time, the Council failed to adopt a statement against the  lifting of the sanctions because a consensus was not reached on  this matter. That says a lot.    [Harrer] Are you optimistic this time?    ['Aziz] It is the Council's credibility that is at stake.  The Council adopted resolutions that were formulated in clear  language. Iraq has fulfilled these resolutions. If certain  Council members choose to ignore this fact -- and this has been  documented not by Iraq, but by UN bodies -- they are undermining  the credibility of the Council itself and its resolutions.    Most countries, including Austria, merely want Iraq to  fulfill the resolutions that were adopted in connection with  Kuwait -- nothing more and nothing less. However, when other  things are suddenly brought into play, such as a unilateral U.S.  policy vis-a-vis Iraq, and the United States attempts to impose  its unilateral wishes on the Council, the Council's image is  bound to suffer.    [Harrer] How much progress has been achieved in installing  control systems inside Iraqi armaments plants?    ['Aziz] Things are moving quickly, and we are doing what is  necessary in this connection. UN special envoy Rolf Ekeus  confirmed this in his report at the end of April.    [Harrer] Apart from France and China, Russia also spoke out  in favor of Iraq at the March Security Council meeting. What  are your relations with Russia like, and is there any truth to  the rumors that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy supports the Iraqi Ba'ath  Party?    ['Aziz] Our relations are good. Russia has great economic  interests in Iraq. Zhirinovskiy visited Iraq in 1992 and  expressed support for our standpoint. But we do not imagine we  can influence Russian domestic policy, and we certainly have no  money to support other parties. Zhirinovskiy invited a Ba'ath  delegation to his party's latest congress, but the Iraqis also  used this opportunity to talk to all other parties with the  exception of Russia's Choice, as well as holding talks at the  Russian Foreign Ministry.    [Harrer] What are moods like in Iraq after four years of  sanctions? Is a radicalization of the population to be feared?  What about the opinions that Iraq's claim to Kuwait is by no  means a closed chapter?    ['Aziz] The Iraqi population is suffering much hardship  because of the sanctions, but we are an ancient civilization,  and we will survive. You will hardly find anyone who says he  hates the American people.    For the government, the Kuwait issue is finished, but one  cannot stop people from thinking whatever they want to think.  One cannot erase historical facts either. But the Iraqis  support the government and know that what the government is  doing -- for example, implementing the resolutions in order to  permit the lifting of the sanctions, is good for the country.    I think frustration is the cause of such opinions concerning  the Kuwait issue. People see Iraq doing everything the United  Nations wants, but this does nothing to help them, and their  situation gets even worse. But this has nothing do with the  government's stance.    [Harrer] What is Baghdad's relationship with the Kurdish  leaders Talabani and Barzani?    ['Aziz] In 1991, they spent several months in Baghdad, and  one reached a consensus with them concerning the extent and form  of autonomy, Kurdish involvement in the central government,  elections, and so on. Barzani told us later that no sooner had  he and Talabani returned to northern Iraq when they were  summoned to Washington. Talabani went, but Barzani did not. In  Washington, Talabani was told: "Are you crazy supporting Saddam  Husayn's government when we want to topple it?" That was the  end for the time being. The Kurds are not free to decide.</p>

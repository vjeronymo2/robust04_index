			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: UK accounting Today's new standard on acquisition accounting will do away with one of the most egregious abuses in UK financial reporting, namely the freedom which acquisitive companies have had to offset many of the costs associated with takeovers against reserves. This practice distorted profit and loss accounts, giving managements the scope to present financial performance after a takeover in an unrealistically rosy light. An extreme case such as Coloroll, the home furnishings group which collapsed in 1990 after years of apparently profitable expansion, demonstrated the extent to which reported earnings could become divorced from true economic performance. If the worst abuses belong to another era, the continuing scope to flatter post-acquisition profits by writing down stocks, or setting up provisions against future losses or reorganisation costs, has cast doubt about the quality of profits generated by companies making takeovers. The latest measure will benefit users of accounts by forcing companies to present a clearer picture of the economics of acquisitions. Reported earnings will drop as a result of the new standard's requirement that provisions be taken against profits, not reserves. But the underlying cash flow will not change, however a transaction is accounted for, and companies should not be deterred from doing deals that make strategic sense. It will be no bad thing if, by contrast, the new rules deter companies from making acquisitions which do not make strategic sense.</p>

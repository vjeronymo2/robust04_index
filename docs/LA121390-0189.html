			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEY'LL BE HOMELESS FOR CHRISTMAS;  </P> <P> AN IRVINE EXHIBIT EMBRACES ITS SUBJECTS AND CHALLENGES VIEWERS' BIASES  </P> <P> Faced with the task of organizing an exhibit about homeless people, Dorrit Kirk  Fitzgerald decided the idea of an arm's length examination was out of the  question.  </P> <P> "Instead of doing an art for art's sake show where artists who are not homeless  would interpret the homeless, I wanted to address the homeless community itself  and let them show me the direction I needed to go," Fitzgerald said recently.  </P> <P> The result is "Who I Am Not," at the Irvine Fine Arts Center through Feb. 3,  which features 28 autobiographical photographs by 13 homeless people as well as  works on the subject by others who are not homeless.  </P> <P> The images by the homeless, people living at the Santa Ana Civic Center, form a  straightforward, unsentimental statement about daily life: A child stands alone  in the sunshine, a row of shopping carts is laden with belongings, friends chat  and eat together, others clown in the street, a man wrapped in a blanket sleeps  beneath a tree.  </P> <P> Fitzgerald, the fine arts center's curator, arrived at an underpinning theme  for the exhibit through hands-on research that proved revelatory.  </P> <P> Last October, she began to distribute food and hygiene kits at the Santa Ana  Civic Center with help from SPIN (Street People In Need), a nonprofit  organization providing services to Orange County homeless who officials  estimate number about 8,000. The experience, which led to friendships with  homeless people she met, made her profoundly aware of her own deeply ingrained  beliefs, she said.  </P> <P> "I came to understand that I represented the typical person in the community  that doesn't know and probably doesn't want to know about the homeless and I  had to deal with my own bias and prejudice," she said.  </P> <P> "I went through such a transformation myself along the way that I felt the most  beneficial thing would be to do an exhibit about perception -- about how we see  others, not just the homeless, but anyone we might see as 'other.' "  </P> <P> Fitzgerald attempted to convey her theme by juxtaposing photographs by  non-homeless artists and other depictions of the homeless, such as newspaper  cartoons with homeless people's photographs. These pictures were taken with  cameras donated for the project by Fuji Photo Film USA Inc.  </P> <P> "It's evident that only the homeless can portray themselves as directly and  humanistically as possible," Fitzgerald said.  </P> <P> Clyde Weinman, one of several officials Fitzgerald worked with to better  understand the local homeless community, said he helped her to see a larger  reality of the situation. Executive director of Irvine Temporary Housing, which  provides homeless families with temporary housing and other services, Weinman  introduced her to several homeless families in Featherly Regional Park in Yorba  Linda.  </P> <P> "Most feel the homeless are degenerate people that society has cast aside; just  an enlarged picture of the old hobo, people who are lazy and don't want to  work," Weinman said. "But homeless people are people with open minds and open  hearts that just had a bad turn. They could be you or I or anyone else."  </P> <P> Fitzgerald said she hopes to change viewers' consciousness. "If I could just  change a person's thinking for a second so they aren't making a judgment  filtered through bias . . . I don't look at anyone the same any more. My life  has completely changed as a result of this show."  </P></p>

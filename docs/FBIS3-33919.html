His Excellency added that  the voluntary return will be implemented in coordination and  cooperation with the UN High Commission for Refugees within the  framework of the basic agreement signed between Sudan, Ethiopia  and the UN High Commission for Refugees.    In addition, retired Brig. Sirr al-Khatim said that he  discussed with the Eritrean commissioner of refugees, during his  visit to khartoum recently, the question of a voluntary return  of Eritrean refugees.

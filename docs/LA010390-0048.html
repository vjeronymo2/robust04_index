			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DON'T IGNORE SINUSITIS  </P> <P> Question: I went to my doctor because I wasn't feeling well, and he told me  that I had a case of sinusitis.  </P> <P> He also seemed concerned that I had waited as long as I had before making an  appointment to speak with him. I'm not a hero, and if I had a pain in my chest  or anything like that I'd get myself to an emergency room as soon as possible.  But I don't think that a case of sinusitis is in the same ballpark. Why is it  such a big deal?  </P> <P> Answer: Sinusitis can be a serious infection. Under some circumstances, for  example, it can lead to brain abscesses.  </P></p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Publishing to a prescription - A new chapter in brand loyalty Early next year, Boots The Chemist will become Boots the publisher when the Nottingham-based cold-cream to corn plaster giant dips into the glamorous world of women's magazine publishing. The Boots Magazine, which begins life as a quarterly, will 'aim to apply Boots brand values to a publication, rather than to a product,' says Michael Potter, managing director of Redwood Publishing, drafted in by Boots to handle the new venture. While Boots has no direct publishing experience, it already has a potential readership in the 27m customers who use the store each month - the core of them women aged between 25 and 40. According to the company's own research, a large proportion are looking for advice and information on anything from glossier hair to staving off heart disease. While the new title will inevitably contain information on and advertising for Boots products, it is not intended simply to be a marketing platform for the company, but a readable glossy magazine - 'a genuine health and beauty title', says the company. The magazine will not only carry advertising for rivals, among them cosmetics and pharmaceuticals companies, but it will also have a cover price of 95p. Although distribution of the 250,000 print run will initially be restricted to 500 of the chain's bigger branches, the intention is that it could one day earn a place on newsstands. A decade ago, so-called customer magazines were thinly disguised company puffsheets, about as welcome to credit card or bank customers as the bills they invariably accompanied. But today, as everyone from supermarkets to car makers seek to build customer loyalty by adding publishing to their portfolios, the quality of the magazines continues to improve. Last month, J. Sainsbury's monthly title, The Magazine, with a cover price of 95p for more than 200 pages of good eating and aspirational lifestyles, earned the Magazine of the Year award from Media Week magazine, against stiff competition from more traditional publishers. This glossy title, whose previous contributors have included Michael Palin and Beryl Bainbridge, has in 18 months achieved a 325,000 circulation, making it the UK's seventh-biggest selling consumer magazine. While distribution thus far remains limited to Sainsbury's own retail outlets, few industry observers would dismiss it as just another company magazine. 'One of our aims in launching our magazine 18 months ago was to enhance the company's image with its customers, and this has certainly been achieved,' says the company. According to the Association of Publishing Agencies, which represents contract publishers such as Redwood (which has contracts with the AA, Marks &amp; Spencer and American Express), there are now at least 110 customer magazines in Britain, ranging from airlines and department stores to computer firms and building societies. They are primarily communications vehicles. Barclaycard, for instance, will launch its first customer magazine at the end of January. The title, yet to be named, will be sent free to all card customers, making it one of Britain's largest customer magazines with a circulation of 3m. The magazine will inevitably be an advertising platform for the card giant, as well as for third-party advertisers keen to establish a presence with Barclaycard's affluent audience. The real value of such a customer magazine, says Neil O'Brien, whose company, The Publishing Team, also produces Open Door (the Alliance and Leicester magazine), is as a loyalty builder. 'The magazine won't make a fat profit for Barclaycard, and all the costs will come out of the marketing budget,' he says. 'But if it generates loyalty to Barclaycard, and acts as a genuine communications forum between the company and its customers, then it will be a wise investment.'</p>

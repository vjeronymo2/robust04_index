			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: McCaw Cellular has loss in first quarter McCAW CELLULAR Communications, the leading company in the fast-growing US cellular telephone market, yesterday reported a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 169.1m but said it was producing continued growth in revenue, cash flow and numbers of subscribers. The company has assumed large debts to fund its rapid expansion and its bottom line results are expected to remain in the red for a considerable time to come. The first quarter's loss, which translated into a per share figure of 97 cents, compared with net income of Dollars 851.9m, or Dollars 4.93 a share, in the first quarter of last year. However, that profit was due to its Dollars 1.2bn sale of southeastern US markets to rival Contel. McCaw said comparisons between the two periods were also affected by the increased interest expense incurred in last year's takeover of 52 per cent of Lin Broadcasting, another large cellular company, and the acquisition of Metromedia's interest in the New York cellular licence. Lin's results have been consolidated since March 5 last year. McCaw said its first quarter revenues rose 56 per cent to Dollars 293.4m, while cash flow increased from Dollars 36.2m to Dollars 89.5m, and the number of McCaw/Lin cellular subscribers rose 47 per cent to 1.26m. Income from operations was Dollars 800,000 against a loss of Dollars 16.5m.</p>

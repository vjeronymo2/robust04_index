			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> AFRICA;  </P> <P> BAN ON IVORY TRADE GETS FINAL APPROVAL  </P> <P> The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, meeting in  Lausanne, Switzerland, approved a formal ban on trading in ivory. The action  followed a resolution to the same effect the day before. Several southern  African nations that contend they protect their elephants and need ivory  revenue hinted that they may bypass the ban. There are about 600,000 elephants  left in Africa, only about half the total of 10 years ago.  </P></p>

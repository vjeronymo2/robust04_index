			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (3): How to reduce the risks - Why Buy New? / Used cars may be worth buying, but you need to protect yourself EVEN BEFORE the door of your new car has shut for the first time and you drive away from the showroom, its value has almost certainly dropped by Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 3,000. That happens as soon as the first name is written on the registration document. The value of an average new car plummets by about 30 per cent in the first year, so many buyers prefer to let somebody else take that financial blow. Of course, the vast majority of cars continue to depreciate throughout their useful lives but the pace of decline slows markedly after the first two or three years. Those who regularly buy 'nearly new' cars usually do so to trade up to something bigger or more luxurious than the new vehicle they could afford. And a modern used car with 10,000 to 15,000 miles on the clock still has a long life ahead of it. 'Cars today do last well and tolerate high mileages - 60,000 and 100,000 miles are not the frightening milestones they used to be,' says Mr Steve Cropley, editor of Car Choice magazine. Neither is rusty bodywork the problem it once was. 'Rust warranties are mainly horse manure but manufacturers are doing a great deal - particularly using galvanised steel - to make sure cars are much better in this respect,' he says. Many cars have transferable warranties - some Japanese makes are offering warranties for three years or 60,000 miles and Mitsubishi is offering one for three years with unlimited mileage. There are 'extended' warranties offered at a price on new cars, such as Ford's Extracover, and it is possible for a used car buyer to purchase a warranty for up to seven years or 70,000 miles (but don't expect too much from that one). Some warranties are better than others. If a dealer offers one which does not cover electronics and other expensive items, you could probably do better buying a warranty direct from an insurance company. However, there are always some risks associated with buying used cars. For example: does the person selling the car really own it? Establishing this fact is incredibly difficult. 'Astonishingly, there is no totally reliable way of proving who owns a car. You can't rely on the registration documents, they show only the 'registered keeper' who may not be the owner. It may, for example, be a leased company car,' says Mr Simon Hinde, senior editor of Which? the Consumers' Association's magazine. He points out that, if you buy a car that turns out to be stolen, in nearly every case you have no right to keep it. That is also the case if the seller has leased or hired the car. However, if you buy from someone who has an unpaid loan or a hire purchase arrangement outstanding for it, you do become the owner. He or she has to continue paying off the loan. The Consumers' Association, with the Office of Fair Trading and various motoring organisations, is trying to persuade the government that the name of the person or organisation who legally owns a car should be on the registration document along with its full ownership history and the mileage each time it changed hands. While waiting for this legislation, buyers would do well to check with HP (Hire Purchase) Information which has data on millions of cars provided by insurance companies and finance houses throughout the country. The HPI register can be checked via Citizens Advice Bureaux or, if you are in the north-east of England, you can ring HPI's hot line on 0722 422422. For Pounds 15 it will check a car out for you. This hot line scheme may be extended to other parts of the UK if the test in the north-east works well. Unfortunately, the HPI register is not infallible. For example, privately leased cars - which pose a big threat to innocent buyers - are unlikely to be listed. Another way a buyer can protect him or herself, Mr Cropley suggests, is to ask for the invoice that the seller received in buying the car. (In this connection, it is also a good idea to keep safely the paperwork you obtain, if you decide to buy.) Other documents might help, such as MOT test certificates, for example, and servicing documents. In any case, a would-be buyer should ask for documents giving the full service history of any used car. This helps to combat another big risk used car buying involves: 'clocking', or turning the car's odometer back. Trading standard officers estimate that one in five used cars has been clocked. A used car's price falls steadily as the mileage rises and it is estimated that UK buyers pay about Pounds 200m a year more than they should because of clocking. Villains in the used car business are also getting better at repairing cars written off by insurance companies. They can weld the bodies from two or even three damaged cars together so expertly that only a very experienced engineer is likely to detect the deception. If you find out after you have acquired a car that it is a previous 'write-off', the law insists you inform any future buyer of this fact and you will be lucky to get half the price of an equivalent, unrepaired vehicle. The best protection against this fraud is to ask for an inspection of the car by an engineer from the AA or RAC. Many people believe this to be a necessity when buying a high-priced used car. The AA charges between Pounds 90 and Pounds 226 for each inspection and a written report, depending on the size and complexity of the car; there is a special telephone number on which inspections can be booked: 0345 500 610. The RAC charges between Pounds 75 and Pounds 190 an inspection, plus a Pounds 14 surcharge if the inspection takes place within the M25 London ring road. The RAC has a Freephone number to book inspections: 0800 333 660 in office hours. Both motoring organisations say it might take two or three days before an inspection can be made but they try hard to cut the time for people who are in a hurry - perhaps because another potential buyer is lurking ready to pounce. While it remains important to follow the 'buyer beware' rules when buying a used car from a private individual, such private sales are covered by the Sale of Goods Act. This says the car must correspond with any description applied to it, so it is a good idea to keep any advertisements about it and take someone along with you as a witness to what is said during discussions with the seller. Of course, the safest way to buy a used car is from a reputable dealer. Despite the Arthur Daley image, most dealers in the UK are honest, so ask around and you will quickly establish which are those in your area with decent reputations. It would also be useful to arm yourself with information about prices. There are several publications available which give guides to used car values. The Consumers' Association also offers a 'Buying a Used Car Action Pack,' available for Pounds 4.45 by mail order from PO Box 44, Hertford X, SG14 1SH or by calling in at the Which? bookshop at 361 Euston Road in London. Some final words of advice from the experts. Mr Cropley suggests you should 'avoid orphans' by which he means cars with unusual specifications (such as three-door Sierras). This not only can cause difficulties if you want to resell later, but also might give problems when spares are needed. 'Buy popular specifications in popular colours,' he says. Mr Hinde says: 'If you have any doubts (about a used car), question the seller directly. If you are on your own, try to get answers in writing. Make sure the condition of the car is consistent with the mileage shown. But don't be put off by a few minor defects - it may pay to be suspicious of an outwardly-perfect used car.'</p>

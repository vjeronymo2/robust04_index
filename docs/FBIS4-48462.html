			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>   [Excerpt] Nairobi, 20 May (AFP) -- Fighting kept up through  the night into early Friday [20 May] in the Rwandan capital  Kigali, much of it around the airport where the United Nations  has stopped flying in any planes, a UN spokesman said. The  sporadic artillery and mortar exchanges between government  troops and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) were less  intense than on Thursday, which saw the heaviest fighting in  Kigali in 10 days, said Abdul Kabia, spokesman for the UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR).    Shells fell throughout the night near Amahoro stadium, where  several thousand people fleeing the country's ethnic bloodbath  have sought refuge, though there were no reported injuries,  Kabia said, contacted by telephone. At least 30 patients,  wounded survivors of Rwanda's killing fields, died in their beds  when shells slammed into the crowded Kigali general hospital  Thursday during violent fighting in several city districts. The  UN headquarters was also hit though no one was hurt.    The United Nations has been trying to broker a ceasefire  between majority Hutu government forces and the Tutsi  minority-dominated rebel Front before the planned arrival of the  new UN troops. UN spokesmen have said they were hoping for a  response Friday from the government to UN proposals to establish  a neutral zone at the airport, to allow flights to land without  hindrance.    Despite the battles, the United Nations went ahead with  plans  to send in thousands of UN peacekeeping reinforcements.    According to Kabia, Ghana confirmed that it would send some  500 men to boost its battalion of 800 troops already stationed  in Kigali. Negotiations with other countries to bring in  equipment needed by the UN peacekeepers are "well advanced," he  added without giving details.    UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali also plans to send  special envoy Iqbal Riza from the UN peacekeeping operations  department to Kigali to meet with the belligerents to discuss  terms of the "new UNAMIR mandate" and try to get their  "cooperation," Kabia said without specifying any date.

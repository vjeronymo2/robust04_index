			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / Saudis confirm dissident arrests Saudi Arabia announced last night that the authorities were holding 110 people in connection with 'attempts to sow dissension and cause chaos', Reuter reports from Dubai. An interior ministry statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency was the kingdom's first confirmation that opponents of the government had been arrested. A London-based opposition group alleged a week ago that more than 1,000 followers of a Moslem sheikh had been rounded up after demonstrations against his arrest. 'The total of those detained is 110 people. The release of some will be considered once investigations now under way with them are complete,' the statement said. 'The cases of those who played a leading role will be considered after the completion of investigations into plans to cause chaos,' the statement added.</p>

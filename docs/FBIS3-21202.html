			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Takashi Murakami, Taketo Takahashi, and Yoji </F> Kawasaki, Second LSI Process Development Dept., Mitsubishi  Electric Corp.]    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Ion implantation equipment has advanced following the  increased density of DRAMs, which are the leading devices  fabricated using ultra-large-scale integration. Figure 1 shows  the changes in the design rule, wafer size, and ion implantation  technology used with each generation of DRAMs. In recent years,  oblique rotation implantation equipment has been put to  practical use with medium-current machines, and parallel-beam  equipment has also been developed. With large-current machines,  the electron shower has been improved to reduce charge-up and a  high-performance plasma flood gun has been developed.  High-energy (up to MeV) ion implanters have passed the R&amp;D  stage  and are now starting to be used in mass production. In addition  to the above, 256M DRAMs with more advanced microminiaturization  require the improvement of low-energy implantation performance  for the fabrication of shallow junctions. Previous technological  trends -- that is the requirements to reduce the particles,  contamination and charge-up, and improve implantation accuracy  -- will become more severe following the microminiaturization of  devices and the increase in wafer size. On the other hand, in  actual equipment operation, improvements in the basic  performance of production facilities such as automation, higher  operating ratios, and easy maintenance will also be important.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-09A>           Figure 1. Different DRAM Generations and Changes in Ion </FIG>       This report describes the requirements of these items from  the user perspective for the ion implantation equipment to be  used with 256M DRAMs.  <H5>  Low-Energy Implantation </H5>   Technology for the fabrication of shallow junctions is  important for 256M DRAMs with a junction depth of about 0.1  m. Formation of junctions in the particularly shallow  p[.sup]+[/] layer is difficult and has been dealt with by  BF[.sup]2[/] implantation[.sup]1[/] or pre-amorphizing  implantation.[.sup]2,3[/] The BF[.sup]2[/] implantation is  advantageous with its possibilities of lowering the virtual  acceleration energy and increasing the beam current. However,  its use in processes is restricted due to such problems as the  roughness of high-melting-point metal surfaces due to  fluorine[.sup]4[/] or the segregation of fluorine, which was  redistributed during annealing, in residual defects near the  interface between the amorphous layer and single  crystals.[.sup]5[/] Pre-amorphizing can be achieved by a  method using Si or Ge[.sup]2[/] or a method using  N[.sup]3[/] but in any case B[.sup]3[/] should be  implanted at no more than 10 keV to obtain shallow junctions.  However, if implantation energy is decreased using a  conventional, electrostatic-scanning-type medium-current  machine, the in-plane uniformity deteriorates as shown in Figure  2(a). This is thought to be because the in-beam charge density  becomes non-uniform as the beam expands during beam travel. In  addition, medium-current machines with parallel-beam  implantation are also required to maintain beam parallelism at  low energy. On the other hand, large-current machines also have  problems in the decrease of beam current and drop of throughput  when the implantation energy is decreased as shown in Figure  2(b). With large-current machines, it is desirable to develop  equipment which allows uniform implantation and high throughput  even at low energy.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-10A>           Figure 2. Implantation Energy Dependence of Ion </FIG>     <H5>  Charge-Up </H5>   Electrostatic breakdown due to charge-up is dependent on the  device structure, manufacturing flow, and ion-implantation  conditions. Increase in integration scale makes the gate-oxide  film thinner and gate area smaller, and the increase in wafer  size requires implantation with a larger beam current to assure  the required throughput. These factors are intensifying the  problem of electrostatic breakdown.    To reduce electrostatic breakdown, attempts have been made  to  reduce the charge density of the ion beam in ion implantation  equipment by neutralizing charges with an electron shower and  enlarging the ion beam diameter. The first electron showers  developed irradiated the target with primary electrons and  supplied the generated secondary electrons to the wafer.  However, problems have been found with the re-entry of primary  electrons with high energy, and in the response of the feedback  control of the amount of irradiation. To deal with these  problems, methods are being studied for preventing the arrival  of high-energy electrons at the wafer by applying a magnetic or  electric field[.sup]6,7[/] and a plasma-flood method which  produces plasma near the wafer to prevent its charge-up with  electrons. The plasma-flood method is attractive in principle  because it allows neutralization using low-energy electrons  alone, and can assure a wide process margin without complicated  condition setting. Conversely, additional study is required on  the influence of generating a plasma near the wafer. Figure 3  shows an example of reduction of electrostatic breakdown using a  plasma flood gun,[.sup]8[/] which has provided favorable  results.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-10B>           Figure 3. Reduction of Electrostatic Breakdown Using </FIG>       Enlarging the beam diameter is also effective for reducing  electrostatic breakdown, and equipment should be designed  considering contamination due to sputtering in the beam line.  <H5>  Particles and Contamination </H5>   About 80 to 90 percent of defects in DRAMs from 64M to 256M  are due to particles on the wafer or its contamination by  metals. It is also said that 95 percent of all particles at the  256M DRAM level may be derived from the manufacturing equipment.  Every equipment manufacturer has expended special efforts to  ensure clean manufacturing, but as microminiaturization  advances, particle control should involve smaller particle sizes  and the equipment to meet this requirement. Figure 4 illustrates  changes over time of the particles of specific implantation  equipment. Particle control, considering particle diameters of  0.3 m or more, may not identify any abnormality because it  does not find a variation in the number of particles, but an  increase in the number of particles due to an abnormality in a  certain period can be identified by monitoring particles with  diameters of 0.17 m or more. As seen here, without due  control and reduction by monitoring even very fine particles,  the yield could drop while the cause would not be identified.  The measurement of the number of particles gets difficult as the  particle size decreases but, as it has been reported based on  experience, even particles of around one-tenth the minimum size  of the device can cause an adverse effect.[.sup]9[/]   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-10C>           Figure 4. Changes in Number of Particles of Ion </FIG>       It is well known that contamination by metals such as Fe,  Cr,  Ni, and Al in general increases the junction leakage current.  The advancement of microminiaturization toward the 256M DRAM  will increase the sensitivity to contamination due to shallower  junctions and a smaller peripheral length reduction  ratio.[.sup]10[/] This problem will increase if  low-temperature annealing, which can reduce impurity diffusion,  is used to form shallow junctions. Figure 5 shows an example in  which metal contamination is reduced by covering with Si the  part that would be sputtered by the ion beam. It achieved a low  leakage current of 10[.sup]-7[/] A/cm[.sup]2[/] even with  low-temperature annealing at 500C.[.sup]11[/]   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-11A>           Figure 5. Reverse Current Density at n[.sup]+[/]p </FIG>       Device microminiaturization will continue to drive the  battle  against particle and metal contamination.  <H5>  Wafer Size Increase </H5>   Wafers with 8-inch or larger diameters will be used in the  age of 256M DRAMs and it is highly probable that 12-inch wafers  will be used in mass production.[.sup]12[/] To maintain the  in-plane uniformities of the implantation quantity and depth  even with large-size wafers, technology for aligning the ion  beam incident angle in the wafer plane is essential for  medium-current machines using ion-beam scanning. Reducing the  in-plane variations in incident angle by using a longer beam  line is advantageous in terms of its lower price but, when  equipment size and performance are taken into consideration, the  predominant equipment used in the future will be parallel-beam  equipment.  <H5>  Basic Performance of Production Facilities </H5>   Apart from the requirements for 256M DRAM-compatible ion  implantation equipment from the viewpoint of process technology  as described above, it is also important to improve the basic  performance of ion implantation equipment by recognizing that it  is a production facility.    To improve the operating ratio, what is required is to  reduce  the failure frequency and to extend the service life of the ion  source. Reduction of the failure frequency may not need any  explanation. Extension of the service life of the ion source has  been attempted by extending filament life, but the implantation  capability of recent equipment is often affected by discharges  due to contamination inside the ion source as well as the  filament life. Future improvements should take this into  consideration.    While equipment automation has progressed, the error rate in  the auto mode is so high that the reliability is not sufficient  for use in automated fabrication in the age of the 256M DRAMs.  This is not only due to software; errors also occur due to  matching errors between software and hardware resulting from  deviations in hardware adjustment. A reliable automated  hardware/software system is necessary if the industry is to move  forward.    As for the processing capacity, while the equipment is  operating the processing capacity is determined by such factors  as wafer transportation, beam set-up, implantation operation and  beam shut-down. Of these, the operation which presently takes  the most time is automatic beam set-up. This is especially true  in the R&amp;D line where continuous processing of several lots  using the same implantation condition is rather rare, and much  time is required for auto set-up every time the implantation  condition is to be changed. Also, as the source condition varies  gradually during use, there are cases in which the beam will not  start smoothly with the initially set parameters. To allow quick  auto-beam start-up regardless of source condition changes in  time, a measure such as the provision of learning functions may  be necessary. Obviously, there is much room for automation  improvement.    It is almost needless to mention that for size reduction,  operability and equipment safety are important. Recent equipment  features better operability in the stationary state thanks to  touch-screen input and various monitoring systems; operability  and safety in non-stationary states such as during maintenance  should also be considered. The equipment must be made  user-friendly, for example, by designating the points where  periodical maintenance is required to relieve operators of that  concern.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   We described above the performance required for 256M  DRAM-compatible ion implantation equipment from the user  standpoint. From the viewpoint of process technology, the  important topic is to improve the low-energy implantation  performance as well as the extensions of previous technological  trends such as dust generation reduction, contamination  reduction, charge-up reduction and implantation accuracy  improvement. From the production viewpoint, the pursuit of  improved reliability including reduced failure rate and ion  source-life extension, automation, improved operability and  greater safety is desirable.

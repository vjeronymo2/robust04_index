			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Kimberly-Clark, P&amp;G settle seven-year dispute KIMBERLY-CLARK and Procter &amp; Gamble, the two major diaper manufacturers in the US, have reached out of court settlements on patent and other disputes after nearly seven years of litigation, Reuters reports. Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark announced that an anti-trust action, due to be heard in federal court in Dallas yesterday , patent lawsuits and other disputes in the US, Canada and Britain were included in the settlement with Ohio-based Procter &amp; Gamble. Details of the settlement are confidential, but Kimberly-Clark's director of corporate communications, Ms Jean Allen, said her company 'is pleased with the terms'. The 'diaper war' has been waged since August 1985 when Proctor &amp; Gamble brought a patent-infringement action against Kimberly-Clark, citing use of an elastic waistband material. Kimberly-Clark counter-sued, alleging Proctor &amp; Gamble was attempting to monopolise the disposable diaper market. In July 1987 a Dallas court found in favour of Kimberly-Clark's waistband, declaring the P&amp;G patent invalid. The decision was upheld on appeal. Over the next five years, Proctor &amp; Gamble brought various patent-infringement charges against Kimberly-Clark, while the latter continued to accuse P&amp;G of anti-trust violations.</p>

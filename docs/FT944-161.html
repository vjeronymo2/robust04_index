			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Australia to harden refugee law Australia's federal government yesterday disclosed plans to toughen its laws on 'refugee status', in an effort to stem the flow of boat people arriving from southern China. About 950 boat people, predominantly Chinese, have landed in northern Australia this year. Senator Nick Bolkus, federal immigration minister, said the government planned to ensure that illegal arrivals could not claim refugee status on the grounds of China's restrictions on the number of children couples can have. He said that many of the recent arrivals had cited this policy in claiming refugee status.</p>

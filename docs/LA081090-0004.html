			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> CAMARILLO SEEKS HALT TO BUILDERS' 15 PROJECTS;  </P> <P> GROWTH: CITY OFFICIALS WANT COUNTY PLANNERS TO STOP FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN THE  SANTA ROSA VALLEY. THEY SAY THE PLANS VIOLATE THE GREENBELT AGREEMENT.  </P> <P> The city of Camarillo is headed for a possible showdown with county planners  over 15 proposed new housing developments in the burgeoning Santa Rosa Valley  that Camarillo officials say could become the virtual equivalent of a new city.  </P> <P> The Camarillo City Council is urging the county to stop all further development  in the neighboring valley to the east, where about 2,500 people now live in  luxury houses on one-acre lots.  </P> <P> The newest proposals from a group of 15 developers to build houses on 463 acres  of agricultural land and open space violate the county's greenbelt agreement  and development guidelines limiting growth to city areas, Camarillo officials  said.  </P> <P> The estimated 1,000 residents that the developments will bring will add to the  burden of already crowded schools in the area and create more traffic than  Santa Rosa Road can handle, City Council members charged Wednesday. Residents  use Santa Rosa Road to travel east through Camarillo to the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> "We're not just doing step-out development here, folks; we're creating a new  city," said Councilwoman Sandi Bush. "The Santa Rosa Valley already has a  population that is larger than Ojai and only about 3,000 people less than when  the city of Camarillo incorporated in 1964."  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously Wednesday to urge the county to stop building in  the Santa Rosa Valley and deny requests for an amendment to the county general  plan to allow one of the proposed developments.  </P> <P> But the city, which has grown rapidly at its east end, has contributed to many  of the problems itself, said Bruce Smith, general plan section manager of the  County Planning Department.  </P> <P> "It would be great if the city of Camarillo was as strict with its own  development as it is with this particular plan," Smith said. The county has no  intention of creating a new city in the Santa Rosa Valley, he said. Including  the proposed projects, the maximum population of the Santa Rosa Valley is about  5,600 people with about 1,650 houses, Smith said.  </P> <P> Nine property owners of the 332-acre Caston Trust property south of Santa Rosa  Road propose to divide the land into 278 one-acre lots for houses. The area is  now zoned for agriculture or open space, with minimum lot sizes ranging from 10  to 40 acres.  </P> <P> Eighty-six of the 332 acres are part of a greenbelt area that the county and  city have jointly agreed to leave as a buffer between cities.  </P> <P> The county must amend its general plan to approve the Caston Trust proposals.  </P> <P> Another six property owners want to build houses on 50 one-acre lots north of  Santa Rosa Road. That area is already zoned for houses and requires no plan  amendments.  </P> <P> The county staff has not yet decided whether to recommend approval of the  proposals. Both the County Planning Commission and the County Board of  Supervisors will hold public hearings before supervisors decide on the  proposals in late November, planner Dan Price said.  </P> <P> Camarillo officials have already made up their minds.  </P> <P> "It's difficult enough to have orderly development within the cities, let alone  this kind of leapfrog development," said Councilman David Smith, referring to  the increase of development outside the boundaries of established cities.  </P> <P> "It's a slow march right up to the city limits," Bush said.  </P></p>

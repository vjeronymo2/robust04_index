			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIGEO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The attorney for a retired San Diego police officer's son who is charged with  murdering his grandfather with a hatchet conceded in court that the young man  committed the killing.  </P> <P> "The only issue in this case is whether it's murder or manslaughter," said  attorney Victor Eriksen, who represents Michael Lopez, 22, of Lemon Grove.  </P> <P> Lopez is the son of Manny Lopez, a former San Diego Police sergeant who is now  a private security consultant and was a leading character in Joseph Wambaugh's  book "Lines and Shadows," which detailed the operations of a now-defunct  undercover police unit aimed at fighting crime along the U.S.-Mexico border.  </P> <P> The victim was Michael Lopez's maternal grandfather, Bruce Corey, 63, of Lemon  Grove, who was found dead in his garage by his wife Jan. 4.  </P> <P> Eriksen told San Diego Superior Court jurors in his opening statement that  Lopez was intoxicated when he went to his grandfather's home that day.  </P> <P> Lopez erroneously believed that his grandfather knew he had stolen jewelry from  his grandmother weeks earlier, Eriksen said. Lopez told Corey about the theft  and "expected a tongue-lashing," which didn't occur.  </P> <P> Instead, his grandfather needed help in moving a gate to his garage and asked  Lopez to help him, the attorney said.  </P> <P> At one point, the gate slipped and knocked Lopez to the ground, and Lopez  "thought his grandfather was attacking him," Eriksen said. "He freaked out. He  snapped. He reached over to the workbench and grabbed what was there. It was a  hatchet. In a crazed frenzy, he kept hitting and hitting." Corey was struck 30  times.  </P></p>

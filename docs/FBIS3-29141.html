Japanese participants said U.S. businesspeople taking part  in  the closed-door session complained about slow progress in  opening the Japanese markets for auto parts, insurance and  electronics products.    On the other hand, the Japanese insisted that progress has  been made in bilateral business cooperation to help U.S. firms  do business in Japan, they said.    As for trade in autos, representatives from Japanese and  U.S.  automakers pointed accusing fingers at each other over why the  U.S. share in Japan's auto market is so small.    Delegates from the "Big Three" U.S. Automakers said this is  evidence of the closed nature of the Japanese market, but the  Japanese pointed to the fact that the European share in Japan's  auto market is the same as European makers have in the U.S.  market.    Some 30 business leaders from the two countries are  attending  the two-day meeting, arranged by the Japan-U.S. Economic Council  and the U.S.-Japan Economic Council and slated to end on Tuesday.</p>

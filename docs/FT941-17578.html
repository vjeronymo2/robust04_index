			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Media review aims to boost UK ownership overseas A wide-ranging review of UK cross-media ownership designed to encourage British companies to take advantage of opportunities in international media markets was announced by the government yesterday. It is likely that further deregulation of broadcasting ownership rules could follow, allowing a larger role for newspaper publishers in television ownership, when the inter-departmental review ends in about six months. Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, who promised a wider review in November when he announced proposals to allow one company to own two ITV licences, said he wanted to see UK participation 'in an enormously expanding market'. The review comes against a background of rapid changes in the industry and growing internationalisation of media ownership. Newspaper proprietors, including Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, and Associated Newspapers, owner of the Daily Mail, have been lobbying hard to remove the rules which at present prevent them holding more than a 20 per cent stake in either commercial television or radio stations. Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, said yesterday: 'Assuming it leads to a relaxation, it is something we would very much welcome. It is a natural extension of newspaper publishing.' The review will bring together officials from the National Heritage Department, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Downing Street policy unit. After it is complete a further round of ministerial meetings is expected, suggesting that policy changes are unlikely before the autumn. 'It is intended to examine things looked at at the time of the Broadcasting Act 1990, but also at the variety of relationships between newspapers, TV companies, radio stations and the press,' said Mr Brooke. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's national heritage spokeswoman, generally welcomed the announcement, but wondered whether newspapers would be allowed greater participation in television ownership in return for accepting value added tax on newspapers in the next Budget. Mr Brooke said in an interview on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the review would broaden out to look at 'the way the world is developing much more widely'. This could include everything from television programmes to films, videos, music, computer games, home shopping and information of all kinds. He was determined however to maintain the UK's domestic production base because, he said, people liked watching things produced in their own country 'through their own national filter'. It was also important to maintain a plurality of views and a diversity of choice in broadcasting, said Mr Brooke.</p>

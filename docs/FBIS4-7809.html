			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Senator Radu Timofte, president of the </F> Senate's Defense Commission, by Irinel Radulescu; place and date  not given: "Foreign Intelligence Service Will Harm Neither the  Citizen Nor His Rights"]    [Text] The draft law on the organization and  functioning of the Foreign Intelligence Service [SIE] was  submitted to the Permanent Bureau of the Senate last week. The  legal initiative of the Commission for Defense, Public Order,  and National Security is part of the package of laws that will  form the necessary legal framework for the organization and  functioning of an important component in the structure of the  intelligence system. The document, which is the first legal  project that refers to the Foreign Intelligence Service, is  notable through a number of distinctive features compared to the  document referring to the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI].  Thus, we asked Senator Radu Timofte, president of the Senate's  Defense Commission, to comment briefly on this subject.    [Radulescu] Mr. Senator, the commission that you are heading  has submitted the draft law on the organization and functioning  of the Foreign Intelligence Service to the Permanent Bureau of  the Senate. There was no such law during the interwar period in  Romania and there is no such law in many other countries because  the activity of the respective services is carried out only in  accordance with internal operational rules. Then why is such a  law necessary now?    [Timofte] The assistance of such a law is needed to enable  us to oversee the organization and functioning of the SIE,  because of the specific and complex nature of its activity, as  well as because of the duty -- established by the Constitution  and by the law on national security -- that an authorized body  such as the SIE should operate in accordance with the law.  Thus, we will coordinate our activity with the legislation  currently effective in our country. According to the law on  national security, the activity of the SIE will be organized and  controlled by Romania's Supreme Defense Council and will also be  supervised by the parliament.    [Radulescu] In connection with this parliamentary  supervision, Article 2 of the respective law stipulates that  this control will be carried out "through the special commission  of the two chambers of the Parliament." Will a new commission  be established or will the current "Vacaru Commission" take over  this task as well?    [Timofte] Through this draft law, we are trying to enable  the current commission that is in charge of supervising the SRI  activity to expand its control over the SIE as well. This is  the wish of those who initiated this document. However, I do  not know to what extent the parliament will like this idea. I  am already anticipating stormy debates on this subject, because  many people will want the Parliament's Defense Commission to  carry out this control of the SIE activity. The reason for  choosing the "Vacaru Commission" for this job is linked to the  wish and the need to limit the number of those who come into  contact with and have access to information that the SIE is  dealing with.    [Radulescu] However, by limiting the number of those who  have access to such information, more power is given to the  control commission, which will have access both to the SRI and  the SIE information. How will the Parliament react to such a  situation?    [Timofte] That is precisely why I said that there will be a  heated discussion on this subject. My personal opinion is  identical with the stipulation of the law. If the parliament  rejects this idea, then the control over SIE will pass to the  two defense commissions.    [Radulescu] What other sensitive articles are included in  the respective law?    [Timofte] When the law was submitted to the Permanent Bureau  of the Parliament, I requested that the Commission in charge of  human rights should also be informed about it. Thus, I would  like to stress the idea that in no way will the law on the  organization and functioning of this service harm the citizen or  his rights. Certainly, any of the articles of the respective law  might become sensitive at one point and positive or negative  examples from the legislation of other countries might be  brought up at any time. I hope that no particular problem will  be encountered before the law is endorsed, as long as this  service carries out its activity in accordance with its own  rules. We tried to avoid as many problems as possible. I could  give you an example regarding the "way in which the service  carries out covert activities." Had we not included such a  stipulation in the draft law, useless and interminable  discussions in the parliament on the issue would have followed.  I would like to mention once again that it is not the law that  has to include sensitive issues but the SRI regulations.    [Radulescu] Mr. Senator, compared to the SRI, the SIE seems  to have a preferential regime, although it is also under the  parliament's control. I am talking about the way in which  reports are submitted and the level at which they are submitted.  Could the SRI react to this or could there be an unprofitable  competition between the two services?    [Timofte] According to the law, the opening of the SIE  toward the parliament and the coordination of its activity by  Romania's Supreme Defense Council is carried out annually or  when the situation requires it. This is identical with the  situation when the director submits a report on the way the  service carries out its duty. The fact that the SRI submits  reports to the parliament and the SIE to the Supreme Defense  Council means precisely that access to information that cannot  be made public is limited as much as possible. Debates on such  a report in the parliament might have a negative effect on the  activity of the service and even on national security.    Theoretically, there is no reason why this "discrimination"  should stir adverse reactions because the SIE and the SRI are in  charge of completely different areas, which exclude competition.  It is true that both services carry out their activity in the  field of national security, but one carries out its activity  inside, the other one outside, the country. No competition can  arise in such circumstances. One might rather talk about  cooperation because, in the activity carried out beyond the  country's borders, one could encounter such situations that  might affect the country's internal situation. And this is the  area in which the two services, I mean all the structures of the  intelligence services, have to cooperate.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / The Irish Referendum: Commission adopts a humbler profile THE UK, which takes over the rotating EC presidency in 10 days' time, will try to calm fears of unaccountable supra-nationalism by spelling out what 'subsidiarity' means. This principle, which Maastricht the treaty incorporates into European law for the first time, in theory means that decisions should be taken at the lowest practicable level of government. In EC terms, it means the Community acts together only when doing so is more effective than individual countries acting alone. The British government believes highlighting this principle will mollify those resisting what they see as a drift of decision-making to Brussels. In fact, generally only the Commission can make proposals, while only the 12 governments can make decisions, and the European parliament has limited amending powers. One of the ironies for the UK is that had Britain accepted the Dutch presidency's compromise on social policy at Maastricht, this would have strengthened subsidiarity by requiring the Commission to prove that its proposals could not be better handled nationally or regionally. With the 11 trying to press on with the treaty rather than re-negotiate it to accommodate Denmark, it is difficult to see how they can produce a re-definition of subsidiarity with a similar, legally binding force. However, Commission president Mr Jacques Delors seems already to be considering a re-organisation of the Brussels executive and rationalisation of its powers. This has every appearance of a strategy agreed with the three large member states - Germany, France and the UK - in return for their leading moves to reappoint Mr Delors for a further two years at next week's Lisbon summit. The 17-strong Commission ends its four-year term in December. Since the Danish shock, the Commission has undoubtedly pulled in its horns, showing deference to the Council of Ministers (of the 12), even in matters like EC trade policy, where it has long-established competence. Mr Delors and UK Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan have floated the idea of giving back to member states certain Commission powers, like the regulation of water standards. Beyond this, senior Commission officials indicate that a larger revamp is being considered. Mr Delors and close colleagues are expected to work through the summer preparing a clear delineation of what powers should remain with the Commission and what should be handed back. He is also, one senior official suggests, likely to submit his reappointment to the approval of the European Parliament, something a Commission president would not be obliged to do under Maastricht until 1995. Mr Delors would also expect clear endorsement of those powers the Commission intends to retain. Internally, there will be more political oversight of major policy areas, for the sake of greater coherence and nipping in the bud meddlesome interventions in national affairs. One consequence is that there is likely to be a re-grouping of functions inside the Commission, fusing, for instance, the several commissioners and departments dealing with external affairs or regional policy. While all this may improve the image of Brussels, it does not deal with the main way in which Maastricht promotes secretive and remote decision-making. This involves the new areas of foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs co-operation, to be agreed between governments, outside EC institutions, and at some remove from national parliaments. Maastricht foresees a constitutional review in 1996 to decide whether this inter-governmentalism - the antithesis of the EC's institutional development  -should be brought into Community decision-making. Already there is pressure to make decision-making by the Council of Ministers much more transparent. But much sooner than 1996, inter-governmentalism could become the focus of hostility.</p>

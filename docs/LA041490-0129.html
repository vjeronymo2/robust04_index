			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEASLES OUTBREAK PLAGUES 23 STATES; FUNDS RUN SHORT  </P> <P> The measles outbreak now plaguing California is part of a larger, two-year  epidemic that health officials say is sweeping the nation, causing thousands of  cases of illness and scores of deaths.  </P> <P> From Maine to Texas, Alaska to Florida, there have been measles outbreaks in at  least 23 states this year, and the number of reported cases is running 70%  ahead of last year at this time, health officials said. For 1989, the Centers  for Disease Control in Atlanta reported 17,800 measles cases and 45 deaths.  </P> <P> By April 6 this year, at least 31 measles-related deaths had been reported  nationally, two in Orange County and 24 in all of California. And the "measles  season" of late winter and early spring, is not yet over, officials said.  </P> <P> State after state has turned to the Centers for Disease Control for additional  money for vaccine to immunize vulnerable populations. Consequently, $9.5  million in special federal funds allotted this year for outbreak control is  already gone, CDC officials said.  </P> <P> "We sent the last of the money out today," Dr. William Atkinson, a CDC  epidemiologist who has been monitoring the nation's measles outbreak, said  Thursday. "We've asked the government for a supplemental appropriation. Until  we get it, people will just have to wait or they will have to go to their state  Legislature."  </P> <P> Most states say they have adequate supplies of vaccine on hand. But, they said,  they are being cautious with their remaining stores.  </P> <P> "At this point, we're running nip and tuck, kind of hand to mouth in order to  immunize all the people who need to be immunized," said B. J. Laing, a nursing  consultant for the Nevada Department of Social and Health Services.  </P> <P> "We've got enough at the moment for outbreak control," said Dr. Mack Sewell,  New Mexico state epidemiologist, "but we're being very judicious about how we  use it. We have to be careful because of the limited supply and the amount of  funds we have."  </P> <P> Rick Nelson, a public health adviser in Washington, said he is keeping his  fingers crossed that Merck, Sharp &amp; Dome, the only federally approved  manufacturer of measles vaccine, can keep up with the demand.  </P> <P> "The worse case scenario is that we may be two or three days in getting the  vaccine into the areas," said Gary Bruell, spokesman for the West Point, Pa.,  company. "But we're getting it there as fast as we can."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the number of measles cases in Orange County is already outstripping  last year's. By Friday, 141 residents had been infected so far this year,  compared to 95 cases by the same date last year. The cases are mounting so fast  that county epidemiologist Dr. Thomas A. Prendergast -- who in early January  had hoped the epidemic was waning -- now gloomily believes that no end is in  sight.  </P> <P> So far, most of the nation's outbreak has been concentrated among preschool  children, either because parents failed to have them vaccinated against the  disease or because they contracted the disease before the recommended  immunization age of 12 months, officials said. Both Orange County children who  died this winter -- a 7-month-old Santa Ana boy and a 10-month-old Anaheim girl  whose measles led to pneumonia and then encephalitis -- were too young to have  been vaccinated.  </P> <P> In Chicago, an estimated 30% of preschoolers have not been vaccinated,  officials said, and Atkinson of the CDC believes those numbers are probably  reflective of other major urban areas.  </P> <P> Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), has introduced legislation for a 40%  increase in the $131.5 million allotted to the CDC to be distributed to states  for immunization.  </P> <P> "We should eliminate any financial barriers and second we should reach out to  bring people in to have their children immunized. It's inexcusable that we  should have people suffering." Waxman said.  </P> <P> For most communities, the biggest problem is providing enough staff as health  officials struggle to identify affected pockets and to vaccinate susceptible  residents. In Washington state, local health departments in some cases have  recruited Boy Scout troops to go door to door handing out flyers urging that  residents be immunized.  </P> <P> In St. Paul, Minn., which has had 117 reported measles cases since January,  compared to seven cases for all of last year, department officials have been  forced to pull staff from other departments, hire additional workers, recruit  volunteers and enlist the services of a home health care agency to meet the  demand for immunization.  </P> <P> "We've never had this type of an outbreak in recent years," said epidemiologist  Dr. Paula Henry."  </P> <P> In Dallas, which has already reported 1,600 cases of measles, five times last  year's number, and four deaths, health department officials have been working  almost around the clock, said county epidemiologist Charles Haley.  </P> <P> "We've had to drive our staff past any reasonable limits," Haley said. "In the  month of February, we immunized more people than we did in all of 1989, and in  the first 10 days of March, we immunized more than we did in February. And  that's with no additional staff."  </P> <P> While the current outbreak pales in comparison to the pre-vaccine era when  measles cases numbered 500,000 to a million annually, health officials say they  are concerned because of the highly contagious nature of the disease in what  has become a more mobile national population.  </P> <P> "You don't have to even be in the same room to get the disease," said Atkinson  of CDC. "We know that an infected person can have left a room two hours ago,  and you can walk into the room and catch the disease from the germs still  floating around in the air."  </P> <P> Officials have tracked cases that were passed on county-to-county and  state-to-state via crowds in medical waiting rooms, at spring break and at  weddings and other family gatherings. Health officials say many cases can be  traced to Canada, Mexico, Nicaragua and El Salvador. More than 300  measles-related deaths were recorded in Mexico alone last year.  </P> <P> Officials say one reason that many young children have not been immunized is  that the health care system has sometimes not made immunization easily  accessible. Consequently, many communities are now considering changes in  location of their clinics or the hours of operation.  </P> <P> But officials also warn that it is parents who ultimately are responsible for  seeing that their children are immunized.  </P> <P> "We had one death where the parent lives six blocks from an immunization  clinic," said Haley in Dallas. "That wasn't a problem of accessibility."  </P> <P> "Fifteen-month-old children don't walk into the clinic," Atkinson added. "They  have to be brought in."  </P> <P> Health officials said part of the problem has been the inability of the health  care system to educate many people, particularly recent immigrants, to the  importance of immunization. That, they said, accounts for the disproportionate  number of measles cases in Latino, non-English-speaking populations and other  immigrant communities.  </P> <P> "We've polled people in our Hispanic community, and it's an accepted thing in  childhood that everyone gets the measles," said Laing of the Arizona Health  Department. "It's a way of life, an expected happening. We're trying to reach  them through the media to let them know that we do have some prevention."  </P> <P> Health officials report a similar situation in Minnesota, where the Laotian  immigrants settled near St. Paul and Minneapolis following the Vietnam War, and  in the Amish communities scattered throughout Iowa, New York, Michigan and  Wisconsin.  </P> <P> "We've had a couple of hundred cases simply because the Amish people don't  believe in immunization," said William Fagel, spokesperson for the New York  Health Department. "Once it starts in a closed community like that, it spreads  like wildfire."  </P> <P> Adding to the outbreak, officials said, are a large number of measles  infections in adults who have been vaccinated. Officials said that in about 5%  of all those vaccinated against measles, the vaccination fails to take hold, or  sometimes the protection wanes over time. That has accounted for large  outbreaks of measles around the country in colleges and universities among  young adults, who are most susceptible to the deadlier aspects of the disease.  </P> <P> In response, the U.S. Public Health Service and the American Academy of  Pediatrics has recommended to public and private health providers that those  born after 1956, particularly school children, college students, medical  personnel and those in high-risk locations, be vaccinated at least twice to be  sure that the vaccine takes hold.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lanie Jones and researchers Janet Lundblad, Mary Kay Lewis  and Tom Lutgen contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Degussa tumbles 26% to DM121m DEGUSSA, the metals, chemicals and drugs group, yesterday warned there will be no recovery in group profits in the last quarter of the financial year as it reported a fall in pre-tax earnings by 26 per cent to DM121m (Dollars 70.3m) in the nine months to the end of June. The group blamed the decline on reforms in the German healthcare sector, combined with the effects of the worldwide recession on its metals businesses. It said it saw no hope of a recovery in the world economy in the latter months of the financial year. It said there was no way it would be able to catch up the shortfall in profits in the rest of the financial year. In contrast to the fall in earnings, group sales rose strongly, up by 13 per cent to DM10.7bn. But Degussa said that the bulk of the increase was due to sharply increased precious metals trading and sales together with changes in the companies included in the consolidated figures. Stripping out these factors, turnover would have been just below the level of the comparable period last year, Degussa said. Losses in the metals division - which accounts for just over one-third of group turnover excluding precious metals - were 'markedly higher' than last year, Degussa said, reflecting weak demand amid the recessionary environment. There was a slight improvement in profits from the chemicals division. In the healthcare division profits were 'substantially below' prior-year figure. Degussa, which has reduced its total number of employees from 33,500 to 31,760 over the year to the end of June despite a number of acquisitions, vowed to maintain its programme of cost-reduction and restructuring. Wella, the German haircare and cosmetics group, reported that group profits climbed by 3 per cent to DM66m from DM64.1m in the first six months of the year, whilst profits at the parent company dropped by 1.7 per cent to DM29m. Escada, the German fashion group, expects to make a profit for the 1993 full year, Reuter reports. This follows an operating loss of DM10m to DM15m in the first six months of the year, according to Mr Wolfgang Ley, chief executive.</p>

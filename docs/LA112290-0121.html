			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALTADENA;  </P> <P> ZONING RULING DELAYED  </P> <P> A zoning variance that has become the center of a controversy over alleged  bootleg rentals in this unincorporated area was delayed Monday by the county  Regional Planning Commission.  </P> <P> The commission made no decision on the variance requested by homeowners  Margaret and Guillermo Villareal.  </P> <P> It is opposed by the Altadena Town Council. Instead, the commission asked its  staff to survey residents surrounding the Villareals' home in the 1500 block of  East Woodbury Drive.  </P> <P> The neighborhood is zoned for one house per 7,500 square feet. But a county  building and safety official told commission members Monday that 38 nearby  residences have two buildings per lot and another 19 have three buildings per  lot. The survey could take at least three months, county planners said.  </P></p>

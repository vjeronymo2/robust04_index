			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPANESE MONOPOLY PROBE ASKED  </P> <P> Boone Co., an investment company owned by U.S. takeover specialist T. Boone  Pickens, asked Japan's Fair Trade Commission today to investigate possible  violations of the anti-monopoly law by Japanese auto makers and parts  suppliers.  </P> <P> A commission official, Yoshiro Sekine, said the panel will study Boone's claims  and decide what action to take.  </P> <P> Pickens has been seeking greater participation in the management of Koito  Manufacturing Co., a Japanese auto parts maker, after becoming its largest  single shareholder in March, 1989.  </P> <P> Sekine said Boone claimed that Japan's 11 auto makers put unfair pressure on  parts suppliers to lower the prices of their products.  </P> <P> He said Boone also claimed that the auto makers' close relations with parts  makers limit free competition among the parts suppliers and hinder entry by  outside companies, especially foreign makers, into the Japanese market.  </P></p>

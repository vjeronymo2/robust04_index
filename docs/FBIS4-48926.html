			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Patricia Lee] </F>   [Text] The inflation problem in China is now under the  central government's control, according to an official from the  Bank Of China in Hong Kong. The Bank of China's Hong Kong Macao  Office assistant officer, Zheng Polin, said the government's  attempts to curb the overheating economy had gradually been  effective. The over-supply of currency was under control and  the amount of bank deposits had gradually risen in the wake of  the economic reforms adopted during the second half of 1993.    Mr Zheng said yesterday that the series of reforms in China  also enhanced the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and  provided ample opportunities for the territory's economic  development. The banking sector in Hong Kong had been further  developed with the opening by 13 local banks of 60 branches or  offices in China since 1985, he said. In turn, the China-based  commercial banks had established offices in the territory.    Both the financial and securities markets in Hong Kong would  grow bigger, because they could act as centres for the large  amount of fund raising required for the restructuring of China  state-owned enterprises and many construction projects. Mr  Zheng stressed that Shanghai could not usurp Hong Kong's  position as the prime financial centre, in view of the time  needed to develop it and the different characteristics of both  cities. Neither did Singapore have the ability to surpass Hong  Kong as, in comparison to Hong Kong, it was geographically far  from China.    China Merchants vice-general manager Lin Jiang said high  inflation would cause pressure on the stability of the yuan  exchange rate. The exchange rate was being stabilised after the  currency's unification, which also implied that the timing and  other mechanisms for the reforms were correct. He expected that  the exchange rate of the yuan would be maintained in the near  future as the policies of the Peoples' Bank of China would be  effective in relieving the pressure on the demand for foreign  currency in China. However, the stability of the yuan in the  medium to long-term depended on fundamental economic factors  such as inflation and interest rates.    Mr Lin said it was unlikely that the business market for  foreign banks would open within the next year or two because  state banks were not competitive enough in terms of operations,  management and staff skills. The government would tend to  protect the state banks until they were mature enough to compete  on an equal basis, he said.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CINCINNATI'S RIJO KEEPS REDS IN RIGHT DIRECTION  </P> <P> When the Cincinnati Reds were building their big lead in the National League  West, Tom Browning and Jack Armstrong were the pitching stars.  </P> <P> Those two, with considerable help from strong arms coming out of the bullpen,  led the Reds to a 9 1/2-game lead before the season was half completed.  </P> <P> Even though their two aces haven't won a game in two weeks, the Reds show no  signs of relinquishing their grip on first place.  </P> <P> The pitching stars now are Jose Rijo and Rick Mahler plus the strong arms --  Randy Myers, Rob Dibble and Norm Charlton, who is making his contributions as a  starter now.  </P> <P> It was Rijo's turn to start Tuesday night at Cincinnati and he beat the St.  Louis Cardinals, 2-1, with Myers getting his 26th save. Rijo went only five  innings, but he drove in what proved to be the winning run on a bunt single in  the second inning and improved his record to 10-6.  </P> <P> Rijo wanted to talk about his batting contributions more than his pitching  after he gave up six hits in five innings. He is hitting .421 in the last nine  games.  </P> <P> He noticed that third baseman Terry Pendleton backed off after the count  reached 2-2.  </P> <P> "I saw him back off and said, 'Thank you.' I knew I had to drop it fair. Every  time I've tried to do it, I've been successful. You've got to believe. I  believe."  </P> <P> Myers ended the game by picking Tim Jones off first base.  </P> <P> Rijo has won twice and so has the surprising Mahler, since either Browning, who  has been hurt, or Armstrong, who has been ineffective, has won.  </P> <P> It was another tough loss for Joe Magrane (8-15). He gave up only four hits  besides the two-out bunt single that scored Paul O'Neill from third. Another  was a run-scoring triple in the first by Barry Larkin.  </P> <P> "This is a rough situation," said Magrane, who gave up only one hit after the  second. "I've pitched some good games, but the bottom line is I'm losing."  </P> <P> Vince Coleman was the Cardinal offense. He singled to stretch his hitting  streak to 12 games, stole three bases and scored the only run on a single by  Ozzie Smith in the third.  </P> <P> New York 4, San Diego 0 -- David Cone (10-7) has become the Mets' most  dependable pitcher.  </P> <P> Cone pitched his third consecutive complete game as the Mets celebrated their  return home by moving to within two games of first place in the East.  </P> <P> The young right-hander pitched a five-hitter, four singles and a double by  Roberto Alomar.  </P> <P> Tim Teufel, getting a chance to start for the first time in 10 days, hit a  two-run home run to lead the Mets' attack.  </P> <P> Atlanta 9, Pittsburgh 0 -- The Pirates are in another slump, and this time it  may wind up with them falling out of first place.  </P> <P> They went four games in front in the East Thursday, have scored only six runs  in the last four games, and all the Mets have had to do was go 2-2 and cut the  lead to two games.  </P> <P> The Pirates' latest hitting slump made a winner out of Charlie Leibrandt (6-8)  at Atlanta. Leibrandt, who had lost five of his previous six decisions, held  the Pirates to five hits in seven innings.  </P> <P> A two-run home run by Francisco Cabrera capped a three-run first inning off  John Smiley (7-7) and it was a breeze for the Braves who have the worst record  in the league.  </P> <P> Chicago 5, Houston 2 -- Ryne Sandberg hit a home run in the fourth inning at  Houston to become the first second baseman to hit 30 home runs in consecutive  seasons.  </P> <P> Sandberg moved into a tie with Pittsburgh's Bobby Bonilla for the league home  run lead. He also helped Greg Maddux improve to 12-11.  </P> <P> Maddux, who pitched his seventh complete game, didn't allow a runner past  second until the ninth when he lost his shutout.  </P> <P> Montreal 5, San Francisco 2 -- The Giants are in danger of falling out of the  race in the West.  </P> <P> Mark Gardner struck out 11 and gave up only three hits in six innings at  Montreal, and the Giants fell 8 1/2 games behind Cincinnati.

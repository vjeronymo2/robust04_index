			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'FORBIDDEN CITY': SONG-AND-DANCE BRILLIANCE  </P> <P> In the 1930s, Charlie Low came to San Francisco from his native Nevada, as he  tells film maker Arthur Dong in "Forbidden City U.S.A." (tonight at 9, Channels  15 and 28), "with different ideas in the back of my head." What emerged was a  fairly stunning and charming episode in the history of America's cultural  diversity: The first nightclub with an all-Chinese floor show.  </P> <P> As in "Cabaret," where a Berlin nightclub became a medium through which the  corrupt Weimar German society was revealed, Dong's film gracefully shows how  one semi-underground club brought all manner of American contradictions to the  surface. The young entertainers first had to break from centuries of cultural  codes: that men ran the business, that women stayed at home and that  performers' lives were sinful.  </P> <P> Then, they had to prove their stuff to white producers and audiences. Like  their non-white counterparts, the Asian-American hoofers and singers had to be  twice as good as the white competition. But there was an extra burden -- the  assumption, as one "Forbidden City" veteran recalled, "that Chinese couldn't  swing."  </P> <P> One look at the elegant film sequences of Paul Wing and Dorothy Toy -- billed  as a kind of Chinese Astaire and Rogers, even though Toy was actually Japanese  -- buries that silly claim forever. But, like much of "Forbidden City U.S.A.,"  the joy of uncovering this buried nugget of song-and-dance brilliance has a  bittersweet edge. Once Hollywood beckoned the duo during the early days of  World War II, the U.S. government barred Toy from employment because of her  Japanese ancestry.  </P> <P> Low's club just wasn't the same after the war. As Paul Wing notes: "The novelty  wore off." Not even Chinese girls prancing around the room, dressed in nothing  but big feathers, could draw them in. Dong's predictable style, cutting back  and forth between talking heads and photos and footage, makes "Forbidden City  U.S.A." less than it could be. And yet the now-old faces reveal the ticklish  excitement of the days when they dared to do something sweetly forbidden.  </P></p>

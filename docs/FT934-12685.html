			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Department stores post 6.7% decline in sales: Japanese Economy INDICATIONS of a small pick-up in Japanese retail sales were yesterday disappointed when department stores reported a 6.7 per cent decline in sales for last month. The year-on-year fall, for the 19th month running, came despite the apparent popularity of a series of sales drives in mid-September, the Japan Department Stores Association said. Demand from corporate buyers was weak, while private customers' sentiment was damped by the string of typhoons to hit Japan over the past month. Further evidence of the extent of Japan's recession emerged on the first day of a three-day conference of regional managers of the Bank of Japan, the central bank. Companies across the country reported a sharp decline in export volumes because of the yen's strength, said managers. Corporate profits were still being revised downwards and demand for capital remained weak. Separately, Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, the minister of international trade and industry, hinted that if the economy failed to improve, the government would consider further pump-priming measures, on top of the two packages so far this year. He told Japan's foreign trade council that the packages did not appear to have worked well.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Unitas profit slides to FM128m UNITAS, one of Finland's largest banking groups, yesterday announced a FM128m (Dollars 29.3m) profit for 1991, compared with FM480m for the previous 12 months. The deterioration was mainly due to a 44 per cent increase in credit write-offs, which rose from FM759m to FM1.09bn last year, to represent 0.77 per cent of total claims. Non-performing loans totalled FM5.72bn at the end of 1991. The bank emphasised, however, that it had maintained its capital adequacy ratio at 10.3 per cent. It plans to pay a total dividend of FM94m. Group equity and reserves amounted to FM10.2bn at the end of last year, and the balance sheet rose to FM151bn. Net income from financing operations was FM2.32bn, down FM252m on the 1990 figure. Despite the weak earnings performance, Mr Ahti Hirvonen, chairman, said Unitas was 'well poised to face the coming upturn', though he believed a recovery was unlikely before late autumn. 'Credit write-offs will remain heavy this year and non-performing loans will continue to increase,' he said. He emphasised that the group's credit write-offs/claims ratio remained 'considerably lower than those of the major Swedish banks'. Mr Hirvonen said the 'major problem facing Finnish banks is the excessively low interest margin'. The group's broad interest margin was only 1.4 per cent last year. He said the bank faced 'no serious international exposure' and that its cost-cutting programme made FM40m savings last year. Staff had fallen by 1,500 to 8,807 over the past three years.</p>

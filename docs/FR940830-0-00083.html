			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> HUD Assistance: Handbook and Field Offices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Nine comments provided advice on better ways to give assistance to program participants. One suggestion was to reinforce the concept of enhanced flexibility with rational handbook guidelines and grant Field Offices sufficient authority to adapt the regulation to local conditions. Field Office and PHA partnerships were praised such as the relationship between the St. Paul HA and the Minneapolis Field Office. Further delegation of approvals and discretion to Field Offices was suggested. Additional Field Office staff training was recommended. The Handbook was found to be deficient on implementation guidance. IHAs expressed a need for extensive assistance on the new rule. Four IHAs also strongly recommended that each Office of Native American Programs should have a full time CIAP/CGP Director/Coordinator or fund NAIHC additional monies to allow them to give technical assistance to those IHAs needing additional support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD was directed to give clear, strict instructions to its Field Offices that establish time deadlines for Field Office action on HA requests, including approvals of RFPs, recommendations for awards, 2530 approvals and approving of waivers. If HUD does not act within 14 days, HAs suggested that the items should be approved. Departmental review and approval of CGP submissions was also mentioned as improving but HAs wanted mandated deadlines for HUD approval and no continuous review of previous approvals. Field Office oversight of troubled HAs was criticized for lacking in clear direction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CLPHA and the NYCHA recommended that HUD's rules and procedures for CGP should vary much more widely to acknowledge the differences between modernization programs at HAs of different sizes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD will take these comments regarding better assistance to program participants into account when it revises the CGP Handbook. Recently, HUD completed its reorganization of the Field Offices. Regional Offices were eliminated and revised delegations of authority were provided to the Field Offices. IHAs are advised that technical assistance is already in place. HUD will make its best efforts to provide timely reviews. However, HUD cannot always respond to HA requests within 14 days in all cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 504 Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  CLPHA requested that HUD allow HAs much wider latitude in meeting 504 requirements, to take into account the current configuration of buildings and units and the comparative suitability of individual buildings for 504 modifications. They also requested that HUD speed up its decisions concerning 504 requirements under modernization and noted that Field Offices sometimes make unreasonable demands on the HAs, and there is no official HUD guidance in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is unclear what the commenter intended. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a civil rights statute. The current regulation at 24 CFR part 8 provides HAs with a considerable amount of latitude to take into consideration current building and site configuration. When an HA undertakes new construction or substantial or other alterations with respect to a given project, the HA has the authority to determine which are the units, buildings and sites in which the required number of accessible units will be located. The following are several examples of how the regulation provides latitude: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

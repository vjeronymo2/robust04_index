			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / World Bank's worst-kept secrets: Michael Holman argues for an open approach in Africa The time has come for the World Bank to open to public scrutiny its relationships with the governments of Africa, just as it has urged the continent's leaders to open up to their citizens. Transparency and good governance demand it. Instead the bank withholds information. Country reports, sectoral analyses and project evaluations are classified as confidential. Often they are the only source of reliable data in Africa, but bank officials apart, only a handful of politicians and civil servants is allowed access to them. This restrictive approach does Africa a disservice - it stifles debate, protects vested interests and gives structural adjustment programmes a bad name. Many governments around the world would like to control the information supply, but in Africa it is easier to do so than elsewhere. The private sector is weak, the press is vulnerable, universities starved of resources, think-tanks are almost non-existent. Who can fill the information gap if governments will not? Only the bank. It already plays an important part. Its 1989 analysis - Sub-Saharan Africa: From Crisis to Sustainable Growth - remains required reading. Hardly a month goes by without a new study on some aspect of the continent's economic crisis. But it is a different matter when it comes to operations in individual countries. The bank's relationships with some of its African clients are profoundly unhealthy: protective, secretive or defensive, sometimes all three. Governments are too often being given the benefit of the doubt when practice falls short of promise, and presidents' white elephants are indulged. Take Nigeria: why the circumspection with which the bank handles its biggest customer in Africa? The bank has been the main supporter of the structural adjustment programme launched by President Ibrahim Babangida in 1986. After a promising start the programme ran into serious difficulties, undermined by corruption, weak management and fading political commitment. But these factors are not evident from a look at the bank's 1992 annual report on the state of black Africa's largest economy. 'Growth in Nigeria's GDP and agricultural sectors,' it says, 'both rose by about 5 per cent in 1991 with total non-oil productions rising by just under 4 per cent. However the combined effect of the political transition and the short-lived effect of the Gulf crisis contributed to some weakening of fiscal and monetary discipline' (my italics). This euphemism conceals a crisis. The unexpurgated view of Nigeria is revealed in a bank report - Public Expenditure Management in Nigeria - not intended for public consumption. It was based on a review conducted in early 1991. In this study, one finds a more enlightening account of Nigeria. The report tells of 'large-scale' spending of oil revenues 'outside the purview of statutory controls'. It speaks of 'a lack of transparency and accountability of big spending decisions'. It says that 'public expenditures (are) used more to distribute oil riches and generate lucrative business opportunities for selected groups than to ensure efficient delivery of goods and services to the country as a whole'. Ask Nigerians about their economic crisis and most will blame corruption and 'sap' - the acronym for the structural adjustment programme, which has become synonymous with hardship, inflation and unemployment. But if they had access to information that the World Bank treats as confidential, they would be better able to see the link between corruption and mismanagement and the failure of 'sap'. They would gain more insight into Nigeria's plight, and why 'sap' was introduced in the first place. This information would not ease the pain of austerity. But at least there would be a better understanding of why 'sap' was not working and a more informed debate about alternative strategies. Of course, the bank has an explanation for the secrecy. Without it, officials argue, governments would not co-operate. And confidentiality is clearly important. Yet all too often information that should be in the public domain remains secret. When information about grave mismanagement is withheld, confidentiality overlaps with complicity. It is now widely accepted that international aid should carry conditions, whether linked to human rights or political accountability. The World Bank should add access to information to that list. The reports and analyses on which adjustment programmes are based should be open to public scrutiny. Nigeria, which has promised to return to the path of reform, would be a good place to start. Chief Ernest Shonekan, chairman of the country's governing Interim Council, set out the blueprint in his budget in January, together with an appeal for debt relief. Few actions would do more to convince sceptical donors and creditors that he means business than allowing the World Bank to open the books on Nigeria. The governments that object the loudest to such scrutiny would be those with the most to hide.</p>

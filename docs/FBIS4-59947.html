			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "On the Margins of the Visit by </F> the Kuwaiti Writers and Professors to the ETTELA'AT Institute"]    [Text] On the basis of a prepared program, a high-level  delegation of Kuwaiti professors and writers visited the  ETTELA'AT Institute and participated in a frank and cordial  discussion with the editorial board. This constructive  discussion can be assessed from the following viewpoints:    The distance between us and our co-religionist brothers and  the lack of the proper conditions for creating an "atmosphere of  discussion" with them, has only generated numerous ambiguities  on both sides. These ambiguities could be clearly perceived in  the nature of the issues raised by the Kuwaiti delegates. This  places an immense responsibility on our shoulders and those of  our colleagues in Kuwait and other Persian Gulf countries.    In other words, a regular exchange of opinions and ideas by  nonofficial individuals on the regional level can provide a  clear impression of the attitude of the officials and on the  other hand, can prove to be an important factor in fostering  greater closeness and understanding among the peoples.    The presence of the Kuwaiti guests in Iran and their  discussions with their Iranian colleagues could prove to be the  beginning of a new and dynamic move beneficial to the regional  nations. For many years, despite Iran's constant declaration of  its good intentions and its desire for extensive relations with  other countries of the region based on good neighborliness, the  fomenters of tension and those who wish to gain by generating  tension have continued to spread propaganda to the contrary.    Adverse propaganda by the fomenters of tension from outside  the region and by those pursuing illicit interests has resulted  in many of our brothers in this country adopting certain  erroneous stances on the basis of this tension-creating  propaganda. The cordial visit to Iran by a delegation of Kuwait  professors, writers, and journalists marks the initiation of a  wholesome trend of exchanging views and perceptions among those  who play the greatest role in moulding the interests and  inclinations of the officials and elucidating ideas for the  peoples of the region.    Without doubt, a continuous exchange of opinions and the  expansion of this trend to the regional level will help to  eliminate many misunderstandings and fallacious conclusions; and  the regional countries will thus achieve better mutual  understanding. This will provide a suitable bedrock of culture,  inclinations and joint interests, and will become a precursor  for the creation of an "atmosphere of discussions and exchanges  of views."    We take this opportunity of the visit of our Kuwaiti  brothers  to Iran to extend a similar invitation to all our colleagues in  the other regional countries, to whom we wish to play host.  Conversely, we are also ready to be guests in their countries.  In this manner, our co-religionist brothers will be able to  discuss various issues in a cordial way and so bring the nations  closer together. We extend our hands to them to create this  atmosphere of discussion and exchanges of views among  nonofficial individuals (writers, journalists, university  professors, and others who do not have any official  restrictions) and to our colleagues in other countries of the  region.    At least discussions among us will have the advantage of  being held in a cordial and fraternal atmosphere, and the media  and extraneous official influences will not be able to affect  the opinions and inclinations of the people of the region.  These influences are the factors that generate tension and  create a climate of suspicion and hostility, and this path is to  the detriment of the nations of the region.</p>

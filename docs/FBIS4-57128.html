			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sao Jose dos Campos correspondent Virginia </F> Silveira]    [Text] Avibras Aerospace Industry, Inc., a  company that specializes in developing military defense  materiel, is investing in an expansion of its civilian products  business, which still represents only 30 percent of annual  sales. Last month, the company concluded two technological  cooperation agreements for development of mobile satellite  communications systems and optoelectronics components used in  optical communications.    The first agreement, signed with Embratel [Brazilian  Telecommunications Company, Inc.] and Simac Systems, a Dutch  company, calls for distribution of the Logiq system in Brazil.  That system is used to manage fleets of vehicles via Inmarsat  satellites, owned by an international consortium of which  Embratel is a member. Avibras, according to its vice president  Rubens Domingues Porto, will supply the complete system,  including installation, training, and technical assistance.    The Logiq system, Porto said, will permit a user to locate  and track his fleet automatically, to plan routes, give  instructions and directions, and exchange information between  each vehicle and the user's company. "Communications can be  exchanged 24 hours a day," the vice president emphasized.  <H5>  Optoelectronics </H5>   Through its Fiber Optics and Telecommunications unit,  Avibras  will also manufacture optoelectronics components (lasers,  optical receptors, amplifiers, etc). The project is being  carried out with technical support from Telebras [Brazilian  Telecommunications, Inc.] and Hewlett-Packard's Components for  Fiber Optics Division. The firm, according to Porto, will  initially supply submodules for assembly and encapsulation of  the devices in Brazil.    The partnership agreement with Hewlett-Packard, the Avibras  official said, will permit nationalization of the production and  exclusive distribution of the components in Brazil and the rest  of South America.    Avibras Fiber Optics is also preparing to enter the fiber  optics market within the next 12 months. "We are finishing work  on the facilities for the unit, in which $6 million has already  been invested," he reported.    Before it can begin operating, Porto said, the fiber optics  will need another $4 million, which would be used to import  equipment. The company predicts an annual market for 100,000 to  150,000 kilometers of fiber optics in Brazil.    The new Avibras factory will make fiber optics by the MCVD  (Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition) process, using technology  developed by Telebras's Research and Development Center (CPqD)  and support from S.G. Control, a British firm.</p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTHING WRONG WITH TRACK MEETS FEATS  </P> <P> In the story of the Sunkist Invitational track meet, writer Julie Cart went far  overboard in focusing on the failure of the milers to threaten world records.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, her story grudgingly noted that while several meet records were set,  they were in seldom-held events. Huh!  </P> <P> Meet records were recorded in the men's long jump, the men's 3000 meters and  women's 50-meter hurdles. All are official events listed by the IAAF for world  records.  </P> <P> AL FRANKEN, Chairman, Sunkist Invitational  </P></p>

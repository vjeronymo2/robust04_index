			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (21): An engine for the future - Rover Group ROVER GROUP'S K Series engine has now won its second major accolade since it was unveiled 2 1/2 years ago as the unit destined to power a significant part of Rover's car range for the 1990s. The all-aluminium, powerful but very lightweight engine - inevitably dubbed 'Special K' by the enthusiastic motoring press - was also a recipient of the UK Design Council's British Design Award early last year. Already used in the Rover 200, 400 and Metro ranges, the K Series is expected to expand into yet larger, more powerful - possibly even supercharged - variants to power as-yet still secret new Rover models. Currently the overhead camshaft engine is produced in three versions: a 1.1 litre giving 60 bhp at 6,000 rpm, a 1.4 litre producing 75 bhp at 5,800 rpm and a 1.4 litre fuel-injected 16-valve high performance option developing 95 bhp at 6,250 rpm. Developed over five years and the subject of a Pounds 30m development programme, as well as Pounds 120m to produce it on highly automated but flexible lines at Rover's Longbridge plant at Birmingham, the engine has been praised for a whole string of attributes. According to Rover, servicing costs over four years will prove to be less than half those for less advanced engines of similar size and power. The toothed rubber camshaft drive-belt is claimed to be good for 100,000 miles, twice the norm, and tappets are self-adjusting. There is only half the usual volume of coolant, so the engine warms up much faster on cold mornings. However, what really captured the Queen's Award for Technology assessors' imagination was the ease with which the engine can be assembled; in construction terms it is the engineering equivalent of an American club sandwich. One of the problems with making an engine in aluminium is that, ordinarily, a greater volume of material needs to be used to achieve the same strength as cast iron, so that it is possible to wind up with an engine just as heavy as an iron block unit, but a lot more expensive. So, unlike conventional engines, the K Series is made as a four-layer sandwich comprising, from top to bottom: cylinder head, cylinder block, crankcase and main bearing supports. All four are held together with ten, 16-inch steel through-bolts. In practice, this means the engine is exceptionally strong as well as light and easy to assemble. Another advantage of the through-bolts is that they absorb all the major stresses from the reciprocating parts of the engine, eliminating bore distortion and enhancing engine efficiency and durability. The relative simplicity of the concept also means lower bulk and weight. The K Series stands as something of a tribute to Rover management's determination not to give up its own engine design and development capability during its long and difficult path to privatisation during the 1980s, and even though it is now in close partnership with Honda - one of the world's best engine developers - with which it now has cross-shareholdings. Whether Rover will ever again embark on a 'ground up' engine programme, however, remains an open question. Judged by its predecessor, however, the K Series should have a life well into the 21st century. The K Series replaced, in the Metro, one of the most venerable engines - the A Series - in motor industry history. First designed in 1949, the 'A' powered the Austin A30 and Morris Minor in the early 1950s. In 1959 Sir Alec Issigonis turned it through 90 degrees and installed it in the Mini. Thirty three years on, in much more powerful, fuel-injected form, it is still powering the Rover's 'flying shoe-box', the Mini Cooper.</p>

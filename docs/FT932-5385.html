			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Swiss pacifist sentiments put to the test: Ian Rodger considers the key issues in Sunday's referendum on defence requirements IN MOST western countries, defence ministry experts are still struggling to assess their future needs in the light of the end of the cold war. In Switzerland, where direct democracy is a way of life, the people will decide in two national referendums this Sunday on the purchase of new fighter aircraft for the air force and the allocation of land to the army for training purposes. Of course, a large proportion of the voters has a special knowledge of, and interest in, the issues; every able bodied adult male serves in the country's militia army for an average of three weeks every two years until he is 50. If the votes had been held a few months ago, there is little doubt that pacifist sentiment would have carried the day. It was only a year ago that the Group for a Switzerland without an Army (GSoA) whipped up nearly 200,000 signatures in only 12 days - a record  - for its petition to block the government's plan to buy 34 McDonnell-Douglas F/A-18 fighters for SFr3.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn). 'The dangers facing Switzerland now are above all economic, social and ecological,' said Mr Andreas Gross, the soft-spoken socialist parliamentarian who heads the GSoA. 'We cannot be threatened militarily except in the context of a European war, and that is implausible,' he claimed. It was a beguiling argument at a time when the country was in recession, government deficits were ballooning and the collapse of the Soviet threat made the traditional Swiss policy of heavily armed neutrality look obsolete. And the GSoA was thrilled to have an unexpected opportunity to build on its moral victory in a 1989 referendum. Then, to the shock of the military establishment, a GSoA plebiscite calling for the abolition of the army was supported by a third of those voting. However, with the fighting in Bosnia veering out of control and unnerving racial strife springing up in neighbouring Germany, voter sentiment appears to have changed. Recent polls indicate that a narrow majority of Swiss are probably inclined to agree with their political and military leaders that, as in the past, it would be wise to be prepared for any eventuality. 'At the moment, no one threatens us directly,' says Mr Jean-Francois Leuba, a Liberal parliamentarian. 'But the situation can change very rapidly. Who would have imagined that Britain and Argentina would have fought over the Falklands? Nobody foresaw the fall of the Berlin wall or the war in Yugoslavia.' The debate in the run-up to Sunday's votes has been typically Swiss - gentlemanly and thorough. The pacifists have argued that no airborne threat could get to Switzerland without having first to pass through allied countries. The military chiefs warned against relying on allies to provide cover and policing of the skies. 'If we do not defend our air space, Nato will,' predicts Commandant de Corps Fernand Carrel, head of the air force. 'And it will do so without taking our interests into account,' he adds. Neither side appears to have seriously dented the convictions or the credibility of the other, but that is perhaps in the nature of the subject. If the votes do go narrowly in favour of the military, the GSoA will be blamed for having exaggerated the terms of its petition. Not content with simply seeking to veto the F/A-18 purchase, it added a clause that would put a moratorium on any fighter purchase until the year 2000. This has frustrated a large number of Swiss who support the principle of a credible air force but doubt the wisdom of buying a very expensive fighter that is unlikely to be able to avoid crossing an international border within only a few seconds of taking off. Mr Gross denies that the wording of the petition was part of the GSoA's strategy gradually to kill off the army by a thousand tiny cuts. Rather, he says disingenuously, it was to prevent the military from rushing into an alternative aircraft purchase without a full evaluation. Whatever the outcome, the Swiss will have more opportunities to vote on military matters. The GSoA has petitions in the works to halve annual military spending, now the largest in Europe at SFr750 per capita, to reduce the number of air force airports and to eliminate the special tax on those who do not serve their time.</p>

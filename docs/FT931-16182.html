			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / People: Charles Good Charles Good, formerly managing director of J S Gadd, is moving to Glasgow as managing director of the Scottish operations of Shoprite, the fastest growing part of the discount food shops empire. The position is a new one, the result of realising that it had become inappropriate to run the Isle of Man-based company entirely from the island. Shoprite, the property-to-discount food stores group, has established 35 stores in Scotland in the past two years and plans to open at least 24 more in the next 12 months. Good, 46, has been advising Shoprite for the past seven years and been on the board in a non-executive capacity for the past three. A chartered accountant who picked up corporate finance skills at S G Warburg before setting up his own company, C A Good, at the beginning of the 1980s, he sold out to J S Gadd in 1987 for Pounds 500,000. The UK corporate finance businesses of the latter, in turn, were sold to English Trust in December. He explains the move as motivated 'not by a negative feeling about corporate finance and certainly not about English Trust. But I have been in this game for 20 years'. He adds that he is a great believer in the Shoprite formula and that he is also 'sympathetic to the industry' - having personally owned three supermarkets in Reading between 1979 and 1982.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sega bucks trend with an advance of 64% SEGA Enterprises, the amusement centre machines and video games manufacturer, bucked the expected trend of the Japanese corporate results season yesterday by reporting a 64 per cent increase in profits. Sega said pre-tax profits in the year to March were up to Y55bn (Dollars 494m) from Y33.4bn after revenues rose 63 per cent from Y213.3bn to Y346.9bn. Sega, whose video games are popular internationally, notably its games hero Sonic the Hedgehog, is expected to provide one of the brighter spots in the Japanese results season as most industries suffered a sharp downturn. Sega has been extremely effective in competing with its main rival, Nintendo, in the US and Europe, where it has increased its market share to about 40 per cent, according to industry analysts. Sega saw a 91 per cent rise in export revenues to Y210.9bn, compared with a 23 per cent fall in domestic sales to Y19.3bn in its consumer products division. Sega is forecasting revenues of Y400bn and pre-tax profits of Y63.3bn for the current fiscal year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 12 KYODO -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu flew to Tokyo on Tuesday [12 April] on his  way for a weeklong visit to Russia, Britain and Belgium,  government officials said.    During a stopover in Tokyo, Han will meet Hans Blix,  director  general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to  discuss North Korea's refusal to grant inspectors unhampered  access to its nuclear facilities.    The IAEA has said two weeks of inspections in March were  insufficient to decide whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear  materials for weapons purposes as alleged by the United States  and other Western nations.    North Korea says it has fully complied with inspection  criteria previously agreed upon and maintains its nuclear  program serves strictly civilian purposes.    The nuclear row will top Han's agenda in Moscow, where he  will meet Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other  government leaders from Wednesday through Friday.    "I expect Moscow to bring up its earlier proposal for an  eight- way conference on the North Korean nuclear issue and I  will explain Seoul's position," YONHAP News Agency quoted Han as  saying before departure.    Moscow has suggested that both Koreas, China, the U.S.,  Russia, Japan, the United Nations and the IAEA try to resolve  the nuclear controversy through a special conference.    According to YONHAP, Han said Seoul welcomes the Russian  proposal but prefers that the UN handles the North Korean issue  for the time being.    Han is scheduled to meet British Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd in London on Saturday and will return to Seoul next Monday  after attending a two-day conference of South Korean mission  chiefs in Brussels.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Foreign companies protest at Indian plan The Indian government is planning to clamp down on foreign companies buying shares in their stock exchange-listed Indian subsidiaries at a fraction of market prices. The proposals have prompted protests from some multinational companies and foreign-linked chambers of commerce which have accused the government of acting unfairly and of reversing an important part of its economic reforms. The foreign companies are lobbying hard to persuade officials to change their minds before they announce new rules during the next month or so. The dispute dates back to last year, when, prompted by the government's liberalisation programme, multinationals started increasing their stakes in their Indian affiliates. Typically, they increased their holdings from the pre-reform maximum of 40 per cent to 51 per cent to secure control. Making use of measures designed to encourage foreign investment, the multinationals bought the shares at discounts of up to 90 per cent of market prices. These purchases brought protests from Indian business families which said foreign companies were taking unfair advantage of liberalisation measures. Foreign companies were able to do so because rules introduced in 1992 abolished the government's long-standing powers to control stock market issue prices and opened the door to free market pricing. The measure was a central element of the dismantling of the 'licence raj', the panoply of controls in pre-reform India. Under the new regime, companies were free to allot shares on preferential terms to any shareholder - as long as they secured approval from at least 75 per cent of shareholders. Shareholders were happy to grant such approvals to multinationals because they judged a multinational which increased its stake would also probably bring other changes to the affiliate such as new managers or new technology - so benefiting all shareholders. Indian state-owned financial institutions, which hold the bulk of Indian shares, set rules for minimum pricing, including a minimum price/earnings ratio of 15. However, because profits in the years 1991 and 1992 were depressed by recession in Indian industry, the formula allowed companies to issue shares to their foreign parents very cheaply. Colgate Palmolive, the US toiletries group, bought stock in its affiliate at a 90 per cent discount; Burmah, the UK oil group, secured an 89 per cent discount on shares in Castrol India. Several Indian business families jumped on the bandwagon - persuading their companies to issue shares to founding families at cheap prices. Last December, the institutions set an additional rule, fixing the minimum price as the average price for the previous six months. Foreign companies did not like this change - but did not object since the institutions were exercising their rights as shareholders - as they might in the US or the UK. However, the institutions' decision did not apply to every listed company because they do not always have majority shareholdings - some important foreign-related companies have small institutional holdings and large numbers of individual shareholders. So officials at the finance ministry started considering ways of clamping down on all preferential issues. They have decided on a plan to amend the Companies Act to outlaw preferential issues to small groups of shareholders, in line with US regulations. This change would affect Indian and foreign groups, but will take some time to carry out because it requires amending legislation. As a stop-gap measure the ministry is considering using foreign exchange regulations to impose on foreign buyers the same six-month average minimum price formula adopted by the institutions. The rule would be administered by the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, which has powers to approve substantial stock market investments by foreigners. Officials are likely to decide whether to adopt the stop-gap rule in the next week or so.</p>

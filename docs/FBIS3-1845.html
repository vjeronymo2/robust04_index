			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Hu Angang (5170 7254 6921) and Kang Xiaoguang (1660 2556 </F> 0342) from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences National  Conditions Analysis Group: "Creating New Systems To Eradicate  Corruption Once and For All (Part Two of Three)"]    [Text]  <H3>  VI. Institutional Upgrading Is the Fundamental  Way of Opposing Corruption </H3>   There are temporary and permanent cures for corruption. It  is a temporary cure to morally encourage incorruptibility among  officials, urging them to exercise self-discipline and keep  politically clean. It is a permanent cure for corruption to  root it out of its hotbeds.    As we mentioned in the previous article, the current  corruption in Chinese society has something to do with the  process of transformation to a market economy, including  institutional defects, institutional changes, and an imperfect  legal system. If corruption occurs in certain departments,  localities, and among certain cadres, we can regard the  phenomenon as an isolated case and mainly adopt the method of  fighting it morally, enforce the law on the very few corrupt  officials, and make public several major and important cases to  "send a warning to a hundred by executing one." Nevertheless,  when corruption has become a common practice in society and  people in the higher echelons and the lower levels are all  seeking rent [xun zu 1416 4436], this shows there is big trouble  with the existing structure which will foster and breed corrupt  elements of all descriptions, major and minor. The exclusive  use of "party discipline and state laws" against corruption is  just like cutting the fragrant-flowered garlic, which grows  thickly once its previous patches are cut. This being the case,  it is necessary to eradicate the hotbeds and soil which breeds  corruption with institutional upgrading.    Objectively, corruption can be found at any time and  everywhere. However, in different societies and under different  structures, corruption differs in degree and scope. By  remedying corruption permanently through institutional  upgrading, we mean minimizing the scope of corruption  characterized by people seeking rent through institutional  checks.    Establish a market economy system.    By institutional upgrading, we mean establishing a modern  market economic system and an economic environment based on fair  competition. This includes abolition of the double-track price  system, economic privileges, and economic monopoly; promotion of  the free flow of production elements and trade freedom;  restriction of special interest groups; correction of excessive  government intervention; and the reduction of the loss of  government effectiveness. The adoption of these reform measures  conforms to the goal set by the Chinese leaders to establish a  socialist market economy system and will thus greatly help  expedite the marketization process of the Chinese economy, cut  the cost of social business, and promote economic prosperity and  social progress.  Resistance comes from within the CPC.    Resistance to anticorruption comes from within the CPC, with  its main manifestation being the formation of Communist-led  special interest groups of all descriptions. The CPC is not a  monolithic bloc. It does not share identical interests and does  not have unity in steps. Otherwise, so long as the party  Central Committee issues an order, corruption would disappear  across the country or at least would be controled. Within the  CPC and the state machinery, various kinds of independent  economic and political interest groups have emerged. This is  one of the most important characteristics of the changes which  have taken place in Chinese society since reform was introduced,  a reflection of the development of the internal groups of the  party and the state machinery from being unified to being  pluralistic and from being centralized to being decentralized.  The role of the political party has been weakened while the  role of interest groups is intensifying. State authority is  diminishing while group authority is expanding. These groups  are special interest groups rather than the interest groups in  the general sense, such as the interest groups of the workers,  of the peasants, of the teachers, and of the scientists. Their  main characteristics are as follows:    First, motivated by their own interests, they set the  pursuit  of their own group's maximum interests as their objective. They  are exclusively concerned about the growth of their own group,  disregarding the loss of society's total wealth. Therefore, so  long as there is a lack of institutional checks or there are  economic rent [zu jin 4436 6855], motivated by their own  interests, they will seek the rent.    Second, they belong to groups of a profit-sharing nature and  participate in sharing society's resources and profits.  Although they constitute a small proportion of the country's  total population, they are always in a position to obtain a  higher proportion of economic resources.    Third, they are exclusive and monopolistic in nature. They  exclude other groups from participation in profit-sharing  activities, hinder the free flow of production elements by  opposing their competitive opponents' participation, and  increase their social monopoly. Of course, when they share  economic rent and other resources with their opponents, or  resist external threats and rectification efforts, they will  collude with each other intensively and extensively, "one  official covers up for another official" and, thus, make  themselves more complicated and difficult to deal with.    Fourth, they are highly influential and able to cause the  "lose of government effectiveness." They try every possible  means to influence government policy and even the policymaking  of the highest echelons of leadership. They also ask for  excessive government intervention, or the intervention by top  leaders, to achieve some economic privileges and preferential  policies and promote their own interests. They try by every  possible means to oppose and hinder the adoption of reform  measures conducive to fair competition because the measures will  mean the loss of many of their monopolistic benefits.    Fifth, their vested interests are rigid. There can be an  increase rather than a reduction in the absolute interests they  obtain and in the relative interests they share.  Reform touches on vested interests.    The characteristics mentioned above determine that any major  measures for institutional upgrading will undoubtedly meet with  strong opposition from these special interest groups because  reform touches on their vested interests and may put them in an  unfavorable position. For example, many interest groups  disagree to such reform measures as cutting customs duties and  abolishing import restrictions and exclusive state control in  foreign trade. Just as Paul A. Samuelson said: The history of  tariff protection has revealed more opposite cases. Some  industries are in their infantile stage forever. What is  protected by the government is the vested interest groups which  have always refused to cast away their diapers for many years  rather than infantile industries. (Paul A. Samuelson and  William D. Nordhaus: "ECONOMICS" (12th) Chinese edition,  published by the China Development Publishing House in 1992, p  1450)  Interest group behavior should be standardized.    The difficulty with market-oriented reform is how to handle  some special interest groups. Practicing the market economic  principles based on fair competition will, in essence, help  reduce or get rid of the economic rents exclusively shared by  these special interest groups. Institutional upgrading is aimed  at standardizing the commercial behavior of these special  interest groups, restricting their monopoly, and allowing other  groups or manufacturers and business people to get involved in  competition, rather than eliminating and expropriating them so  that the market based on competition becomes more mature,  monopolistic profits will become average profits, and economic  rents will disappear gradually.    Proper government intervention is a prerequisite for  institutional upgrading. In real economic life, the government,  more often than not, will provide certain special interest  groups with some sort of monopoly, intentionally or  unintentionally, such as economic privileges or preferential  policies. Thus, the other groups will follow suit and also seek  preferential policies conducive to their interests.    The government, in particular the central government, can  both create and eliminate unfair competition. It must be made  clear that the purpose of government intervention is to define a  series of regulations for market competition, put an end to  market distortions and ineffectiveness, create a market economic  environment based on fair competition for the various kinds of  main players in economic activities (including special interest  groups and general interest groups), and bring the role of the  market economy into the fullest play.  To oppose corruption, we must not rely on launching mass  movements.    Anticorruption is an institutional upgrading activity. It  needs careful planning, organization, and implementation. To  combat corruption, we must not rely on launching mass movements,  or turn anticorruption into a political movement, because a mass  movement or a political movement cannot remove the institutional  roots of corruption, or remedy institutional defects, and is  bound to lead to either confusion or disturbance.  Anticorruption is an institutional reform in the genuine sense.  The road to the most successful institutional reform is one of  active reform progressing step by step.    Institutional upgrading needs to bring the "superiority of  achieving development at a later date" of the countries starting  modernization later than others and the leading role of the  central government into play, achieve institutional upgrading at  relatively less cost and higher speed, and wipe out, once and  for all, the conditions breeding corruption. As a latecomer to  modernization and modern market economy, China can learn from  and use for reference the experiences in institutional upgrading  which have taken hundreds of years for developed countries to  achieve at a high price, including institutional framework,  economic systems, and legal standardization. This is the  so-called "superiority of achieving development at a later date."    With the government playing a leading role and the help of  the superiority of achieving development at a later date, it is  possible for China to lower the economic rents in the various  aspects of endeavor and check the vicious expansion of  corruption by carrying out market-oriented reform in a  relatively short time, say, two or three years, and, further, to  roughly establish the framework of the socialist market economic  system in a relatively short time, say, 10 years or a little  longer.  We Do Not Oppose the Use of Ethical Restraining  Forces.    Finally, what needs pointing out is that we favor curing  corruption permanently by institutional upgrading. However,  this does not mean excluding and opposing the use of ethical  restraining forces but, on the contrary, they must be  strengthened and fully used. The following major reform  measures to be taken are all based on this idea. At the same  time, consideration has also been given to short- and long-term  measures. Some measures can be gradually put into effect in the  short term and some take a relatively long time to implement.  <H3>  V. Suggestions for Major Institutional Upgrading Measures  To Cure Corruption Permanently </H3>   1. Liberalize interest rates and make them market oriented.  Capital is the most sought after element of production and,  while capital is the source of economic growth, it can become a  bottleneck for economic expansion. In a market economy,  "everybody is equal before interest rates." This is one of the  basic conditions for the main players in economic activities of  all types to enjoy fair competition and economic freedom.  Interest rates are the use price of funds and reflect the  relationship between fund supply and demand. For many years,  state-owned banks have pursued official interest rates in some  enterprises (mainly state-owned enterprises) and market interest  rates among some other enterprises (mainly nonstate-owned  enterprises). Moreover, they gave "preferential treatment" to  the former in the form of a loan quota ration and employed  "discriminatory treatment" to the latter.  This is the typical way of doing things based on the "theory  of the unique importance of class origin," a method which  violates the principle of fair competition in the market  economy. It is one of the main causes for the distortions in the  funds market and the large-scale rent-seeking activities.  Moreover, the current banking and financial activities are  basically directed by administrative orders. Under the pressure  of political groups, the banks grant "political background"  loans and governments at all level directly interfere in the  banks' loan business. The basic line of thinking on cracking  the crux of this problem is to turn the "double track" interest  rate system to a "single track" market interest rate system,  liberalize interest rates, relax the restrictions on loan  quotas, forbid the pursuance of discriminatory or preferential  interests rates toward any enterprises, let "everybody be equal  before interest rates," and grant financial discounts and  subsidies to loans used by such sectors as agriculture, energy,  and telecommunications. For this purpose, we suggest:  Pursue the idea that "everybody is equal before interest  rate."    --Pursuing market interest rates and abolishing official  interest rates. Savings interest and loan interest rates should  fluctuate side by side. Commercial banks are entitled to decide  their own interest rate levels. Government organizations are  not entitled to issue mandatory orders on loan and interest rate  levels to commercial banks. Interest rates can be liberalized  in two steps: First, official interest rates can be increased  gradually and oriented to market interest rates and restrictions  on loan quotas can be relaxed gradually and, second, interest  rates can be oriented to the market and restrictions on loan  quotas can be lifted.    --Promoting development of commercial banks and interbank  fair competition. We should lift the restrictions on bank  businesses (including regional and trade restrictions), allow  the development of nongovernmental commercial banks and the  participation of foreign commercial banks in competition in the  domestic market, eliminate the restrictions on the free  participation of financial enterprises in such competition, and  let relevant departments be in charge of examining and approving  the qualifications of enterprises to engage in financial  activities. Several major specialized banks are still occupying  a monopoly position. They should be divided into smaller banks  and encouraged to compete with one another in accordance with a  fair competition mechanism.    --Pursuing mortgages on assets (funds) in enterprise  lending.  Mortgage loans are extended to enterprises, which use 50 to 75  percent of their funds (circulating funds plus fixed assets) as  pledges, according to their types (production enterprises and  enterprises engaged in circulation) and the degree of their  creditability. Once enterprises default on their loan  repayments or their assets are less than their debts, they will  be confiscated and sold by public auction by the banks.    --Granting loans to agriculture, communications and  transport, energy, telecommunications, and other basic  industries and giving them government financial discounts and  subsidies to promote their development. Some of the  help-the-poor funds of the poverty- stricken areas should be  changed into financial discounts and subsidies to help the areas  develop their economies.  Abolish exclusive state control in foreign trade and turn  down trade barriers.    2. Since customs tariff rates were cut, nontariff trade  barriers were removed, and the reform of exclusive state control  in foreign trade was introduced, the Chinese economy has rapidly  become more market-oriented and the market orientation index has  increased from 25 percent in 1979 to 63 percent in 1992.  Nevertheless, China's foreign trade structure, in particular  its import structure, still conspicuously retains the  characteristics of the planned economy, such as exclusive state  control in foreign trade, import licensing and control, high  customs duties, and export control. These ways of doing things  are, in fact, protection by the government of the interests of a  small number of interest groups and some producers at the  expense of the interests of the whole and the consumers. They  have hindered the overall liberalization [kai fang 7030 2397] of  the Chinese economy and thus are detrimental to promoting the  free flow of production elements and both domestic and  international competition. Therefore, it is increasingly urgent  to reform the foreign trade structure, in particular the import  structure. It is also the only way of reducing and eliminating  the economic rents brought about by the structure. For this  purpose, we suggest:    --Lowering customs duty rates by a wide margin and  eliminating nontariff import restrictions; scrapping the import  licensing of major commodities, lifting administrative controls  over imported commodities, and simplifying customs duties; and  terminating various localities' power of tariff concession,  which should go to the central government.    --Eliminating exclusive state control in foreign trade,  empowering enterprises of all types to directly import and  export, treating state-owned and nonstate-owned enterprises  equally without discrimination, with the relevant departments in  charge of enterprises' import and export qualifications, and  auctioning the import approval documents for major commodities.    --Lifting restrictions over the operation by foreign capital  of such industries as commerce, trade, banking, insurance,  communications and transport, post and telecommunications, real  estate, and tourism, and boosting the competitiveness of the  tertiary industry at home.    --Removing controls over foreign exchange and gradually  establish a floating exchange rate system to make the renminbi a  freely convertible currency and promote the internationalization  of the Chinese economy.    --Gradually using international market commodity prices and  establishing links between international and domestic markets.    --Pursuing an appropriate, protective policy toward  agriculture and infantile industries at home but a more liberal  policy toward car, petrochemical, and other monopolistic  industries.  Put monopoly under strict control and promote fair  competition.    3. Put monopoly under strict control and ensure that  enterprises of various types and localities compete with one  another on a free and fair basis.    Competition is the core of the market economy and also a  motive force in economic development. However, the market  economy does not operate in a vacuum, with competition going  unregulated. One of the important government functions in the  market economy is to set "regulations" for competition through  policies and laws; create an environment of fair, open, and just  competition for the main players in economic activities; and  ensure the effective operation of the market economy.  Antimonopoly is interference by the government in the  incomplete market competition. It is achieved by enacting a set  of laws with which to standardize and restrict enterprise  behavior such as monopolizing the market and forbidding  enterprises from taking irregular actions to compete. The  formation of monopoly has many factors, including product  difference, superior cost, and the rate of economic returns.  The most important reason is institutional hindrance. To put  it another way, the system has restricted other manufactures and  business people and the element of recourse from getting free  access to the markets for certain professions and trades. If  the market is open and allows fair competition, those who corner  it have to engage in a fierce competition with other  manufacturers and business people who have free access to the  market, their monopolist profits will gradually disappear. To  prevent monopoly operations and ensure fair competition, we  suggest:    --Enacting an antimonopoly law as soon as possible to curb  monopoly, unfair competition, and the conspiratorial actions of  a small number of enterprises and reorganizing and disbanding  some monopoly organizations and enterprises, in particular,  companies or trade companies with exclusive control over certain  industries which must be divided into more than two companies so  that they will compete with each other.    --With the exception of a small number of public trades  (such  as water supply, electricity supply, gas supply, and post and  telecommunications) and the military industry, most trades will  not restrict enterprises engaged in other trades from having  free access to the market and set up manmade barriers to the  market. Companies are prohibited from monopolizing public and  service trades (such as communications and transport,  telecommunications and telephone, insurance, and broadcasting  and television). The government should exercise the necessary  economic controls and impose restrictions on their prices,  product varieties, and the conditions of market access.  --Prohibiting the adoption of means other than efficiency  competition to compete, such as preferential interest rates and  franchised operations.    --Accelerating the transformation of various industrial  departments and companies from monopoly to fair competition in  their sectors and the transformation from the control of  state-owend enterprises to the industrial management of  state-owned enterprises and nonstate-owned enterprises and from  administrative departments to trade associations.  Market unity helps break regional confinement.    --Reaffirming the principle of separating finance and  industry and preventing the convergence of financial monopoly  and industrial monopoly; implementing the provision made by the  Central Committee and the State Council on 28 July 1989 that  trust investment companies and other financial institutions are  prohibited from directly running nonfinancial enterprises and  those which have been set up should be separated in terms of  functions within the specified time. The operational scope and  funds of the abovementioned companies should be reassessed so  that finance and investment are separated.    --Abolishing various kinds of preferential policies and tax  concessions, including the multifarious practices in violation  of fair competition adopted by the special economic zones,  development zones, cities enjoying provincial status in the  state plan, and companies whose development plans are listed  separately in the state plan.    --Breaking down market barriers set up by different regions,  ensuring the free flow of production elements, and establishing  a single domestic market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Spring Sowing Uncertain"] </F>   [Text] Food manufacturers announce, as early as now, a  lack of finances for the spring sowing. The selective program,  the previous sole source of finances for this and other  agricultural activities, will definitely be abolished on March  31. The approved finances by the National Bank of Macedonia --  a total of 140 million denars -- are aimed only for financing  the production of corn. The stabilization program restrictions  even more limit the possibilities of any additional sources.  Thus, changes will have to be introduced in the plans for  sowing of 218,140 hectares with rice, sugar beet, sunflower, and  other products.</p>

			<p>Trafficking   <F P=102>   HK1906050094 Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in English 0348 GMT  18 Jun 94 </F>  <F P=103> HK1906050094 </F> <F P=104>  Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Nanning, June 18 (CNS) -- The Director of the  Public Security Bureau of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,  Mr. Lin Chaoqun, said here that remarkable achievement had been  made in the Region's campaign against drug and gun trafficking.    Mr. Lin said during the period from June of last year to May  this year, the Region had uncovered 5008 drug cases, more than  500 of them being big cases. Over 700-kilogram opium,  120-kilogram heroin, 16-kilogram caffeine and RMB [renminbi] 2.4  million gained from drug trafficking had been seized. Some 189  cases of gun trafficking had been also uncovered with 346 guns,  8200 rounds of ammunition as well as over 360 grenades,  flashlights and mines seized.    Special efforts must be made in areas teeming with such  illegal activities. The areas, according to Guangxi, include  frontier area connecting the Region with Vietnam, the juncture  between the Region and Yunnan Province, Guizhou City and  Guangdong Province. Hubs of communications in the Region such  as Nanning City, Liuzhou City and Wuzhou City as well as the  important communication lines and districts along these lines.    It was reported that drug taking situation in the Region had  been rampant with drug market there expanding. According to the  authoritative statistics, drug addicts in the Region have  reached nearly 40,000 in number covering 6 cities, 8 prefectures  and 79 counties there. A special campaign against drug  underground market has been staged in Nanning, Liuzhou, Wuzhou  and Beihai at present to curb drug addiction. In Frontier  areas, more than 250,000 opium poppies have been rooted out.    Serious punishment had been imposed on criminals engaging in  drug and gun trafficking. From June of last year till May this  year, among 326 criminals arrested, 209 of them had been  sentenced to different terms of imprisonment with 16 of them  sentenced to death, 11 sentenced to suspended death and 21 to  life imprisonment. On June 26 this year, the international day  for banning drugs, another batch of criminals will be put to  death in the region.    Mr. Lin said drug trafficking cases in the Region had been  increasing. In the former five months this year, such cases had  increased by 60 percent than the same period of last year and  heroin seized doubled that in the same period of last year.  Therefore it would be still an arduous task for the Region to  handle such problems.</p>

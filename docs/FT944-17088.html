			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (7): From the lavish to the cramped - Separate lounges for commercially important passengers are now common Business and first class airport lounges have come on rapidly in the past 20 years. In the 1970s, separate seating and relaxation areas, owned and run by the airlines for the benefit of their CIPs (commercially important passengers, as business and first-class travellers are known) were a rarity. Today, any airline with pretensions to status will have a scattering of lounges across the globe, dedicated to its most valued customers. American Airlines - which claims to have opened the first exclusive CIP lounge at La Guardia, New York, in 1939 - now operates 42 such lounges worldwide. United Airlines has 33. Heathrow Airport is home to some 30 CIP departure lounges (seven of them run by British Airways), with more expected. Increasingly, the world's airlines find themselves looking after their business passengers with the same assiduity on the ground as they do in the air. In general, CIP lounges are distinguished from the free-for- all seating arrangements in the rest of the terminal by the same recurring pattern of attributes: CIP lounges are open only to those flying first or business class with the airlines which run them; they offer free drinks and snacks; they provide enough decent seating to allow passengers to sit and stretch out; they offer TV, newspapers and washrooms; they will have numerous telephones; and there will be an area sectioned off for the business traveller to work in, with desks, a photocopier, a fax machine and the odd computer modem. Long-haul operators, such as Qantas, United Airlines and British Airways, have started adding to this list by installing shower facilities at their more important destinations. There are even occasional unpredictable extras, such as the vibro-massage armchairs offered by American Airlines, or the automatic shoe-cleaners provided by Japan Airlines. As you might expect, CIP lounges reflect the service provided by the airlines themselves, with all of them, at the very least, adequate. But not all airports are equal, and not all airline facilities are the same at either end of the journey. A lounge at one end of the flight might be large and lavishly-stocked, while its counterpart at the other end might be a quarter of the size and a good deal less impressive. Lufthansa, for instance, has the largest lounge complex at Frankfurt Airport, comprising four separate facilities for first and business travellers, which together can comfortably handle more than 2,000 passengers a day. At Heathrow, on the other hand, Lufthansa has to share a rather austere 80-seater room with Air France, which, on the admission of one of the staff, can become a little crowded late on Friday afternoons. Worse still, Alitalia, TAP, Olympic and Swissair are all crammed into one small, unprepossessing room along a far corridor of Terminal 2, far removed from the grandeur of BA's establishment. On this basis, one should learn to expect a lavish CIP lounge at the home airport of any airline, but to take whatever is provided at the destination end, without undue preconceptions. On top of this is the airline's judgment of what the CIP lounge is really there for. How much of the facility should be given over to work and how much to relaxation? And how, given the restraints existing at many airports, can it make some kind of positive statement about the airline which owns it? The Americans, not unsurprisingly, tend to place the emphasis on the work side of things. American Airlines' gargantuan facility at Chicago's O'Hare Airport covers 14,000 sq ft, boasts 19 bookable conference rooms, offers paper-shredding equipment and, significantly, a bar which serves free coffee, tea and iced water, but liquor only at a price. The furnishings might be described as comfortable without being plush; and as a temporary office for the determined businessman, it is hard to fault. The Japanese, similarly, organise their lounges at Narita, Tokyo, as smartly-furnished waiting rooms rather than as private clubs. The big advantage of their three CIP facilities (two executive class, one first or Sakura class) is that together they occupy more space than that of any other airline. Given the limitations on space at Tokyo's principal airport, this is a real boon, despite their somewhat unengaging atmosphere, with their ranks of armchairs, and their furtive 'Relax Corners'. British Airways tries to address the problem of business efficiency versus the need for a welcoming environment by making its lounges more like the interior of a Forte hotel foyer. BA's lounge spaces - especially the agglomeration at Heathrow's Terminal 4 - are strong on warm woods, low lighting and friendly wool fabrics. The self-service drinks and food counters are tempting, while the workstations are writing-desks with an extra phone on top, as opposed to the purposeful cubicles offered by American, or their rivals, United Airlines. It is a typically English compromise, in which the world of work is kept at arm's length. Heathrow is, in fact, unusually well-stocked with CIP lounges - reflecting its position as a hub international airport and a crucial staging-post: one in three of Heathrow's passengers connects between flights. And it is because of this that some airlines are branching out into new types of facility for business and first class travellers. British Airways has recently spent Pounds 1.6m on a new arrivals lounge at Terminal 4, catering for passengers who have just come off an overnight transatlantic flight and who need to spruce themselves up at the start of the day. Instead of comfortable chairs and free drinks, the CIPs are offered 23 shower rooms, a clothes pressing service and a continental breakfast. American Airways has followed suit, with the difference that its arrivals lounge at Heathrow is at Terminal 3 and contains nine showers. United Airlines will soon be offering competition in this line, but it may have to strike a deal with a nearby hotel if it is unable to find the space at Terminal 3. Elsewhere at Terminal 3, Virgin Atlantic is trying something altogether different. While its New York lounge is relatively conventional in approach, the Virgin Clubhouse at Heathrow attempts to subvert the notion of the CIP lounge as a comfy but uninspiring hinterland between work and relaxation, between waiting and doing. The Clubhouse aims to make travel fun for the business executive. To this end, it boasts a music room, a computer games arcade, a three-tonne model of a galleon, a massage salon, a hairdresser, a well-stocked bar and a model railway. It cost over Pounds 1m to fit the place out, and despite a token fax and photocopier, its whole philosophy runs counter to the essentially utilitarian values of other airlines' facilities. And as a tool for building loyalty to what is, after all, an extremely small player in international aviation, it works brilliantly. Realistically, it is hard to imagine Virgin's rivals taking a leaf out of the Clubhouse book. But it shows that the airport lounge can be more than a mere waiting-room, if enough people want it that way.</p>

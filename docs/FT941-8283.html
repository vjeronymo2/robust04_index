			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / British Steel customers consider legal action Steel fabricators are considering legal action against British Steel after the company was fined Ecu32m (Pounds 24.3m) by the European Commission last week for allegedly taking part in a cartel that rigged the market for beams and girders. The fabricators - which buy beams from British Steel, cut and weld them and then erect them on building sites - have asked their representative organisation, the British Constructional Steelwork Association, to see whether there are grounds for legal action. Mr Derek Tordoff, association director, said member companies were worried that they may have paid too much for the beams between 1984 and 1990, when the commission says a well-organised cartel was operating. British Steel, which plans to appeal against the commission's judgment, said the facts did not support any legal action by the fabricators. The association hopes to discuss the issue with British Steel, which is the only supplier in the UK of beams used in construction. It manufactures them at its Teesside works. Mr Tordoff stressed that the association was not trying to pick a fight with British Steel and admitted it was in a delicate position. The steelmaker, the association and its members have successfully worked together to market steel frames in buildings. Last year, they were used in 62 per cent of buildings of two or more storeys compared with only 30 per cent in 1980. In addition, both the fabricators and British Steel are fighting steel subsidies in Spain and Italy which are underpinning imports of fabrications into the UK market. Some fabricators believe they may have been paying Pounds 50 a tonne too much for their beams from 1984 to 1990. For a small operator using 30,000 tonnes over that period, the overpayment would have been Pounds 1.5m. British Steel says effective UK prices for beams rose by only 9 per cent between 1986 and 1990, less than the rise in the retail prices index. It said the fabricators' problems stemmed from the recession, which had caused business to dry up after the period when the cartel was alleged to have operated.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: BHP considers Chinese site Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, is to look into the commercial feasibility of developing an integrated power plant and open-cut coal mine near Hohhot, the provincial capital of the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia. The company said yesterday that a letter of intent had been signed this week with Zhungeer Coal Industry Corporation, part of China's ministry of coal industry, permitting a pre-feasibility study. The study, which will determine the size and timing of the potential project, should be completed within 12 months, and will be undertaken by BHP Minerals and BHP Power. The Chinese project is the second significant potential development announced in recent days by BHP Power, a newly-formed 'fifth leg' to BHP's business. Last week, the subsidiary said it had submitted a proposal to the Vietnamese government, seeking to conduct a feasibility study for a large integrated power and urea development. Also included in the proposed project consortium were Japan's Tomen Corporation, General Electric of the US, and Canada's Cominco Fertiliser, although BHP would be the lead company. Although the Australian company declined to speculate on the cost of the Vietnamese project, it has been suggested it could be worth more than USDollars 800m, making it by far the biggest foreign investment in communist Vietnam. The largest project to date is a USDollars 288m cement plant being built by Taiwan's Ching Fong group. The Vietnamese project could include a 'world-scale' urea fertiliser plant, producing around 600,000 tonnes per annum, which would be integrated with a 680MW power station, using gas turbine combined cycle technology. The project would rely on natural gas, from gas reserves recently discovered off the south Vietnamese coast.</p>

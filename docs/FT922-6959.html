			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Yorkshire TV 55% ahead to Pounds 9.36m YORKSHIRE Television yester-day announced a 55 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Pounds 9.36m for the six months to the end of March. Sir Derek Palmar, the Yorkshire chairman, yesterday described the result as a good increase in a period of recession that reflected the group's decentralised divisional structure 'which encourages management at all levels to maintain constant pressure to reduce costs in all areas.' The result was achieved on turnover ahead from Pounds 95m to Pounds 102m. Yorkshire, like other ITV companies, benefited from the government's decision to reduce the exchequer levy in the last year of the old franchises before the survivors started paying the Treasury the money they bid to retain their franchises. Yorkshire's profit before levy rose from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 12.7m but the company only paid Pounds 3.38m in levy in the half year compared with Pounds 5.61m in the same period last year. Mr Clive Leach, Yorkshire's managing director, said that the rise in operating profit had been the best in ITV. Yorkshire, a company in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a 20 per cent stake, successfully retained its licence against two rivals but with a bid of Pounds 37.7m a year. The payments, in monthly slices, start in January together with 7 per cent of qualifying advertising reven-ue. Mr Leach said yesterday that Yorkshire had already achieved its 1993 cost structure - eight months ahead of schedule. The company had a net cash balance of Pounds 13.1m at the end of March. Earnings per share improved from 10.1p to 16p and the interim dividend is being maintained at 3.3p. Yorkshire said yesterday that there had been vigorous discussions with some advertisers designed to 'raise the value of the company's airtime in the market to bring it more in line with our high audience delivery in preparation for 1993.' Despite difficulties Yorkshire improved advertising revenue to Pounds 75.8m (Pounds 71m) and the sales of programmes increased by 8.7 per cent from Pounds 23.87m to Pounds 25.95m. Margins however remained depressed and further steps were being taken to improve profitability. Yorkshire said the outlook for advertising revenue was encouraging and the company was confident that its position as a strong ITV licensee was assured. The share price rose 3p to 193p.</p>

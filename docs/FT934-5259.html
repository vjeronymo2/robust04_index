			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (28): A requiem for Sweden - Robert Taylor reflects on the death of a social model THE LIMITS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY: INVESTMENT POLITICS IN SWEDEN by Jonas Pontusson Cornell University Press Pounds 23.55 261 pages THE VOLVO EXPERIENCE by Christian Berggren Macmillan Pounds 25.00 286 pages Today's Sweden has become paradise lost for many of its social democratic admirers. Until recently it was the paradigm of the progressive society, with a generous welfare state for all, full employment, peaceful industrial relations and successful global corporations. Now it looks just another depressed western European economy with soaring dole queues, a huge public sector deficit, negative growth rates and plummeting living standards. The gravediggers who have been gathering around the Swedish Model for over 20 years finally look as if they have a corpse to bury. Both Jonas Pontusson and Christian Berggren in their differing ways provide invaluable insights into why the country is no longer what it used to be. Pontusson's rigorous analysis of investment politics in contemporary Sweden breaks fresh ground, despite its Marxist framework, by focusing on the country's powerful private manufacturing sector and its needs on global markets. Too often Sweden has been treated in splendid isolation, as a social experiment on the fringes of northern Europe which could flourish with little concern for events in the outside world. This was always a false one-dimensional picture and during the 1980s it became a sad delusion. Under global pressures the ruling Social Democrats pushed through a perhaps over-hasty deregulation of its financial system and as a result lost control of Sweden's economic destiny. There can no longer be Social Democracy in one country. The country's economy is now painfully vulnerable to short-term speculation, as was shown in November 1992 when despite an impressive display of national unity in defence of the fixed rate of the krona, global forces forced a massive devaluation. Pontusson argues convincingly that the once-powerful labour movement was compelled to recognise its own limitations in the face of capital when the manual unions pressed from the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s to establish so-called collective wage earner funds which, in their original version, aimed at providing the trade unions with a dominant ownership role over Sweden's corporate investment strategies. The controversy revealed the strength of the country's private employers, who mobilised effectively to block such a radical proposal. By contrast, the manual unions failed to carry their members with them over the issue. Renowned for their pragmatism and positive attitudes to structural change, the unions became too ideological and were unable to convince their own rank and file that the funds were in their own best interests. However, at the same time the unions were successful in securing legislation that introduced worker participation into Swedish industry. This was not the intricate, formalised German model of codetermination and works councils, but it has provided Swedish employers with an invaluable system to strengthen workplace support for structural change. Berggren's book on Sweden is a sorry tale. Volvo under Pehr Gyllenhammar's often visionary but autocratic leadership became the wonder of the global auto industry as it abandoned mass production methods at its new plants in favour of team-working and multi-skilling. By fusing computer-based technology with labour-intensive craft skills, the company broke from the old dehumanising methods of the assembly line and division of labour pioneered by Henry Ford, at least in its new plants although not in Volvo's homebase in Gothenburg. Industrial sociologists sang the praises of the Volvo. Other Swedish enterprises outside auto production followed suit. But their strategies were not really motivated by altruism. With high worker turnover and absenteeism in a tight labour market where open unemployment was not a policy option, they had little obvious strategic choice until the 1980s when many began - for a variety of reasons - to establish production plants outside Sweden. Finally, last year Volvo decided to shut its showcase Uddevalla and Kalmar plants in response to a crisis of excess capacity in a depressed world market. The company was keen to emphasise its decision was not a vote of no confidence by management in the new production methods but a sad consequence of commercial pressure. But it was always debatable whether the Volvo methods made financial or industrial sense. In short, during the 1980s the country could no longer pursue progressive ideas on how to make cars. It faced increasing market competition where cutting high unit labour costs and raising productivity were more important than humanising the content of work. As Swedes agonise over whether Volvo should become junior partner to Renault, the French state-run giant, they face the harsh consequences of being a small open country in a hostile global economy. Having avoided two world wars and created one of the most enviable of societies, Sweden's luck may perhaps have run out. These two books provide a nostalgic reminder of the country's exceptionalism before its fall.</p>

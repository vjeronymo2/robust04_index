			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. Zasurskiy: "Gaydar Was Right--and </F> Chernomyrdin Also"]    [Text] In the opinion of Vladimir Shcherbakov, the  first six edicts are not sufficient to evaluate how  comprehensively the president approaches economic reform.    Vladimir Shcherbakov, president of the Interprivatizatsiya  fund, expressing his views on the presidential decrees,  commented that the first six indicate movement in the right  direction, while the return of two drafts for additional  elaboration out of eight that were prepared provides grounds for  evaluating the approach to economic reform as a weighed and  thoughtful process. It is still too early to speak about how  comprehensive they are, as it is necessary to see if only the  drafts of the others, of which, as is commonly known, over 100  are currently in preparation.    A selective state industrial policy is fundamental to the  former deputy prime minister of the USSR. Emphasis must be  placed on it, and not on the accelerated bankruptcy of  enterprises. The legislative base for bankruptcy is undoubtedly  necessary. Bankruptcy was and will continue to be a routine  phenomenon in a market economy. The question is what type of  policy will be implemented--one with additional limitation of  the money supply, which will generate massive bankruptcies of  enterprises in a difficult financial position, or with  stimulation of individual types of production and enterprises as  well as selection of producers in the interest of preserving the  domestic economy and the life of the people.    A grasp of the essence of what constitutes a selective  policy  is highly important.    The elaboration of such a policy must afford us the  possibility of differentiating not individual enterprises, but  groups of them, perhaps types of production, those that we need  and without which we simply cannot survive--in this case I do  not have in mind preferential credits for individual  enterprises. We must not have a situation where the appropriate  government commission would decide which plant is to get what  amount of money. That commission has another task: formulation  of the goal, tasks, selection criteria, determination of forms  and methods of stimulation, and control to ensure that the money  is not spent on wages but on organization of production,  purchase of materials, and the like. At present, however, in the  view of the former deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers  of the USSR, such a policy has not been worked out, and money is  being received by lobbyists blackmailing the government with  strikes. Shcherbakov asserts: "The government cannot be blamed  for the fact that some are able to twist its arm until it  crunches, it is only possible to sympathize with it, however it  is necessary not to succumb to blackmail. At one time,"  Shcherbakov continues, "we were unable to hold out: Having given  in to the miners, we were compelled to give in to others as  well. The consequences of that for the economy are well known."    How to conduct a selective policy? For instance, we pick a  criterion--vitally important branches. Today that is not the  entire Ministry of Railways, but only its enterprises involved  directly with organization of traffic on the railroad. It is  clear that without it we are nowhere. Then let us declare that  it will be operating under special financial conditions. Let us  grant it special-purpose credit at a reasonable interest rate,  but not in order "to keep its pants up" and cover current  expenditures, but for repairs, because if the old tracks used by  trains disintegrate completely, there will be an entirely  different situation developing in the country. It is the same  with oil workers. Issue credit for repair of wells and  pipelines, but not for wages. It is not very difficult to ensure  that technically.    Today money turnover in production equals about 100 days.  This means that practically all enterprises are insolvent. Money  is the lifeblood of production. That is, if the policy of  limiting the money supply is to be continued with a rise in  inflation, Vladimir Shcherbakov believes that would be a  situation where blood was drained from everyone, one after the  other--from those who are not needed in a market economy as well  as from those who were forced to give their production for state  needs but were not paid, and those without whom we will perish  as a sovereign state and people.    By way of an example, even if an absurd one, for  instance--who in the world would think of turning off  electricity in a hospital? At the airport control tower? In our  case, however, such cases are not that rare.    Simple solutions are deceptive. Neither bankruptcies nor  promissory notes are a panacea for the problems faced by the  Russian economy. That is, promissory notes can and must promote  the resolution of certain tasks with an appropriate legislative  support. Just as bankruptcies are important so that enterprises  know what may happen to them. But a policy prodding toward  bankruptcy is highly unpromising. It is dangerous both in the  economic and in the political regard. That is a very heavy  social scene in the revival of the economy. It is impossible to  get by without that, but it is important not to agitate for the  conduct of such policy. If matters develop in the way on which  certain members of the government are insisting, then no  agreements will rescue us."    In the opinion of the former chairman of the State Planning  Commission of the USSR, there is another aspect of the problem  pertaining to the industrial crisis that can also be resolved  only through comprehensive methods--that is, the problem of  business in industry. "At present I do not know whether  enterprises will ever give me the money or not, and if the state  shares even with regard to a few branches, then I will know for  certain that the pharmacists will give me the money. The railway  workers also. Then I will invest in them and will organize  production for them."    It is necessary to see the entire system of problems in all  of its complexity. When Gaydar started with abrupt moves, he was  correct, Shcherbakov believes, and when Chernomyrdin allowed  everyone to adapt a little bit and regain their senses, he was  also correct.    Is Livshits also correct?    I do not know who is the real author of the edicts. I can  only note that until it becomes clear what edicts will follow  the first six, it is impossible to tell whether their author is  right.</p>

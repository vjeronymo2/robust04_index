			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Funding plans take colleges into market In the last year further education has been subjected to one of the government's most vigorous attempts to introduce a market to the public sector. In April, further education and sixth form colleges were removed from local authority control and incorporated as independent institutions. Their funding now comes from an education department quango, the Further Education Funding Council (England), and from commercial companies which pay for colleges to train apprentices. Although further education colleges educate more than 2m students - more than half of the UK's post-16 education - they remain almost invisible to the public eye. Their aim is to provide vocational and academic courses for teenagers and adults, as well as literacy and numeracy programmes. The funding council is putting the finishing touches to a new funding methodology, endorsed by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, which will have four aims: To encourage colleges to expand and compete for students. To encourage them to retain students, rather than allowing them to drop out without completing their courses. To improve educational standards by awarding extra funds for higher attainments. To remove any distinction between full-time and part-time students in funding. The funding council will set a 'tariff' for the number of students each college is expected to teach. Under present plans this will come to about 90 per cent of total funding. Colleges will be given extra money for each student they recruit in excess of the tariff, and will lose funds if they fail to recruit enough. Most colleges are happy with the principle of the arrangements but admit they are concerned that the gearing towards expansion may be excessive. Funding will also be available for good careers advice. Pupils will be set a target attainment and colleges will be rewarded with extra funding if the target is reached. Funds will be distributed each term. If students drop out colleges will be asked to refund money. On top of these incentives from the public sector colleges will be allowed to keep all funds they raise from local employers. Mr Bill Stubbs, chief executive of the funding council, made clear that these funds would not be taken into account when grants were allocated. Colleges should therefore be able to offer competitively priced training to employers, although this is yet to be widely tested in the market.</p>

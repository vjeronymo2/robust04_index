			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Accountancy Column: Green accounting and competitive advantage SPRING IS fast turning into the season for corporate reporting awards. Hot on the heels of last month's Stock Exchange and joint chartered accountancy institutes' annual award for published accounts comes an ecological equivalent that companies ignore at their peril. If the green bandwagon is beginning to creak from a surfeit of initiatives of dubious quality, the 1991 environmental reporting awards sponsored by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants deserves at least a little attention as an attempt to cut through the hype. There was a certain air of inevitability about the ceremony last Tuesday evening. The venue was the Whale Hall of the Natural History Museum in London. The individual making the presentation was Professor David Bellamy, while the two companies receiving the joint award - Norsk Hydro and British Airways - were names familiar to those with much knowledge of corporate innovation on environmental issues. Lessons to be learnt on the quality of environmental reporting exhibited by companies and how best to assess that information should be important elements in future debates about company reporting. It is time to inject some rigour into green reporting. While the judges of the published accounts award in late February found themselves unable to identify smaller company reports of sufficiently high quality to earn a prize, their counterparts assessing environmental reporting could not even find many candidates to consider. The total number of entries - including some which were entreated - was only 18. The number of companies venturing into the green arena is, without doubt, still relatively small. An international survey conducted by Clare Roberts at the University of Glasgow in 1990 suggested that only 13 per cent disclosed environmental information. That proportion is growing fast, however. Professor Rob Gray, one of the pioneers of 'green accountancy' and one of the judges of the award, estimates that at least two-fifths of the top 500 British companies now include some form of environmental statement as part of their annual reporting process. Mr Roger Adams, technical and research director at the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, argues that pressure for greater disclosure is being driven by both strong accounting pressures - as expenditures such as environmental clean-up become significant - and by legislation passed as a political response to growing ecological awareness. Mr Andrew Blaza, director of the environmental management unit at the Confederation of British Industry and another of the judges, says that competitive advantage is the drive towards environmental disclosure. 'It has to be commercially-driven,' he says. 'I am saying to companies that if they want to be first, they had better hurry up.' The accuracy and usefulness of the green data provided is developing rather more slowly, however. Gray highlights a number of weaknesses to existing statements. 'They are often parcelled up very much in a public relations way that owes more to advertising than accountability,' he says. 'We often wondered if we were really just looking at advertising.' He cites Body Shop as an example. 'They are very green by normal standards, but their reporting is PR-driven. It doesn't get down to what they actually do.' Many companies have tended to concentrate on peripheral activities and do not scrutinise the environmental impact of the core operations of a company, he says. An analysis last summer of 670 UK companies by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monthly monitoring service of company accounts, showed that only 10 per cent mentioned the environment and only 3 per cent provided a separate statement on the subject. 'The majority of disclosures are of such a low level as to be virtually meaningless,' it said. As last year's survey of UK financial reporting from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales illustrated, brief paragraphs such as that in the 1989 accounts of Evered are not uncommon. It states simply: 'The company is committed to taking responsibility for the environment in which it operates. This policy manifests itself through working closely with residents and local government groups.' The problems in no way reflect poorly on the two companies which won the environmental reporting awards this week. 'British Airways and Norsk Hydro chose themselves,' says Gray. 'They were so far ahead of the UK field.' He highlights a number of characteristics which singled out the winners. Both concentrated their environmental reporting on core business areas, approached the subject systematically, and gave data which allowed for comparisons and could be audited. They also employed an external consultant to verify the information provided. Neither simply published flattering information. 'The charm is they they didn't pull their punches,' says Gray. 'There was a lot of bad as well as good. Nobody's going to believe a squeaky clean approach.' Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest quoted company, first produced an environmental report three years ago, which was widely circulated within the country, including to every resident within three miles of all the company's sites. It followed up with a 28-page report covering its UK activities, published in late 1990. It shows trends over several years on topics such emissions, discharges, industrial accidents and energy consumption. BA produced a 100-page environmental review last year, which examined the impact of its activities at Heathrow airport, including trends in aircraft noise exposure, fuel consumption and emissions. The acid test, Gray believes, is whether the two companies will repeat their assessments. Bitter experience in the past has suggested that fear of attracting criticism has detracted even those companies which have published information from repeating the exercise. Mr Charles Duff, corporate development manager for Norsk Hydro in the UK, says there are discussions to produce an up-dated version of the UK report, perhaps next year. More significantly, he says the company is considering including a detailed environmental statement with its annual report and accounts, which would include 'real pound-note numbers'. Dr Hugh Somerville, BA's head of environment, says it is producing a report analysing the company's activities at Manchester airport this year. Next year there are plans to do the same at Gatwick and to assess the impact of its holiday business. BA is also seriously considering producing an annual environmental statement, containing a numerical assessment of the business under six headings: noise, emissions, congestion, waste, tourism and staff involvement in the community. The first one is due out this summer. The challenge for the future is to convert these first tentative examples of good environmental reporting into a series of more detailed standards. How far meaningful and comparable information can be coerced from the majority of companies without legislation is questionable. But without greater rigour, the mass of green data now being generated is probably not worth the recycled paper on which it is printed.</p>

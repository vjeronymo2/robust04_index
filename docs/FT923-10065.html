			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / International Company News: New bid move at NY Daily News THE BATTLE among bidders for the Daily News appears set to enter its final phase, as the newspaper yesterday won a 10-day extension of the deadline by which it must file a reorganisation plan to the New York bankruptcy court. The extension came with news that a new group - Silver Screen Management - is joining forces with the newspaper's management and unions to launch a stand-alone bid. Silver Screen, led by Mr Roland Betts and Mr Tom Bernstein, former entertainment lawyers, is said to be willing to put up about Dollars 25m. Both Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher who owns the Daily Telegraph in the UK, and Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, the publisher who owns US News and World Report, are, however, continuing to negotiate with the paper's unions and creditors. It is believed that one of these bidders is more likely to end up owning the New York tabloid. It is also thought likely that the latest 10-day extension will be renewed again. But advisers say the identity of the leading contender should become clear within the next 10 days.</p>

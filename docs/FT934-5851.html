			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Insurer buys Denplan - At a Glance PPP, the UK's second largest medical insurer, yesterday announced that it had bought Denplan, the largest private dental healthcare business. More than 25 per cent of dentists are members of Denplan, and 400,000 patients are registered. PPP provides private medical cover for nearly 2m people. The new relationship will have no immediate effect on subscribers of either Denplan or PPP, but cross-marketing and joint projects between the two are likely in future.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Following the announcement of the arrival on 25  March of a ship containing 530 tons of food products, a flood of  reaction continues to rain down upon Signal FM. A group of four  political parties made up of the National Cooperative Action  Movement [MKN], the Democratic Movement for the Liberation of  Haiti-Democratic Revolutionary Party of Haiti [MODELH-PRDH], the  Bel-Air branch of the Movement for the Organization of the  Country [MOP], and the Alliance for the Rebirth of Haiti [ARH]  have rejected this humiliation that France would like to add to  its sadism. France has pointed out that no people still under  its hegemony have ever been brought to the brink of extinction  because of the overthrow of a government. [passage omitted]    Certainly, Haiti has always hailed international aid  provided  as compensation within the framework of a world economic system  biased in favor of the highly industrialized countries. In that  regard, these parties recall that, far from making amends for  the wrongs done to the race debased by slavery, France has held  back the evolution of the Haitian people by requiring a very  heavy payment for acknowledging the nation's independence.  Nevertheless, the Haitian people have never needed charity from  the descendants of the Leclercs and the Rochambeaus [French  generals fought by Haitians during the War of Independence] --  conclude these political parties.    This press release is signed by Volvick Remy Joseph of MKN,  attorney Francois Latortue of MODELH-PRDH, Greger Jean-Louis of  the Bel-Air MOP, and Alex Dominique of ARH.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE QUAKE;  </P> <P> BUSH ACTS QUICKLY TO SEND FEDERAL AID TO DEVASTATED AREA  </P> <P> With a swiftness not seen in two previous disasters, President Bush sent  federal aid to earthquake-ravaged Northern California today and promised to  "take every step and make every effort to help the Bay Area."  </P> <P> "We're going to turn to the American people to help those in need," he said.  "So far, I think from an organizational standpoint, people are moving in the  right direction and we're going to follow it very, very closely from here."  </P> <P> Just more than 12 hours after the San Francisco Bay area was jolted by its  worst killer earthquake in 80 years, Bush signed a disaster declaration that  could clear the way for hundreds of millions of dollars in federal assistance.  </P> <P> Having taken political heat for a slow response to two other disasters -- the  Exxon oil spill and Hurricane Hugo -- Bush cranked the federal machinery up to  full speed, rushing civilian and military assistance to the area.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said $273 million of the $1.1  billion appropriated by Congress for cleanup efforts after Hugo will be  available immediately for earthquake victims in California.  </P> <P> Within minutes of Tuesday's quake, White House officials began marshaling  federal resources for an all-out response that included activation of a  2-year-old catastrophic earthquake response plan involving the Red Cross and 26  federal agencies.  </P> <P> Although it was too early to estimate the eventual cost, Fitzwater predicted it  would far exceed the damage caused by Hugo, which struck the Carolina coast  after hitting the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.  </P> <P> During a visit to headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Bush  said he hoped the quick response would lead to "less carping" than was the case  after Hugo.  </P> <P> Bush was to receive a report by telephone this afternoon from Vice President  Dan Quayle and Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, who flew to the area  to survey the damage.  </P> <P> Bush said he "probably will" visit the area, but not immediately because "I  don't want to get in the way."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It is Germany's duty to promote Latvia's  incorporation into the European Union emphasized the new German  Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Reinhard Holubek,  meeting today with Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs. The envoy  noted that Latvia's integration into Europe is currently delayed  by the Russian troops. Therefore, Germany supports Latvia's  demand for the withdrawal of the troops. Holubek expressed the  conviction that, thanks to international pressure, the Russian  troops will be withdrawn from Latvia by 31 August this year.  Another delaying factor in Latvia's integration into Europe,  the envoy believes, is the problem of the Skrunda radar station.</p>

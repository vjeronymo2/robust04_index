			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / Major starts drive to reassert his political authority Mr John Major will tomorrow attempt to relaunch the government's troubled 'back to basics' initiative in a speech which was being interpreted last night as the start of a concerted push to rebuild his political authority. The prime minister will use a visit to the north of England to set out his 'prospectus for 1994' amid mounting pressure for him to regain a grip on the government after a month of turmoil. Downing Street said last night that Mr Major would use the speech to explain his policy priorities for the rest of the year. Meanwhile, senior Conservatives disputed a claim by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, that Labour had not made any public spending commitments. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, dismissed government allegations about Labour's spending plans as 'bogus rubbish'. However, he warned the shadow cabinet not to give the Conservatives ammunition by making irresponsible promises. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, faced criticism from some rightwing Tory MPs for his apparent failure to react quickly enough to Labour's attack on the government's planned tax increases. His deputy at the Treasury, Mr Michael Portillo, was being attacked from the party left for seeking to raise his own profile ahead of any challenge to Mr Major's leadership. Rightwing MPs were speculating about the possible candidacies of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, if Mr Major is threatened. Yesterday's exchanges on Labour's spending pledges came after Mr Brown had said in a morning radio interview that the party had 'no commitment to spend money on anything'. Mr Portillo accused Mr Brown of 'stepping on the garden rake', saying his 'rash campaign against his colleagues' showed he realised that 'if you promise to spend more you will have to tax more'. Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, said that by making tax the 'main political issue', Labour had scored 'a significant own goal'. Labour responded to signs the government was backing away from a confrontation over pay with the main groups of public-sector workers by urging an end to secrecy over such pay awards. Downing Street insisted independent pay review body recommendations for rises this year of up to 3 per cent would not necessarily cause problems for the government, which has imposed a cash freeze on its pay bill.

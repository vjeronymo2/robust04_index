			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Special report for NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS by Luis Torres] </F>   [Text] Buenos Aires, 22 Jun (NA) -- The 1995 presidential  race is clearly and definitively under way. This has been  confirmed by Carlos Menem's concern in achieving the quiet  approval of the constitutional reform, and by Cordoba Governor  Eduardo Angeloz's concern in gaining an advantage through the  unification of the upcoming elections. Angeloz will certainly  be the UCR [Radical Civic Union] presidential candidate.    There are three political directions that can be noticed  during this World Cup month, and which outline the national  electoral future. First, Angeloz's Radicals are fully engaged  in playing a leading role to defeat their probable contenders in  the party's primaries, such as Senator Fernando De la Rua and  Deputy Federico Storani. Second, Menem's Peronists are moving  the chess pieces of the upcoming elections with the goal of  fully polarizing the people's hopes, thus preventing the run-off  election system that truly represents a "fearsome hell" for  them. Third, Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez's Grand Front [FG]  is actively engaged in probing the spirit of other parties, with  the goal of forming a broad alliance that will allow it to  challenge the Peronists. Storani and Peronist Senator Jose  Octavio Bordon have been included in the FG's immediate plans.  UCR President Raul Ricardo Alfonsin has been included in the  FG's future plans.    Current politics, and the hide-and-seek game played by many  leaders who are attempting to hide what is obvious, may be  interpreted based on these three directions.  <H5>  The Governors' Silence </H5>   The president has peevishly imposed upon himself the  painstaking and severe task of making his most cherished dream  come true as soon as possible: the approval of a constitutional  reform that will allow him to become a candidate again. This  task involves preventing any action that could delay or obstruct  the Constituent Assembly's progress.    Therefore, the attempt to include a clause allowing the  governors to be reelected without the requirement of resorting  to provincial conventions was quickly scrapped, after the  proposal created a controversial atmosphere that threatened to  spread to the entire Constituent Assembly. The proposal was  shelved, but not dismissed. Menem, as any other politician, is  aware of the fact that if a weapon is not of any use today, it  will probably be useful tomorrow.    After spirits were calmed with the removal of this proposal,  it did not take long before the governors demanded increased  revenue sharing in the federal tax system.    The first to scream blue murder was Economy Minister Domingo  Cavallo, who believed that his adjustment and stability program  would be seriously jeopardized by the hopes harbored by the  governors, led by a "hardliner" like La Pampa Governor Ruben  Marin. Marin was supported by the Radical Rio Negro Governor  Horacio Massaccesi.    Economy Ministry officials secretly and almost stealthily  contacted prominent Peronist leaders (Alberto Pierri?), asking  them to intercede with the Peronist governors.    Therefore the presence of Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo  Duhalde at the Federal Revenue Sharing Commission, with the goal  of talking with the governors, was not a coincidence.    Although no one explained the reason for Duhalde's visit  last  Tuesday evening, everyone believes that the Buenos Aires  governor -- undoubtedly, the most powerful Constituent Assembly  member -- is attempting to prevent the Peronist governors'  insurgency over the distribution of the tax cake. Duhalde also  has the official title of national Justicialist Party [PJ]  president, which allows him to issue some instructions from the  high command, like the duty of remaining silent so as not to  stir up the constitutional reform's internal atmosphere.    Although a concealment effort is being made, the explicit  order is as follows: "In order to win the upcoming elections,  the economic program must not be touched; if the governors keep  bothering with the tax issue, everything will go to hell..."  <H5>  The Radicals' Roar </H5>   Eduardo Angeloz keeps harping on the need to unify the  presidential elections, without concealing his goal of making  full use of the advantages that he may receive in the run-off or  "ballotage" [preceding word in English] system in the upcoming  elections.    Angeloz's equation is simple: With the "star" governors --  "winners" [preceding word in English] like Tucuman Governor  Ramon Ortega, Santa Fe Governor Carlos Reutemann, and Entre Rios  Governor Mario Moine -- unable to run for reelection, with the  resulting accumulation of votes it is better to compete under a  unified system because the "influence" effect will be minimized.    Menem believes quite the opposite, even though he has  remained silent on this issue.    As the Cordoba governor has not noticed any sign of  solidarity from Alfonsin, he has just talked with Alfonsin in an  attempt to achieve Alfonsin's commitment to pressure the  government to achieve the unification of the elections.    In a nutshell, Alfonsin told Angeloz that the following  political and technical problems exist for the unification of  the elections:     -  Menem's presidential term of office would  have to be extended for six months (from July to December),  which is specifically banned by the current constitution. The  1853 Constitution states: "The president and vice president  will discharge their duties for six years..."    -  The governors'  terms of office would have to be reduced. This would involve  meddling in the autonomous provincial system, paving the way for  another highly dangerous meddling: the direct reelection of the  "winners" or "star" governors.     It is being said that Alfonsin will "not move a single  finger" to promote the unification of the elections unless the  entire UCR leadership specifically asks him to do so through a  document signed and certified, in order to prevent "poor"  memories later.    Alfonsin is actually attempting to have his party understand  that it must not spend any effort on these elections, but wait  for the possibility of achieving alliances or preparing to  regain power by the turn of the century, in 1999.    Thus far, Alfonsin is keeping -- at any price -- the UCR  presidency, a privileged position for reaching agreements and  devising future strategies.</p>

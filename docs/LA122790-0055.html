			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: MENUDOMANIA: CURE FOR THE NEW YEAR'S BLUES  </P> <P> As we usher in the New Year, there's always a good bit of overindulgence.  Parties, festivities, bashes: Call them what you will, 'tis the time for them,  and unfortunately the morning after inevitably follows. In Mexico they call  them paranda -- a night out on the town -- and they have a cure -- menudo.  </P> <P> I first tasted menudo and felt its sobering effects at Al Williams' Papagayo  Room in San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel in the early 1950s. The Papagayo Room  was the place to go in those days after a night on the town. Williams had "the  cure."  </P> <P> Menudo is made from tripe, the lining of the stomach of beef animals, which may  be why it does such a good job of lining ours against the effects of too much  paranda. Tripe needs long soaking before cooking and lots of time over low heat  in the cooking process, but the rewards are well worth the effort.  </P> <P> The best tripe for any dish, and the one Williams recommended for menudo, is  honeycomb tripe. It is the lining of the second stomach of cattle and it  actually looks like a honeycomb. Some tripe is smooth and requires more cooking  time to tenderize.  </P> <P> Tripe has an additional plus -- price. Tripe still qualifies as inexpensive  compared to other cuts of meat. So whether it's for soothing the stomach or the  pocketbook, try tripe.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  I like my tripe still a bit on the chewy side, but it can be cooked longer  until tender, or even mushy, if you prefer.  </P> <P> MENUDO -- SONORA  </P> <P> STYLE  </P> <P> 3 pounds honeycomb tripe  </P> <P> 2 pig's feet  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic, crushed  </P> <P> 2 bay leaves  </P> <P> 1 large onion, diced or sliced thin  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 1 to 2 sprigs mint, optional  </P> <P> 2 jalapeno chiles, optional  </P> <P> 1 large can white hominy, drained  </P> <P> Condiments: dried oregano, chopped onion, lemon wedges, dried chile flakes  </P> <P> Cut tripe in 1-inch squares. Soak in salted water several hours or overnight.  Rinse and drain.  </P> <P> Add tripe to 6 cups boiling salted water in large saucepan. Return to boil.  Reduce heat and skim. Add pig's feet, garlic, bay leaves and onion. Season to  taste with salt and pepper. Add mint and jalapeno chiles, if desired. Cover and  simmer 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until tripe is done to taste.  </P> <P> Remove bay leaves, chiles and mint. Add hominy and simmer 15 minutes longer.  Adjust seasoning to taste. Serve in large bowls with small bowls of condiments.  Makes about 10 servings.  </P> <P>  For those of you who on occasion may have the head, but not the stomach, for  tripe, there is another dish Williams said will serve and soothe as well. It is  pork and hominy stew -- Pozole.  </P> <P> POZOLE  </P> <P> 1 pound pork neck bones  </P> <P> 2 quarts chicken broth  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped onion  </P> <P> 3 or 4 cloves garlic  </P> <P> 3 pounds pork shoulder butt, cut in 1-inch cubes  </P> <P> 6 ounces dried California chiles (about 12 pods) or 6 tablespoons chili powder  </P> <P> 2 cups white hominy  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Condiments: chopped onions, dried oregano, lemon wedges, sliced radishes  </P> <P> Salsa Picante  </P> <P> Shredded lettuce  </P> <P> Combine neck bones with chicken broth, onion and garlic in kettle over medium  heat. Bring to boil. Cover and simmer about 2 hours. Remove neck bones and when  cool enough to handle, cut meat from bones. Return meat to kettle. Add pork  cubes. Cover and continue cooking 45 minutes or until pork is tender.  </P> <P> Remove seeds and veins from dried chiles. Soak in boiling water about 20  minutes. Drain and puree in blender or put through sieve.  </P> <P> Add pureed chiles (or chili powder) and hominy. Season to taste with salt and  pepper. Cook 15 minutes. Adjust seasoning to taste. Serve in bowls, with  condiments. Makes 8 to 10 servings.  </P> <P>  This cold hot sauce is traditional with almost all Mexican food, or as a dip  with tostaditas. It will keep in a jar in the refrigerator for about a week.  </P> <P> Salsa Picante  </P> <P> 3 jalapeno, serrano or waxed green chiles, fresh or canned  </P> <P> 2 tomatoes, diced  </P> <P> 1/2 onion, diced  </P> <P> 1 squeeze lemon juice  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon olive oil  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro  </P> <P> Remove stem ends from chiles. If using fresh jalapenos, remove most of white  seeds and stem ends. (The more seeds and veins left in, the hotter the sauce.  Be sure to wash your hands in cold water immediately after handling chiles.)  </P> <P> Chop chiles fine, scraping all chiles and chile oil off cutting board into  bowl. Add tomatoes, onion, lemon juice and olive oil. Season to taste with salt  and pepper. Chill. Just before serving, sprinkle with chopped cilantro. Makes 6  servings.  </P></p>

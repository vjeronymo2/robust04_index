			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 19, IRNA -- Russian Energy Minister  Yuriy Shafranik has called for expansion of Tehran-Moscow  cooperation in areas of oil and gas.    Speaking to IRNA at the opening ceremony of an international  oil and gas exhibition, Shafranik termed the exhibition as a  short step taken towards cooperation with oil-rich countries and  industrialized world. Shafranik said he was willing to discuss  oil and gas cooperation between Iran and Russia with an Iranian  delegation currently participating in the exhibition.    In his recent talks with Iranian Oil Minister Gholam Reza  Aqazadeh in Ashgabat, the need for mutual ties in the said  fields were stressed, the Russian minister noted.    The prospect for promotion of cooperation between the two  countries depends on Iran's interest in the issue, the Russian  minister said.    Iran's pavilion at the exhibition covers an area of 60  square  meters in which pictures of Iranian oil and gas facilities and  those of operations regarding capping of blazing oil fields and  laying pipe lines by Iranian experts are put on display.    Over 200 government and non-governmental companies from 30  countries are present at the exhibit.</p>

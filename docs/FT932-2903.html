			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kemper says brokerage is no longer for sale KEMPER, the Chicago-based insurance and financial services company, yesterday said its beleaguered Kemper Securities brokerage unit was no longer for sale after it failed to receive an adequate offer for it. 'The offers simply didn't reflect the value inherent in this company and its long-term prospects,' said Mr Stephen Timbers, Kemper's chief operating officer. Kemper Securities has long been considered a thorn in its parent's side. Although the unit's performance improved in the 1993 first quarter, it has lost more than Dollars 200m since 1982, with a deficit last year of Dollars 38.4m when many other brokerage houses posted record profits. On May 27, Kemper said it was reviewing several expressions of interest from parties considering acquiring Kemper Securities. Kemper did not reveal specific plans for the securities division, but said it would make a significant commitment to the business and added that it would position the business to allows its management 'to demonstrate better the operating performance of the unit'.</p>

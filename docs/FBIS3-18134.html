			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "J.L.": "Increase in Export Surplus"] </F>   [Text] Frankfurt, 22 Feb -- The surplus in German exports  increased strongly again last year. According to the Federal  Statistical Office, the positive balance amounted to 59.4  billion German marks [DM] (1992: DM33.7 billion). This was due  to the fact that imports dropped more strongly than exports.  While exports decreased by 10.1 percent to DM603.5 billion,  imports went down 14.7 percent to a level of DM544.1 billion.  As a result of deficits in the sphere of services and  transfers, the export surplus was transformed in a deficit of  DM36 billion (DM39.4 billion) in the balance of payments on  current account. In December, the export surplus reached DM8.5  billion (DM0.4 billion), while the deficit in the balance of  payments on current account was DM0.8 billion (DM4.9 billion).  Compared to November, exports increased by 4.2 percent to a  level of DM56.4 billion, thus being 2.2 percent higher than the  December 1992 level. Imports were up 2.8 percent on the  previous month, reaching a level of DM47.9 billion, thus  remaining 12.5 percent below the level of the end of 1992.</p>

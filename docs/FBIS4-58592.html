			<p>BFN     [Text] The House of Representatives met this morning in a  session chaired by Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar.  The house reviewed and approved the minutes of the previous  session. The people's representatives resumed their discussions  of the contents of the report of the House of Representatives'  committee in charge of investigating the incidents in the 'Imran  region.    During the discussions, the representatives stressed that it  is important for the House of Representatives to adopt a serious  and responsible position on developments in the country. This  is because the current situation requires the House to issue  sound decisions that are free of leniency and placation. It was  stressed that the Armed and Security Forces should stand  alongside Constitutional legitimacy, seek to spare Yemeni blood,  withdraw military forces and units stationed in what used to be  called the border areas before unity between North and South  Yemen was established, and transfer these units so they can  undertake the duties of defending national sovereignty and  protecting vital targets.    The people's representatives applauded the appeal issued by  the chairmanship of the House of Representatives on 3 May to all  personnel, noncommissioned officers, and officers of the Armed  and Security Forces throughout all camps and positions in the  Republic of Yemen. In the statement, the chairmanship noted the  need to show wisdom and self-restraint and to reject any  conspiracy calling for infighting.    The session lasted for four hours. The House of  Representatives will resume its session tomorrow morning.</p>

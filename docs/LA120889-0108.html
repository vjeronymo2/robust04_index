			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST BLOC IN TURMOIL;  </P> <P> LIFE HECTIC FOR U.S. EXPERTS ON EAST BLOC;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: THE UPHEAVAL HAS BROUGHT A BUREAUCRATIC BACKWATER INTO THE  SPOTLIGHT.  </P> <P> Their once-measured pace of work has accelerated to a nonstop, 12-hour-a-day  clip. The White House, which earlier seemed unaware of their existence, now  calls several times a day.  </P> <P> Welcome to the suddenly hectic life in the U.S. government offices watching  events in Eastern Europe -- a longtime bureaucratic backwater that now finds  itself in the eye of history.  </P> <P> At the State Department, the staff expert on Czechoslovakian affairs is  suddenly in demand to talk to members of Congress, reporters and private  citizens. At the Commerce Department, the desk officer for Hungary responds to  30 or more telephone calls a day from American businessmen hoping to make their  fortune in the capitalistic renaissance sweeping Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> In the State Department's Eastern European office, harried diplomats amuse  themselves with office pools on when the next Communist regime will fall.  </P> <P> "The pace of change has been remarkable," said Curtis J. Kamman, the State  Department's top Eastern European expert. "The work load, the flow of paper and  everything else is much heavier, and we have very little additional help. Our  staffing in the department doesn't expand easily."  </P> <P> The department regularly assigns several specialists to desks that monitor  nations where diplomatic activity is extensive and the United States carefully  tends policy interests -- nations like Japan. But in Eastern Europe, it is only  one officer per country. So far, the staff has been able to cope by working  much longer hours, buoyed by the rush of adrenalin that comes from being in the  middle of something big.  </P> <P> "The direction of events is positive," Kamman said. "It is easier to react to  positive events than when the situation is deteriorating."  </P> <P> Kamman's deputy, James Hooper, said: "The thing you are doing (now) is not the  usual bureaucratic crap. You can see the connection between what you are doing  and a larger purpose."  </P> <P> For years, the State Department and Commerce Department desks that follow  events in the Communist-ruled nations of Eastern Europe were overshadowed by  the more glamorous offices watching the Soviet Union -- much in the same way as  Moscow dominated its satellites. It was a static job that appealed mostly to  people with a strong academic or personal interest in a region where 1,000  years of history seemed to be submerged in a bog of stagnation. The Bible of  the government bureaucrat -- a detailed job description known as the "work  requirement statement" -- seemed to go for years without significant revision.  </P> <P> No longer.  </P> <P> "Things are changing so fast that the work requirement statements are going  straight from the typewriter to the shredder," Hooper said. "You go out of the  office for lunch and when you get back another government has fallen."  </P> <P> Hooper's job always has required him to meet frequently with diplomats from  East European countries. That hasn't changed, but the East European diplomats  have.  </P> <P> "They have real smiles on their faces," Hooper said. "They are more inclined to  use our first names instead of the stilted formality they used to use. One of  the bloc ambassadors is returning to sender any letter addressed 'Dear  Comrade.' "  </P> <P> At the Commerce Department, officials are swamped with requests for information  on how to do business in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "We used to get eight to 10 calls a day; now it is 30 to 40, and if there is  something in the newspaper about Hungary, we can get 60 or 70 calls that day,"  said Russell Johnson, the Commerce desk officer for that nation. "Some people  come to us with basically no knowledge whatsoever. With some you have to start  out right from the beginning and explain that these are non-market economies  with non-convertible currencies.  </P> <P> "The calls run the gamut from people who are knitting lace doilies on the side  and want to sell them to Hungary to Fortune 500 companies that want to set up  joint ventures," Johnson said.  </P> <P> Often, he said, his job consists of trying to dissuade naive capitalists from  plunging into the turbulent Eastern Europe market.  </P> <P> "It is true that smaller companies find it more difficult to work in these  countries, and we try to be up front about it," Johnson said.  </P> <P> At the State Department, some career diplomats have been grumbling that  Secretary of State James A. Baker III and his close circle of advisers run  foreign policy by themselves, without the help of the department's  professionals. But the Eastern Europe specialists have no such complaints.  </P> <P> When the pace of events caught the attention of the upper levels of the State  Department and the White House, the Eastern European specialists found that  they, almost alone in the government, knew the names, places and issues that  were shaping a revolution.  </P> <P> "No one can concentrate on everything at once," said Cameron Munter, the State  Department's desk officer for Czechoslovakia. "Both the Seventh Floor (the  State Department's top officials) and the White House have had a number of  other things to look at. Now that they are confronted with a situation that we  know about, we find that what we know is in more demand."  </P> <P> In theory, the State Department's country desks collect and analyze the most  accurate factual information they can obtain. It is up to higher-ranking  officials to put the political spin on the facts. Sometimes, when conditions do  not change very much from day to day, the desks have little to do.  </P> <P> "If there are a lot of chiefs in the State Department, we are the Indians,"  Munter said. "We are supposed to create the raw product that can be shaped at  higher levels into policy."  </P> <P> These days, Munter and his colleagues on other Eastern European desks arrive at  the department no later than 8 a.m. each day. Their first priority is to  prepare the press statements that will be issued by department spokesman  Margaret Tutwiler or her aides. The statements are supposed to represent the  U.S. government's up-to-the-minute policy concerning global issues. With  reporters' questions about East European developments now numerous, and the  issues in question quite sensitive, drafting the appropriate pronouncements and  getting the necessary high-level clearances often takes hours.  </P> <P> And by the time 10 a.m. arrives in Washington, it is 4 p.m. in Prague, almost  the end of another day that, more likely than not, produced political events  that would have been unthinkable six months ago. Already, the "in" basket on  Munter's desk is piled high with new cables from the embassy in Prague and  other messages.  </P> <P> He said he starts to go through the messages, but the routine is frequently  interrupted by calls from senior State Department officials or from the White  House for background papers needed for urgent meetings.  </P> <P> Some desk officers stay at their posts until 9 p.m. many days to catch up with  the cable traffic. Others take the messages home to read there.  </P> <P> "It is very rare that I have time to think about what it all means," Munter  said. "That is a potential hazard."  </P></p>

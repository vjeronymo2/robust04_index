			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Recent Campaign of Detentions"] </F>   [Text] Israel's rulers did not suffice with instructing  their negotiating delegation in Cairo to show more intransigence  toward the issue of Palestinian detainees and prisoners in  Israeli jails but recently gave their security agencies a free  hand to detain hundreds of Palestinians in the occupied  territories. Meanwhile, they have declared their intention to  continue these detentions under the frequently repeated pretext  of Israeli security.    At a time when the negotiating Palestinian side in Cairo is  insisting on the release of all Palestinian prisoners -- be they  for or against a settlement -- in order to save as much face as  possible and to depict the expected settlement as involving the  entire Palestinian people, Israel's rulers are intent on  embarrassing and blackmailing the Palestinian negotiating side  and showing its weakness. Otherwise, this arbitrary campaign of  detentions, which is liable to accelerate tension in the  occupied territories and not vice versa, would not have been  launched.    If all democratic forces in the Arab homeland, Israel, and  the world are expected to condemn the recent campaign of  detentions, the Palestinian negotiating side is duty bound to  draw from this campaign appropriate lessons, perhaps most  important of which is to stop the slide and deterioration of the  Palestinian negotiating position.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE;  </P> <P> KARLINER RUNS, PASSES OCEAN VIEW TO 30-0 VICTORY  </P> <P> Randy Karliner threw two touchdown passes and ran for one to lead Ocean View  over Fountain Valley, 30-0, in Friday's Sunset League opener at Sheue Field.  </P> <P> Karliner completed a 26-yard scoring pass to Jeff Bush with 8:45 remaining in  the first quarter and a 28-yard touchdown pass to Dennis Eichen in the final  four seconds of the second quarter.  </P> <P> He also scored on an eight-yard run outside right tackle in the final 3:25 of  the first quarter.  </P> <P> Ocean View Coach Howard Isom said this was Karliner's best game. "He has  started to settle down," Isom said. "He is not as pressed as he was earlier in  the season."  </P> <P> Karliner completed 19 passes for 188 yards. He also gained 59 of Ocean View's  134 rushing yards on 10 carries.  </P> <P> Ocean View (1-0, 4-0) dominated the game from the opening kickoff. At halftime,  the Seahawks had netted 303 yards while their defense held Fountain Valley  (0-1, 0-4) to a net total of 95 yards on 14 plays.  </P> <P> "Our defense rose to the occasion. It was our best defensive effort this year,"  Isom said.  </P> <P> Leading 14-0, Ocean View lined up in punt formation with 9:20 left in the  second quarter. Albert Fanoga received the snap and promptly completed a  58-yard scoring pass to Eichen.  </P> <P> After the ensuing kickoff, which went in the end zone, Fountain Valley marched  from its 20 to the Ocean View 12 on nine plays. Two costly penalties, the  latter called for an illegal forward pass by Marcos Diaz that ended the Barons'  possession, stopped the drive. BOB BORSUM  </P></p>

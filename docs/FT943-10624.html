			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Nicotine in cigarettes declared addictive by FDA advisers A US Food and Drug administration advisory panel has concluded that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive, this being the first formal step toward US federal regulation of nicotine as a drug. The eight-member scientific panel, made up of academics from various parts of the country, concluded after a nine-hour debate on Tuesday that all cigarettes on the market are addictive. This was the first official statement by the FDA that nicotine meets its definition of a drug - a substance which affects 'the structure and function of the body.' However, the committee failed to reach a consensus on how much nicotine it takes to make a smoker addicted. Dr David Kessler, the FDA commissioner, called the findings 'enormously important' because they contradict tobacco industry claims that cigarette smoking is 'a free-choice issue.' Dr Kessler has been considering tighter federal regulation of the tobacco industry since February, amid protests from cigarette manufacturers who claim he is waging 'a dangerous crusade' to ban cigarettes and destroy their companies. The commissioner said he does not want prohibition but is increasingly convinced the government must try to stop more teenagers and children from becoming addicted. To regulate cigarettes, the FDA must prove not only that nicotine is addictive but also that companies purposely manipulate chemical levels to make more customers addicted.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / ADB changes loan strategy The Asian Development Bank will link future lending to policy liberalisation that will make the economies of borrowing countries more open, Mr Mitsuo Sato, the new bank president, said yesterday. Mr Sato, who took over from Mr Kimimasa Tarimazu, who retired on November 24, told a press conference that during his term the ADB would encourage more of its member countries to 'shift to greater democratisation, to market-oriented economy, and to greater openness (of their economies) to the outside world'. The Manila-based ADB counts among its members the high-growth 'tiger economies' of east Asia, most of which, however, have been identified with authoritarian governments or protective economic policies. Before his election to the ADB top position, Mr Sato was deputy president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. He is credited with opening up membership of the exchange to foreign groups. He had served previously in Japan's Finance Ministry. Mr Sato stressed, however, that the new strategy would be manifested in 'policy dialogues' with borrowing member countries. It would not be a strict condition similar to those imposed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in their own lending criteria. He said these policy discussions would focus solely on economic matters and 'not in general terms.' While opposition lingers over a capital increase for the ADB, Mr Sato said yesterday he was confident the bank's lending programme for the coming year would not decline as had been feared by some groups. 'We have agreed on the need to raise capital,' he said, although certain 'policy questions' remained to be sorted out. 'There is a clear consensus among board members that an agreement will be reached by the end of the year.' In the first nine months of the year, ADB lending totalled nearly Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn), an increase of 11 per cent from the year before. Equity investments amounted to Dollars 16.4m, up 3 per cent. In the whole of 1992, total lendings reached Dollars 5.1bn, up 6.9 per cent from the previous year, while equity investments and underwriting came to Dollars 15.8m, down 44 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "special report": "What Klaus Actually Said </F> on NOVA Television"]    [Text] On Monday 30 May, NOVA Television recorded its  regular "Why?" program, whose guest was Prime Minister V. Klaus.  As we have reported, NOVA announced via CTK that it would not  broadcast the program with Klaus due to a "technical error." In  fact, this was not due to a "technical error" but because Klaus  reacted acrimoniously to some of the questions from L. Beniak,  and the program, according to RUDE PRAVO's information, was not  aired at the request of the prime minister. The RUDE PRAVO  editorial office has managed to obtain a recording of the  program and, in view of the fact that the whole issue has  meanwhile become politicized, it considers it necessary to  fulfill its obligation to keep the public informed and to  disclose some of the prime minister's replies. The NOVA  management was still insisting yesterday evening, under the  threat of legal action, that RUDE PRAVO not publish anything  from the recording. We are publishing some excerpts that  document the course of the interview.    [Beniak] I asked my friends abroad to send me all of the  newspaper clippings possible in which they write about you. I  found a couple of characteristic features in them: He has the  talent to say terrible things in the most amiable way; he has an  unfortunate aptitude for making enemies of people who support  his policy; and he does not suffer in silence when he has to  deal with people whom he regards as fools, including reporters.  And, there are adjectives such as "virulent," "gruff,"  "hurtful," "contemptuous," "aggressive," and "arrogant." What  affect does this have on you when they write that you are  arrogant? Do you let it pass, or does it annoy you or bother  you? Do you have the nasty feeling that someone does not  understand you?    [Klaus] I think these are only some of the clippings. I  think we could bring in completely different clippings. That  was one tendency in these clippings, and it has become a  definite cliche. I think that, when a reporter does not know  what to write, does not know what to say, has no arguments, and  so on, he resorts to these facile and unidirectional judgments,  when it is not the substance but something superficial that is  being assessed, and I really disagree with this. I do not  believe that this is true.    [Beniak] Nevertheless, you are perhaps the only politician,  or the only politician accessible to us, who, for instance, does  not forgive reporters if they do not ask a question properly.  You are certainly the only one. You immediately feel the need  to point out that it is imprecise. Others react, let us say,  politely, let it pass, and then answer.    [Klaus] We each have some proclivity. I have to admit that  sometimes I chose this one, sometimes another. That I always  correct reporters if it seems to me that the question is wrong,  again I have to say that it would appear otherwise; this is  simply not true. I repeat and I insist that sometimes a person  chooses one technique and strategy and sometimes another.    [Beniak] Karel Hvizdala, when he wrote a book with you in  1992 called First Report, reminded you that, in reply  to a question on what you consider to be your weakness, you once  said: a lack of credence in opinions held by someone else. You  said this on 4 April 1990 in an interview that I recorded with  you and that you authorized. Do you think this was, shall we  say, a slip of the tongue...?    [Klaus] Of course, I cannot, over four years, remember every  single word that I said. I certainly could not have meant this,  I could not have said.... I said that there may be a tendency  toward this, or that there may be in this respect, if I were to  measure it on scales, then I would say in a ratio of 51:49, that  there may be a certain problem. However, there is no question  that this would be an absolute judgment, and I simply do not  think it is.    [Beniak] Sometimes you definitely encounter manifestations  of antagonism--let us say, you are asked questions to which you  reply that their resolution is not within your jurisdiction.  Typical questions: Will you increase the price of something  else? I mean the kind of antagonism in PRACE, for example, when  it published an interview composed of questions readers had sent  to the editorial office--it was very noticeable there. What  affect does this have on you?    [Klaus] You are choosing only negative questions, and now  you are forcing me to go on the defensive. I will not accept  them, Mr. Editor. I do not accept this. The world is not like  this, not at all like this. It is quite different. Another  motif prevails absolutely. I will not accept these questions.  I do not accept them; do not be angry with me. I do not accept  them. Why do you not speak about other issues? Why do you  choose one random interview? Why do you interpret this  interview in this way? The world is simply not like this. It  is not a view of the world that I accept exists like this.    [Beniak] I am unable, in the course of 20 minutes, to ask  questions from which it is possible to put together...    [Klaus] You are the one who is asking that we do something  like this... I am not desirous of it.    [Beniak] I have spent several days reading your interviews  and books...    [Klaus] Something else is paramount, right?    [Beniak] I am trying to ask questions that you are not  normally asked or that you evidently do not like to answer...    [Klaus] They are asked constantly, these questions. If the  day before yesterday I had a one-hour interview on Radio  Frekvence 1, the questions were about nothing other than this.  I simply do not understand where these questions can lead, how  it is possible to answer them. I cannot imagine this at all.    [Beniak] I am saying--and you know this from sports--that a  person reveals himself most when he is under pressure, when he  has to respond to something that is unpleasant for him.    [Klaus] Then, the only possibility is if he accepts this  pressure, if this pressure is fair, if this pressure is correct  or incorrect.    [Beniak] Do you think my questions are unfair?    [Klaus] No; the issue does not involve fairness. I am  surprised by their selection, by their range. I do not  understand where it can lead and where it is leading. You had  better ask; this is probably a waste of time for your viewers.    [Beniak] What kind of leader of the opposition would you be?    [Klaus] What kind of question is that? What do you want to  say? If we are ever in opposition, then, undoubtedly, we will  act somehow.    [Beniak] What kind of opposition would it be--good, bad?    [Klaus] What could the answer possibly be to that question,  an answer that would satisfy you a little, at least a little? I  could now start asking you questions and you would be under  pressure. It does not seem to me that these questions add  anything; they lead to an opening being created for something,  they lead to a possible answer, they lead to a situation in  which a person could somehow reveal something that is not known  about him. I do not believe this, I simply....</p>

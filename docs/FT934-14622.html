			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Quadrant back in the black SHARES IN Quadrant Group jumped 7p to 39p after the photographic and video equipment company reported strong progress towards recovery with a return to the black in the half year to August 31. Operating losses on continuing activities were cut by 82 per cent, from Pounds 1.49m to Pounds 263,000. After exceptional credits of Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 11.3m debits) and interest, the pre-tax profit came through at Pounds 1.02m, against a Pounds 12.5m deficit before. Lord Rees, chairman, said he expected a further improvement in operating results in the second half. The successful disposal of the lossmaking estate agency photoprocessing activities generated an exceptional profit of Pounds 861,000, while the re-negotiation of the deferred consideration for the disposal of its shipping activity resulted in an additional Pounds 470,000 credit above the line. Lord Rees said Sangers and Leeds - the distributors of photographic and other imaging products - had returned to profit. He added that Quadrant Video had stabilised under new management after a poor second half last year. Further losses had been incurred in the period, but a much improved second half was expected. Turnover dropped to Pounds 22.9m (Pounds 28.8m), of which Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 25.2m) related to continuing activities. Earnings per share were 4.36p, against 45.47p losses. There is again no interim dividend.</p>

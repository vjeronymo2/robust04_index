			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOYCOTT SOUTH AFRICA  </P> <P> I was keenly disappointed to see the headline, "Native Crafts Are Reason for  South African Visit," (Dec. 24). There is no good reason for a South Africa  visit in today's political climate, and Times staff writer Norman Dash has  shown a lack of sensitivity to the struggle against apartheid by giving such  prominent display to a trip which is being boycotted by all those who oppose  this racist regime.  </P> <P> WILLIAM G.

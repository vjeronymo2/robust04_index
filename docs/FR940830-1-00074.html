Overall Proposal and Rationale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In light of the number of fatalities that are occurring as a result of back door ejections, NHTSA has decided to propose extending and expanding Standard No. 206's side door requirements to the back doors of passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles (MPVs) with a GVWR of 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) or less, including hatchbacks, station wagons, sport utility vehicles, and passenger vans. Given the differences between side doors and back doors in the orientation of their hinges and latches in relation to the vehicle, the agency is proposing modifications to the test requirements/procedures to make them appropriate for back doors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has previously concluded that Standard No. 206's requirements have been effective in reducing side door ejections. In November 1989, the agency published ``An Evaluation of Door Locks and Roof Crush Resistance of Passenger Cars_Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 206 and 216 (DOT HS 806 489).'' The study concluded that door latch improvements in passenger cars implemented during 1963&hyph;68 save an estimated 400 lives per year, reducing the risk of ejection in rollover crashes by 15 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA believes that extending the existing requirements of Standard No. 206 to back doors would make an additional contribution toward reducing injuries and perhaps fatalities caused by back door ejections. The agency recognizes that the increased use of seat belts is also an effective means of addressing this problem. However, despite continuing efforts by NHTSA, state and local governments, safety organizations, manufacturers and others to promote safety belt use, fatalities resulting from the ejection of unbelted occupants remain a serious safety problem. Therefore, while the agency recognizes the importance of continuing efforts to increase safety belt use, it now believes that an extension and expansion of Standard No. 206's requirements to back doors is appropriate as well. The agency also believes that, given the increasing popularity of vehicles with back doors, especially vans, this safety problem may become more serious unless action is taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA also notes that the agency is in the process of conducting additional research examining the potential for improving vehicle latch performance. While that research may lead to a future upgrade of Standard No. 206, the agency does not believe it should delay the application of the standard's existing and/or modified requirements to back doors in the interim. The agency believes that the back door ejection problem warrants immediate attention. Compliance should not present any significant problems since the manufacturers are familiar with the design changes needed, as they apply to back door latches to meet Standard No. 206's current requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the differences between side doors and back doors, NHTSA believes that some minor modifications in Standard No. 206's test requirements and procedures are needed for back doors. Of particular note are the differences in the orientation of hinges and latches in relation to the vehicle and in the variety of designs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The difference in orientation is significant because the requirements and procedures specified for longitudinal loading of latches and hinges differ from those specified for transverse loading of those components. If all back doors were just like side doors except for their location on the back of the vehicle, the longitudinal and transverse directions of the loading would simply be reversed with respect to the latches and hinges of back doors. However, all back doors are not just like side doors, thus the establishment of appropriate test requirements and procedures for these doors is somewhat more complicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is considerably greater variety in the design of rear doors than side doors. Side doors almost always open to the side and most have hinges on their front edges and latches on their rear edges. Rear doors may open upward, downward or sideways, and have latches and hinges on the top, bottom or side. Moreover, while side doors are generally vertical, when viewed in a front or back view, rear doors may be vertical or sloped (as in the case of many hatchbacks), when viewed in a side view.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

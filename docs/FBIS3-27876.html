The National Space  Development Agency (NASDA) originally scheduled the launch for  Monday, but postponed it because of bad weather.    NASDA officials said the rocket would lift off between 7 AM  and 9 AM from the Tanegashima Space Center on Tanegashima  island, off the southernmost main island of Kyushu.    The 50-meter, two-stage vehicle is the first space rocket  developed autonomously with Japanese space technology. It is  capable of sending a two-ton payload into geostationary orbit.    The H-2 rocket will carry a vehicle evaluation payload  satellite, which will confirm the launch performance of the H-2  as well as its compatibility with the new range of facilities at  Tanegashima.    It will also carry an experimental vehicle called the  orbital  reentry experiment, which is part of a program to prepare a  Japanese space shuttle called Hope to be launched around 2005.</p>

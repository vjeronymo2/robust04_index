			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWYERS AND TRUSTS  </P> <P> Attorney Bruss unfortunately was misleading in one important respect.  </P> <P> In the article, the reader was advised to "hold title in joint tenancy with  right of survivorship." While this may be preferable in most cases to holding  title to a home or other real estate as separate property in the name of the  husband or wife alone, it is usually recommended that a husband and wife take  title to property as community property, rather than as joint tenants.  </P> <P> The article also failed to mention one of the biggest advantages of a living  trust, the ability to reduce or eliminate estate taxes.  </P> <P> STEPHEN C. CLARK  </P> <P> San Diego  </P> <P>  Clark is an attorney.  </P> <P>  Robert J. Bruss replies: Attorney Stephen Clark is probably unaware of IRS  Revenue Ruling 87-98, which states that even if the title is held in joint  tenancy, if the joint tenants acknowledge in writing that the property is  community property, then the IRS will give it a new basis stepped up to market  value on the date of the first spouse's death. Contrary to popular belief, the  revenue ruling says that in community property states, it is no longer  neccessary to hold title as community property, if the joint tenants have  acknowledged in writing that their realty is community property.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: KeyCorp laughs all the way to the bank - The 'bar-bell' expansion which defied conventional wisdom CRAZY. That was the verdict Wall Street delivered in the mid-1980s on Mr Victor Riley, chief executive of KeyCorp, then a modest-sized bank in up-state New York, when he began snapping up banks in Alaska, Oregon and Washington. The deals defied conventional wisdom that US banks should acquire others in their own or neighbouring regions. The pundits said KeyCorp would find it very hard to manage a business with two entirely separate clusters of operation in the extreme north-east of the US and the extreme north-west. Eight years on, however, it is Mr Riley who is laughing. So, too, may be KeyCorp's long-time British institutional investors who, he says, supported his bold move into the Pacific north-west 'when Wall Street was calling us lunatic. 'Many of the Scottish folks told us: 'Right on, you're doing the right thing,' ' he recalls with a chuckle. For a rapid succession of well-priced, strategically bold takeovers has given KeyCorp operations in eight northern states and a reputation as one of the more adept US 'super-regional' banks at profiting from the wave of consolidation sweeping through the American industry. From its base in Albany, New York, it has lifted assets from just Dollars 3bn in 1982 to around Dollars 32bn - a figure which includes the completion in January of one of its most important acquisitions yet  - Washington state's Dollars 4.8bn-asset Puget Sound Bancorp. It recently unveiled plans to build up assets to around Dollars 50bn by 1995-1997, while increasing earnings per share 13 per cent a year and improving its return on equity from 16.48 per cent to 17 per cent. Details will be spelt out for European investors next week when Mr Riley embarks on an annual tour of the region's financial centres. A big, broad-shouldered man of 61, with an infectious laugh, he took over as chief executive in 1973, which makes him the longest-serving leader of a leading US bank. He spends some 50 per cent of his time on the road, visiting branches of KeyCorp's far-flung empire or giving presentations issues in small, rural towns. His unusual working schedule reflects what makes KeyCorp distinct from its rivals: It is the only regional bank with branches on both sides of the US, with roughly 50 per cent of assets in the Pacific north-west and Rocky Mountain states and the remainder in the north-east. This has been dubbed a 'bar-bells' strategy, since the bank has no presence in the middle of the country. It concentrates on predominantly small town and rural markets, with branches in such obscure corners of the US as Eagle River, Alaska, Big Piney, Wyoming, and Caribou, Maine. And it has remained very much a community bank, with lending decisions taken by local officers. All this helped keep KeyCorp growing strongly in the early 1990s, when many US banks stumbled because of regional recession or serious exposure to a collapsing commercial property market. Its geographical diversity has been a source of strength, for while the north-eastern economy has been through a severe downturn, the Pacific north-west was - at least until recently - one of the fastest-growing regions of the US. Banking margins in rural America are high, while KeyCorp's conservative lending practices mean its ratio of non-performing assets to loans and repossessed real estate is a very low 1.80 per cent. But what can KeyCorp do for an encore - particularly when the interest rate cycle seems to be turning against the banking industry, trimming the easy profits earned by the sector over the past year, and when growth in loan volume is likely to be sluggish? Its five-year plan has three elements. First, to broaden and improve its banking services, and make their delivery more efficient. In the past KeyCorp had a relatively high ratio of overheads to revenue  - in part because of its geographical spread - but it has driven this down from around 72 per cent five years ago to around 62 per cent, just below its peer group average, and the aim is to cut it to 57 per cent. Technology will be an important factor here. KeyCorp has recently completed the installation of a sophisticated computer network linking every bank-teller. 'We can tell you at the end of every day the loans that have been put out on our system,' says Mr Riley. The bank is now moving into electronic imaging for cheque processing and hopes to sell this service to other businesses which involve a lot of paperwork. Technology is meant to play an important role in the bank's second objective  -to boost its fee-based income from services such as mortgage banking (where it is already a substantial player, with a portfolio of over Dollars 20bn), insurance and trust services. Bank-tellers will be encouraged to cross-sell these other products - and earn commission doing so - by using their computer terminals. The third objective is to keep up KeyCorp's acquisitions, which Mr Riley thinks could account for about one third of its earnings growth over the next few years. The emphasis, says Mr Bill Dougherty, the chief financial officer, will be on filling in gaps in the states it serves, together with moves into contiguous ones 'provided we can get a major market share.' There are risks, perhaps reflected in the fact that Wall Street has kept KeyCorp's P/E ratio below the best in its peer group. The economy of the Pacific north-west is slowing as aerospace recession hits Seattle-based Boeing. But KeyCorp argues that Boeing is not the crucial factor in the regional economy it once was, and it points out that states like Utah and Idaho are booming. Second, the bank could make a poor acquisition - although its shrewd record to date suggests the contrary. Third, the leadership could change: Mr Dougherty will probably retire in 1994 and Mr Riley could quit the following year, although he will only say: 'The day that I'm just not excited getting up and coming in to work is the day I'm going to tell the board I'm ready to retire.' Judging by his busy European schedule, that is still a long way off.</p>

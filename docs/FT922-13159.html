			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Getting your own back on VAT - In a Nutshell Businessmen and women can, in theory, reclaim the Value Added Tax (VAT) they pay on expenses incurred during trips abroad. In practice the amounts are often too small and the red tape too complex to make it worthwhile to pursue. VAT rules and rates differ from country to country in Europe with VAT reclaimable, for example, on the cost of car hire in Belgium, but not recoverable in Eire or Greece. The VAT Clearing House says it offers a VAT recovery service which will allow business travellers in Europe to reclaim VAT paid on items such as hotel bills, meals, car hire, conferences and exhibitions. It charges 12.5 per cent of the VAT recovered regardless of the size of the claim. VAT Clearing House, 80 Ebury Street, London SW1W 9QD. Tel 071 730 8705.</p>

Polyethylene catheters were inserted into each rat's  left ventricle through its right carotid artery. The coronary  vessels of seven rats were embolized for a length of 15 m by  radioactive microspheres injected into the cavity of the left  ventricle during occlusion of the ascending aorta. The seven  control rats were subjected to pseudo-operations, during which  they were subjected to the same procedures performed on the rats  in the experimental group. During the occlusion procedure,  however, they received a physiological solution instead of the  microspheres. Twenty-one days later the rats that had been  implanted with catheters in their left ventricle, femoral  artery, and jugular vein 1 day before the experiment began were  selected for testing. Indicators of the rats' general and  regional hemodynamics in response to intravenous ouabain  infusion (in a dose of 0.4 mg/kg for 1 minute at a constant rate  of 26 m/min for 3 minutes) were studied while the rats were  wide awake. At the conclusion of the tests the rats were killed  with a large dose of nembutal, their organs removed and tissues  weighed, and the amount of microspheres trapped in them and the  amount of microspheres in blood samples from each rat  determined. When compared with the controls, the rats whose  coronary arteries had been embolized manifested higher  end-diastolic pressure and peripheral resistance and a decrease  in cardiac output and heart rate. These changes were accompanied  by a statistically significant decrease in blood flow in the  skin, muscles, brain, small intestine, kidneys, adrenal glands,  and diaphragm. In the control animals, ouabain infusion induced  an increase in aortal pressure, end-diastolic pressure, and  general peripheral resistance and a decrease in heart rate but  no statistically significant changes in their regional  hemodynamics. In the embolized rats, ouabain infusion resulted  in an increase in aortal pressure, cardiac output, and  myocardial contractility and in a decrease in end-diastolic  pressure. Significant increases in blood flow in the embolized  rats' skin, brain, small intestine, lungs, liver, kidneys, and  diaphragm and a decrease in vascular resistance in their lungs  and diaphragm were also observed. The heart rate increased in  five of the embolized rats and decreased in the other two. Of  the total amount of microspheres injected into the rats, 34 +/-  8 percent (i.e., 106,278 +/- 23,720/g) ended up in the heart as  a whole. These findings confirmed that 21 days after  embolization, rats with symptoms of cardiac insufficiency (heart  failure) induced by embolization of their coronary vessels are  more sensitive to the glycoside ouabain than are rats with no  symptoms of heart failure and that coronary vessel-embolized  rats may therefore serve as suitable models for studying the  status of a cardiovascular system with evolving heart failure.

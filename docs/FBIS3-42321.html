			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Ankara -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'  this weekend assured Ankara that his country has clamped down on  the activities of Turkey's Kurdish separatists and will not  allow any terrorist leaders to shelter in its territories, his  Turkish counterpart Hikmet Cetin said on Sunday (6 February).    Cetin told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that the Syrian Foreign  Minister also indicated that Damascus was in touch with Lebanon  on this issue.    "Minister al-Shar' unequivocally said that they are not  supporting the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party)," Cetin said. "He  added that they would never allow their territories to be used  by the separatists."    The Turkish Foreign Minister said his Syrian counterpart had  even proposed to increase cooperation between the security  organizations of both countries and organize more frequent  meetings.    Developments in neighboring Iraq, Kurdish activities and  regional waters were the highlights of a tripartite summit held  in Istanbul on Saturday between the foreign ministers of Turkey,  Syria and Iran.    The meeting resulted in a declaration of support for the  continuation of Iraqi sovereignty, a mutual condemnation of  terrorism, and a Turkish rejection of Syrian efforts for a  water-use agreement for the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Syria  said a formal agreement on the rivers, which al-Shar' described  as "international waters," was needed to avoid escalating the  dispute.    "But I explained how sensitive Turkish public opinion was  with regard to terrorist activities, and the impressions that  are imbedded in Turkish public opinion about Syria in this  context," Cetin said.    In his talks with al-Shar', the Turkish Foreign Minister  suggested that doing away with this impression was one of the  conditions for a better dialogue between the two countries,  including on the subject of "regional waters."    Cetin and al-Shar' met for talks on Friday when the Syrian  foreign minister arrived in Turkey. They also met immediately  after Saturday's three-way talks.    The assurances al-Shar' gave Cetin in bilateral talks were  in  line with remarks he made during a press conference on Saturday.  He said Syria did not support "any acts which violated the  sovereignty of Turkey," and strongly denied allegations that  Damascus was supporting PKK terrorism.    Diplomatic sources noted that al-Shar' appeared to be  sincere  in his remarks related to Ocalan, the PKK and terrorism, and  that Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati and his  delegation had also approached Turkey in friendly fashion.  Cetin said he had observed "an atmosphere of understanding" on  the Iranian side and repeated that Turkey would cooperate to  "heal the wounds" that had arisen from the adverse effects of a  recent Turkish air operation in northern Iraq during which nine  Iranians were killed.    The tripartite summit and the change in atmosphere observed  in Istanbul, said one official, who asked not to be identified,  indicated a change in attitude by both countries, and implied  that there could be better cooperation between the three  capitals in the future on the subject of combating the PKK.  Turkish officials believe al-Shar's "guarantee" to Ankara is  highly significant, but added that this indicates that a change  in tactics and alliances by the PKK should also be expected.  Equally important is the noteworthy attitude of Iran over the  January 28 air raid by Turkey on a major PKK training base in  northern Iraq, they say.    Although nine Iranians were killed and a further 19 were  wounded in the air raids -- reportedly due to shrapnel from a  bomb which exploded in mid-air -- the official Iranian reaction  was next to nothing.    Turkey now expects both countries to give more concrete  assurances to Ankara, and wants promises made concerning the  fight against terrorism to be kept.

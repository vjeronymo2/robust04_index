			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Anti-abortion lawyer Cyrus Zal appeared at San Diego County Jail Friday  prepared to start serving his sentence for contempt, but jail officials did not  have the proper paperwork to admit him.  </P> <P> Zal, 42, a Folsom-based lawyer who was cited for contempt 20 times during a  trial last February by El Cajon Municipal Judge Larrie R. Brainard after being  warned not to discuss abortion, had yet to be admitted to County Jail by 8 p.m.  Saturday night, said a jail official.  </P> <P> Zal was to serve a 290-day sentence for bringing up abortion during the trial  of six abortion foes accused of trespassing at a La Mesa clinic Oct. 21. The  six were convicted.  </P> <P> Zal, former general counsel for the militant anti-abortion group Operation  Rescue, has said that he would "gladly" serve the sentence to bring attention  to the issue of abortion.  </P> <P> In July, the California Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Zal.  </P></p>

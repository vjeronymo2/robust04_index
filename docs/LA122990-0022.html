			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> STOCK PRICES IN TOKYO CLOSE OUT '90 ON DOWNSIDE  </P> <P> Tokyo stock prices ended 1990 with a whimper, closing lower on bearish  expectations of another bad year.  </P> <P> "The realization that this year was a bad one all came out in the end," said  Masahiko Tsuyuzaki, trader at Tachibana Securities Co.  </P> <P> Initial buying during Friday's half-day session sent the Nikkei index briefly  over key support at 24,000 points. But selling emerged on expectations that  1991 is unlikely to see much recovery from 1990's declines, brokers said.  </P> <P> The key 225-share Nikkei index lost 91.99 points, or 0.38%, to 23,848.71. The  market closed for the day after the morning session. It will reopen for another  half-day session Jan. 4 before normal trading resumes Jan. 7.  </P> <P> Turnover was a light 180 million shares, against 150 million in the morning and  330 million all day Thursday. Declining issues led advancers by two to one.  </P> <P> In 1990, the Nikkei fell 15,067.16 points, or 38.7%. Friday's close contrasts  sharply with 1989, when the Nikkei closed the year at a record 38,915.87, up  29% on the year. The last time the index closed lower the last day of the year  was in 1986.  </P> <P> "This was the Nikkei's biggest yearly percentage drop since World War II, said  Kunio Urakami, senior adviser at Nikko Securities Investment Trust &amp;  Management Co.  </P> <P> "There aren't any bright factors in 1991 either," he said.  </P> <P> In Hong Kong, stocks slipped in a very quiet day characterized by a marked  absence of enthusiasm in the trough between two holidays, brokers said.  </P> <P> "Many people are still on holiday and trading is not likely to pick up until  after the New Year," said a local broker.  </P></p>

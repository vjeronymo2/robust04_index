			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Bosnian Serb and Moslem leaders hold first meeting THE LEADERS of Bosnia's two main warring factions, the Serbs and Moslems, yesterday held face-to-face talks for the first time since the outbreak of the conflict last April, in what appeared to be an unusually constructive effort to overcome disagreements on new international peace proposals. The meeting in Geneva between Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, took place on the margin of a conference between the political and military leaders of all three of the main communities. The conference is chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, international mediators on former Yugoslavia. It came as US president George Bush promised French president Francois Mitterrand that the US would take no unilateral action that could endanger French or other foreign troops in Bosnia, during a two-hour talk in Paris in which the two men agreed to await the conclusion of the peace talks in Geneva. 'We are very sensitive to the fact that other countries have troops on the ground and we would not precipitously on a unilateral basis do anything that would put these troops in danger,' Mr Bush told a press conference. France has nearly 5,000 peacekeeping troops serving under United Nations auspices in Bosnia. Mr Bush's reassurance followed a warning yesterday by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, that the 2,400 British troops in Bosnia would either be given greater protection or be withdrawn from the region if they were at serious risk. The two presidents said they were 'very close' in agreeing that the recent UN resolution banning military flights by Serb aircraft over Bosnia must be enforced, but they would await the outcome of the peace talks before taking further diplomatic action in the UN Security Council. Arriving from Moscow yesterday, Mr Bush reported that Security Council action to enforce its no-fly resolution had the backing of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Mr Major said in an interview on BBC television that the British forces 'are not there as fighting troops and if I thought they were in danger I would have to protect them or have to bring them home'. He said he thought there would be some limited success in the peace talks in Geneva. Billed as a last-ditch effort to avert international military intervention in Bosnia, the Geneva meeting has been taking place in an unexpectedly restrained and positive atmosphere, according to the two co-chairmen. Mr Vance, who has been chairing a working group of political leaders, described the discussions over the past two days as 'very serious and very thoughtful'. Lord Owen, who has been overseeing a working group of military chiefs to work out ceasefire and troop withdrawal arrangements, said: 'The tone has been good and the substance important.' That was a remarkable development, given that only a few days ago the participants 'were still knocking hell out of each other'. But Mr Izetbegovic has sharply criticised the co-chairmen's plan, which proposes the creation of 10 largely autonomous provinces within Bosnia-Hercegovina. The plan ensures that the three main groups (the third being the Croats) would each dominate three of the new provinces, while Sarajevo would remain a 'mixed' province and its capital city would become an 'open city' and be completely demilitarised. However, the three provinces assigned to the Serbs would represent nearly half the territory of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Plan for Bosnia stirs disputes Page 12</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: American Express plans to relaunch Optima card AMERICAN Express yesterday said it planned to relaunch its troubled Optima credit card, the loss-making business that suffered heavy credit loss provisions last year. The relaunch involves tightening the criteria for new card-holders and creating a three-tiered pricing structure that rewards the best customers with a low interest rate. Optima, which was launched in 1987 and has more than 3m cardholders, suffered 1991 losses that are estimated by analysts at around Dollars 150m. Last November, American Express named Mr Frank Skillern to take over the Optima business, following a Dollars 155m third-quarter charge related to Optima losses from consumer delinquencies. Mr Skillern yesterday said the new tiered pricing structure would be accompanied by a move to deploy more resources that focus on potential delinquencies earlier in the credit process. More than 50 per cent of the Dollars 697m pre-tax increase in 1991 credit loss provisions at American Express's Travel Related Services (TRS) division is believed to have come from the Optima business. Optima, operated through the Delaware-based Centurion Bank, is not expected by American Express to return to profitability until 1994. The new pricing structure, which will only be available in the US, will offer the lowest interest rate - 12.50 per cent - for cardholders who have at least one year's tenure, have made no late payments over the past 12 months, and spend at least Dollars 1,000 annually with Optima. Cardholders who have not been in good standing will pay a rate of 18.75 per cent, while a middle-tier rate of 14.75 per cent will be charged to card-holders who have been in good standing but do not meet other requirements.</p>

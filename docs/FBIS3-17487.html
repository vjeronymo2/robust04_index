			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "United States-Kazakhstan: Caspian Oil </F> Pipeline"]    [Text] Kadyr Baykenov, Kazakhstani minister of energy and  fuel resources, stated this week that Kazakhstan had agreed to  all the terms of the proposed oil transportation agreement  between the Caspian Oil Consortium and the "Tengiz-Chevroil"  company.    The agreement, an ITAR-TASS correspondent reports from New  York, envisages allowing Kazakhstan to export crude oil lifted  from the Tengiz and Korolevskoye Fields. Moreover, given the  very limited throughput of Russian pipelines, Kazakhstan  considers it expedient to rapidly complete the construction of  pipelines for the Caspian Oil Consortium. This decision was  confirmed at meetings in London with representatives of the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD], which,  as expected, will be financing part of the project to build the  Caspian oil pipeline. Kazakhstan and Russia are shareholders in  the EBRD.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Bic's US unit slips into deficit BIC, the French consumer products company best-known for its ballpoint pens and disposable razors, yesterday announced that its US subsidiary fell into the red in the first quarter of this year with a loss of Dollars 700,000 against a Dollars 7.9m net profit a year ago. The US company has been hit by the exceptional cost of adapting to the new regulations on accounting for pension and medical insurance contributions for its employees. This change, all of which was absorbed in the first-quarter figures, cost the company Dollars 9.8m, thereby pulling it into deficit during the first three months of the year. Without the change in accounting regulations Bic's US subsidiary would have been in the black during the first quarter. Its turnover rose by 15 per cent to Dollars 101.2m in the first three months of 1993 from Dollars 88.1m in 1992. Net profits rose by 15 per cent to Dollars 9.1m from Dollars 7.9m.</p>

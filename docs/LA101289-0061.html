			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Paramount Pictures has a stake in the upcoming Broadway musical "The Grand  Hotel," due to open Nov. 12 at the Martin Beck Theater. Paramount, which is  co-producing the show with Martin Richards and Mary Lea Johnson of the Producer  Circle, views the endeavor as "an opportunity . . . to further nourish a vital  American art form, the musical theater." Last season, Paramount co-financed the  Broadway play "Shirley Valentine," for which Pauline Collins won the Tony Award  as best actress and in which she stars in the current Paramount film version.

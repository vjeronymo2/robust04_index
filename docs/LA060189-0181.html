			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> USAIR CUTS ORANGE COUNTY-SACRAMENTO FARES  </P> <P> USAir said Wednesday that it has slashed unrestricted one-way fares between  Sacramento and four Southern California destinations including the county's  John Wayne Airport -- to $129 from $189.  </P> <P> The move came just days after American Airlines said it would cancel its  nonstop flights from John Wayne to the state capital on July 1.  </P> <P> Although the fare reductions appeared in part to be a bid to woo Orange  County-to-Sacramento commuters away from American even before the nonstop  service is eliminated, the cuts also apply to USAir flights to Sacramento from  Los Angeles, Burbank and San Diego.  </P> <P> Virginia-based USAir said it has also cut its fare for advance-purchase,  seven-day, round-trip tickets between Sacramento and the four Southland  airports to $128 and has added a new one-day, advance-purchase, round-trip  ticket on the same routes for $148.  </P> <P> A spokesman for American Airlines said the Dallas-based company is studying the  USAir fares and will probably match them.  </P> <P> A fare war broke out in late April among carriers with Southern California-Bay  Area routes after price-slashing Southwest Airlines announced a $29 one-way  fare on two routes. American, United and USAir all countered with round-trip,  advance-purchase fares of less than $100. Sacramento fares, however, were not  discounted.  </P></p>

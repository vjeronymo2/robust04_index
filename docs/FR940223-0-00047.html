Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> I. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601&hyph;9675 (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act''), in response to the dangers of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. CERCLA was amended on October 17, 1986, by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (``SARA''), Public Law 99&hyph;499, stat. 1613  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To implement CERCLA, EPA promulgated the revised National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (``NCP''), 40 CFR Part 300, on July 16, 1982 (47 FR 31180), pursuant to CERCLA section 105 and Executive Order 12316 (46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP sets forth the guidelines and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. EPA has revised the NCP on several occasions, most recently on March 8, 1990 (55 FR 8666).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA requires that the NCP include ``criteria for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases throughout the United States for the purpose of taking remedial action *&blank;*&blank;* and, to the extent practicable taking into account the potential urgency of such action, for the purpose of taking removal action.'' Removal action involves cleanup or other actions that are taken in response to releases or threats of releases on a short-term or temporary basis (CERCLA section 101(23)). Remedial action tends to be long-term in nature and involves response actions that are consistent with a permanent remedy for a release (CERCLA section 101(24)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, EPA has promulgated a list of national priorities among the known or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States. That list, which is appendix B of 40 CFR part 300, is the National Priorities List (``NPL'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) defines the NPL as a list of ``releases'' and as a list of the highest priority ``facilities.'' The discussion below may refer to the ``releases or threatened releases'' that are included on the NPL interchangeably as ``releases,'' ``facilities,'' or ``sites.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) also requires that the NPL be revised at least annually. A site may undergo remedial action financed by the Trust Fund established under CERCLA (commonly referred to as the ``Superfund'') only after it is placed on the NPL, as provided in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(b)(1). However, under 40 CFR 300.425(b)(2) placing a site on the NPL ``does not imply that monies will be expended.'' EPA may pursue other appropriate authorities to remedy the releases, including enforcement action under CERCLA and other laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three mechanisms for placing sites on the NPL for possible remedial action are included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). Under 40 CFR 300.425(c)(1), a site may be included on the NPL if it scores sufficiently high on the Hazard Ranking System (``HRS''), which EPA promulgated as Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 300. On December 14, 1990 (55 FR 51532), EPA promulgated revisions to the HRS partly in response to CERCLA section 105(c), added by SARA. The revised HRS evaluates four pathways: ground water, surface water, soil exposure, and air. The HRS serves as a screening device to evaluate the relative potential of uncontrolled hazardous substances to pose a threat to human health or the environment. Those sites that score 28.50 or greater on the HRS are eligible for the NPL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under a second mechanism for adding sites to the NPL, each State may designate a single site as its top priority, regardless of the HRS score. This mechanism, provided by the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)(2), requires that, to the extent practicable, the NPL include within the 100 highest priorities, one facility designated by each State representing the greatest danger to public health, welfare, or the environment among known facilities in the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third mechanism for listing, included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)(3), allows certain sites to be listed whether or not they score above 28.50, if all of the following conditions are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the U.S. Public Health Service has issued a health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA determines that the release poses a significant threat to public health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use its remedial authority (available only at NPL sites) than to use its removal authority to respond to the release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA promulgated an original NPL of 406 sites on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). The NPL has been expanded since then, most recently on October 14, 1992 (57 FR 47180).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPL includes two sections, one of sites that are evaluated and cleaned up by EPA (the ``General Superfund Section''), and one of sites being addressed by other Federal agencies (the ``Federal Facilities Section''). Under Executive Order 12580 (52 FR 2923, January 29, 1987) and CERCLA section 120, each Federal agency is responsible for carrying out most response actions at facilities under its own jurisdiction, custody, or control, although EPA is responsible for preparing an HRS score and determining whether the facility is placed on the NPL. EPA is not the lead agency at these sites, and its role at such sites is accordingly less extensive than at other sites. The Federal Facilities Section includes those facilities at which EPA is not the lead agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Deletions/Cleanups  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA may delete sites from the NPL where no further response is appropriate under Superfund, as explained in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(e) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). To date, the Agency has deleted 58 sites from the General Superfund Section of the NPL, most recently Charlevoix Municipal Well, Charlevoix, Michigan (58 FR 63531, December 2, 1993) and Mowbray Engineering Company, Greenville, Alabama (58 FR 69238, December 30, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

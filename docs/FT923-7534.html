			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Africans arrested in Spain Thirty-two Africans were detained at the weekend after crossing the Straits of Gibraltar in a small craft - the latest in a steady flow of illegal immigrants, agencies report from Algeciras, Spain. Officials said this brought the number of detentions last week to 128. Thousands of illegal immigrants, mainly from Morocco, are believed to have made the dangerous crossing since entry requirements were tightened more than a year ago. At least 20 were reported drowned three months ago.</p>

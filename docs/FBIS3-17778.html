"The talks focused on problems concerning the maintenance of  a city in the steppe where the cosmodrome's workers live. We  have solved this issue. I am confident that our children and  grandchildren will use Baykonur in the 21st century in the  interests of both Russia and Kazakhstan," Yeltsin was quoted as  saying.    For his part, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev put a  special emphasis on Russia's important role in the development  of Kazakhstan's scientific, technological and cultural  potential. No speculation about Kazakhstan's alleged cooling  towards Russia have any grounds, he added.    The two presidents signed four main documents out of 23  bilateral accords adopted as a result of the summit, including  treaties on the further enhancement of economic cooperation and  integration, on the strategic nuclear forces temporarily  stationed in Kazakhstan, on military cooperation and a  memorandum on the basic principles for the resolution of issues  related to the citizenship and the legal status of Russian and  Kazakh citizens residing on the territory of the other state.    Yeltsin received letters of ratification on Kazakhstan's  joining the non-proliferation treaty from his Kazakh counterpart.</p>

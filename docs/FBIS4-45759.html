			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- Levels of carbon dioxide  and methane, blamed for the greenhouse effect, are higher in  Korea's southwestern Taean peninsula than in China, Mongolia and  Hawaii, according to a study by Korean scientists.    Another study shows that acid rain occurs in rural or remote  areas like Chongwon, North Chungchong Province, Cheju Island and  the Taean peninsula -- not as a result of air pollutants from  Korea but from China.    Chong Yong-song, head of the Korea-China Center for  Atmospheric Research based at the Korea National University of  Education in Chongwon, and his associate researchers presented  their observations at the four-day fourth international  conference on Atmospheric Sciences and Applications to Air  Quality (ASAAQ) that started Monday at a hotel in southeastern  Seoul.    Their studies, particularly of the Taean peninsula, were  compared with the results of carbon dioxide and monoxide, and  methane observations obtained by their counterparts from China,  Mongolia and Hawaii at Mt. Waliguan, Ulaan Uul and Mauna Loa.    Their observations of carbon dioxide levels since November  1990 show that the Taean peninsula is generally under the  influence of airflows coming from China.    The Korean scientists says their analysis indicates that  according to methane data from Mongolia and several sites in the  North Pacific, the Taean peninsula is influenced as much as 31  PPB (parts per billion) on average by Chinese emissions.    In his study on the background-level acidity of  precipitation  in Korea, conducted jointly with fellow researcher Kim Tae-kun,  Chong concludes that annual pH values in rural areas that are  isolated from major industrial regions are "weak acid" ranging  between pH 5.0 and 5.3.    In Chongwon, a rural area situated in central Korea, 173  days  (64 percent) showed acid precipitation out of a total 271 days.  Higher frequencies of acid precipitation indicate that it is  spreading out in the rural areas of Korea.    Acid rain in rural or remote areas like Cheju Island and the  Taean peninsula, the scientists say, is carried by rain clouds  from southern China usually containing high values of acidity.    Considering the annual 10-percent rise in energy production  in China, acid rain is feared to frequently occur in Korea, they  conclude.</p>

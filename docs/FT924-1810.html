			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Boardroom shake-up at Pegasus IN A boardroom coup prompt-ed by institutional investors, Mr Jonathan Hubbard-Ford, who on November 25 resigned the chief executive post at Pegasus Group he had occupied only since May, has been re-appointed chief executive of the USM-quoted accounting software company. This follows the decision made on December 7 by Mr Derek Moon, non-executive chairman, to replace SG Warburg with Henderson Crosthwaite as the company's broker. Warburg had been the mouthpiece through which the institutions had told Mr Moon that they would prefer Mr Hubbard-Ford in charge of Pegasus. Mr Moon, along with Mr Tony Barber, Mr Roger Dickinson and Mr John Percival, all directors, has now resigned. His place has been taken by Mr Philip Sellers, non-executive chairman of CSL Group and a non-executive of Etam. Mr Jamie Minotto, managing director of Pegasus Software, has appointed to the board, along with Mr Neil Pearce, the non-executive director who represents Advent Capital. The other institutions include Postel, Scottish Amicable and Prudential. Mr Hubbard-Ford said last night that the board had 'sensibly' heeded the suggestions of the institutions, and added that Warburg would be re-appointed broker. He said that the board upheaval was the result of a clash of both management style and policy. 'We are a knowledge-based business: we must be open.' He said Pegasus could now 'refocus its efforts on its core business'. Areas of the product range would be reviewed, and 'we need to utilise fully our large end-user base, our committed dealer network and cash resources' - boosted by the Pounds 1.7m disposal in September.</p>

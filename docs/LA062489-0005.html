			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN DEFENSE OF THE CAMPUS REBELS  </P> <P> May 19, 1969  </P> <P> I hate to write on subjects about which I know no more than the conventional  wisdom of the moment. One of these subjects is the campus revolt. My  credentials as an expert are slim. I always loved learning and hated school. I  wanted to go to Harvard, but I couldn't get in because I had graduated  forty-ninth in a class of fity-two from a small-town high school. I went to  college at the University of Pennsylvania which was obligated -- this sounds  like an echo of a familiar black demand today -- to take graduates of high  schools in neighboring communities no matter how ill-fitted. My boyhood idol  was the saintly anarchist Kropotkin. I looked down on college degrees and felt  that a man should do only what was sincere and true and without thought of  mundane advancement. This provided lofty reasons for not doing homework. I  majored in philosophy with the vague thought of teaching it but though I  revered two of my professors I disliked the smell of a college faculty. I  dropped out in my third year to go back to newspaper work. Those were the  twenties and I was a pre-Depression radical. So I might be described I suppose  as a premature New Leftist, though I never had the urge to burn anything down.  </P> <P> In microcosm, the Weekly and I have become typical of our society. The war and  the military have taken up so much of our energies that we have neglected the  blacks, the poor and students. Seen from afar, the turmoil, and the deepening  division appear to be a familiar tragedy, like watching a friend drink himself  to death. Everybody knows what needs to be done, but the will is lacking. We  have to break the habit. There is no excuse for poverty in a society which can  spend $80 billion a year on its war machine. If national security comes first,  as the spokesmen for the Pentagon tell us, then we can only reply that the  clearest danger to the national security lies in the rising revolt of our black  population. Our own country is becoming a Vietnam. As if in retribution for the  suffering we have imposed, we are confronted by the same choices: either to  satisfy the aspirations of the oppressed or to try and crush them by force. The  former would be costly, but the latter will be disastrous.  </P> <P> This is what the campus rebels are trying to tell us, in the only way which  seems to get attention. I do not like to hear opponents shouted down, much less  beaten up. I do not like to hear any one group or class, including policemen,  called pigs. I do not think four-letter words are arguments. I hate, hate,  intolerance and violence. I see them as man's most ancient and enduring enemies  and I hate to see them welling up on my side. But I feel about the rebels as  Erasmus did about Luther. Erasmus helped inspire the Reformation but was  repelled by the man who brought it to fruition. He saw that Luther was as  intolerant and as dogmatic as the Church. "From argument," as Erasmus saw it  (in Froude's "Life and Letters of Erasmus"), "there would be a quick resort to  the sword, and the whole world would be full of fury and madness." Two  centuries of religious wars without parallel for blood-lust were soon to prove  how right were his misgivings. But while Erasmus "could not join Luther, he  dared not oppose him, lest haply, as he confessed 'he might be fighting against  the spirit of God.' " I feel that the New Left and the black revolutionists,  like Luther, are doing God's work, too, in refusing any longer to submit to  evil, and challenging society to reform or crush them.  </P> <P> Lifelong dissent has more than acclimatized me cheerfully to defeat. It has  made me suspicious of victory. I feel uneasy at the very idea of a Movement. I  see every insight degenerating into a dogma, and fresh thoughts freezing into  lifeless party line. Those who set out nobly to be their brother's keeper  sometimes end up by becoming his jailer. Every emancipation has in it the seeds  of a new slavery, and every truth easily becomes a lie. But these perspectives,  which seem so irrefutably clear from a pillar in the desert, are worthless to  those enmeshed in the crowded struggle. They are no better than mystical  nonsense to the humane student who has to face his draft board, the dissident  soldier who is determined not to fight, the black who sees his people doomed by  shackles stronger than slavery to racial humiliation and decay. The business of  the moment is to end the war, to break the growing dominance of the military in  our society, to liberate the blacks, the Mexican-American, the Puerto Rican and  the Indian from injustice. This is the business of our best youth. However  confused and chaotic, their unwillingness to submit any longer is our one hope.  </P> <P> There is a wonderful story of a delegation which came here to see Franklin D.  Roosevelt on some reform or other. When they were finished the President said,  "Okay, you've convinced me. Now go on out and bring pressure on me." Every  thoughtful official knows how hard it is to get anything done if someone isn't  making it uncomfortable not to. Just imagine how helpless the better people in  government would be if the rebels, black and white, suddenly fell silent. The  war might smoulder on forever, the ghettoes attract as little attention as a  refuse dump. It is a painful business extricating ourselves from the stupidity  of the Vietnamese war; we will do so only if it becomes more painful not to. It  will be costly rebuilding the ghettoes, but if the black revolt goes on, it  will be costlier not to. In the workings of a free society, the revolutionist  provides the moderate with the clinching argument. And a little un-reason does  wonders, like a condiment, in re-invigorating a discussion which has grown  pointless and flat.  </P> <P> We ought to welcome the revolt as the one way to prod us into a better America.  To meet it with cries of "law and order" and "conspiracy" would be to relapse  into the sterile monologue which precedes all revolutions. Rather than change  old habits, those in power always prefer to fall back on the theory that all  would be well but for a few malevolent conspirators. It is painful to see  academia disrupted, but under the surface were shams and horrors that needed  cleansing. The disruption is worth the price of awakening us. The student  rebels are proving right in the daring idea that they could revolutionize  American society by attacking the universities as its soft underbelly. But I  would also remind the students that the three evils they fight -- war, racism  and bureaucracy -- are universal. The Marxism-Leninism some of the rebels cling  to has brought into power a bureaucracy more suffocating than any under  capitalism; the students demonstrate everywhere on our side but are stifled on  the other. War and imperialism have not been eliminated in the relations  between Communist states. Black Africa, at least half-freed from the white man,  is hardly a model of fraternity or freedom. Man's one real enemy is within  himself. Burning America down is no way to Utopia. If battle is joined and our  country polarized, as both the revolutionists and the repressionists wish, it  is the better and not the worse side of America which will be destroyed.  Someone said a man's character was his fate, and tragedy may be implicit in the  character of our society and of its rebels. How make a whisper for patience  heard amid the rising fury?  </P> <P> I.F. Stone died Sunday at the age of 81.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Abu Dhabi to buy 20% of Austrian oil group The Gulf emirate of Abu Dhabi has agreed to buy a 20 per cent stake in OMV, the partially-privatised Austrian integrated oil and chemicals group, for about Sch5bn (Dollars 413m) from the Austrian government. Oesterreichische Industrieholding (OIAG), the Austrian state holding company that owns 72 per cent of OMV, said its supervisory board had 'approved unanimously' the offer by Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC). Two weeks ago, OMV said it was planning a one-for-eight rights issue to raise about Sch3bn as part of the terms for bringing in a strategic partner. OIAG will pass on its rights in the issue to IPIC and sell to IPIC some of its existing shares. Full details of the deal will be disclosed following the official signing in the next few days. The Austrian government has been searching for partners for OMV for nearly two years as part of its privatisation policy. It was expected that partners would be found quickly, as OMV has a dominant position in Austria and appeared well placed to penetrate the emerging markets in central and eastern Europe. However, the group suffered a series of embarrassing reverses, including the sudden departure of a chief executive and deterioration of trading performance. It lost Sch604.6m in 1992 and suffered a further loss last year of Sch4.43bn, of which Sch3.5bn was for restructuring. For much of this period the quoted price of the group's shares was below book value, making it difficult for potential partners to agree purchase terms. OIAG's stake in OMV would drop to 52 per cent following the deal. OIAG said it hoped to bring in other strategic partners. Its goal was to reduce its holding to under 50 per cent by the end of this year and ultimately to a blocking minority of just over 25 per cent.</p>

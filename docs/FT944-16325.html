			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Clarke refuses to guarantee tax cuts before poll: Chancellor dismisses suggestions of swing to right as 'laughable' Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday refused to guarantee tax cuts before the next general election. He dismissed as 'laughable' suggestions that the Tory party should swing to the right to counter Mr Tony Blair's more moderate Labour party. Speaking after a cautious but well-received address to the Bournemouth party conference, Mr Clarke indicated he would strongly resist efforts by right-wing cabinet colleagues to dictate the government's policy towards Europe. With other cabinet ministers on the centre-left angry at attempts by right-wingers to set the agenda, he said that Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, had been 'mistaken' in questioning the government's commitment to Europe. The chancellor said he had not changed any of his pro-European views and remained in favour of the long-term goal of full economic and monetary union  -an idea that is anathema to right-wing colleagues. During a subdued debate on the economy in which he pledged that sustained recovery would bring a strong upturn in the government's political fortunes, Mr Clarke defused recent pressure from rightwing Tory MPs for tax cuts in November. He stressed that he was committed to a lower tax burden once public borrowing had been brought under control. But he added later: 'Of course I would be a happier man if it was this side of the election that I could make the tax cuts. But I have no date circled in my calendar.' Mr Clarke acknowledged that the strength of the economic recovery and the sharp fall in inflation should allow him to cut several billions of pounds in next month's Budget from his spending and borrowing targets. But he insisted that the squeeze on spending would not be at the expense of manifesto pledges to maintain the effectiveness of the welfare state. 'There are areas of public spending where we are committed to growth.' The chancellor added that the party should stick to the political ground on which it now stood. 'The idea that the party starts marching off to the right wing because Tony Blair is muscling in on it is slightly laughable.' His comments came as cabinet ministers close to Mr John Major privately voiced anger at the anti-European stance adopted by Mr Portillo and other rightwing ministers such as Mr Peter Lilley and Mr John Redwood. The ministers predicted Mr Major would use his closing speech to the conference today to indicate that he would not allow the cabinet ministers he once described as 'bastards' to dictate his strategy.

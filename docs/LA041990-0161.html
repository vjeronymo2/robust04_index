			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIND'AMOUR HELPS BLUES GET THE JUMP ON BLACKHAWKS, 4-3  </P> <P> Rookie Rod Brind'Amour scored two goals and Rick Meagher and Brett Hull one  each Wednesday night, leading the St. Louis Blues to a 4-3 victory over the  Chicago Blackhawks in the opening game of their second-round playoff series.  </P> <P> The victory took away the home-ice advantage for Chicago, which finished first  in the Norris Division.  </P> <P> The Blues grabbed a 4-1 lead midway in the second period before the Blackhawks  staged a comeback that fell short after goalie Greg Millen was replaced by Ed  Belfour.  </P> <P> Chicago put on the pressure in the final period but couldn't offset the tight  checking of the Blues. With 42 seconds remaining, the Blackhawks pulled Belfour  for a sixth attacker, but were stopped cold by goalie Vincent Riendeau.  </P> <P> Riendeau was playing in place of Curtis Joseph, who suffered a shoulder injury  in the final game of the Toronto series and is expected to miss two games.  </P> <P> The Blues held a 5-2-1 edge over the Blackhawks and were 3-1 at Chicago during  the regular season.  </P></p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Chinese output leaps China's industrial output rose 33 per cent in January against the same month last year, despite government efforts to calm economic activity. The surge in output suggests China faces serious difficulties bringing growth down to a target of 9 per cent this year compared with 12.8 per cent in 1993. The latest indications of economic overheating, reported yesterday by official Chinese newspapers, are likely to further intensify government concerns about inflation. Cost of living in China's cities rose by 23.9 per cent a year in December.</p>

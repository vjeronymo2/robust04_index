			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Bosnia war creates 100,000 refugees AT LEAST 100,000 people have been displaced by the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the newly independent republic, adding to the 1m people who fled the war in Croatia. The flight continued yesterday as fresh clashes were reported in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and other towns in the republic, despite the ceasefire agreed on Sunday among the leaders of Bosnia's 4.4m Moslems, Serbs and Croats. Radio Sarajevo said the federal army had reported 11 violations of the most recent European Community-sponsored truce by mid-morning. Heavy fighting was reported on the outskirts of Sarajevo, in Foca, a predominantly Moslem town in south-eastern Bosnia, and in Bosanski Brod, in the north. Ms Judith Kumin, the Belgrade representative of the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR), said that although it was difficult to get a precise figure, she estimated that at least 100,000 people had fled strife-torn towns in Bosnia. Some had escaped to other existing or former Yugoslav republics, while others were still in Bosnia, sheltering away from the trouble spots. The UNHCR, the Red Cross and other international organisations are all trying to cope with the thousands of refugees who fled their homes. Encouragingly, relief workers tell of communities making great sacrifices in order to give shelter to refugees despite the fact that they are in a difficult economic situation and have already taken in thousands of people from Croatia. Relief workers trying to deliver food and medical supplies are confronted by gunmen at road blocks around many towns. Ms Kumin said: 'The biggest problem is transportation. It is very expensive to get lorry drivers to go into Bosnia while there is fighting. They insist on UN escorts which makes the cost even higher'.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: CRT shares fall on profits setback PRE-TAX profits at CRT, which stands for consultancy, recruitment and training, its areas of activity, declined from Pounds 2.61m to Pounds 689,000 in the six months to October 31. The shares fell from 100p to 888p. Mr Karl Chapman, chief executive, said the group had been 'on the back foot' in the period following Pounds 30m-worth of acquisitions in three years. CRT was 'now back on the front foot' after the restructuring, reorganisation of the business and the acquisition of the 160-strong Wetherby Training Services chain and Convergent Communications, bought in May for a combined Pounds 1.74m. The group said it saw 'the next 18 months positively' and lifted the interim dividend to 0.65p (0.575p). Earnings emerged at 0.91p (3.47p). Mr Chapman ascribed the profits decline to a poor performance from Doctus, the consultancy side, and the 'substantially increased second-half weighting of the training division's profits', adding that a large proportion of the full-year's Pounds 5.4m investment in the group, taken through the profit and loss account, was spent in the first half. Mr Barrie Clark, finance director, said the investment was a 'prerequisite for the future', reckoning that within the next two years various 'standards and kitemarks' could be obligatory. Both this and CRT's growing use of expensive software in its 12 Pitman Training Centres would help rationalise a 'fragmented and underdeveloped' industry. The pre-tax outcome was knocked back by reorganisation costs of Pounds 629,000. More than 100 of CRT's 1,000 workforce were made redundant - mainly in consultancy, where the French operation was closed, and recruitment, where five offices were closed. Mr Chapman said the Wetherby acquisition allowed CRT to distribute the group's Pitman training - franchising the brand is currently being piloted.</p>

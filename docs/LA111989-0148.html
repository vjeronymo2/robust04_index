			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKDOWNS MAY DAMPEN RETAILERS' CHRISTMAS CHEER;  </P> <P> SHOPPING: STORE OWNERS FEAR A POTENTIAL PRICE-CUTTING WAR. SOME ARE FIGHTING  BACK WITH SERVICE.  </P> <P> This should be a white Christmas for America's leading retailers -- in fact,  some already seem to be turning a little pale.  </P> <P> Although no one is predicting an industrywide disaster, many department store  and specialty shop executives fear that an unusually fierce price-cutting war  will erupt during the holiday shopping season. While that is good news for  customers shopping on a budget, it brings out the Scrooge in people on the  other side of the cash register, who normally count on Christmas for a big  chunk of their profits.  </P> <P> For retailers, beset by worrisome long-term trends and financial turmoil at  some big chains this year, "the primary objective is to escape with as few  bruises as possible," said C. Scott Killips, a vice president with the  consulting firm Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton in San Francisco.  </P> <P> "You'll see markdowns of 50% to 60%, no doubt about it," predicted analyst  Sarah Stack of the Los Angeles brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc.  </P> <P> In Southern California, markdowns generally are not expected to be quite as  sharp as elsewhere because of the relative strength of the region's economy and  the financial health of most of its major stores. Even so, price reductions  here began right after Halloween.  </P> <P> Preliminary results of a survey sent to 1,200 Southern California retailers by  the accounting firm Touche Ross &amp; Co. show that roughly 80% of those  responding expect their gross profit margins to be flat or down during the fall  and winter months. The reasons: among other things, higher labor costs and  profit-squeezing price competition.  </P> <P> Aside from fretting over markdowns, retailers this Christmas season are  emphasizing customer service -- in part, to shield themselves somewhat from the  price wars. With the enormously successful Nordstrom department store chain  setting the standard, everyone locally from C &amp; R Clothiers to Vons  supermarkets is promoting the quality of its service to attract shoppers.  </P> <P> Retailers are also looking for early signs of what will be the hottest-selling  products. Although people with money will always buy gifts, there is concern  that consumers are unenthusiastic about this year's offerings. "People are kind  of spent out," said Rosalind Wells, chief economist of the National Retail  Merchants Assn. "We've had a seven-year expansion, and a lot of things already  have been bought."  </P> <P> On the other hand, Sandra Shaber, an economic analyst with The Futures Group  consulting firm, added that the "jaded, bored, bargain-hunting consumer can  still be captured by someone with a new gimmick."  </P> <P> Generally speaking, apparel is expected to do well compared to last year, when  many women were cool to the available fashions. Television sets, videocassette  recorders and other home electronics equipment are projected to sell fairly  briskly as well, but analysts predict that big-ticket items such as furniture  and appliances will move slowly.  </P> <P> As usual, a handful of novelty gifts are expected to emerge as hits, but store  managers say it is too soon to pick the big winner. A leading candidate is  "Rock'n Flowers," battery-powered daisies selling for $30 that "dance" to the  sound of music or a loud voice.  </P> <P> Still, retailers are mainly preoccupied with the bottom line, amid a host of  factors that are consorting to drive down prices and profits.  </P> <P> Nationally, much of the concern stems from the bleak financial condition of  both Campeau Corp., parent of the Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores  chains, and of L. J. Hooker Corp., which owns B. Altman and Bonwit Teller. The  companies have been brought to their knees by hefty debts from acquisitions. In  another move that recently shook the retailing industry, the Saks Fifth Avenue  and Marshall Field's chains were put up for sale, but analysts say those firms  are in good shape.  </P> <P> Experts speculate that the Campeau and Hooker stores could grow desperate for  cash and resort to sharp markdowns to bring in customers, triggering a  cutthroat battle throughout the marketplace.  </P> <P> Neither Campeau nor Hooker has department stores or specialty shops in Southern  California. Consequently, "people in New York may be getting better buys this  Christmas than in California," said George Rosenbaum, president of the Chicago  market research firm Leo J. Shapiro &amp; Associates.  </P> <P> Even so, the fallout from the retailing industry's acquisition spree during the  past few years may be felt in the Southland. Bullock's, now owned by debt-heavy  R. H. Macy &amp; Co., recently surprised competitors with newspaper ads  trumpeting that it will not be undersold on women's coats.  </P> <P> Some retail experts suggested that the move could be part of a broad  price-cutting effort to win back business from Nordstrom. That was denied,  however, by a Bullock's spokeswoman. Bullock's will have "some sales, which is  always the case this time of year, but we will not be involved in price  slashing," said spokeswoman Kathleen Waugh.  </P> <P> The Campeau and Hooker problems also may indirectly influence prices locally  and nationally. Industry analysts have suggested that a number of apparel  makers -- worried about the ability of Campeau and Hooker stores to pay their  bills after the Christmas rush ends -- will try to ship more of their  merchandise to off-price retailers.  </P> <P> Retailers, meanwhile, are struggling to change widespread consumer shopping  patterns that have narrowed profit margins. Their main problem is that more and  more shoppers are putting off their buying until merchandise is discounted  sharply.  </P> <P> "There were days when 15% to 20% reductions would bring shoppers in the store.  That is no longer the case," said Gordon Cooke, executive vice president of New  York-based Bloomingdale's. He said it now takes reductions of 30% to 50% to  draw a rush of shoppers.  </P> <P> Several major companies, most notably Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., have responded  by switching to "everyday low prices" -- that is, offering stable and  relatively low, if not rock-bottom, prices. So far, though, there is little  evidence that the strategy is working. The middle-of-the-road stores are being  hurt by competition on one side from the high-end chains and on the other side  by discounters and off-price shops.  </P> <P> As part of the waiting-for-sales trend, for the past several years Christmas  shoppers have increasingly put off much of their buying until the last days of  the shopping season.  </P> <P> Retailers commonly fear that last-minute shoppers will buy less expensive goods  and fewer accessories or, worst of all, will take their business to other  stores. The typical solution for reversing the pattern: offering more service  and -- what else? -- earlier sales.  </P> <P> With Christmas falling on a Monday this year, giving consumers a full weekend  for last-minute buying, retailers are particularly nervous. Working in  retailers' favor, though, is the apparently increasing awareness among  consumers that if they wait too long, the merchandise that they want won't be  around because of tighter inventories.  </P> <P> For example, Violet Leisher, a department head at Midway Medical Center in West  Los Angeles, says she started her holiday shopping a month ago. "Every year  (before this one) I have shopped later and later, and you get less and less of  a selection," she explained. "I've already shopped and taken advantage of  sales."  </P> <P> She also started shopping early to avoid the year-end crowds at the malls and  the traffic tie-ups that result when winter rains begin.  </P> <P> Other consumers who are pressed for time have taken more of their business to  mail-order houses. Analysts expect mail-order firms to make further inroads  this Christmas, but at a slower pace, partly because of the lower prices  offered by some conventional retailers. Mail-order firms themselves, including  Wisconsin-based Lands' End, have been hurt recently as dozens of newcomers have  entered the field.  </P> <P> The backdrop for the intensified price competition is a national economy that  is giving mixed signals after a long recovery. The federal government reported  last week, for instance, that lower auto sales brought overall retail sales  down 1% in October, the biggest one-month drop since January, 1987. On top of  that, job creation in the private sector and personal income growth have been  slower in recent months.  </P> <P> Analysts say that consumer confidence remains high but it could falter if more  discouraging news breaks. "If on Nov. 20 we have a 300-point drop in the stock  market, people could change plans very abruptly," Rosenbaum said.  </P> <P> All told, analysts expect consumers' Christmas spending to rise a modest 5% to  7% this year, down from roughly 9% in 1988. After discounting the impact of  inflation, the projected growth is in the 2% to 3 1/2% range. Economists are  not giving earnings forecasts, but many say they expect profits to rise even  less than sales because of the likelihood of price cutting.  </P> <P> In some quarters, though, is a measure of optimism. Philip M. Hawley, chairman  and chief executive of Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., said  the Southland's retail market will benefit from having settled down after being  roiled in recent years by corporate mergers.  </P> <P> "It's probably as stable a market as we've seen in Southern California in a  number of years," Hawley said.  </P> <P> And even if retailing experts are more worried than usual this year, some note  that concerns always run high around now. "This time last year everybody was  saying it'll be a terrible year, but people now look back and say it wasn't  that bad," said David W. Stewart, an associate professor of marketing at USC.  </P> <P> Still, in a market as tough as this year's, paying some extra attention to the  business couldn't hurt retailers. "We're in a situation where a weekend can  make or break your business," said Bateman Eichler's Stack. "Retailers have to  be able to turn on a dime."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ANNUAL RETAIL SALES  </P> <P> Figures are all in 1982 dollars to compensate for the effects of inflation.  Retail goods that cost $100 in 1982 would cost $117.90 today.  </P> <P> Year-to-year % increase after inflation  </P> <P> 1985: 4.4%  </P> <P> 1986: 5.3%  </P> <P> 1987: 1.3%  </P> <P> 1988: 3.6%  </P> <P> 1989 *: 2.0%  </P> <P> * Projection  </P> <P> Source: The Futures Group  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Armed Forces General Staff Issues Warning, </F> Demands Compliance With Law"]    [Text] Brasilia--The minister-chief of the Armed Forces  General Staff [EMFA], Admiral Arnaldo Leite, warned yesterday  that "the Armed Forces are prepared to enforce law and order  against any person at all who disobeys the law, even if that  person is a judge on the Federal Supreme Court." Leite denied,  however, that the military are poised for an institutional  confrontation.    "It is not a matter of confrontation; it is a matter of  enforcing the law," he said. In his opinion, the fact that the  Federal Supreme Court [STF] unanimously voted itself an  11-percent pay increase by moving up the date for converting  wages to URV's [real units of value] from the 30th to to 20th  means nothing "because there is no sovereign decision which can  violate the law."  <H5>  Anarchy </H5>   The suggestion by the minister-chief of the EMFA--and it is  supported by other military ministers--is that President Itamar  Franco should not release any funds beyond those already  provided to anyone who is disobeying the law. "The amount in  excess, which in the STF's case is that 11-percent increase,  cannot be paid because the executive branch is bound to obey the  law, and anyone who does not is subject to arrest," the minister  said. "No one can disobey the law, be he a Supreme Court judge,  a deputy, a senator, the minister of Army, the chief of the  EMFA, or an ordinary government employee," he emphasized.    In the minister's opinion, that kind of attitude on the part  of the Supreme Court and of Congress, which overrode the  presidential veto limiting the pay of a portion of the civil  service, is aimed at destabilizing the plan. "If they do not  obey the law, the result will be anarchy, and that is not  acceptable," he noted. Arnaldo Leite said that the note released  by Planalto Palace on Friday night had the support of the entire  cabinet. Although only 13 ministers were present, President  Itamar Franco instructed Henrique Hargreaves, chief of the  Civilian Household, to notify them all of the note's contents.  There was general agreement.  <H5>  Military Intervention Ruled out </H5>   Brasilia--President Itamar Franco will meet with all the  military ministers again next Tuesday at a luncheon on board the  training ship Brasil, which is beginning its year-long training  cruise. In the opinion of Adm. Arnaldo Leite, minister-chief of  the EMFA, the president will be applauded by the servicemen  because he has shown that the administration is not indifferent  to the pay disparity among the three branches of government.    Despite the tone of his statements, the minister maintains  that there is no possibility of military intervention in  politics. "The country is living in a democracy," he pointed  out. "Our action shows only that the Armed Forces are prepared  to enforce the law in the manner determined by the president,"  he added. "Judges interpret the law; they cannot disobey the  law," the admiral said heatedly. In his opinion, the branches of  government are "distinct, harmonious, and independent," but they  must obey a provisional measure. He concluded by saying: "The  only people who don't see that are the people who don't want to."</p>

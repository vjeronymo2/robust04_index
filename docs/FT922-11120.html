			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / An opposition in exile You can forget about the opposition for a while. It is of more than passing interest to know whether or not Mr John Smith becomes leader of the Labour party, but beyond that we need only look in from time to time. When the party has been restructured it may become credible. Until then British politics will be about what goes on among Conservatives. This is not to say that oppositions make no difference at all. If during 1990 Labour had not reached the high 40 per cents in the opinion polls (misleading as that may now be seen to have been), the Conservatives would have had no reason to overthrow Mrs Margaret Thatcher. In the last parliament Mr Smith skilfully exploited the obvious disagreements between Mrs Thatcher and her 'excellent' chancellor, Mr Nigel Lawson. Labour saw off more than one health secretary. The political career of Mr John Moore was ended; that of Mr William Waldegrave blighted. In this parliament, however, the advantage to the opposition of a low Tory majority is offset by both Mr John Major's strategy of seeking a Conservative consensus and the disarray in which Labour finds itself. This week's argument about the rules under which a successor to Mr Neil Kinnock is to be elected is about a mere technicality. What Labour has to do is detach itself from the trade union movement, find a reason for existing in a non-socialist world, devise new policies, and perhaps even rename itself. If it does not follow such a path it may have no future at all; if it does it will be so preoccupied with its own restructuring for a good while yet that it will have little energy left with which to mount a vigorous opposition. Such reflections are not entirely consonant with the election result. Simple arithmetic suggests that the government ought to tread carefully, lest the opposition stomp on its toes. Mr Major's victory on April 9 was so unexpected, and such a signal triumph after a contest fought in mid-depression, that the relative smallness of the Conservatives' parliamentary majority was generally overlooked. They are 21 seats ahead, but in a house of 651 that should not be unassailable. Their advantage could be eroded as a result of by-election losses. Even if that does not happen, the government side is in theory subject to harassment by a united opposition. Tory back-benchers could stage successful rebellions. Yet, as many of us discovered on the morning of April 10, arithmetic can be misleading. Tories can manage quite well on a small majority in the Commons, as Labour must on most of the rare occasions on which it wins. In October 1951 Churchill returned to No 10 Downing Street as the head of a government with an overall majority of just 17. It lasted for 3 1/2 years, until May 1955, and might have survived for longer had not the great war leader been obliged to retire on grounds of ill-health. Churchill did not try to reverse the welfare state reforms pushed through by Labour in the previous six years, but his administration did begin the dismantling of war-time controls. In those gentlemanly post-war years MPs were relatively docile. Expecting to return soon, Labour did not make life unduly difficult for the government. In 1970 the then Mr Edward Heath was less fortunate. His victory by 30 seats was just as much of a shock to the opinion pollsters as this year's upset; his government was not, however, given such a comfortable ride as Churchill's had enjoyed 20 years previously. Mr Heath was obliged by the oil price shock to perform his celebrated U-turn on economic management. He was brought down in 1974 by the coal miners' strike. The National Union of Mineworkers behaved at that time as a part of the opposition, the extension by other means of Labour's parliamentary tactics. Everything is different now. In 1951 there were nine Liberal and other-party MPs; in 1970 there were only 12. Since then the 'third force' of representatives of centre parties and Celtic nationalists has grown, to 44 in the current parliament. For Labour to catch the Tories in a big set-piece vote it must find an issue upon which all these parties can agree, and it must win the support in the lobbies of about a dozen Tory rebels. Something of the sort might have happened, had there been a majority of 21 and not 100, during the debates on the poll tax. The celebrated amendment moved by Mr Michael Mates, which would have provided for banding of the Community Charge according to income, might have won through. That was in the days of Mrs Thatcher and government by ideology. Such a rebellion is less likely while Mr Major is prime minister, for he has no ideology. He never forgets the lessons he learned in the Whips office. It would be uncharacteristic of him to put an issue to the house if he was uncertain of winning the vote. He will try to square the parliamentary party first, then come to the Commons. So that is where there is business to be done: among Conservatives.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MYSTERY LETTER PUTS ODD TWIST ON MEDFLY CRISIS  </P> <P> The Mediterranean fruit fly crisis has taken an odd turn with law enforcement  officials tentatively investigating a mysterious letter from a group that  claims to be breeding and spreading the pest throughout Southern California.  </P> <P> The group, calling itself the "Breeders," said in an unsigned letter to Mayor  Tom Bradley, agricultural officials and media that it was angered by repeated  aerial spraying of pesticide to eradicate the fly and "decided to make the  Medfly 'problem' unmanageable and aerial spraying politically and financially  intolerable."  </P> <P> Authorities are cautious in assessing the validity of the two-page typewritten  letter, a copy of which was received by The Times. Many officials and  investigators suspect a hoax.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Cmdr. William Booth said the letter was forwarded to the  department from Bradley's office and turned over for investigation to the  Criminal Conspiracy Section.  </P> <P> "A threatening letter is something we take seriously," Booth said. Even if the  claim is a hoax, he said, the letter writer has committed at least a  misdemeanor -- "threatening to do something if government officials don't  accede to their demands. That is a violation of the law." The "Breeders" also  could be guilty of other crimes, including extortion, he said.  </P> <P> Rex Magee, associate director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture,  said the threat must be taken "seriously until we prove otherwise. This  particular infestation has had some characteristics that we have not seen in  the past."  </P> <P> Roy Cunningham, a U.S. Department of Agriculture entomologist and dean of the  state's Medfly scientific advisory panel, agreed that there have been some  baffling aspects to the Los Angeles infestation.  </P> <P> "It has been peculiar that we go in and we don't find any larvae," Cunningham  said. "We just find a few flies right outside spray zone boundaries."  </P> <P> Cunningham recalled that a similar letter, which apparently was a hoax, was  written toward the end of the 1980-81 Medfly infestation in California.  </P> <P> The "Breeders" claim to have imported Medfly larvae into Southern California  "and started breeding them here."  </P> <P> "State officials have probably noticed an increase as well as an unusual  distribution of Medfly infestation in Los Angeles County since March, 1989,"  the letter stated. The group threatened to spread the infestation into the  farm-rich San Joaquin Valley if aerial spraying is not stopped in the Los  Angeles area. It apparently sent a copy of the letter to The Fresno Bee as  well.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Department Detective John Mattingly, who with his partner is  conducting the investigation, said it is in its "embryo stage" and that tests  will be conducted on the letter's stationery and envelope. He would not  disclose the type of tests.  </P> <P> Federal authorities were less definite.  </P> <P> "We are evaluating it," said Floyd Cotton, regional inspector general for the  U.S. Department of Agriculture. "We will review the letter and decide whether  to open up a formal investigation."  </P> <P> The unprecedented infestation has required that 232 square miles of primarily  residential neighborhoods in Los Angeles and Orange counties receive one or two  aerial sprays of malathion from low-flying helicopters. Government officials  say the malathion spray poses no threat to human health because the pesticide  is applied in extremely low doses.  </P> <P> Cunningham asserted that the "Breeders" "logic is seriously faulted" because  the government will not "abandon the effort" to use aerial applications to  eradicate the pest. He said that if the Medfly were to become established in  California, pesticide use by farmers and homeowners would increase.  </P> <P> Agricultural officials have blamed the spreading infestation on people who  illegally smuggle infected fruit into the country or out of quarantined  neighborhoods. In recent weeks, roving teams of agricultural inspectors have  patrolled neighborhoods, while state officials have set up a hot line for  residents to anonymously tip off authorities about violations.  </P></p>

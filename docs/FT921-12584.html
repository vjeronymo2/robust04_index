			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Standing on his own legs - David Spark meets John Franklin, who abandoned the safety of the BBC for an uncertain living making aluminium props which keep yachts steady on the beach FOR 22 years, John Franklin designed the images projected behind BBC election broadcasters and weathermen. When he left the BBC six years ago, because he could not live with its new management style, he began to work full time in his private business, making telescopic aluminium legs for yachts. Before Franklin, sailors who wanted to prop-up their yacht on a beach had to use lumps of wood, sometimes with disastrous results. Now, if they have fitted the Franklin system, they have a pair of adjustable legs which clip into special fittings on the sides of the boat. These legs can be extended to the sea bottom. When the tide goes out, the yacht can stand safely on its keel, steadied by the legs, while the sailors sun themselves. At the BBC, Franklin worked all hours at busy periods and took time off when work was slack. He used this spare time to start a business in his garage, making aids for the assembly of printed-circuit boards at EMI, ICL and other manufacturers. The idea for yacht legs came from his brother, an ocean-going yachtsman who wanted to buy a ready-made pair and found he could not. Franklin decided on light, corrosion-resistant aluminium as the best material but found that no-one stocked seamless tubes of the right strength and specification which could telescope together. He had to have dies made for tube extrusion. Even so, the manufacturer proved more adept at raising prices than extruding tubes to acceptable accuracy. Faced with a choice between giving up the business and finding a new supplier, he found Stubbs Metals, which not only supplied cheaper tubes to a better specification but also absorbed the die costs of Pounds 4,000. 'If there were more companies like Stubbs,' he says 'the economy of this country would be in better shape. He now has a new problem: premises. The workshop where he cuts, drills and coats his aluminium tubes is in a rebuilt barn near Slough, west of London. Next July, such workshops on farm premises will acquire users' rights under European legislation. South Buckinghamshire council is getting in first by issuing stop notices. Franklin says he and the other six small businesses on the farm can stave off eviction by taking their case to a public inquiry. But, even if they win, they will have to pay more rent because, for example, mains drainage will have to be installed. At present, he pays Pounds 3.50 a square foot - but, if you have no work, anything per square foot is a problem. Franklin yacht legs cost Pounds 350 to Pounds 950 a pair, and he sold 120 pairs in 1989. The recession struck in spring 1990. Turnover that year was Pounds 45,000, yielding no profit above Franklin's salary. Sales in 1991 will probably have been 75 pairs. 'At one period, I was sitting here for five weeks and didn't even get a phone inquiry.' Fortunately, he has paid for all his equipment out of income. 'We don't need high-precision machinery. We want salt water and sand to escape easily from the leg system.' People will keep treating him like a shop, though, so he has to keep stocks of expensive aluminium tubes and castings, which he finances with a Pounds 7,000 bank overdraft.' Franklin has taken advantage of the recession to design two new products: cheaper yacht legs, which dispense with two of the three castings in the standard model; and a frame to support yachts while they are worked-on in a boatyard. Since the frame is for use in the dry, it can be manufactured in steel and he believes there is a world-wide market. A boatyard is keen to take delivery of his second prototype but he reckons he needs several thousands pounds to go into full production. He says: 'It's easy to understand how recession feeds upon itself. We have a new product of high potential; but, on a reducing order book for our existing products, I am apprehensive about borrowing more, particularly with suggestions that interest rates may rise again.' Franklin displays his yacht legs in the London and Southampton boat shows. Most sales are direct to sailors but those to the boat trade are increasing. His terms are cash; no-one gets anything out of the workshop unless the cheque is in the bank. He has made some overseas sales but has found them time-consuming and expensive, with translation and bank charges. 'Freight costs are hard to estimate before a pair of legs are actually made, and you have to spend up to one hours with the freight company filling in the documentation.' Franklin concludes: 'Provided the recession does not become more acute, I am confident we can survive. Our biggest threat at the moment is premises. It seems a strange world when small, struggling businesses such as ours are threatened with eviction to deny us users' rights under EC law. We have struggled long and hard to produce a viable business.' The Yacht Leg Co, 30 Crosier Road, Ickenham, Uxbridge UB10 8RR.</p>

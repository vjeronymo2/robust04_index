			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Books: Relentless introspections - Fiction THEORY OF WAR by Joan Brady Andre Deutsch Pounds 14.99, 208 pages THE ORIENT-EXPRESS by Gregor von Rezzori Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 13.99, 208 pages COSMO COSMOLINO by Helen Garner Bloomsbury Pounds 13.99, 221 pages THE AMERICAN civil war may have ended in the official abolition of black slavery, but its chaotic aftermath also produced a new generation of human chattels: unwanted white children who were sold to the highest bidder for as little as Dollars 15. One of these 'bounden boys' was Joan Brady's grandfather. And in Theory of War, a fictionalised account of his life and her journey into the past, she explores the psychological legacy of slavery. At four, Jonathan Carrick is bought by Alvah, a sadistic tobacco farmer, and his dehumanised mate, Wify. He is beaten, tied up, and starved. They remove his teeth to sell them for dentures. But the main focus of Jonathan's inarticulate anger is not the brutish Alvah but his ambitious son George, who actively provokes the bounden boy's envy, setting in motion a lifetime's rivalry and resentment. At 15, Jonathan runs away. He eventually finds an education, a wife and a faithless vocation as a preacher. But he cannot escape his hatred for George, by now a successful politician. After half a century of separation, they are reunited in a final, fatal confrontation. Joan Brady's novel is in part an act of personal catharsis - an attempt to exorcise the emotional scars transmitted down the generations. But it also universalises the individual's story into a symbolic parable of human cruelty and its effects. If the novelist's artistry sometimes gets in the way of the raw experiences she describes, Theory of War still achieves a genuine tragic weightiness. Gregor von Rezzori's The Orient-Express is another novel about reclaiming the past. Its unnamed narrator, born into the pre-war cultural elite of central Europe, has been an American capitalist since the 1940s. At 65, afflicted by a delayed bout of adolescent angst, he decides to revisit the scenes of his real adolescence and take a trip on the newly refurbished Orient-Express. In what follows, the external journey is soon subordinated to an interior monologue which unfolds like a slow motion dream sequence. Fragments of memory appear and dissolve - and it is up to the reader to piece together the facts of the narrator's life. We see the fussy Armenian aunts of his childhood; his first sexual experience on a train with a woman in a silver turban; his student obsession, fed by an overdose of Nietzsche, with suicide. Central to his present ennui is an inability to forge emotional relationships with women. His thoughts return again and again to his alienated marriage and to his empty encounters with prostitutes. Cultural schizophrenic and nostalgia victim, von Rezzori's narrator is suffering from serious depression. At times his sanity seems under pressure. But though his states of mind are minutely recorded, he is too introverted to invite empathy. After all this relentless introspection, Helen Garner's ability to present characters actually relating to one another is something of a relief. Her world is low-key and domestic. But Cosmo Cosmolino - which contains two short stories in addition to the title novella - is wry, individual and stylistically mature. Garner's characters were young in the 1970s, caught up in the fashionable utopianism of the time. But the communes have long since dispersed, and, looking back, you have to decide whether the intervening years represent a growing up or a loss of innocence. The two short stories deal with death. In Recording Angel, a man contracts a brain tumour and we witness the effects on his wife and best friend. In A Vigil, a virtual suicide is followed by a hellish crematorium scene. But Cosmo Cosmolino itself is a story of rebirth, in which Janet's buried existence is given a jolt by the arrival of two lodgers, aimless Raymond and Maxine with her batty New Age ecstasies. Garner has an impressive ability to infect imaginative life into mundane objects, and to focus on an individual character or situation without generalising. Her choice of words is always eloquently precise. And it is the honesty of her prose style, rather than any particular gift for storytelling, which stands out.</p>

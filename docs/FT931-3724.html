			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: The franc marks time If the doom-mongers were to be believed, we should have been in the middle of another ERM crisis now that the French election is approaching. That the strains on the system have been limited is in part due to the troubles of Mr Boris Yeltsin which have conveniently depressed the D-Mark. Some pressure on the franc has been masked by intervention, particularly on Friday morning. Above all, expectations of a cut in Germany's official interest rates have held the more timid speculators at bay. That means, though, that this Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting has assumed increased importance whether the bank likes it or not. Some recent statements from bank officials suggest it regards the quarter point cut in its money market repurchase rates as enough for the time being. But, given expectations this cut has engendered, the disappointment if there is no follow-through would be significant. The bank would be sending a powerful signal that it would only cut rates slowly despite the deterioration in the German economy. That could immediately expose the French currency to speculative pressures that are currently more repressed than cured. It might also revive the debate over how long other ERM countries can survive with real interest rates far too high for the good of their economies. Last week again saw rumblings of concern in Portugal and Spain, while it is striking that, even after devaluation, Ireland still has to endure short-term interest rates of 11.5 per cent. It was always the case that the clouds over the ERM would lift only when the Bundesbank finally took decisive action on rates. It has not done so yet.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Procordia improves 14% to SKr1.12bn in first term PROCORDIA, the Swedish pharmaceutical and food group jointly controlled by Volvo and the Swedish state, announced yesterday a 14 per cent improvement in profits (after financial items) for the first three months of the year to SKr1.12bn (Dollars 189m). This compares with SKr928m for the same period of 1991. But in his final address to shareholders yesterday before he moves on to his new post as Volvo chief executive, Mr Soren Gyll, Procordia president and chief executive officer for the past eight years, warned that he did not expect the past twelve months of strong growth to continue for the rest of 1992. He added that Procordia would continue with its SKr1.4bn rationalisation programme so it could regain the profit level of SKr13.20 per share it enjoyed two years ago before its business merged with the Pharmacia drug group and Provendor, the food company. Last year Procordia doubled its profits to SKr4.2bn and a profit of SKr11.60 per share. Mr Gyll has not disguised his disappointment over the past few days at the failure of the proposed Procordia-Volvo merger in the face of opposition from the Swedish state. The compromise agreement entails the government selling off its entire shareholding in Procordia at the price and moment it feels appropriate with an increase in Volvo's voting rights in the company to 45 per cent. Today Mr Jan Ekberg becomes Procordia president and chief executive officer in place of Mr Gyll who takes over as Volvo chief executive at the same time, but who will also take on the chairmanship of the Procordia board. Mr Ekberg was previously head of Kabi Pharmacia, the group's pharmaceuticals business. Procordia's strong performance in the first quarter stems from a particularly impressive result from Kabi Pharmacia that reported a 22 per cent growth in sales over the period to SKr3.404bn from SKr2.781bn and a 19 per cent boost in operating income to SKr742m from SKr625m. The highest growth in sales of 59 per cent and in income was for peptide hormones with rising sales in Japan and Germany. Ophthalmics, with Healon as its principal product, increased its sales in most markets, especially Japan and the US. By contrast nearly all of the rest of Procordia's businesses recorded falls in operating income and sales with a 62 per cent drop in operating profits for its beverages division to SKr13m from SKr34m. A 48 per cent fall in operating profits in Pharmacia Biotech, was blamed on 'a poor investment climate for large instruments'. But the company's food business made a 12 per cent improvement in operating profits to SKr46m from SKr41m and there was an 8 per cent growth in operating profits to SKr208m from SKr192m for Procordia's tobacco and confectionery sectors.</p>

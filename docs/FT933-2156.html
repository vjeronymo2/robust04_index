			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Kohl attempts to reunite coalition after protest vote CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday chaired a crisis meeting of leaders of Germany's three coalition parties in an effort to paper over cracks in his ruling alliance. The parties suffered a decisive vote of no confidence in local elections in Hamburg on Sunday. Both Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and the opposition Social Democratic party admitted that a big protest vote in Hamburg in favour of the Greens, two extreme rightwing parties and an anti-party alliance was a warning to the traditional political establishment. The result was worse for Mr Kohl's CDU, with a slump in support from 35 per cent in 1991 to 25 per cent on Sunday, in spite of a swing against the ruling SPD government which saw it lose its overall majority in the city. SPD support fell from 48 per cent to 40.4 per cent. Mr Peter Hintze, general secretary of the CDU, warned that the splintering of support for the main parties would undermine future coalition government. The main parties must tackle the fundamental causes of protest, he said, including rising crime, unemployment, and the lack of cheap housing. The meeting yesterday did produce agreement on a social insurance plan to pay for nursing care for the elderly. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and leader of the liberal Free Democratic party, which lost all its seats in the Hamburg election, promised that he would not allow the coalition to collapse over the issue. Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the SPD, said the continuing rise of the extreme rightwing parties - although they failed to win any seats, they gained a combined 7.6 per cent of the vote - was 'alarming'. The Greens were the big winners in the city election, almost doubling their vote from 7.1 to 13.5 per cent, followed by the Statt Partei - literally the 'Instead of a Party' - which won eight seats in Hamburg with 5.6 per cent of the vote, although it has no political platform. The extreme rightwing parties, the Republicans and German People's Union (DVU) split the far right vote. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

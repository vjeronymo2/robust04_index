			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo pricing worries THE SETBACK in Lasmo shares continued and the stock was the worst performer in the Footsie list yesterday as rumours anticipated a change in the pricing of the proposed International Public Offer of shares in the Ultramar downstream interests. The concern followed last week's unexpected withdrawal of the planned GPA flotation. Last week, dealers were expecting the Ultramar interests to be priced at Dollars 19 to Dollars 22 a share, but by Monday, forecasts had been shaved to Dollars 17 to Dollars 19. By yesterday afternoon, forecasts had been reduced yet further, to around Dollars 15 a share. Last night, Goldman Sachs in New York put the range at Dollars 15 to Dollars 17. Lasmo plummeted 15 to 172p, its lowest level since December 1987. Turnover was a heavy 5.6m shares. Since last Wednesday the stock has fallen 37p. Abbey Nat'l shift The recent slide in the Abbey National share price, triggered by broker profits downgrades, was reversed yesterday after broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was said to have shifted its position on the shares from 'hold' to 'buy'. The stock rallied 7 to 274p on good turnover of 3.6m. Dealers said UBS, whose research in the housing/building society areas is highly respected by fund managers, had told its clients that Abbey's rating now fully reflected the scale of bad debts but not the expected recovery of inherently reliable earnings in 1993. James Capel, the leading agency broker, last week chopped its current year profits forecast for Abbey from Pounds 635m to Pounds 580m. UBS is said to be predicting profits of Pounds 600m. Bass upset Bass slipped 4 to 598p on suggestions that there is growing overcapacity in the UK beer market and on doubts about the benefit to the parent company from Holiday Inns, its US hotels subsidiary. Lehman Brothers was negative about Bass on both counts, saying that, as the largest brewer, Bass is easily the most exposed to the UK market. The US securities house said that after a recent visit to Foster's UK brewing arm it believed Courage is capable of producing much more beer at relatively little cost to itself. Lehman is also concerned that Holiday Inns will not produce the benefits hoped for, because only 13 per cent of its North American operation is owned or managed, with the other 87 per cent franchised, and as such is likely to be a much smaller beneficiary from any US economic upturn. Threats of overcapacity in the UK brewing industry hurt several shares, including Whitbread 'A', down 3 at 419p. Other drinks companies, with a greater exposure to the international spirits trade, had a firmer tone. Allied-Lyons gained 4 to 649p and Guinness 2 to 569p. Regional brewer Mansfield Brewery remained in demand, rising 10 to 720p. In a generally ragged oil and gas sector, British Petroleum came under fire early in the session, apparently weakened by bearish forecasts issued by at least two of the market's leading analysts of the sector, Kleinwort Benson and BZW, although this was not confirmed. BP retreated to 238p before stabilising and closing only a fraction off at 244p; turnover was 7.7m shares. Dealers expect more big downgrades of BP to follow. After receiving a battering on Monday, pharmaceutical shares bounced on a mixture of technical factors and specific features. Wellcome jumped 18 to 931p after stating that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved the use of a Roche product to be used in combination with Wellcome's Retrovir in the treatment of Aids. Recovering all of the previous day's loss, Glaxo leaped 23 to 712p as the market felt the threat from Sandoz's rival migraine treatment had been overdone. SmithKline Beecham benefited from the positive sentiment, advancing 24 to 884p. A downgrading by Kleinwort Benson knocked Pearson, the publisher's shares dipping 6 to 403p. The house lopped Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m respectively off this and next year's profits forecasts, now at Pounds 165m and Pounds 185m. Merchant banks were given a rough ride after a block of 420,000 shares in SG Warburg were crossed some 20p below the then ruling market price. At the close Warburg shares were 14 cheaper at 530p on turnover of 1.1m. Kleinwort Benson was also under pressure, finishing 13 weaker at 291p. Kingfisher, the Woolworth to B &amp; Q holding company, gave up 10 to 513p as analysts took a cautious view of the stock. Smith New Court lowered its profits forecast for 1992/93 by Pounds 10m to Pounds 230m, on the view that second-half recovery might not meet expectations. It was also suggested that SG Warburg Securities had cut its forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 240m on falling margins at B &amp; Q. High street retailer Burton was steady at 48 1/2 p after subsidiary Redcastle made a Pounds 100m zero coupon issue, aimed at raising Pounds 60m after expenses. The slide in Ratners continued with a penny decline to 8p, nearly halving the company's stock market valuation since the beginning of the month. The recovery in Ladbroke shares continued as County NatWest reiterated its positive stance, first made last week, and Kleinwort Benson marked it out as a long-term buy. Ladbroke gained 7 to 219p. The Kleinwort recommendation came in a comprehensive analysis of the gaming and gambling market, which it reports as making an unexpectedly fast recovery from the recession. The house also tips Rank Organisation, 6 to the good at 669p. Worries over a potential price war kept holiday group Airtours under a cloud, in spite of reporting good interim figures. The shares slipped 3 to 266p, while rival Owners Abroad lost 2 to 75 1/2 p. British Airways was in demand on hopes that the airline will benefit from European deregulation. The stock moved ahead 7 to 274p in brisk trade of 5.3m. Victaulic shares lost almost 10 per cent of their value after Hoare Govett weighed in with a profits downgrading. They ended 37 down at 344p, the second worst performing stock yesterday. Nerves ahead of next Monday's results continued in British Steel, which eased a penny to 69p. The announcement of the departure of the company's chief executive sent ML Holdings down 7 to 37p. Fenner firmed a penny to 81p as it was reported that Wassall, steady at 175p, now holds a 1.6 per cent stake in the company.

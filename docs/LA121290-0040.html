			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> COUNTY OKS STUDY BY AIR POLLUTERS  </P> <P> At least 19 Ventura County businesses that pollute the air will be required to  study whether their emissions could cause cancer in nearby residents under a  program unanimously approved Tuesday by the County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Companies targeted in the next two weeks by the county Air Pollution Control  District will have to inform the public whether the chance of contracting  cancer is greater that one in a million if a person lives nearby for 70 years,  said Karl E. Krause, manager of the air pollution district's engineering  section.  </P> <P> The program is based on the state Air Toxics Hot Spots Information and  Assessment Act of 1987.  </P> <P> The law requires air pollution control districts to determine the sources of  more than 400 contaminants released into the air.  </P> <P> Companies that emit more than 25 tons a year of pollutants submitted their  emission lists earlier this year.  </P> <P> The results of that inventory produced a list of 40 pollution sources in  Ventura County.  </P> <P> They include 20 oil field pumping stations, five manufacturing companies and  two defense contractors.  </P> <P> Officials are deciding which of the 40 companies must do health risk  assessments, Krause said.  </P> <P> He said he estimated that it would take officials another two weeks to come up  with the final list.  </P> <P> Of the 24 companies reviewed so far, 19 must do the assessments, he said.  </P> <P> Krause said he expected to decide on the remaining 16 companies in the next two  weeks.  </P> <P> The selected companies will have six months to perform health assessments,  including examining the height of smoke stacks or vents emitting the  pollutants, the proximity of neighborhoods and weather and wind patterns in the  area. The California Department of Health Services then has six months to  review the findings, Krause said.  </P> <P> If the studies show a significant health risk, state law requires the results  to be provided to all exposed people.

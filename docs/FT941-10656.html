			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: US rate hike takes the 'froth' off European bond markets US and European bond markets fell sharply in the wake of Friday's quarter point hike in US interest rates. However, dealers in Europe said activity was concentrated in the futures market, and selling in the cash market was controlled. By the end of the day, prices had steadied, and most markets appeared to have consolidated at lower levels. 'European markets had been rallying strongly so far this year, and traders took advantage of the US move to take some of the froth out of the market,' one trader said. UK gilts opened sharply lower, and lost further ground when the US market opened weaker. But by the end of trading, prices had recovered to Monday's opening levels. The March long gilt futures contract on Liffe ended at 116 17/32 , down  3/4 point on Friday's close, but little changed on the day. Although the UK is generally seen as lagging the US economic cycle by six months, it is ahead of the rest of Europe, so the advent of higher rates in the US reinforced expectations that the UK interest rate cycle will turn later this year. 'Over the medium term interest rates are going up - and that makes playing the yield curve much more dangerous,' said Mr John Kendall, an economist at Baring Brothers. The market showed little reaction to the release of stronger consumer credit data for December, which underlined the fact that economic recovery is gaining ground. A modest upturn in the level of pay settlements according to the latest survey by Incomes Data Services, the information and research organisation, also pointed to potential inflation problems. However, next week's inflation data is expected to show inflation under control. It was a bad day across the Continent for government bond markets yesterday, but continuing hopes of interest rate cuts in Europe helped many to end above the day's worst levels. In Germany, the long end suffered more than the short end, with yields on eight-year paper rising 12 basis points to 5.92 per cent and yields on 10-year bunds rising seven basis points to 5.84 per cent. Yields on two-year paper rose seven basis points to 5.24 per cent. 'There has been a general shift up the curve due to the weakness in US Treasuries and supply concerns,' said Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson. He added, however, that the market had found some comfort in comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the German Bundesbank and the Group of 10 central bank governors' chairman, that G-10 central bankers were not very concerned about the situation on foreign exchange markets following the Fed's decision to tighten monetary policy. Mr Tietmeyer's comments pushed up the March three-month Euro D-Mark contract from an opening level of 94.26 to 94.32 by the late afternoon. There were also glimmers of hope that the Bundesbank would announce a return to variable rate pacts this week which would enable the market to nudge the repo rate lower. However, some dealers believed that the Bundesbank would put off any cuts in official rates until early March. By the late afternoon, the March bund future on Liffe stood at 99.11 after a heavy day's trading, down 0.39 point on the day but off the day's low of 98.82. News that the Belgian National Bank cut its central rate to 6.70 per cent from 6.85 per cent helped French government bonds to make a late recovery on hopes that the newly independent Bank of France would cut its interest rates at its council meeting this week. A firm French franc also underpinned the market. Analysts said the weakness of the French economy and the fall in money supply growth justified an interest rate cut from 'la Bubette', as the French central bank is now affectionately known in the market. Italian government bonds rebounded from the day's lows as investors were attracted by their high yields. After hitting a low of 117.20, the March contract on Liffe recovered to 118.19 in late trading, up 0.09 point on the day. The Japanese government bond market was the only sizeable market able to remain immune from the US Federal Reserve's interest rate hike. The market ended the day little changed. In Japan, machinations over the fiscal package continued to dominate traders' attention. The latest expectations are for an agreement to be reached today and a new budget plan to be drawn up on Wednesday. However, expectations have been disappointed before, and the market remains sceptical. Dealers said that another reason for the ability of the Japanese market to decouple itself from outside forces is that, unlike other markets, it has lost substantial ground in recent weeks, due to concerns about supply. Consequently, traders were not looking for an excuse to take profits, said one economist. The US Treasury market yesterday failed to bounce back from a big sell-off on Friday, when a sharp decline was triggered by the Federal Reserve's decision to tighten monetary policy. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  11/32 lower at 98 7/32 , with the yield rising about 4 basis points to 6.38 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 7/32 , to yield 4.40 per cent. In early trading, selling pressure was most intense in longer-dated securities, which sank only about a half a point in the wake of the Fed's surprise announcement last week that its policy-making arm had voted to lift short-term interest rates. But prices stablised by midday, and climbed off their session lows in the afternoon. This week's influx of new supply was contributing to the market's continued weakness. The Treasury is scheduled to auction Dollars 17bn in three-year notes today and Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes tomorrow. But it was the Dollars 11bn sale of 30-year bonds on Thursday that was generating the most concern yesterday. The auction will come a day ahead of the release of January's producer price index, the next milestone in charting inflationary pressures which could undermine the long bond's value and influence the timing of a further tightening by the Fed. The PPI outlook is bearish, with forecasts centred on a 0.4 per cent jump in the overall index, and a 0.3 per cent gain after excluding energy and food prices, which tend to be most volatile.</p>

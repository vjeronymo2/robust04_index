			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Elsa Suarez; from the "National" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Taiwanese Government has decided to pardon 75  percent of Nicaragua's debt to Taiwan. The release of a  $30-million loan, which will be allocated to the  agricultural-livestock sector, has also been announced. Here is  Maria Elsa Suarez with a report:    [Begin recording] [Suarez] The pardon of 75 percent of the  Nicaraguan debt by the Taiwanese Government is equivalent to $16  million.    [Lim Ki Seng, Taiwanese ambassador in Nicaragua] The  negotiation to pardon the overdue debt is almost finished. We  have decided to pardon 75 percent--more than $16 million--of the  overdue debt. The remainder would be some $5 million.    [Suarez] He said the $30-million loan, which will be  allocated to the agricultural-livestock sector, will be arriving  in Nicaragua soon. Nicaragua is a magnet for Taiwanese private  investors, as reflected through the opening of the Fortec  [expansion unknown] factory and the future opening of a textile  factory in the duty-free area. Taiwanese investors also own 80  percent of the Intercontinental Hotel, in which they plan to  build new installations. More Taiwanese private investors, who  are interested in the fishing sector, will arrive on 23 January.    [Lim] Investors will come to investigate and [words  indistinct] fishing and pisciculture activities. They will only  stay in Nicaragua for four days, because they are touring three  Latin America countries. They will visit Colombia and  Argentina after Nicaragua. [end recording]</p>

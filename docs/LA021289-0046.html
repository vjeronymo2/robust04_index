			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER PROBLEM: 'THE DRY YEARS'  </P> <P> After reading your editorial I was struck by the gross inequity that would be  imposed by an across the board, mandatory 10% reduction in water usage. Last  summer, my husband and I, along with many of our friends and neighbors, cut our  water usage by 10%. To subsequently impose another 10% reduction on us and  others who voluntarily complied with the program would be, not only unfair, but  a hardship. I feel that the Department of Water and Power should either use the  usage figures from 1987 as the base value, or should look at setting a standard  for usage based on the size of the household and property.  </P> <P> SUSAN GROSSMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

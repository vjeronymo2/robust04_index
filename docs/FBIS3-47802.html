			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Challenge to the Aspiration </F> for Reunification"]    [Text] The Kim Yong-sam ring's fascist oppression maneuvers  become more vicious as the days go by.    According to Seoul radio, on 17 January the Seoul Police  Administration arrested Ho Hyon-chun, a senior at the Chonbuk  University, who was involved in the August 1993 Pan-National  Rally as vice chairman of the South side's Headquarters of the  National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's  Reunification [Pomchonghangnyon], and took him into custody on  charges of violating the National Security Law.    Student Ho Hyon-chun was wanted by the puppet police on the  charge of attempting to make a telephone call to a  representative of the Korean Student Council of the northern  half of the Republic, who was in Beijing, China, during the  inauguration ceremony of the Korea Federation of University  Student Councils held at the Koryo University last 28 May.    The puppet police arrested the vice chairman of the South  side's Pomchonghangnyon Headquarters at a time when the  aspiration for the fatherland's reunification has been  increasing among fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and  overseas since the beginning of the new year. This is a vicious  challenge to the fellow countrymen's aspiration for  reunification as well as an open fascist oppression of South  Korean youth and students' rightful struggle for the  fatherland's reunification and has caused a burning national  indignation.    As everyone knows, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song  taught in his historical New Year's address that all Korean  compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas should open a  new phase of the fatherland's reunification this year by  carrying out a nationwide struggle, united in one under the  banner of the great unity of the whole nation.    Greatly encouraged by the great leader's New Year's address,  the people in the northern half of the Republic have been  vigorously carrying out the struggle for socialist construction  and for the fatherland's reunification since the beginning of  the new year. The South Korean people and overseas compatriots  are also actively struggling to achieve the reunification in the  nineties, with a new aspiration for the fatherland's  reunification.    Reflecting this trend of the time, the South Korean  Democratic Party leader Yi Ki-taek held a New Year's news  conference and expressed his concern about the current  South-North relations and his willingness to visit Pyongyang and  meet the great leader in order to improve the deadlocked  South-North relations. Yang Hyong- sop, chairman of the DPRK  Supreme People's Assembly, supported and welcomed Yi's  willingness to visit Pyongyang, saying it is a natural  expression of intense patriotism by a person who is concerned  about the destiny of the country and the nation.    Now is the time for all fellow countrymen in the North, the  South, and overseas to launch into the struggle to achieve the  great national unity after overcoming ideological and systemic  differences. At this time, the South Korean puppets put a South  Korean student on the wanted list and finally arrested him  simply because he had attempted a telephone call to the North's  youth and students. This was like throwing cold water on the  South Korean students' and people's fervent aspiration for the  fatherland's reunification, and clearly showed the rascals' real  nature as the enemy of the reunification and fascist tyrants who  does not have the slightest will for reunification.    If the Kim Yong-sam ring really practiced civilian politics,  which they have noisily been advertising, how on earth could  they consider it a crime to attempt a telephone call to the  North's students for the fatherland's reunification that all  fellow countrymen earnestly desire and could they impute an  awful charge of violation of the National Security Law on him.    This act can be done only by those who pursue a permanent  division of the country, not its reunification; and national  confrontation, not its unity. In fact, the Kim Yong-sam ring  has not abolished the fascist evil laws and suppressive  organizations, such as the National Security Law and the Agency  of National Security Planning, while talking about reform. They  use them rather rashly to brutally oppress the South Korean  people's struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification.    Their ignorant and cruel fascist oppression maneuver of  considering it a crime to attempt to make a telephone call to  youth and students in the northern half of the Republic and of  punishing it shows that it is impossible for the South Korean  youth, students, and people to enjoy their democratic freedom,  to exercise their right to democracy, or even to discuss with  fellow countrymen over the reunification issue while leaving the  ring of civilian dictator Kim Yong-sam and the National Security  Law, a vicious fascist evil law and anti-reunification law, as  they are.    If the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique believes that they can  break the people's will for reunification by oppressing the  South Korean students' reunification movement, they are making a  wrong assumption.    The fatherland's reunification is the national task that  cannot be delayed any further and the South Korean people's  struggle for it is intensified more than ever.    The Kim Yong-sam ring should look straight at the  development  of the situation in South Korea, act discreetly, and resign from  power immediately.</p>

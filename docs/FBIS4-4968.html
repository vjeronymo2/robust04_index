			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Manirat Chitsamankun] </F>   [Text] Thai Embassy officials in Washington expect the  United States to link its decision to extend tax concessions to  Thailand to environmental protection issues when the Generalized  System of Preferences (GSP) agreement is reviewed in September.    A report from the embassy's commercial counsellor indicates  that environmental issues are among general social issues likely  to be considered in the review of the GSP for Thailand.    Addressing environmental issues through trade restrictions,  however, has been opposed by some conservation groups such as  Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the National Wildlife  Foundation [as published], which argue that it was difficult to  apply such pressure on trade.    The United States, the report noted is also likely to grant  concessions to an additional 40 developing countries, especially  from Africa.    Washington will further consider lowering the GSP's per  capita income ceiling condition for some countries, as it feels  the current set level is too high.    Meanwhile, the report said, US importers have lobbied for  higher levels of imported goods under the GSP programme,  especially for the three most active sectors -- textiles,  footwear and leather products.    But local producers of these products are strongly opposed  to  any increase, fearing an influx of cheap imports will hurt US  industries.    Washington has reduced import tariffs affecting US$19.5  trillion worth of goods under the GSP programme, cutting US$500  million from the normal level.    Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) recently informed the  Thai  Commerce Ministry that it will announce new conditions for Union  GSP privileges by June 15.    The EU is considering new tax concessions for its GSP  programme that will take into account the level of economic  development of exporting countries as well as the level of per  capita income.    The Foreign Trade Department expects the EU might cut the  volume of Thai exports in some categories under its GSP  programme.    Last year, Thai exporters took full advantage of the GSP  programme in many sectors, including textiles and apparel, yarn  and processed pineapple.    The European Union's new conditions for its GSP programme  are  expected to be introduced next year.</p>

The delegations are led by Akhsarbek Galazov and Ruslan Aushev.    Before the talks the head of the interim authority Vladimir  Lozovoy read out a government telegram signed by Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin. It says that the Cabinet worked out and  approved measures to carry out the Russian president's decree on  the return of refugees.

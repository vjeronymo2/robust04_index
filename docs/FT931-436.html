			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Sun Alliance It comes as a relief that Sun Alliance has found a use for surplus capital tied up in Codan, its Danish subsidiary. With minority shareholders to consider, the funds could hardly be syphoned back to plug holes in the UK balance sheet. Yet previous attempts at using Codan as a vehicle for Nordic acquisitions have fallen flat. Buying the insurance and financial services business of Hafnia from its collapsed holding company - at a price close to book value - thus looks like a good deal. Sun Alliance gains market leadership in Denmark at minimal cost to its depleted solvency ratio. The wonder is that Codan's winning bid was not pitched further above net assets. But Hafnia's problems - like those of Skandia and Baltica - stemmed from disastrous attempts at empire-building. The plight of the holding company may have eroded some goodwill in the insurance market. But with considerable scope for cost savings, Hafnia and Codan combined should still show a decent return on capital. That alone will not reverse Sun Alliance's fortunes. Next week's preliminary figures will doubtless confirm that exposure to mortgage indemnity insurance remains a millstone. Some solid overseas earnings would make such blunders easier to bear in future.</p>

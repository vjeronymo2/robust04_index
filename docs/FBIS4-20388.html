			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gu Chu (6253 0443): "Study Identifies Eleven </F> Social Diseases"]    [Excerpts] Under the organization and direction of Zhang  Ping [1728 5493], a research associate at the Sociology  Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences [CASS], and  working in their spare time, 13 researchers from the Legal  Studies Institute, Sociology Institute, Ministry of Supervision,  Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Public Health, and the  China University of Politics and Law, among others, collected  and analyzed for the first time the social problems facing China  today and put forward countermeasures. In so doing, they  accomplished an urgently-needed research mission on China's  current social ills.    They divided China's existing social problems into 11  categories, the foremost of which is the corruption and  dereliction of duty by government employees, as when they abuse  their office to further personal interests, take bribes,  squander away public funds, wine and dine, and send gifts. The  second problem is organized crime, which has been on the rise  since the 1970's and now directly threatens the people's daily  lives and law and order. The third problem is economic crime,  the fastest-growing crime. Next is the manufacturing of bogus,  counterfeit, or shoddy products, a pitfall on the road toward  creating a socialist market economy in China. The fifth social  disease is drug-related crime, which has been skyrocketing. The  sixth disease is prostitution, which goes hand in hand with the  seventh -- sexually transmitted diseases -- and eighth--the  proliferation of pornographic materials. The ninth disease is  the outright buying and selling of women and children, a gross  violation of their legitimate rights and interests and a cause  of the tenth disease, namely illegal marriage, which essentially  means early marriage, arranged marriage, bigamy, concubinage,  marriage between close relatives, and prohibited marriage. The  eleventh social disease involves feudal and superstitious  activities, which at one point were subsiding and diminishing  only to reappear openly and extensively in a variety of forms in  recent times.    Zhang Ping, the researcher, said that social problems and  social contradictions exist in any kind of society and that it  is precisely through the resolution of endless social problems  that a society matures. From the perspective of social control  research, the various diseases in China today--widespread  impermissible behavior, transgressions, and criminal  conduct--essentially belong at the first level of loss of social  control, that is, the break-down of methods or means, not bad  enough to endanger the existence and development of society.  However, if the break-down of methods is not checked  effectively and allowed to continue, it will escalate to the  next level, namely erosion of trust in and declining compliance  with all social norms, which will undermine the public's sense  of sacredness about such norms. If the break-down of methods is  allowed to reach the third level, the "disintegration of basic  goals," then "absolute lawlessness" will ensue and things will  get utterly out of control, leading to the collapse of the  entire body of social institutions.

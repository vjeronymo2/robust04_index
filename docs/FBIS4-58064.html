			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, 30 Apr (MENA) -- A spokesman for the Political  Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has accused the  military forces in Sanaa of continuing their buildup to besiege  and attack the 3d Armored Brigade in the new positions it  assumed after the attack against it in 'Imran.    In a statement this evening, the spokesman said the  aggression against the 3d Brigade in 'Imran was part of a  military and political plan worked out by the General People's  Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Reform Grouping. The attack was  launched after the "war speech" delivered by President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih on 27 April, he said.    The spokesman said President Salih is issuing instructions  to  chase and liquidate the 3d Armored Brigade and to send  reinforcements from the Republican Guards and the Central  Security forces. These forces, the spokesman added, are  assisted by battalions from the al-Majd Brigade moved from Babil  al-Jadidah [name as received].    The spokesman said in his statement that the military forces  in Yemen left the wounded from the 3d Brigade without medical  treatment and sent them to jails. They are being treated as  prisoners of war from a foreign army, not as the sons of the  unified homeland. The spokesman urged Red Cross and Red  Crescent societies and human rights organizations to extend the  necessary assistance to those soldiers and to save them from  torture.    The spokesman said the schemes currently being designed are  part of a horrible bloody adventure that will deeply hurt  Yemen's unity and security.    Attacking and chasing the 3d Brigade, the spokesman said, is  a crime that will not pass easily because it means declaring an  all- out civil war for which the separatists will be responsible.    Meanwhile, informed military sources in Aden have stressed  that the military forces in Yemen continue to reinforce the  Republican Guards, the Central Security, and the forces led by  brothers and aides of President Salih in many governorates to  escalate the military and political situation.    The sources said military reinforcements continued in the  Governorate of Ta'izz toward al-Rahidah and Jabal Bani Shu'ayb,  and the 3d Brigade was equipped to move toward the former border  between the two parts of Yemen.    The sources added that the Republican Guards forces and the  Central Security units in Dhamar were reinforced by two infantry  battalions from al-Majd Brigade to besiege the southern Basuhayb  brigade. President Salih and "his military family" are trying  to push the biggest force possible toward the oil-rich  Governorate of Shabwah, the sources added.</p>

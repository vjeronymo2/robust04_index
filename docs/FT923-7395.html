			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / TV adds to pressure on Collor OPPOSITION parties plan to increase the pressure on Brazilian President Fernando Collor, whose administration is beset by allegations of corruption, in prime-time television election broadcasts starting last night. Mr Collor's opponents hope to score points by attacking the president and harping on the corruption claims. The national scandal is likely to take precedence over local issues in the nightly broadcasts. Free TV and radio time, awarded to big parties under Brazilian electoral law, will continue at least until the first round of municipal elections on October 3. Cracks have also begun to appear in the Liberal Front party (PFL), the anchor of Mr Collor's coalition support. Mr Joaquim Francisco, the PFL governor of the northeastern state of Pernambuco, has withdrawn his backing of the president. The report of the congressional commission investigating the activities of Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's campaign treasurer and the focus of the corruption allegation, is to be completed on Saturday and presented to the committee for approval on August 26. The report will serve as the basis for impeachment charges against the president. A poll by DataFolha, associated with the opposition newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo, showed that 70 per cent of those surveyed in 11 cities want the Congress to remove Mr Collor from office. AP adds from Braslia; The powerful Brazilian Bar Association said yesterday it would support impeachment of the president.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Hidden hurdles for Uruguay Round - The clouds are gathering over next month's Marrakesh meeting When ministers from more than 100 countries gather in Marrakesh, Morocco, next month to sign the Uruguay Round, there is bound to be much self-congratulation on having achieved the most far-reaching world trade liberalisation package in history. However, their festive spirit will be tempered by awareness that the deal will not be finally in the bag until it has been ratified by their own legislatures - or at least by most of the economically more important members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. And on that score, a number of worrying uncertainties remain. Negotiators have agreed in principle that the process should be completed in time for the Round's provisions, including establishment of the planned World Trade Organisation, to take effect by July 1 next year. But urged on by the Gatt secretariat, several leading industrialised powers have indicated that they are aiming for ratification by the end of this year. Though the deadline is informal, it has started to acquire considerable psychological importance in Geneva. However, it also looks increasingly ambitious. While all governments say they are confident of mustering the necessary legislative backing, there are growing risks that ratification could be sidetracked in several national capitals by procedural complications or by political obstacles not directly related to trade policy. Serious delays among the 'Quad' powers - the US, the European Union, Japan and Canada - would defer realisation of the economic benefits of further trade liberalisation. Equally important, they could check the momentum by lessening the pressure on other, smaller, countries to ensure speedy ratification of the Round. Until recently, the main doubts centred on the prospects for early action by the US Congress. Not only have these deepened since the start of this year; but fresh uncertainties have emerged about the outlook in the EU, where an internal wrangle has arisen over jurisdictional issues, and in Japan, where parliament is already late with its existing timetable. In the US, the Clinton administration had originally aimed for congressional ratification before the summer recess. But the timetable has been jolted by the need to compensate for revenue losses caused by planned tariff cuts. The losses have been put at at least Dollars 13.5bn (Pounds 9.2bn) over five years. Mr Richard Gephardt, leader of the House Democrats, has suggested they could total Dollars 40bn in the next decade. Under budget rules, the shortfall must be made good by tax rises or reduced spending. In Europe, the fate of the Round has been complicated by an arcane controversy about who is entitled to ratify it on behalf of the EU. The European Commission, backed by the European parliament, claims it has the necessary authority. But most member governments disagree. The 12 contend that while the commission was empowered to negotiate on their behalf, EU law requires that their own parliaments approve those parts of the package dealing with the creation of the WTO, liberalisation of services and intellectual property rights. In an effort to resolve the row, Brussels plans next month to seek an opinion from the European Court. The commission claims to be confident of a decision in its favour which would enable it to ratify the entire agreement and leave national parliaments to give their assent at their leisure. However, there are two possible catches. One is that the court is unlikely to rule before autumn at the earliest. The other is that if its ruling goes against Brussels, the EU will be unable to ratify the Round until it has been approved by every national parliament. The Japanese parliament will be unable to tackle the Uruguay Round during its current session because of blocking tactics by the Liberal Democratic party, which has refused to discuss the coming year's budget until prime minister Morohiro Hosokawa divulges more details about a Y100m (Pounds 637,000) loan from a trucking company. The package will be submitted to a special parliamentary session in the autumn, which will also be asked to consider controversial tax reform proposals and a bill to redraw the country's electoral boundaries. 'It is going to be a very tight schedule,' says Mr Koro Bessho, director of the foreign ministry's Gatt division. Additional reporting by Will Dawkins in Tokyo, and Nancy Dunne in Washington.</p>

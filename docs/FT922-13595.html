			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Fed displays its determination: A look at the timing of the latest easing in monetary policy YESTERDAY'S surprise easing of monetary policy by Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, is a sign of his determination to ensure that this year's fledgling economic recovery does not fizzle out, as happened last year. But the timing of the Fed's signal of a  1/4 -point cut, to 3.75 per cent, in the key federal funds rate also reflected the plunge in share prices in Japan, which has unsettled the US stockmarket. The immediate reaction on Wall Street was positive, with both share and bond prices gaining ground. The Fed's move was the first since late December, when it announced a one-point cut in the discount rate to 3.5 per cent and a  1/2 -point cut in the federal funds rate to 4 per cent. The fed funds rate is the rate at which banks lend to each other. Yesterday's announcement followed the release of encouraging inflation figures. The producer price index for finished goods rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 0.9 per cent in the year to March. Figures for 'core' producer prices, which exclude food and energy, were also subdued, suggesting that inflation at the retail level will be moderate even if the sluggish recovery gathers momentum. Many analysts had assumed that the next move in interest rates would be up rather than down. A surge in retail sales in January and February seemed to indicate the economy was shaking off its lethargy. But in the last week or so confidence began to be eroded again. The biggest setback was last Friday's employment report for March. This showed a paltry 19,000 increase in employment. Economists fear that, if employment does not recover, personal income will not grow and the revival of consumer spending will grind to a halt. Many analysts also worry that the retail figures were distorted by warm weather and faulty seasonal adjustments, and therefore exaggerated the revival of demand. In addition to fears about the real economy's strength, Mr Greenspan is acutely aware that monetary growth is losing momentum. In recent weeks, M2, the main targeted measure of broad money, has fallen sharply, reducing its growth rate to 3 per cent, or just above the bottom of its 2.5-6.5 per cent target range. The White House, keen to ensure a recovery in election year, has been warning the Fed not to allow the money supply to stop growing, as happened last year. The Fed's move was probably also designed to put downward pressure on mortgage rates, which have risen in recent months, taking the edge off a mild recovery in residential housing. A  1/4 -point cut, however, is unlikely to have a great impact either here or on banks' prime lending rates, currently 6.5 per cent. If the economy shows further signs of weakness, speculation about another cut in the discount rate is likely to mount.</p>

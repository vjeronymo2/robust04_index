			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Honduran Armed Forces want to break the  Military Assistance Treaty signed in 1954 with the U.S.  Government because they believe the treaty is obsolete and is no  longer of any benefit to the nation.    The above was reported by CNN international, which also said  that the presence of U.S. troops in Latin America continues to  cause problems for some nations of the region. [passage omitted]    When questioned about the issue, President Carlos Roberto  Reina commented: "We should study the issue and see if this  installation can benefit Honduras and our new agenda."    To end the treaty, the CNN report concluded, is the  prerogative of the president. Meanwhile, the Armed Forces are  trying to obtain the support of civilians to achieve their goal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Liu Shuqing, president of the Chinese People's  Institute of Foreign Affairs, who is visiting the ROK, said  today that China will oppose to resolve the North Korean nuclear  issue by applying sanctions, stressing that to take a  countermove of sanctions against North Korea will only  complicate the issue.    President Liu came to Seoul to hold discussions with the ROK  on the detail of forming the ROK-PRC Forum, which will be  inaugurated in June. His remarks attract the public eye because  he is a core person in charge of China's diplomacy who was vice  foreign minister and occupied other important posts.    President Liu asked back if any problem had ever been  resolved through international sanctions and said that, although  the North Korean nuclear issue had occasionally faced obstacles,  progress was truly made in resolving the issue through dialogue  between North Korea and the United States and between North  Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency. He continued  to say that on the ground of this progress, China believes  firmly [hwaksin] that the North Korean nuclear issue will be  resolved through dialogue.    President Liu also said that he had met North Korean  President Kim Il-song many times, but he would not play the role  of a mediator between South and North Korea for resolving the  nuclear issue because there are dialogue channels between the  two.</p>

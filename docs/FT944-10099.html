			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Landlords serve notice on chancellor: Robyn Chalmers looks at what the private-rented sector wants Clarke to deliver in the Budget Pressure is mounting for the government to introduce financial incentives to private landlords who fear that cuts in housing benefit expected in this month's Budget will undermine the private housing market. Banks and building societies which provide loans to housing associations are also concerned that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, under pressure from rightwing Tories, may have opted to curtail the Pounds 8bn spending on housing benefit. More than two-fifths of private tenants are estimated to receive the benefit and any cut could damage the fragile recovery of the private-rented sector, which has grown from about 1.8m units in 1988 to about 2m last year. Lobbying groups argue that the market is also threatened by the ending of the business expansion scheme (BES) and the tentative upturn of the residential property market. The private-rented sector was ignored in last year's Budget, in spite of the government's wish to expand the market. Interest groups, including the Association of Residential Letting Agents, the independent Housing Investment Group and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, are looking for positive steps this month. The main proposal backed by these groups is for the establishment of authorised housing investment trusts to promote institutional investment. These would be backed by government grants of up to 25 per cent of the cost of properties. A recent report by the Housing Investment Group and the letting agents association estimates that grants of up to Pounds 250m a year supporting a total investment of Pounds 1bn would provide 16,600 new or reconditioned properties at an average cost to the exchequer of Pounds 15,000 a home. Other proposals which have been floated include grants for capital costs, depreciation allowances and tax concessions. The recent growth of the private-rented market has come largely on the back of the BES scheme and the poor state of the housing market. The BES was expensive and short-lived, bringing 76,000 units to the market over five years at a cost to the public purse of Pounds 24,000 each. Many are expected to be sold for home ownership when tax concessions end after four years. Professor Peter Kemp, director of York University's Centre for Housing Policy, maintains that the size of the private-rented sector is likely to be affected at the margin by what happens to house prices. He said: 'If house prices increase substantially, and especially if there is another boom, the size of the sector is likely to fall to some extent.' He added that returns for many landlords were low compared with alternative investments. 'There seems little prospect of the major financial institutions being attracted into the sector unless subsidy is provided to close the yield gap,' he said. But Mr John Roberts, of the Department of the Environment, argued recently that the point of a private rental market was that it should not depend on large government subsidies or unduly favourable tax treatment. 'The public sector cannot and need not meet all housing needs,' he said. The cost of both housing benefit and of income support for mortgage interest payments have spiralled in recent years. It is therefore in the government's interest to promote reasonably priced rental housing for poorer tenants who will be hardest hit by any housing benefit cut. By the same token, it is seeking to reduce the role played by local authorities in the sector by promoting a more market-orientated provision. Prof Kemp, in recently published research, said the government could consider reducing the maximum housing benefit from the current 100 per cent and implementing rent ceilings - two proposals aimed specifically at combating high rents in the sector. But he was not convinced that either method would achieve the required results.</p>

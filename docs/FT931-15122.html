			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Net assets down at Aberforth Split The net asset value of Aberforth Split Level Trust was 181.7p per capital share at December 31, down from 196.7p at the trust's July year-end and 185.9p at end-December 1991. Net revenue for the six month period amounted to Pounds 804,000, down from Pounds 842,000 last time, equivalent to earnings of 5.36p (5.61p) per income share. An unchanged second interim dividend of 2p is declared, making 4p to date; directors warned, however, that it was unlikely that last year's total of 9p would be maintained.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The United Nations says that foreign troops in  Rwanda will be given another 24 hours to evacuate foreigners.  The United Nations has made new agreements with the Patriotic  Front and with government units. Previously, the Patriotic  Front had said that the evacuation operation had to be over by  yesterday evening. There are about five Belgian citizens left  in Rwanda. Apart from that, there are 10 journalists at Kigali  airport.    In the meantime, about 200 Belgian paratroopers have arrived  in Kenya. In the course of the day as many other soldiers as  possible will be withdrawn from Rwanda -- their exact number  depends on the circumstances on the spot.</p>

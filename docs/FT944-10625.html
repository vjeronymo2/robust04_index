			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / German parties near deal on coalition agenda Talks between the three German parties hoping to form the next government are due to end on Friday, Mr Peter Hintze, general secretary of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democratic Union, said yesterday. At the same time, the CDU, the Christian Social Union, its Bavarian sister party, and the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the coalition, expect to elect the Chancellor on November 15. A cabinet is expected to be chosen within the next 10 days. Unlike previous coalition negotiations which lasted several weeks, these talks, which have drawn up a rough policy agenda for the next parliament, have tended to highlight similarities rather than differences. The main differences, many of which were narrowed if not resolved yesterday, have focused on taxation. One disruptive issue - increased powers for police to introduce bugging in private homes - has been deleted from the agenda, while greater access for citizenship for the 6.8m foreigners in Germany will be discussed on Friday. During yesterday's session, Mr Hintze said a controversial 'solidarity' or income tax surcharge of 7.5 per cent would be decreased over time if the annual financial transfers to the five east German states were gradually reduced. More than DM160bn (Pounds 65.3bn) each year is allocated to east Germany for, among other things, modernising the infrastructure and subsidising pensions and consumer spending. However, these transfers have increased the budget deficit which this year is expected to be DM68bn. As a means of reducing the deficit, the incoming coalition government will re-impose the solidarity tax which had been introduced after German unification in 1990 but was dropped in 1993. It is expected to raise DM28bn. CDU and CSU officials stressed, however, that any reduction in the annual financial transfers and the solidarity tax was linked to a continuing economic upswing, in eastern as well as west Germany. All sides also agreed to raise the threshold at which income tax is payable, said Mr Erwin Huber, general secretary of the CSU. However, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday found himself at loggerheads with a commission of experts, which he appointed, about how to finance this. After a year's work, the eight-man commission told Mr Waigel he would need around DM40bn in order to raise the threshold to DM13,000, up from DM5,616. Mr Waigel must introduce the changes by the beginning of 1996 to fulfil a ruling by the constitutional court, Germany's supreme court, but has said he will need only an extra DM15bn to do so. Mr Waigel also rejected the commission's suggestion that unemployment and other welfare benefits and pensions should be taxable.</p>

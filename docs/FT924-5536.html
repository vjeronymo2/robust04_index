			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Market-Testing in Whitehall: Courts Charter attacked for not improving access to law THE much-delayed Courts Charter, published yesterday as part of the prime minister's Citizen's Charter programme, was dismissed by lawyers and consumer groups as a cosmetic exercise irrelevant to the real issue of access to justice. The charter, designed to guarantee national standards of service for court users in England and Wales, was attacked by the Consumers' Association for its failure to offer compensation to victims of administrative error by court staff. The Lord Chancellor's Department already pays compensation to people who have suffered financial loss because of negligence by court staff. Last year the department paid out almost Pounds 600,000, but the charter makes no mention of entitlement to compensation. Launching the charter, Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, said there was no mention of compensation because when something went wrong it was more important to put it right. The Law Society said that while the commitment to clearer information for court users and better procedures for handling witnesses and victims were welcome, the charter was 'very disappointing'. The society said it was sceptical about its benefits and surprised to find no commitment to flexible court opening hours, the improving of case listings, better accommodation for the disabled and the establishing of court-based advice services for housing and debt. Mr Paul Boateng, Labour's legal affairs spokesman, said the charter sought 'to hide an increasingly run-down and under-resourced justice system behind a glossy veneer that bears no relation to the reality'. The charter did nothing to address the central issue of equality under and equal access to the law, he added.

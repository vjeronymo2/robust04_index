			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on statement to parliament by the Finance Ministry </F> on the 1994 budget -- read by announcer]    [Text] The government has decided to raise the tax-free  concession from 150,000 to 210,000 cedis per annum. The tax  rate applicable to other lower income earners has also been  reduced. This is to prevent individuals in the lower income  group from being liable to higher taxes in view of the recent  increase in the minimum wage. This was contained in this year's  budget proposal presented to parliament today by the minister of  finance, Dr. Kwesi Botchwey.    Other tax rates on personal incomes are as follows: From  291,000 to 392,850 cedis will attract 5 percent; and 431,000 to  573,300 cedis, 10 percent. On indirect taxes and import duties  on all goods which are imported under exemption and  concessionary rates, will now attract a rate of 10 percent,  while those classified as standard and luxury will now attract  25 percent. [sentence as heard]    In the case of sales tax, imports, the rates of goods  classified as concessionary and standard have been reduced to 15  percent while those for luxury goods remain at 35 percent.  Building materials will now attract a concessionary rate of 10  percent import duty. Dr. Botchwey explained that this has become  necessary in view of the gross abuse of the decision to remove  all customs and import duties on certain building materials.    On the question of Ghana Investment Center concessions, the  government is of the view that the exemptions of saloon cars,  office equipment, and consumables are excessive and unnecessary  for the effective promotion of investment in the country. In  this regard, granting of these exemptions will be thoroughly  reviewed.    Dr. Botchwey said the government has also responded to the  complaints of manufacturers by looking more closely at the  structure of existing tariffs with a view to ensuring that there  is no unintended but inherent discrimination against domestic  producers. Therefore, finished imported commodities will in  future not attract less taxes than the amount payable on their  domestically produced equivalent merely by underdeclaration of  value of the competing imports.    On petroleum duties, Dr. Botchwey said an amount of 216.8  billion cedis has been projected as petroleum tax this year.  And to obtain this revenue, it is proposed that petroleum  prices be increased by an average of 18 percent and remove the  subsidy on premix. The increase in the price of kerosene will  be 10 percent.    Dr. Botchwey explained that in view of the dramatic changes  in the subregion, especially the devaluation of the CFA [franc]  and the policy changes in Nigeria, it would not be in the  national interest to keep prices at the 1993 levels. He said  for some time now, many importers have been buying all kinds of  goods including secondhand or used goods into the country under  the trade liberalization scheme. Some of these have proved to  be harmful to the health of the users. Accordingly, he proposed  the banning of secondhand goods such as undergarments, towels,  socks, handkerchiefs, bedsheets, pillowcases, mattresses, and  sanitary wear.    On general economic targets, Dr. Botchwey said real GDP  [gross domestic product] is expected to grow by 5 percent and  end of period inflation rate, 15 percent. An overall balance of  payment surplus of $180 million is to be achieved. A budget  surplus of 68 billion cedis is also expected.    He said to achieve these targets and create the foundation  for accelerated growth, it will be necessary to raise the  investment-GDP ratio to at least 15 percent this year from 12.9  percent in 1992. This, he said, is to be financed by increases  in domestic savings.    Consequently, the government's role in savings mobilization  effort will be crucial, as it would be expected to reverse the  huge fiscal deficits generated over the last two years into a  substantial surplus to be channeled into productive investment  in both the private and public sectors of the economy.    Dr. Botchwey said the 1994 budget provides for total  appropriation of about 1,000 billion cedis, while total revenues  including grants are projected at 1,078 billion cedis,  (?implying) a surplus of 68 billion cedis. [as heard] He said  to achieve this target, there is the need for further  streamlining of the tax system, improvement in the efficiency of  tax administration, reform of the tax structure, as well as the  elimination of the lapses in tax administration.    With regard to expenditures, he said they have been  programmed to support income-generating activities and poverty  alleviation through income redistribution.    Total expenditures have been projected to rise from a  provisional outturn in 1993, from 782.9 billion cedis to 1,000  billion -- a rise of 29 percent. Recurrent expenditures will  amount to 742.4 billion cedis compared to 596.6 billion in 1992.  Expenditure on personal emoluments is to rise to 274.5 billion  cedis from 227.6 billion.    Negotiations are to be conducted with the Civil Servants  Association within the framework of the civil service machinery  to determine the appropriate parameters for income policy for  the year.    Outlays for repairs, maintenance, and renewals are projected  to rise by 27.7 percent to 114.4 billion as against a  provisional outturn of 91.1 billion cedis last year.    Dr. Botchwey said education and health sectors are to have  larger allocations to enable them to improve upon their  services. The education sector will be expected to provide more  textbooks and other accessories, while the health sector will  concentrate on an accelerated rehabilitation of health  facilities as well as the provision of adequate drugs and  dressings.    He said the allocation for subvented organizations has been  projected to rise to 95.1 billion from 75 billion in 1992 -- an  increase of 26.8 percent. Also, transfers in respect of  pensions, gratuities, and social security contributions are  estimated at 79.7 billion compared to 64.8 billion in 1993 -- a  rise of 22.9 percent.    Dr. Botchwey said interest on domestic debt is expected to  rise from 91.9 billion cedis in 1993 to 114.2 billion in 1994.  This increase, he said, is due to the large bank and nonbank  borrowing to finance the deficit in 1993. Interest on external  debt is to rise from 43.9 billion in 1993 to 61.3 billion in  1994. Dr. Botchwey explained that the increase is mainly due to  expected exchange rate depreciation.</p>

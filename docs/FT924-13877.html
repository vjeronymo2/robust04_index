			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (13): Widening horizons worked - Profile of 3COM A PIONEER of local area networking technology, 3Com is also proving to be a survivor. The Silicon Valley company which played a vital role in creating the local area network (LAN) market in the early 1980s is making a strong come-back after refocusing its product line on global networking hardware two years ago. Founded in 1979, 3Com commercialised 'Ethernet' networking technology, which remains a pervasive industry standard for PC networks. Ethernet 'adapter cards' - add on circuit boards that plug into personal computers and enable them to be linked to a network - remain 3Com's bread and butter products and represent over half of the company's revenues. Ill fated attempts, in the late 1980s, to broaden the company's participation in the markets for network servers and diskless PCs for networks were jettisoned last year. 3Com also withdrew from the network operating systems market in which it had first attempted to establish its own software standard and then linked with Microsoft by backing LAN Manager. Already, however, 3Com's new focus on global networking is paying off. In September, 3Com announced first quarter 1993 net income of Dollars 4.8m on record sales of Dollars 130.9m. New product orders totalled Dollars 125.9m. For fiscal 1992, ending May 31, 3Com reported total revenues of Dollars 408.4m, up from Dollars 393.6m in 1991. Net income was Dollars 13.3m, down from Dollars 15.4m in the previous year, when the company recorded restructuring charges of approximately Dollars 43m. Mr Eric Benhamou, 3Com's president and chief executive, attributes the company's new-found strength to two strategic directions: a relentlessly global outlook and a steady stream of broad product line announcements to address important links in the networking chain. The company is now focused upon four core product lines; network adapters, terminal servers, wiring systems and hubs and internetworking platforms. In September, for example, 3Com simultaneously announced 12 new hardware products in Budapest, Hong Kong, Paris, Sao Paulo, Stockholm and Milan. These products range from network adapter cards, to structured wiring hubs for directing and managing networks, to bridgers and routers for connecting local and remote networks. These are some of the fruit of Dollars 120m spent in research and development over the past three years as 3Com beefed up one of the industry's broadest product lines. In April 3Com launched the well-received NETbuilder II router that positions it solidly in 'internetworking', the trend toward linking far-flung local and wide area networks which enables users to connect their existing incompatible networking equipment without having to purchase a completely new networking system. The internetworking market has huge growth potential. According to Frost and Sullivan, the US market research firm, 70 to 80 per cent of the 3.7m LANs installed to date have yet to be linked to internetworks. With the number of LANs expected to grow to 12.7m by 1995, growth in the internetworking market may even exceed the pace of growth in the LANs. 3Coms other product plans include an Etherlink family of adapter cards for the 100 megabit-per-second Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) marketplace. These products are aggressively priced yet carry good profit margins, analysts say. The company has also announced a strategy for Asynchronous Transfer Mode products. It also is expected to launch adapter card products for use in Apple Macintosh computers and portable PCs. 3Com still faces some stiff competition. In the adapter board business, for example, Intel, the leading microprocessor manufacturer, has been making a run at becoming a big time player with aggressively priced 16-bit cards. 3Com also faces stiff competition in the internetworking market from companies such as Cisco Systems and Wellfleet. Nonetheless, 3Com has positioned itself to participate in the fastest growing segments of the networking equipment market and in particular is targetting the European market. This year, 3Com announced the acquisition of the networking operations of BICC Group plc, Europe's largest manufacturer of networking hubs. The acquisition is expected to strengthen 3Com's market position by expanding its hub and low-end internetworking lines. 3Com has also recently opened a new manufacturing plant near Dublin, Ireland. The new plant, in Blanchardstown, represents an investment of Dollars 16.5m and is 3Com's first production plant outside the US. Totaling 60,000 square feet and expected to employ 175 people within four years, the new facility has been specifically designed for the production of 3Com's network adapter cards but may, if necessary, be expanded to produce internetworking products, the company said.  -----------------------------------------------       ETHERNET ADAPTER CARDS MARKET SHARE  ----------------------------------------------- 1992                                    %  ----------------------------------------------- 3Com                                   29 Standard Microsystems                  21 Anthem Electronics                     14 Racal                                   7 Digital Equipment                       5  ----------------------------------------------- Source: International Data Corp  -----------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------                 ROUTER MARKET SHARE  ----------------------------------------------- 1991                                   %  ----------------------------------------------- Cisco Systems                         51 3Com                                  11 Wellfleet                              9 Digital Equipment                      7 Proteon                                6  ----------------------------------------------- Source: The Yankee Group  -----------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Brazilian Supreme Court acquits Collor Mr Fernando Collor, who resigned the Brazilian presidency in 1992 amid corruption allegations, was yesterday cleared of such charges by the country's Supreme Court. The acquittal is likely to strengthen his determination on a political comeback next century. An earlier ruling still bars Mr Collor, 45, from public office until 2000. He was cleared of the charge of 'passive corruption' by five of the eight judges hearing the case. The three dissenters agreed with prosecutors that Mr Collor and the man then his campaign treasurer, Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, were in an influence-peddling scheme which offered political favours for financial contributions. Mr Farias, now in jail for tax evasion, was also cleared of the passive corruption charge, but he faces four other charges. Judges ruling for Mr Collor said prosecutors had failed to provide proof linking him to Mr Farias's fund-raising. The case against the former president was further weakened when some prosecution evidence was ruled inadmissible because it had been seized without a court order. Mr Collor's acquittal is a severe embarrassment for Congress, which stripped him of his political rights and tried to impeach him. He resigned as president during the impeachment procedure. Several leading politicians said they were disappointed by the court's ruling, which they described as being based on 'technical' legal reasons. Mr Collor, who by the end of his term in office was so unpopular that thousands of protesters massed on the streets, did not attend the judgment. Public resentment has turned to apathy and a recent newspaper survey found that, although most people thought Mr Collor was guilty, less than half thought he would be so judged.</p>

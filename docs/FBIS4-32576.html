			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jan Rezac: "Last Year Social Security Saved the </F> State Budget 11.4 Billion Korunas"]    [Text] The final state budget report presented by the  Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, which was discussed by the  government yesterday, indicates that revenues based on social  security premiums and other revenues of the ministry amounted to  a total of 106.198 billion korunas [Kc] for 1993. When compared  to the adjusted budget at Kc97.151 billion, this amounts to a  difference of Kc9.047 billion. In the expenditures column,  Kc2.353 billion was shown as savings because the budget  anticipated expenditures of Kc121.965 billion and actually  expended Kc119.611 billion for social security transfers. The  overall positive balance in this chapter of the state budget  thus amounts to Kc11.4 billion, according to what Ctirad  Ondracka, budget director of the Ministry of Labor and Social  Affairs, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY.    The excess of revenues was mostly due to insurance premiums  paid for workers, which accounted for revenues of Kc100.792  billion, which means Kc7.958 billion more than was anticipated  by the budget, which had figured on Kc92.835 billion. The reason  was a virtual increase of 600,000 workers over what had been  anticipated when the budget was being written, as well as a  higher aggregate of basic assessments, upon the basis of which  insurance premiums are computed. Higher revenues were also the  result of insurance premiums paid by self-employed individuals.  Arrears in insurance premiums amounted to Kc2.83 billion (2.7  percent) and were caused primarily by the insolvency of payers.    Revenues for old-age pension purposes amounted to Kc80.052  billion; those for hospitalization insurance were Kc13.75  billion, and revenues based on the state employment policy  amounted to Kc11.875 billion. Transfers for old-age pensions  amounted to Kc72.4 billion, those for health benefits amounted  to Kc11.961 billion, and the total paid out in conjunction with  employment policy amounted to Kc3.146 billion. Overall  expenditures (including administrative costs) were Kc88.647  billion, and overall revenues amounted to Kc106.198 billion. The  difference between revenues for insurance and expenditures for  pensions, health benefits, and employment policy thus amounts to  approximately Kc17.5 billion. In answer to a question by  HOSPODARSKE NOVINY as to how this surplus was utilized, Director  Ondracka responded that, according to law, the revenues based on  insurance premiums are part of the state budget that is used to  defray all social transfers, and he said that the law had been  adhered to. In terms of expenditures, it is necessary to include  the state equalization contribution, which last year amounted to  Kc6.1 billion, as well as the state transfers. The Ministry of  Labor and Social Affairs last year engaged in a number of social  measures that were not covered by the approved budget. According  to Ondracka, this means that, were it not for these revenues  based on insurance premiums, the Ministry of Labor and Social  Affairs would not have been able to fund Kc2.8 billion worth of  these measures.    Jindrich Vodicka, minister of labor and social affairs,  noted  in this connection that, although some components involving the  collection of insurance premiums appeared to be a sort of  quasi-surplus, the overall balance of revenues based on  insurance premiums and all transfers is negative (revenues of  Kc106.2 billion, expenditures of Kc119.6 billion).    After including the state equalization contribution in  pensions paid out--something that is being readied for this  year--there will actually not be any surplus. If, given the  current development of unemployment, the contribution for the  state employment policy becomes reduced by 1 percentage point,  there will most likely even be a mild deficit. These possible  adjustments in financing the system of social security are now  being discussed with the Ministry of Finance. The government is  not considering establishing an independent fund for social  security, said J. Vodicka.</p>

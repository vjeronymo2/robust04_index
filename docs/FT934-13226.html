			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: A drive for clear objectives - Why BSG is undergoing a strategic review FEW medium-size companies are driven by as many component parts as BSG International. In Europe, North America, the Far East and Australasia the average car is likely to be fitted with wing mirrors, lights and a sunroof made by one of the group's subsidiaries. If it is a family car there is a good chance the child seats have been manufactured by another division. In Britain the car itself may have been leased or sold by the vehicle distribution arm. In the sky, the next aircraft passing overhead will more often than not be a Boeing. If so, many of the seats and interior fittings will have come off a BSG production line. Unfortunately for the Midlands-based group, recession has not been kind to companies supplying equipment to users of roads and runways. Falling vehicle demand in continental Europe and for commercial aircraft worldwide has weakened BSG's performance. In its recent half-year results, the company blamed weak consumer demand and falling car and aircraft production for flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.53m against Pounds 8.56m. Operating profits fell by 5.6 per cent to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 11.7m) - the result of airline cutbacks, a 15 per cent drop in European car output and higher than expected tax charges in some overseas markets. According to industry analysts, the recession has served to expose some deeper problems in BSG's four business areas: automotive components; childcare products; aircraft interior equipment; and vehicle distribution and leasing. They say the group is typical of a growing number of companies which are too diversified and need to re-examine their core activities. Mr Richard Marton, who took over as chief executive in May, says he recognised the strains some time ago but is only now in a position to rectify them. On October 1 he ordered a strategic review of the group to examine the entire structure and come up with a corporate plan, which will be implemented from the start of 1994. Mr Marton, who was promoted from the company's consumer and special products division, is honest about the task ahead. 'We have never really addressed the subject of a well-planned strategy. BSG has not gone very far because in the past decisions were made on an ad hoc basis. It was divide and rule.' He claims, however, that the realisation that the group's divisions were operating without strategic guidance did not grow solely with the worsening recession. There had been a legacy of little management planning. Mr Marton is reluctant to criticise directly Mr Tom Cannon, his predecessor who resigned as managing director in May after 42 years with the company. But, he says: 'We now have to develop the clear objectives that we've never had. In the past we didn't have the leadership to set out a new structure, so this review is long overdue.' The board, however, was reluctant to sanction an overhaul before it had strengthened the balance sheet. This it achieved through a Pounds 31.4m rights issue earlier this year. The funds raised have enabled the group to cut gearing and proceed with capital expenditure on things it is good at  - namely, a Pounds 12m expansion of its US mirror plant near Detroit and a Pounds 7m investment in UK car dealerships. With the rights issue past, the new chief executive has concentrated on earmarking areas ripe for restructuring. As part of that process, the divisional structure has already been reorganised. The three operating arms  - automotive, vehicle distribution and leasing, and consumer and special products which embraces aircraft parts and childcare goods  - have been sub-divided along regional lines. This is the foundation for the three-month review and reflects widely varying margins on BSG products in different markets. In the automotive division, for example, operating margins are healthy in North America and the Far East where the group's Britax subsidiaries have won lucrative contracts with companies such as Ford, Chrysler, GM, Mazda and Mitsubishi. But in Europe and the UK, falling car output has tightened margins. Meanwhile, the lossmaking aircraft parts operation has won some big seat orders from airlines but turnover has declined because Boeing, its main customer, has scaled back 737 production. These areas are now being scrutinised by a strategic review committee, which is likely to identify activities which no longer fit in with Mr Marton's vision of a focused company. Potential candidates for disposal include Britax Weathershields, the sunroof manufacturer, the pushchair and nursery furniture side of the Britax childcare division, and Rumbold, the aircraft interiors subsidiary. Mr Marton refuses to pre-empt the findings of the review committee, but admits 'we'll be stronger if we dispose of one or two product areas'. The existence of such a committee, involving senior divisional managers and the main board, reflects his determination to arrive at a consensus on the group's future direction. The growing opinion among analysts is that BSG needs to shed some operations. But they warn it would be unwise to put its aircraft business on the market before it could demonstrate a return to profitability. Mr Marton acknowledges their concerns and says the company is not rushing to amputate lossmaking areas. 'We know we have to be fitter and more focused; that will take time. We also need to build values into the company  - we've never had values before.'</p>

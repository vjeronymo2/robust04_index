			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Minister over markka's float MR Iiro Viinanen, Finnish finance minister, confirmed yesterday it would be 'a matter of months' before Finland could revert to a fixed exchange rate, after having floated the markka on Tuesday, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. Mr Viinanen told the Financial Times the decision to float the currency was taken in preference to a straight devaluation, in order to reassure the European Community. 'Floating was not designed to be aggressive,' he said. 'I hope the EC will understand our situation.' On Tuesday the European Commission said it 'regretted' the Finnish move. There was some concern in Helsinki yesterday that formal negotiations over Finland's EC membership might be delayed as a result of the floating markka. Mr Viinanen acknowledged that the country would 'face hard terms' in the talks, due to start early next year. He was bewildered by how quickly the value of the markka deteriorated because of the huge outflow of capital that threatened to deplete the country's capital reserves. The international swap arrangements made in the spring with European central banks were used but proved insufficient. 'On Monday night it was impossible to stop the flow. The position was hopeless,' he said. 'It would have been too expensive for the country to use up all its resources to defend the markka.' Mr Viinanen said further cuts would be made in government spending over the next three fiscal years, to persuade money markets that the burgeoning budget deficit could be brought under control. It could reach FM200bn (Pounds 22.5bn) this year. Next year cuts will total about FM20bn, with a further FM22bn-FM30bn in 1994 and 1995. So far this year Mr Viinanen has assembled three separate cuts packages but they have failed to restore the market's credibility in the government's economic strategy. The new cuts are expected to include swingeing reductions in agricultural subsidies, regional grants, and transfer payments to local authorities. But painful reductions can also be expected in the value of Finland's wide-ranging social welfare benefits. 'We can no longer afford the benefits we now have,' the minister said.</p>

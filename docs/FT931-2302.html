			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways The collapse of peace talks between BA and Virgin is decidedly damaging given the delicate relations between the US and UK in aviation matters. Virgin may be over-egging its case, but BA has damaged its own cause by extending the uncertainty. BA's shareholders may well ask why their company is prepared to pay Pounds 4m in compensation for a 'dirty-tricks campaign' which it insists was relatively minor. But their main concern has been to see the episode resolved. If BA has been fully frank, it should have nothing to fear by dropping its 'gagging' clause. Its best defence in any future regulatory disputes would then be that it had recognised past misdemeanours, compensated Virgin and acted to prevent their recurrence.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Patronat chooses new leader Mr Jean Gandois, the former head of Pechiney, the state-owned aluminium and packaging group, is set to become the next president of the Patronat, the French employers' federation, after winning a clear majority in a vote by the organisation's executive council. Mr Jean-Louis Giral, the other candidate in the contest, said he would withdraw following his 25-10 defeat in yesterday's poll. Mr Gandois should now be confirmed as the next head of the Patronat at a meeting of the organisation's 536-member general assembly which is scheduled for December 13. The contest to succeed Mr Francois Perigot as president of the Patronat has been one of the most fiercely fought of recent years. Mr Gandois, a pro-European, has said he wants to revitalise the organisation and give it a stronger voice in the debate over political and social reforms. Mr Giral, head of the family-run building contractor Desquenne et Giral, was regarded as the champion of small and medium-sized industry. He is close to Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist candidate for next spring's presidential elections.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOLS TRY TO EASE CROWDING  </P> <P> The Oxnard Union High School District has approved plans to reduce crowding in  two of its high schools by realigning enrollment boundaries.  </P> <P> Under the plan, 157 students enrolled in Channel Islands and Oxnard high  schools next September will be transferred to the less-crowded Rio Mesa and  Hueneme high schools.  </P> <P> Students at Camarillo High School and Frontier High School will not be affected  by the boundary changes.  </P> <P> Reacting to parents' concerns that brothers and sisters will be separated by  the boundary changes, trustees said they will allow students with siblings in  the district to attend either the older student's high school or the school of  the new ninth-grader.  </P> <P> The trustees said the changes are necessary to even out enrollment in the  11,000-student district. Channel Islands High School is the most crowded of the  district's six schools, with 2,692 students in a school designed for 2,240.  Oxnard High School is the second-most crowded, with 2,379 students in a school  designed to hold 2,060.  </P> <P> The realignment of boundaries will last until 1993 or 1994, when construction  is expected to be completed on two new schools in Oxnard. By then, the district  expects to absorb an additional 1,000 students into its system.  </P> <P> But crowding has already become so serious within the two high schools that  trustees have been forced to make the interim changes, said Gary Davis,  assistant superintendent for educational services.

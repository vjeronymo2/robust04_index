			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOOTBALL '89;  </P> <P> NORTHWEST VALLEY CONFERENCE;  </P> <P> WEST VALLEY LEAGUE  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P> <P> COACH: Rudy Lugo, 4th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 1-8; 4th in league, 0-7  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Lugo praises junior David Erhardt (6-2, 180) as "probably the  most talented quarterback I've ever seen in high school." Erhardt completed 71  of 167 passes for 795 yards and four touchdowns last year. But he'll need  blocking. "Last year, a lot of the time he was running for his life," Lugo  said. Senior tackle Bob Moose (6-2, 230) is a Division I prospect but might be  forced to play on defense, too. Senior Doug Kreider (5-9, 175) returns at  center and is a good pass blocker. Senior wide receiver Reynaldo Gallegos  (5-10, 150) is elusive and has good hands. Junior Hugo Escamilla (5-8, 180)  will double as a kicker and fullback. Senior linebacker Elvis Palacios also  will play at fullback. Twins Dalton and Darrin Payne, both 5-10, 155 and  juniors, are potential deep threats. Junior guard-linebacker Brian Bolognia  (5-11, 175), who played on the B team last year, and senior running  back-defensive end Calvin Williams are typical of several players: They start  both ways. Explained Lugo: "We're down in numbers."  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Canoga Park was outscored, 217-80, last season. Consequently, Lugo is  stressing ball control. "We're in a pretty tough 4-A league," he said. "You're  never in easy. We'll have to keep things really simple."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cleveland  </P> <P> COACH: Steve Landress, 5th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 5-5; 2nd in league, 4-3  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Look for Cleveland to run the ball with senior tailback Pat  Bryant (5-11, 185) carrying the load and offensive linemen Curtis Hudson (6-1,  255), a senior, and Warren Whitaker (5-10, 210), a junior, leading the way.  Bryant rushed for 276 yards in 46 carries last year in part-time duty. "He is  as good an athlete as I've ever coached," Landress said. He called Hudson "the  best guard in the City." Junior Jon Palacio (5-10, 220), senior tackle Dave  Unger (6-3, 225), a starter last year, and junior tight end Lance Johnson (6-0,  195) all are strong and should help the Cavaliers' ground attack. Senior  fullback Lamont Roberson (6-0, 195) moves into a starting role this season.  Senior flanker Roderick McMillan (5-11, 165), who was ineligible last season,  is expected to play this fall. Left-hander Steve Bryant (5-11, 180), a senior,  is the quarterback. On defense, three-year starter Vincent Johnson (5-8, 165)  heads the secondary and senior Will Johnson III (6-0, 235) is the team's best  linebacker. Al Martinez (6-2, 220) returns as another starting linebacker.  Senior nose guard Eric Young (5-7, 235) anchors the line.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: The Cavaliers have talent but little depth. "It's just going to depend  on injuries," Landress said. "It wouldn't surprise me if we won the league and  it wouldn't surprise me -- if a few guys got hurt -- if we wound up on the seat  of our pants." Pat Bryant and good blocking should be more than enough to lead  Cleveland into the playoffs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> El Camino Real  </P> <P> COACH: Ralph Stam and Mike Maio, 2nd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 4-7; 3rd in league, 2-5  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Conquistadores are small -- not in numbers but size.  Center Ed Yates (5-10, 185) returns, as does guard Tony Candella (5-7, 165),  and both typify the team's undersized front. Senior wide receiver Aaron  Guerrero (5-6, 138) might be the smallest player in the league. After  rebounding from consecutive winless seasons, however, the Conquistadores are  showing a lot of desire, Maio said. "We're small, physically, so we'll have to  trap and do those kinds of things. We'll have to substitute a lot," Maio said.  Senior running back Bobby Kim (6-0, 205), who rushed for 173 yards in 47  carries last year, arguably is the team's best player. Senior Jamal Anderson  (5-11, 200, 44 carries, 145 yards) and junior Lejon Carr (6-1, 185, 79 carries,  220 yards) also return at running back. "We'll build the team around them,"  Maio said of the trio. Senior Tony Bordwell (5-9, 150), an inexperienced  quarterback, completed just one of 13 passes as a backup last year. Junior  linebackers Troy Snyder (6-0, 210) and Chris Griggs (5-10, 165) both started as  sophomores. Senior defensive tackle Abdul Zaid (5-10, 220) is the team's  strongest player.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: A continued upward swing is the Conquistadores' main objective. Early  indications, Maio said, are positive. "We might be in the best condition on the  first day of practice than we've ever been," he said. "We feel things are going  in the right direction."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Taft  </P> <P> COACH: Tom Stevenson, 5th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 6-4; 1st in league, 5-2  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: How do you replace graduated tailback Kelvin Byrd, who rushed  for 1,480 yards and 13 touchdowns last year? "You don't," Stevenson said.  "Hopefully, a new guy will step in and do the job that he did." Senior Steve  Lockridge (6-2, 200), who rushed for 107 yards as Byrd's backup, will try.  Lockridge also will return as a starting linebacker. "Nobody will go both ways  full time," Stevenson said. Senior Edwin Velasco (5-11, 165), quarterback of  last year's league-champion B team, will lead an "option-oriented" offense.  Senior Wolfgang Von Aspe (5-11, 190) returns at fullback-inside linebacker and  senior Gregory Bernard (6-0, 235), who will start as a defensive tackle, also  will play fullback. Senior Chad Petrilli (5-11, 165) returns at wide receiver.  Junior Darnell Hendrix (6-2, 190), a transfer tight end and middle linebacker  from Jefferson, also could draw attention. "He's really going to be  outstanding," Stevenson said. Senior defensive back Irving Carter (5-10, 200)  transferred from Antelope Valley. Senior Jason Levine (6-0, 180) and junior  Greg Levy (6-0, 185) return as offensive linemen, and junior linebacker Vance  Swendell (5-11, 170) returns at linebacker.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: The Toreadors had the most explosive offense among Valley-area City  teams last season, averaging 308 total yards a game. "We also had a great  running back," Stevenson said. Without Byrd -- and no proven successor -- the  offensive load must be shouldered by several players. "I think it's going to be  a very, very difficult season," Stevenson said. A nonleague opener at Servite,  an Orange County power, offers proof of that.  </P></p>

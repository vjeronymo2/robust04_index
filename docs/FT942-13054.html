			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / ILO disappoints ex-GCHQ staff Trade unionists sacked in 1984 from GCHQ, the government communications centre in Cheltenham, last night voiced disappointment that the government had escaped censure for at least a year for breach of International Labour Organisation conventions on freedom of association. The union members had been expecting Britain to become the first western country to be on an ILO blacklist of countries with poor human rights. It is understood that, for procedural reasons, the ILO has made no serious criticism.</p>

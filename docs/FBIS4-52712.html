			<p>BFN     [Text] On 9 May, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata visited six  former prime ministers of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] one  after another to inform them of his inauguration as prime  minister. They were Noboru Takeshita, Toshiki Kaifu, Takeo  Fukuda, Yasuhiro Nakasone, Zenko Suzuki, and Kiichi Miyazawa.  Although the visits were exactly like those made by a newly  appointed prime minister when the LDP was in power, Hata's  "modest" visits appear to have been accepted favorably by the  former prime ministers. Nakasone even gave him a yell, saying:  "(Although the Hata cabinet is a minority government) there is  a saying that small is beautiful. So, hold on to it!"    Hata stayed at each of their offices for just less than 30  minutes. Both Takeshita and Miyazawa praised Hata, respectively  saying: "Since you are a good listener, you will be able to  manage things successfully," and "You are a first-class person  in terms of personality."    Referring to the fact that Hata served as chairman of the  LDP's Research Commission on the Electoral System under the  Kaifu cabinet, Kaifu also said: "Since the outline of political  reform has been drawn up, I hope you will carry out the  remaining task of achieving it." Meanwhile, Nakasone said:  "The right to dissolve the House of Representatives is the  supreme power given to the prime minister. You should use the  power with courage no matter what electoral system is used for  the next general election." In this way, Nakasone indirectly  opposed Hata's adherence to the idea that constituency  boundaries should be redrawn for a new single-seat electoral  system so that the next general election will be held under the  new system.    Maybe because of their warm welcome, Hata seems to have felt  relaxed. But during the meeting with Miyazawa, he carelessly  revealed his true feeling about the uproar caused by the  formation of the parliamentary group "Kaishin" [Innovation], due  to which the Social Democratic Party of Japan had to leave the  ruling coalition. Hata said: "After all members of the ruling  coalition parties voted for me in the prime ministerial  election, some moved to form the new group. I was also offended  by their act."</p>

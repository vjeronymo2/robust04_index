			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT POLICE FEARED SUSPECT WOULD FLEE;  </P> <P> AISSA WAYNE'S EX-HUSBAND, JAILED IN ATTACK, HAD PASSPORTS, EUROPE CONTACTS,  OFFICERS SAY  </P> <P> Newport Beach police said Wednesday that they arrested the wealthy Pomona  physician accused of ordering an attack on his ex-wife, the daughter of actor  John Wayne, because they feared that he was planning to flee the country.  </P> <P> Police said Thomas A. Gionis, an orthopedic surgeon, had been making telephone  calls to Greece, where he has relatives, had obtained a passport for himself  last January and last month obtained a passport for his 2-year-old daughter,  Anastasia.  </P> <P> "We feared he would flee the country and take the child with him," said Sgt.  Mike Jackson, one of the investigators assigned to the case.  </P> <P> Gionis, 35, who owns a string of five clinics from Beverly Hills to Palm  Springs, was involved in an unusually bitter child-custody battle with Aissa  Wayne, 32, his former wife, when the attack occurred last October.  </P> <P> According to police, two men approached Wayne and her companion, financier  Roger W. Luby, in the garage of Luby's Newport Beach home, bound and beat them  and slashed one of Luby's Achilles' tendons.  </P> <P> One of the attackers told Wayne: "You're (messing) with the wrong guy. Next  time, we kill you," police have said.  </P> <P> Two men have been arrested within the last 3 weeks on suspicion of being the  attackers. Police identified them as Jerrel L. Hintergardt, 37, an unemployed  apartment manager from Burbank, and Jeffrey Kendall Bouey, 35, a swimming pool  cleaner from Simi Valley.  </P> <P> An arrest warrant has been issued for a Century City private investigator, O.  Daniel Gal, who worked on behalf of Gionis in the custody case and who police  allege hired Hintergardt to make the attack. Hintergardt once worked for Gal's  investigation agency, police said.  </P> <P> Gal, who was interviewed by Newport Beach police after the attack, is believed  to have fled to Europe. Newport police said Interpol, the international police  agency headquartered in Paris, is trying to locate Gal for arrest and  extradition.  </P> <P> Gionis was awarded custody of the couple's child, Anastasia, after a hearing in  which his lawyers argued that the attack on Wayne showed that the child would  be endangered in Wayne's custody. The judge, holding that both were fit  parents, nevertheless criticized Wayne as being "emotionally immature."  </P> <P> Wayne's lawyer said Wednesday, however, that in light of Gionis' arrest, he  would try to reopen the custody case.  </P> <P> Three Newport Beach officers watched Gionis' home in Pomona Tuesday night and  arrested him when he drove up in his chauffeured limousine at 10:50 p.m.,  police said. Gionis was returning from a business trip to New York.  </P> <P> He was taken to Newport Beach City Jail, where he was held without bail on  suspicion of conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon.  </P> <P> Wayne said Wednesday that she was "shocked" by news of the arrest. "After  everything Tom Gionis and I have gone through, I'm still shocked to think he  could do something like that to me," she said in an interview.  </P> <P> Luby said he was "pleased" and that his injuries are "98% healed." He said that  if Gionis ordered the attack on him as well as on Wayne, it was probably  motivated by jealousy.  </P> <P> At a hearing in Harbor Municipal Court Wednesday afternoon, a solemn-faced  Gionis entered an not guilty plea to the charges as his former wife and her  mother, Pilar Wayne, looked on from the back of the courtroom.  </P> <P> Gionis did not acknowledge them, but mouthed "hi" to his father, Matthew  Gionis, and his sister, Xanthia, who were seated in the courtroom. They had  arrived earlier in Gionis' limousine.  </P> <P> Gionis, wearing a white dress shirt and light-blue dress pants, appeared in  court without handcuffs. He was flanked by armed bailiffs as photographers shot  pictures.  </P> <P> Through his attorney, Byron K. McMillan, Gionis surrendered his and his  daughter's passports in hopes of persuading Municipal Judge Russell A. Bostrom  to allow his release on bail.  </P> <P> Gionis was being held on a no-bail arrest warrant based on the statements by  police that they believe Gionis might flee if released. Bostrom scheduled a  bail hearing at 1:30 p.m. today. Gionis' preliminary hearing was set for April  17.  </P> <P> Outside the courtroom, McMillan and Albert M. Graham Jr., a Santa Ana lawyer  who represented Gionis in his divorce case, belittled the case against Gionis.  </P> <P> Police said records of Gionis' telephones show that he called Gal four times  from his limousine and his office on the day of the attack. The calls were made  before and after the attack, and one was made to Gal's car at the time police  allege that Gal was parked outside Luby's home.  </P> <P> Gionis' bank records showed he had paid a total of $65,000 to Gal during the  custody dispute, $40,000 of which was paid 2 weeks before the attack, police  said.  </P> <P> McMillan insisted that Gionis is the victim of Gal, who was employed by Gionis'  attorney and not by Gionis. He said Gal tried to "shake down" Gionis for money  before he fled to Europe.  </P> <P> He said Gionis' arrest was outrageous because Gionis had offered to surrender  whenever he was wanted. "They're cowboys, just cowboys," McMillan said of the  police.  </P> <P> Graham said the police are stretching credibility when they connect the $40,000  that Gionis paid Gal with the attack itself. Graham said Gal had been retained  to watch Wayne every day she had custody of the child. The surveillance went on  for months, he noted.  </P> <P> "Add up what it takes to do that much surveillance, from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.  every day," Graham said.  </P> <P> The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans, declined to comment on  the Gionis case other than to compliment Newport Beach police on their  "thorough investigation" and "excellent job."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lonn Johnston contributed to this story.  </P></p>

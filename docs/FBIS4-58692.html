			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Yemeni House of Representatives in </F> Sanaa on 5 May--read by announcer]    [Text] Praise be to God the almighty. Prayers and peace  be upon Muhammad, the true and honest one, and on his family and  companions until the day of judgment.    O sons of the unified and great Yemeni people: The House of  Representatives, while following the successive and serious  events the country has been passing through since the crisis  began, emphasizes it has provided repeated opportunities for  genuine and true dialogue designed to extricate the country from  what it is passing through, in the hope that everyone will  return to his senses and place both unity and democracy above  narrow-minded party considerations and calculations.    For this purpose, the House has made great efforts to  prevent  matters from going as far as they have today. The House has  temporarily frozen some of its constitutional powers, out of its  concern about unity, about its continuity, and about the unity  of the House as a Constitutional establishment representing a  united Yemen, in order to foil the goals of the adventurers who  want nothing good for this homeland.    Now that matters have reached the point of involving the  Armed Forces in the furnace of a destructive war, of bloodshed,  killing, and the squandering of both the property and the  capabilities of the Armed Forces -- the shield of the people --  as well as the sabotaging of peaceful cities, led by the  capital of the state of unity, the capital of historic Yemen,  the House of Representatives is now duty-bound to carry out its  responsibility and fully pursue its Constitutional powers --  powers the House was reluctant to use in the past.    Given all this, the House holds the secessionist clique in  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership, led by 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, who rebelled against Constitutional legitimacy and who  created the crisis, fully responsible for what has happened and  what is now taking place. The House has decided to remove the  legitimacy of al-Bid and his secessionist colleagues. The House  regards the activities they are carrying out and the decisions  they are making as illegal and says they do not represent the  Republic of Yemen.    The House regards the reckless actions the secessionist  elements in the YSP are carrying out as a reflection of the  ailing psyche of those who do not follow the Constitution or law  and who do not adhere to the results of the democracy that they  used to boast about.    Having studied the measures the legitimate leadership has  taken in terms of declaring a state of emergency, the House of  Representatives appeals to citizens to keep calm, restrain  themselves, and cooperate with legitimate authorities to  confront the enemies of unity and the advocates of secession  among the YSP leaders and elements.    The House appeals to all sons of the Armed Forces to rally  around the legitimate leadership, implement its instructions,  and stand in the trench of the forces defending unity and  democracy. This is because they are duty-bound to protect funds  and property and to safeguard the honor of people and the blood  of the innocent.    Moreover, the House appeals to the forces of good in the  YSP,  who reject both war and secession, to stand with legitimacy,  unity, and democracy. God is the one who grants guidance and  success.    The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned that the House  will hold a session tomorrow morning [7 May].</p>

He believed joining the regional grouping would  stimulate the development of his country, which switched from a  socialist system to democracy in 1990. "Our external relation's  interest is to join Asean within three years, but it depends on  the agreement of Asean members," Gombosuren told THE NATION.    Gombosuren is accompanying Mongolian President Punsalmaagiyn  Ochirbat on a three-day official visit which concludes today.  In talks with Prime Minister Chuna Likphai, Ochirbat raised his  government's interest in joining Asean, attending the Asean  Regional Forum and joining the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  (Apec) forum. [passage omitted]    "We can see in Europe and North America that regional  organizations play a vital role in stimulating political and  economic development," said Gombosuren. "We feel this kind of  cooperation is very important. We do not have to copy it, but  take it as an example and develop model suitable to our region."  The minister said his government has attached great important to  this visit--the president's first trip abroad -- because  Thailand is a country with an outstanding record of success in  social and economic development.    In a joint statement issued at a press conference in  Pattaya,  both sides agreed that the Asia Pacific region and the world  have now moved into a new era in which countries enjoy  much-improved relationships and greater cooperation. They also  recognized the trend toward regional consolidation and peaceful  resolution of disputes and that an unprecedentedly favourable  environment now exists for both bilateral and multilateral  cooperation among countries in the region.</p>

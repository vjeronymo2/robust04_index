			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Observer: Lawson minor Poor old Nigel Lawson. Not only does Britain's ex-chancellor of the exchequer look like losing his bid to get a proper job as OECD secretary general, but a comprehensive school in Gateshead wants to erase his name from the school gates. Governors of the Lord Lawson Comprehensive at Birtley, Tyne and Wear - named after an extinct Labour baron - have voted to rename their school the Lord Lawson of Beamish Comprehensive to avoid any confusion with the current Lord Lawson. But why not rename it the Baron Lawson Comprehensive, as a reminder of the time when even Labour prime ministers handed out hereditary honours?</p>

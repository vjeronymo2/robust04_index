"The fact that the U.S. Senate has voted in favor of lifting  the embargo by President Bill Clinton is a positive gesture that  corresponds to international reality and the wishes of the  American people," a ministry spokesman said.    "We believe that this vote will enjoy substantial approval  among American and world opinion," according to the ministry,  which reacted particularly rapidly.    The Senate voted 62 to 38 in favor of lifting the sanctions  imposed against Vietnam in 1975. The issue now moves to Clinton  for his decision.    Last week, Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said  the  embargo was a domestic American affair, saying that Vietnam has  already cooperated fully in trying to resolve the issue of 2,238  US soldiers missing in action (MIA) in Indochina. The MIAs  remain the final obstacle to the lifting of sanctions.</p>

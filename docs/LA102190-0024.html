			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> The Redondo Beach of old -- with its Victorian turrets, gables and wide  verandas -- will be on view today from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. during a historical  and architectural home tour sponsored by the Redondo Beach Historical Society  and the Dolphins Junior Women's Club. Eleven historic homes will be opened to  visitors, and the tour also will include some "drive by" examples of period  architecture in the city.  </P> <P> "This is a chance to see a variety of historical homes that are the best of  what Redondo has to offer," tour coordinator Kathleen Ackley said.  </P> <P> Among the gems are a 1923 Mission Revival triplex, which still has its original  moldings and built-in dining room cabinet, a Victorian beach cottage from the  1880s with a spiral staircase and an 1890-era Queen Anne cottage that is  undergoing complete restoration. The two cottages were once near the harbor and  were moved to their present sites by mule team in 1923.  </P> <P> Tickets may be purchased during tour hours at Redondo Beach City Hall, Pacific  Coast Highway at Diamond Street, or at the street fair taking place outside  City Hall. The cost is $15, $12 for seniors and students with identification.  The annual tour was started eight years ago to raise funds for historic  preservation. Because so many old homes are lost each year to development,  Ackley said, "we work very hard to preserve the ones we can." GERALD FARIS  </P></p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / New CSO figures paint a detailed picture of imports Exports to third world countries and other regions outside the European Union account for almost two-thirds of cigarettes produced in Britain. Meanwhile imports account for only about a 50th of the total value of the UK cigarette market, but nearly two thirds of the total volume of cigarettes sold. This indicates that domestic brands are concentrated at the quality end of the UK market. These are the type of statistics that have emerged in a new series of business publications providing information on import penetration levels of different sectors. The series was launched in London yesterday by the Central Statistical Office and Taylor Nelson AG, the market research group. The series collects information from 28,500 businesses and allows penetration levels to be calculated from some 4,800 sectors. The reports on the sectors will become available over the coming months. However, samples of preliminary data for last year on areas such as the tobacco sector yesterday indicated that the UK is now running a significant trade surplus in the cigarette market. Although the data still has to be approved by the CSO, the preliminary statistics show that while tobacco exports account for only a tenth of the total value of UK cigarette output, they represent more than three-quarters of the volume. Elsewhere, the data showed that import penetration in the industrial clothing field fell significantly in some sectors while the average price of some textiles items dropped as much as 30 per cent. The report notes that the fall in the level of import penetration probably reflects the sharp drop in the price of items sold by UK manufacturers - a trend that suggests that in some sectors at least, UK manufacturers continued last year to benefit from sterling's devaluation by becoming more competitive than their overseas rivals. But although UK products dominated the market for men's work jackets, for example, exports crept up in other sectors such as men's work trousers. The statistics show that UK producers accounted for almost all of the Pounds 51,520 sales of men's synthetic overalls last year, with import penetration falling from about 3 per cent to about 1 per cent in the year.</p>

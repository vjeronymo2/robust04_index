			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sell-off plans feature in Australian election AUSTRALIA'S federal election campaign yesterday produced variations in plans to privatise two of the country's biggest government-controlled companies, the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, announced plans to float a further 19 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank, which is due to release interim results today. But the planned float of the government's 75 per cent interest in Qantas, the Australian international airline, originally scheduled for June, is now unlikely to take place before October. Mr Keating said he hoped to raise more than ADollars 1bn (USDollars 670m) from the flotation of 19 per cent of Commonwealth Bank in 1994-95. This would leave the bank majority government-owned, as ADollars 1.3bn was raised in 1991 through a 30 per cent float. The government is hoping to raise about ADollars 2bn through the Qantas float, following the recent sale of 25 per cent of the airline to British Airways for ADollars 665m. The minister for finance, Mr Ralph Willis, said the delay in the Qantas float would also allow the airline to obtain an independent credit rating before severing its links with the government.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali left  Amman for Washington today to join His Majesty King Husayn on  his U.S. visit, during which he will meet with U.S. President  Bill Clinton. Dr. al-Majali was seen off by Deputy Prime  Minister Dhuqan al-Hindawi and several cabinet ministers.    On His Majesty King Husayn's Washington visit, Dr. al-Majali  spoke to [Salim 'Ali Dhiyab], our correspondent for political  affairs:    [Begin recording] [Al-Majali] Undoubtedly, there must be  constant reconsideration of Jordanian-U.S. ties to further  promote and strengthen them in the interest of the American and  Jordanian peoples. The summit between his majesty the king and  President Clinton constitutes a peak in these ties, which we  know to be special. This summit will remove any of the  difficulties that might have emerged along the path of these  good ties, which continue to be promoted. [passage omitted]    [Dhiyab] Dr. al-Majali: With regard to inter-Arab  coordination, I do not want to ask you whether you are satisfied  with it. But, how strong is it at present?    [Al-Majali] As a matter of fact, the word coordination  continues to be misunderstood. Coordination is not seriously  observed, as we wish. We understand coordination to mean that  each party is properly and unambiguously informed of the  position of the other party. If the two parties agree on  certain issues, that would be fine and great. But if the two  parties disagree, this should not mean that there is a dispute.  For each party must respect the other's view. This is how  coordination should be viewed. It is regrettable that  inter-Arab coordination has not reached the desired level.    [Dhiyab] But, in practical terms, is there currently  coordination among the three Arab sides?    [Al-Majali] Of course. Coordination has remained intact.  Coordination has remained an ongoing process. Whenever there is  an opportunity, coordination takes place. Nonetheless, people  do not meet all the time. Whenever there are new developments,  the other parties are informed of them, and consequently these  developments are discussed. This is what always takes place.

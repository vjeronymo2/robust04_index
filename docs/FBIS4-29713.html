			<p>BFN     [Text] Sydney, June 21 (AFP) -- Australian security  services are investigating the circumstances in which two  alleged Afghan war criminals have taken refuge here, Foreign  Minister Gareth Evans said Tuesday.    But the minister denied a claim that any deal was done by  which the men -- said to be former high-ranking members of  Afghan communist leader Najibollah's regime -- were granted  entry in exchange for giving information to the security  services.    The Australian Broadcasting Corp. (ABC) claimed in a report  Monday that at least three members of the regime responsible for  many atrocities had been given permanent residence in Australia.    The regime's former vice president and a deputy secret  service chief were said to be among the war criminals.    Members of Australia's Afghan community were threatening to  take action against them unless the government responded, the  ABC said.    Opposition Senator David MacGibbon asked in a parliamentary  question Tuesday if it was true the men had gained entry despite  a warning from members of the Afghan community to former  Immigration Minister Robert Ray in May 1989.    MacGibbon described them as being former members of a regime  said to have executed one and a half million of its citizens  during Afghanistan's civil war.    Evans said he took the view that no Australian security  agency ever had or ever would knowingly assist the entry of any  individual who had been involved in terrorist activities or war  crimes.    "I am certainly not aware of any deal whatsoever being made  with anybody on this matter," he told the Senate.    Evans said the allegations were known to the Australian  security authorities and were being investigated although the  government was not yet fully apprised of the status and other  relevant details of the persons in question.    The identity of two had been established but nothing was  known of the third.    Evans said the immigration department was considering an  application for refugee status from one and the second had  resident status, having entered under the humanitarian program.    His visa was issued in New Delhi, India after all normal  requirements had been assessed as met, Evans said.    But the minister declined to elaborate on MacGibbon's  suggestion of security service involvement, saying it was  long-standing government policy not to comment on security  matters.</p>

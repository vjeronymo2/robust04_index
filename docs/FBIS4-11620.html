			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Paulina Gamus, president of the Comptrollership  Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, said statements by the  deputy transportation and communications minister represent the  first case of corruption in the Rafael Caldera administration.    [Begin Gamus recording] We can call this the first  corruption  scandal in this administration, which is not yet 100 days old.  Rafael Irribaren, former [as heard] deputy transportation and  communications minister, has made these charges against  Transportation and Communications Minister Cesar Quintini  Rosales. In its regular session this afternoon, the  Comptrollership Committee will begin an investigation based on  the request by Deputy Luis Manuel Esculpi. Through this  investigation, we will determine whether what Irribaren is  saying is true and why this type of thing is occurring. [end  recording]    Deputy Paulina Gamus later said the case will be  investigated  by the Comptrollership Committee:    [Begin Gamus recording] This afternoon, Deputy Luis Manuel  Esculpi of the Movement Toward Socialism asked for the floor to  speak about this case. I had already announced on an early  morning television program that the Comptrollership Committee  was going to immediately open an investigation. Regardless of  whether I or Deputy Esculpi made the request, this is a case  that falls strictly under the purview of the Comptrollership  Committee. [end recording]</p>

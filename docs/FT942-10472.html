			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (12): Confrontation looms - Privatisation is ahead of schedule Parastatal reform in Kenya is a many-headed hydra. It has three distinct dimensions: the technical and financial, the political and the managerial. Each is horrendously challenging. Reform of public enterprise cannot be achieved without head-on confrontation with the political mafia, for whom the parastatals remain one of a diminishing number of sources of patronage. Nor can the problem be tackled without getting to grips with the parastatal sectors' endemic financial weakness and heavy indebtedness. Above all, reform requires far-reaching change in terms of corporate culture - finding a new breed of suitably-qualified, experienced and appropriately-rewarded public enterprise managers. Men and women must be appointed for their professionalism, and not because they represent a particular ethnic group or powerful family. These are tall orders, and it is hardly surprising that parastatal reform is at the eye of the storm, given the impossibility of sustaining structural adjustment without root-and-branch parastatal restructuring. Kenyan officials agree that little progress has been made in restructuring the 33 'strategic' public enterprises - railways, ports, electricity, water, posts and telecommunications - but the turnround at Kenya Airways and the remarkable transformation of the Central Bank of Kenya, underscore the major contribution to reform achieved by personnel change at the top. Officials insist, however, that reform is ahead of schedule in liquidating and privatising the 207 'commercially oriented public enterprises with direct or indirect public ownership'. Three years ago, the government published a two-dimension classification of its 240 public enterprises: StrategicNon-strategic Viable RetainSell Non- RestructureLiquidate viableand retain By April 1994, 31 companies had been liquidated, including 27 that were either dormant or insolvent. A further seven had been sold by the receivers, five by competitive bidding and 15 sold under pre-emption rights, allowing other shareholders to increase their equity stakes. Heightening the public perception that the sell-off is going slowly, only five have been privatised through the Nairobi Stock Exchange: Bamburi Portland Cement (in 1991); partial sales of the government's controlling equity stake in the Housing Finance Company and Uchumi Supermarket (in 1992); and CMC Holdings and East African Oxygen last year. In total, 63 companies - about 30 per cent of the government's non-strategic portfolio - have been divested, in four cases, partially. Another 33, pushing the number to just under half the total, are being processed, with 15 having reached the point of sale. These include some of the better-known businesses in which the state has a stake that are being sold under pre-emption rights agreements: Carnaud Metal Box, Chloride Exide (UK), Everready Batteries, Associated Battery Manufacturers and Firestone East Africa. By the end of this year, the government says, it will have sold another 25 parastatals, including Kenya Airways, at least two sugar factories, all cotton board ginneries and the freight-handling services at Nairobi and Mombasa airports. Over half the remaining non-strategics will be sold in two roughly equal tranches in 1995 and 1996. The policy framework paper, agreed with the IMF last year, commits Kenya to 'significant and irreversible public sector reform' - an armslength, transparent owner-management relationship between the government and the management of strategic parastatals. The government has promised to eliminate indirect subsidies to parastatals (which averaged 5.5 per cent of GDP during the 1989-1992 period) by 1997. Public utilities will be given tariff autonomy, subject to appropriate regulatory controls for monopolies and individual performance contracts must be n place by mid-1995. A corporate plan has been approved for Kenya Railways, including the sale of peripheral activities, limiting freight services to 23 main-line stations, and staff retrenchment. The posts and telecommunication functions of the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation are being separated, and a performance contract is due by mid-year. Given Kenya's record, the temptation to write this programme off as hopelessly ambitious would be overwhelming, but for the success achieved - in remarkably little time - at Kenya Airways. But whether the politicians and other vested interests are willing to allow other parastatals to follow Kenya Airways through rehabilitation and eventual privatisation is problematic, to say the least.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: No sense in 'permanent' temporary housing Sir, David Owen ('Councils' rules on homeless may be relaxed', December 2) does his best to explain how temporary accommodation for homeless families is to be permanent. Let common sense prevail: temporary housing is not suitable for families with children who need stable schooling and continuity in their lives. Now that we have stopped building council houses, there is enormous pressure on the existing stock of re-lets, and no amount of shuffling the people who need it can conceal the underlying shortage or the economic stupidity of current policies. Scarce private rented accommodation costs between Pounds 100-Pounds 150 a week and traps people on benefits, with rising costs to the national and council tax payer. This policy makes no economic or social sense. In the longer term it is unsustainable because of the shortage of private rented accommodation which the Budget did nothing to reverse. The housing benefit bill will rise and threaten the government's spending targets. What will we do then? I hope the government knows the answer to that question because, other than rising levels of homeless people on our streets, we do not. Sheila McKechnie, director, Shelter, 88 Old Street, London, EC1V 9HU</p>

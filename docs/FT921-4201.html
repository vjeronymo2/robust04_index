			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Book Review: Wrong lessons from the past THE END OF HISTORY AND THE LAST MAN By Francis Fukuyama Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 20 Businessmen proverbially do not have time to read books. To gratify them, Francis Fukuyama announced three years ago that history had ended - in a short journal article. He was then an unknown US State Department official. Yet the collapse of communism gave the argument a journalistic appeal, and that bald statement, cased in no more than the outline of an argument, attracted international attention. Fukuyama has now expanded the end of history to book length. But you can stick to the article. The argument is little advanced - just 300 pages longer, padded out with Fukuyama's musings on a future without history and his debts to Plato and Hegel - or more precisely, the interpretation of Hegel by Alexandre Kojeve, an inter-war French-Russian philosopher. The argument is simple enough. Events will continue to happen; in that sense, history has a future. But as a struggle between rival ideas on how to organise society, economy and government, the age-long debate is over. Western-style capitalist, liberal democracy has swept all before it, whether marxism and communism on the left, or theocracy and authoritarianism on the right. Multi-party democracies, the rule of law and bills of rights may not yet be universal, but ignore Islamic fundamentalism and the like: 'liberal democracy remains the only coherent political aspiration that spans different regions and cultures across the globe'. All of which is underpinned by an appeal to Hegel's 'cunning of reason': the German philosopher's dialectic which supposes that history is proceeding through a continual process of conflict on the road to human freedom, with each bout of conflict resulting in a less contradictory system - leading, ultimately, to the perfect regime. It is universal history - 'nothing other than man's progressive rise to full rationality, and to a self-conscious awareness of how that rationality expresses itself in liberal self-government'. In case all that sounds a bit high-flown to our businessman, Fukuyama includes a solitary table. It lists 'liberal democracies worldwide' at intervals from 1790 (when there were three) to 1900 (13), 1960 (36), ending in 1990, when the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the eastern bloc, plus less dramatic events in South America, took the figure to 61. Thus is the onward march of the ballot box plotted, and liberal democracy shown to have broken out of its original beachheads of western Europe and North America, spreading around the globe. Leaving Hegel to one side, the table alone gives pause enough for questioning Fukuyama's universal history. In the first place, it features only two countries with an unbroken 'liberal democratic' record going back two centuries - not an unduly exacting test of the ability of the species to dominate the next few thousand years. Those two are Switzerland and the US. Go back even to 1900, and the number rises to a mere five. Fukuyama's powers of extrapolation are impressive: plot his more recent numbers on a graph, and North Korea, Iraq, even China, must have liberal democracy around the corner. But what, exactly, are they about to confront? Examine Fukuyama's list a bit more closely. In the 1990 column, the US, Britain, Germany and France are closely followed by Romania, South Korea, Honduras and Singapore. If all those are 'liberal democracies', then liberalism and democracy are fairly elastic beasts. Yet Fukuyama treats the two as if they were stock animals: either you are one, or you are not, and if you are, then the age of political conflict is over - unless you relapse, a possibility that he allows for but never properly explains. If only liberal democracies came so pre-packaged and conflict-free. In reality, conflict is as endemic within many as it is absent from a few of those regimes which should be warming to the democratic dawn. Democracies evolve and degenerate; they can be overthrown; they are under constant stress - not only from left, right and nationalists across the spectrum, but from environmental pressures which could prove as destabilising as the first three. Moreover, democracies take such a myriad of forms, with such profound differences, that to characterise them as a single type of polity is about as meaningful as to throw all systems of supernatural belief in the box 'religion'. Yet Fukuyama rarely penetrates beneath such airy generalisations. 'Democracy can never enter through the back door,' he tells us: 'at a certain point, it must arise out of a deliberate political decision to establish democracy'. Try that on a serious British historian. Fukuyama does, at least, tackle some of those countries which are not remotely near his 'liberal democracy' box. In the west, religious fundamentalism and nationalism have often been catalysts for democracy; so he is confident they will prove so elsewhere. Perhaps; perhaps not. It would be nice to think so - so buy this book for that rainy day when business is bad and you need reassuring that capitalism, democracy and liberalism are indeed forever.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jamal 'Abd-al-Rahim] </F>   [Excerpt] The interrogation of members of the al-Jihad  Organization's military wing has disclosed that they recently  returned to Egypt from abroad, where they received training in  all types of weapons, the preparation and manufacture of bombs  and explosives, and how to use them to carry out terrorist  operations against important public figures and senior security  officials.    The investigations also revealed that 'Adil 'Awad Siyam, the  terrorist who was killed in a fight with policemen on al-Bahr  al-A'zam street in al-Munib on 4 April, had been assigned by  fugitive terrorist Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of the al-Jihad  Organization, to lead the organization's military wing and to  act as coordinator between the terrorist leaders abroad and in  Egypt. Dr. al-Zawahiri supplied him with the money to buy  weapons and ammunition in order to carry out terrorist  operations. Organization members were to have assassinated UN  Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali during his visit to Egypt,  but failed due to a change in his route. They had also planned  to assassinate Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif.    The interrogation of al-Jihad's military wing members also  indicated that terrorist Siyam had planned the aborted attempt  on the life of Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. For that  operation, he rented a house for terrorists Diya'-al-Din Mahmud  Hafiz, Nazih Subhi Rashid, Ahmad Faruq, and Muhammad Rashad  'Abd-al-Hamid in the Kafr al-Manfa area in al-Haram. He then  persuaded terrorist Diya'-al-Din Hafiz to carry out the suicide  mission, while he personally watched the interior minister's  motorcade.    Members of the organization, including terrorist Muhammad  'Abd- al-'Alim Khalifah, brother-in-law of terrorist 'Adil  'Awad, admitted to killing witness Sayyid Ahmad Abu-Yahya and  three others at his car showroom in Shibin al-Qanatir on 4  February. He was murdered for reporting to the police on their  terrorist colleague Sayyid Salah. Salah was sentenced to death  in connection with the assassination attempt of Prime Minister  Dr.'Atif Sidqi. They also admitted to placing an explosive  device at al-Jazirah Youth Center in 1993 so it would detonate  during a training course of State Security Intelligence  officers, and to killing their dissident colleague 'Adil Anwar  in Saray al-Qubbah area.    The investigations revealed that terrorist Siyam had been  using seven stolen cars to move around in and to pass  instructions to organization members. A report by the criminal  laboratory identified the weapons found in possession of the  terrorists as those used in the Shibin al-Qanatir terrorist  operation, in which Sayyid Abu-Yahya and three others were  killed and a police officer, who chanced to be in the showroom,  was injured. The investigations showed that terrorist 'Adil  Siyam had received funds from abroad, for a receipt from a  foreign currency transfer in Italy was found. The organization  members used to disguise themselves in police, armed forces, and  municipality workers' uniforms to place the explosive devices in  strategic areas. The investigations revealed that terrorist  'Adil Siyam and his brother-in-law Muhammad Khalifah had trained  the terrorists how to prepare explosives. The organization  members led prosecutors to nine dens in al-Basatin, al-Munib,  al-Qalubiyah, where weapons and ammunition had been stored, as  well as an underground tunnel which led to Bilbays in al-  Sharqiyah Governorate.

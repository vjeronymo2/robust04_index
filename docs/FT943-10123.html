			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Fashion: Exotic evenings from deep in the wardrobe / A look at ways to add glamour to a summer night Do you ever have the urge, in this era of sober and minimal dress, to break out into something wildly flamboyant and opulently decorated? Are you fed up with restrained neutrals? Do you long to throw taste and caution to the wind, to indulge in a splash and clash of colour or layers of rich adornment? If your world is a round of business meetings and rushing for the 7.15 this could be tricky in your daily life. But there is one area of fashion where you can legitimately let your fantasies take wing and that is eveningwear. Many women have begun to feel that a monochrome and beige fashion world is a dull place indeed and to thirst for colour somewhere in their wardrobes. This can often be done by reappraising your wardrobe, putting together pieces which have lain unworn for years in a new way. Perhaps you have an old velvet evening jacket with some embroidery or beading? Try it over a rich brocade waistcoat. A length of sari-silk makes a wonderful sarong. Any genuine ethnic item can be pressed into service, from a gauzy embroidered peasant blouse to a Moroccan kaftan or a Japanese silk kimono. The new designer versions are good value in the sales. The fun is in experimenting and layering, seeing which combinations work and which fail because the proportions do not work or the colours clash. Generally, one brilliantly-patterned piece per outfit is enough, although that does not preclude others from being beaded, textured, metallic or even all three. You will be forgiven on taste grounds if you pile on the jewellery, provided it is the non-sparkly ethnic kind. Dull, antique-looking silver with amber or turquoise beads hit the spot. Subtle excess is the aim, aided by elements of surprise and drama that can give one cleverly home-concocted outfit more impact than a roomful of expensive plain frocks. For beginners at the ethnic evening game the most straightforward approach is to adopt an easily-identifiable one-nation look making sure you keep in a few items of contemporary fashion to prevent the whole becoming fancy dress. The choice is yours: most designers have tweaked both our fashion sense and our social conscience with Chinese worker jackets made in silk or romanticised versions of the swirling skirts and layers worn by east European gypsies. Others choose the more opulent fantasy of high-collared Indian jackets and richly embroidered waistcoats, long, split-sided Moslem-style tunics over trousers or, such as Roland Klein, of brilliant shades and veiling transparencies that might have been worn in a Sultan's harem. Chloe, Romeo Gigli and Alberta Ferretti look backwards instead of far away for inspiration, with draped, high-waisted tunics and dresses modelled on designs from ancient Greek frescoes. The advantage for those wishing to experiment is that by this stage of the season the sales provide the means to a reasonably-priced end. The one exception to the national identity rule is Jean-Paul Gaultier who takes ideas at will from India, Africa and the 18th century and then rolls them into one with a hard-edged, neo-punk urban style. Tribal-looking jewellery apparently pierces (but is actually clipped to) odd parts of the anatomy and his men wear clusters of shiny gilt hairdressing pins. The overall effect is innovative and beautiful. Only those with great confidence could carry off such an unlikely clash of influences with panache but it is a look of which La Piaggi would approve.

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Fashion: Never wear your Barbour to shop at Peter Jones - The rights and wrongs of rural attire / Dressing for the Professions, The Country Set THE BRITISH have a greater nostalgia for a vanished rural past than any other nation. Dreams of Arcadia, Mother Nature, Merrie England, images and fantasies of rustic simplicity, bucolic innocence, sylvan peace and pastoral purity pervade UK art and literature. Immersed in an overwhelmingly urban culture, Britons all crave a slice of the country. But where once their aspirations may have focused on the artless peasant plainness of the unaffected cottage with roses round the door, in recent years their focus has shifted upwards towards the manor house of the country gentleman. They yearn to be there in the setting of the PG Wodehouse caper, the Agatha Christie plot, the television dynastic saga. And so well have they been able to study its ambiance, its mores, its rituals and its clothes that they feel they know just how to fit in. Indeed, funded by the new riches of the 1980s, many tried. But many failed. And it was often their clothes that left them on the outside, peering in. 'Clothes in the country,' says Ewa Lewis, the social editor of Tatler magazine, 'are really all about suitability and practicality. It may look as if an arcane set of rules applies but, really, it is to do with the work of the countryside, the fact that life is inevitably led as much outdoors as in and that, therefore, you have rough terrain and real weather to deal with. 'So, looking wrong can happen in two ways. You can wear clothes which are unsuitable because they are impractical - leather jeans, spiky high heels, fabrics you can't wash the mud off - or because they are in the wrong mood: too formal, too glossy, too city-glamorous. You can also earn the derision of the country set by wearing what they see as working gear in the town.' Nigel Hadden-Paton, born to the country, snorts in agreement: 'You could always tell a yuppie by the fact that he wore his Barbour for shopping at Peter Jones.' Bumble, his wife, adds: 'And by his white socks. And by his girlfriend's taste for stilettos worn with trousers - my pet hate.' Barbara Daly - who, with husband Laurence Tarlo, is a transplanted townie - says: 'You instinctively go for the functional and relaxed, rotating your London wardrobe down to the country when it starts to date. The only time I have felt out of place is when I have worn a short skirt or a tight body or one of my sharp suits or something in the evening that is too sparkly, too revealing or too glam.' Nigel and Bumble Hadden-Paton live at Rossway Park in Hertfordshire, a handsome Victorian house in 1,220 acres of which 620 acres are under the plough. Nigel is reducing this every year as he returns more of it to woodland and parkland in order to extend the game crop and his hospitality events business. A former officer in the Blues and Royals, he says: 'When I left the army after 13 years and Bumble and I took over the estate, it seemed to me I had a choice. I could, at 35 and with two children, take myself off to agricultural college and learn to farm; or I could retain our farm manager, who knows exactly what he's doing, and find some way of being able to afford him.' Using the house and park for conferences and corporate entertainment - a day's shooting is very good for bonding an executive team - proved the answer. For the landed gentry, opening their doors to outsiders is, increasingly, the best way to retain a much-loved but expensive-to-maintain family home. It exploits gently that yearning for access which the rest of us share. Nigel's strong selling line in his small brochure is Rossway's 'feeling of calm and serenity which restore a sense of balance and perspective amid the pressure and hurly-burly of everyday life.' It is not just a line, though. As you enter Rossway's tiled and pillared hall with its speadeagled tiger skin (the animal was shot by Nigel's father in 1956), glassy-eyed stags' heads and welcoming fire, you can almost hear the calls of house guests greeting each other in excited anticipation of a jolly weekend of rural sport, large meals, and many changes of clothes. It was a style of life with which the rest of the world has, retrospectively and thanks largely to movies and Ralph Lauren, fallen in love. The grand English country house style reached its apogee in Edwardian times, due in large part to the expanding railway network bringing weekend guests 'down' quickly and comfortably and bearing them away again before they became boring. It flourished through the 1920s and '30s and was maintained stalwartly through the 1950s and '60s with a smaller staff, fewer courses and warmer clothes. But it declined through the 1980s as mass entertaining became too expensive and difficult logistically because of the problems of getting domestic help. 'Of course,' says Bumble, 'it is still nice to have a party for the weekend and we still do it, but it is much more informal these days. In the summer, for instance, we usually have supper in the kitchen. Nor do you need an elaborate wardrobe. Or, in any sense, a 'correct' wardrobe. You just don't do all that changing any longer, and country people are much less husky-and-green wellingtons than they used to be. 'If we are dressing in the evening, it is more likely to be a half-change where the men wear a smoking jacket and trews with velvet or needlepoint slippers, and the women can pass in almost anything as long as they look as if they have made an effort.' Running the house as a business has modified Bumble's wardrobe. 'I have to have some clothes which are smart in a country way. The wonderful thing about the past few years is designers like Paul Costelloe, Mulberry and Nicole Farhi who understand the country and produce excellent clothes which are sturdy, stylish and timeless. High fashion just does not look right.' Nevertheless, much of her life with Nigel and their four children is lived out of doors. When not on hospitality duty, she tends to live in corduroy breeches. 'When we were clearing out the maids' rooms upstairs, I found a pair of coachman's breeches which fitted me perfectly. When I wanted a replacement, I asked Nigel's tailor, who quoted me Pounds 400 to make them. So, next time we went back to Cyprus - where we were once stationed - on holiday, I took them to Mr Osman in Nicosia who copied them perfectly. I have several pairs now.' 'Neither of us,' says Nigel, 'is really a jeans person. My working clothes are my holiest jersey, scruffiest boots and a Viyella shirt. My father always wore breeches, stockings, brown shoes, a shirt, a tie, a moleskin waistcoat, a tweed jacket and, if it rained, a Barbour. Even for tying the woods] Even when dealing with the clients, I tend to wear just a slightly smarter version of my workwear. That's politeness. 'It would be ridiculous for me to climb into a tweed suit just because I might think that's what they expected. We're not running a theme park, after all.' Ewa Lewis says: 'If there is a point to dressing correctly for the country, it is under-dressing. And the level of conformity required varies from county to county. If you misjudge it in Gloucestershire, Berkshire or Hampshire, it is not going to be as noticeable as it would be in Lincolnshire. 'I have noticed, too, that while town imports may ape country work-wear during the day, they make no concessions in the evening. This means that, in their fashionable outfits, they tend rather to outshine the country ladies in their black velvet skirts and frilly white blouses. 'But I doubt if anybody really notices unless they have to be carried across the puddles from the Land-Rover because their shoes are non-functional. That's when you look silly.' Lewis dismisses the widely-held belief that country folk like to affect scruffiness as an aspect of a cultivated eccentricity. 'The upper middle class squirearchy may, indeed, aim to look as battered as possible but, although most country people's kit may be old, it is always impeccably maintained.' 'The rule,' says Bumble Hadden-Paton, 'is no self-conscious dressing up. No wafting around like something out of a Ralph Lauren ad. Apart from that, you dress for practicality and to look as nice as possible.'</p>

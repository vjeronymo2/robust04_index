			<p>BFN     [Text] During the visit by Lithuanian President Algirdas  Brazauskas to the Council of Europe, a statement by Vytautas  Landsbergis, a member of the Seimas delegation to the  parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe on Russia's  intention to join the Council of Europe was distributed among  the parliamentarians of this organization.    In this statement, the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry is  accused  of conducting a policy based on Moscow's directives, reads a  statement by this ministry, disseminated by its information and  press department.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not discuss the  accusation, which is not based on any arguments, and stresses  that such statements, which had more than once been publicly  distributed abroad, harm the prestige of the Lithuanian state.    Lithuania's stance on Russia's membership in the Council of  Europe is based on the following principles:    Russia must fulfill the conditions of the Council of Europe  on the membership in that organization;    Lithuania will support Russia's membership in the Council of  Europe only after Russia fulfills international obligations on  the withdrawal of troops from Latvia and Estonia, respects the  sovereignty of the neighboring states, human rights, and those  of national minorities;    The support of the Council of Europe to Russia's democratic  forces is a weighty contribution to the processes of  democratization and the development of reforms in that country,  says this statement in conclusion.</p>

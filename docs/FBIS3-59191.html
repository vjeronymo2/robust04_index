Russia could not move closer to full membership as long as  its foreign policy conflicted with international law, Santer  told the winter session of the Council's parliamentary assembly.    "The stationing of troops in bordering countries, against  their wishes, flies in the face of these principles," Santer  added.    Russia did however have a "vocation" for full membership of  the 32-nation organisation, Santer said.    Russia has since May 1992 sought to exchange its special  "guest" status, which it has had for the past four years, for  full council membership.    The head of the Russian delegation last Tuesday accused the  Council of erecting "new, artificial obstacles" to full  membership.    Russia fulfilled all the requirements for full membership  after holding democratic elections and drawing up a new  constitution in December, he added.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Yeltsin purges political opponents: Emergency restrictions on media provoke a public outcry PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday purged opponents in Moscow and in the regions amid a public outcry over emergency restrictions on the media and, separately, allegations that arrested demonstrators had been severely beaten. Mr Yeltsin, who declared a week-long state of emergency in Moscow after the army crushed an armed uprising by supporters of the parliament, sacked the prosecutor-general, Mr Valentin Stepankov, and two regional governors. He also postponed a meeting of regional leaders, who had been expected to set up a new Federation Council, to give himself more time to purge disloyal officials in the provinces. Restrictions on the media, including bannings and censorship, caused a storm of protest and the resignation of Mr Yeltsin's media aide, Mr Mikhail Poltoranin. At least 150 people were killed in the two days of violence, according to Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister. Separately it emerged that 1,500 people, rounded up after elite troops stormed the White House, were being held in detention centres around Moscow. Apart from the rebellion's top leaders, such as Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the former vice-president, and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, who were in Lefortovo jail, those in custody included deputies who had stayed in the White House, as well as snipers and demonstrators who had stormed the mayor's office and the television centre on Sunday night. One of those detained and then released, Mr Boris Kagarlitsky, a well-known writer and member of the Moscow city council, said yesterday that many demonstrators and bystanders had been severely beaten to force confessions while in police custody. 'We were handcuffed and beaten with Kalashnikovs to make us sign a confession. We were not blindfolded, but told to face the wall, and if we turned around we were kicked,' he said, adding that their official charge was stealing a police car. The deputies were finally released, one with a broken rib, when an international human rights group learnt of their arrest and telephoned police stations directly. However, Mr Kagarlitsky, 35, said that at least two more deputies from the Moscow city council were still being held. 'I was a dissident under Brezhnev and jailed for 13 months then. But I was never beaten like that then,' he said. Mr Yeltsin's onslaught also turned to the regions. According to his original plan when he dissolved the Russian parliament two weeks ago, the Federation Council was to become the un-elected upper chamber of a new parliament. It was due to comprise the chiefs of the regional administrations and councils in each of Russia's 88 regions. But Mr Pyotr Philipov, a presidential aide, said Mr Yeltsin was now considering whether to dissolve all councils. The aim would be to replace them with new-style councils with less influence over the day to day running of regional affairs. Opposition political pro-communist parties, banned on Monday, yesterday vowed to fight on, but claimed they would be prevented from registering for the parliamentary elections. The Russian Communist party, the largest of the parties, disputed that it had been banned and insisted it would operate as normal.

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / The European Market: Dual-use goods expose EC export control disparities THE success of the single European market depends partly on how far governments are prepared to trust their Community neighbours; and nowhere will this be more important than on issues of external trade. Concern over the quality of countries' export control systems is being brought into focus by the European Commission's plans to tear down internal barriers to the export of so-called 'dual-use' goods and technologies, which can be used for civilian or strategic purposes. The Treaty of Rome allows member states to maintain as many restrictions on the trade in weapons as they think necessary. But until now national controls have also been applied to dual-use goods and technologies, even if they are only being traded between EC member states. Accepted international definitions of such products - which are not covered by the arms-trade treaty clause - have embraced items as diverse as personal computers, machine tools and airliners. Movement of dual-use products within the Community may account for between 5 and 8 per cent of intra-EC trade, but neither the Commission nor industry has reliable figures. Both appreciate, however, that the administrative burden alone is hampering free trade, not only between genuine buyers and sellers within the Community, but between project partners which have to 'export' and 'import' dual-use components across EC borders. Mr Hanns Glatz, Daimler-Benz's representative in Brussels, says: 'In the internal market, it will be increasingly difficult to stay national in the development and production of dual-use technologies: you'll have to enter co-operation deals and alliances across Community borders. 'As long as one of those countries is in a different export control system from another, the one subject to the tougher rules will be excluded as a partner.' Progress towards a European Commission initiative on dual-use export controls has been slow. In 1988 the Brussels official collecting data on existing national systems was thrown out of one foreign ministry on the grounds that it was none of his business. Earlier this month, however, EC foreign ministers agreed that expert discussions should begin on the abolition of internal barriers and harmonisation of dual-use export controls, on the basis of a Commission discussion paper which identifies a number of 'key elements' for any legislation: A common list of dual-use goods and technologies subject to controls. A common list of banned or restricted destinations for such exports. Common criteria for issuing licences from the EC. A forum for co-ordinating licensing and enforcement. Administrative co-operation between customs and licensing offices throughout the EC. Pushing ahead, European companies would like to extend any free market in dual-use goods and technologies to Scandinavia and other members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta). The Commission is restricting itself to solving the problems caused by EC controls for the time being, but there is a strong international dimension to its plans. A common EC list of products would probably encompass those drawn up under existing international agreements. EC policy on exports beyond Community borders would also correspond with US thinking on export controls, which has gradually shifted from preoccupation with west-east controls to more complex concerns about restricting global proliferation of dual-use technology. But although much of the hard work has been done in other forums, the practical difficulties which remain are enormous. The transparency of national policies - whether lists are published, for example, or even available - varies from country to country, as do the penalties for infringing the rules. Some member states levy fines of Ecu16,000 (Pounds 11,400); some have no limit or recommend imprisoning offenders for up to seven years. At the moment the Commission is maintaining its light touch in this sensitive area, allowing member states to debate the main political issues between themselves. This is the strategy of informal consultation described by national officials as 'a model of how to develop Community policy', but characterised slightly differently by one Brussels official: 'The member states are making an effort to reach agreement between themselves, partly because they want to keep the Commission out.' The Commission may decide to step in if such discussion results in the harmonised and simplified licence for intra-EC trade suggested by some member states. Brussels fears such a move would restrict access to the internal market and actually increase the administrative burden on EC companies. The Commission's timetable - legislation by early autumn, implementation by the end of the year - is ambitious, possibly too ambitious according to some northern member states which doubt whether their EC partners will manage to bring their export control systems up to scratch in 11 months. Even the Commission concedes in its paper that some member states 'have less sophisticated control systems and little practical experience, up to the present, in operating controls'. If that situation does not change quickly, EC members will be reluctant to take their neighbours' efficiency on trust alone when barriers come down on January 1 1993.</p>

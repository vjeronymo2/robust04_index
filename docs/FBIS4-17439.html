			<p>BFN     [Text] As before, the situation in the zone of the Karabakh  conflict remains tense. The press service of the  Nagorno-Karabakh defense army reported to Interfax that over the  previous 24 hours active hostilities were being waged on the  greater part of the confrontation line. Fierce hostilities do  not stop at the south-eastern part of the Karabakh front where  the Azerbaijani forces try to break the defense line on the  Martunin and Fizuli directions being supported by a great number  of armored vehicles and combat aviation.    According to the press service, last night Karabakh  positions  were attacked at two sections of Karabakh's Martunin region,  near the populated center of Kuropatkino and in the region of  Agburun. Experiencing great losses (according to preliminary  information, as many as 50 soldiers were killed on mine fields),  the Azerbaijani army managed to move forward and to seize three  Karabakh posts.    However, in two hours, the Karabakh formations started a  counterattack and by the morning of April 23 moved the adversary  to his starting positions. The Karabakh army lost two people  were killed and nine wounded in the course of these hostilities.    Simultaneously the headquarters of the Karabakh defense army  refuted information of Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry stating  that a great number of fighters had allegedly joined the  Azerbaijani army. These reports have been qualified "as pure  falsification intended to conceal facts of mass desertion of  Azerbaijani soldiers."    The border of the former Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous region  has been practically restored after the recent counterattack of  the Karabakh forces which liberated six villages in the north of  the Mardakert region, the leader of the Karabakh army press  center Serzh Arushanian reported to Interfax. In his words, as  of today only a small territory of the Mardakert region which  includes several villages, including the largest village  Leninavan in the north-east of the region is still under control  of the Azerbaijani forces.    In addition, Arushanian said that the Shaumian region is  still occupied though it has been part of Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic since September 1991.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Safety fear over E Europe nuclear plants Eastern Europe's ageing nuclear reactors will present a serious hazard unless more money is provided for their renovation and eastern European governments agree to implement the Vienna convention on nuclear safety, Foratom, the European nuclear industry body warned yesterday. Speaking in Brussels, Dr Claus Berke, president of Foratom, said that in spite of growing western concerns about the safety of the plants, in the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident nearly eight years ago, attempts to bring them into line with western safety standards were now almost entirely blocked in Russia, the Ukraine and Belarus. One reason for this is a lack of funds - although Foratom has calculated that DM15bn (Pounds 5.8bn) would be needed to carry out the necessary safety work, only Dollars 1.7bn of funds had been offered so far, the group said. However, the most significant reason for the delay has been the refusal of western companies to carry out the necessary replacement work, because of the failure by the governments in Russia. Ukraine and Belarus to sign the Vienna convention on nuclear safety. This ensures that western companies carrying out renovation work on eastern European nuclear plants will be not be liable for civil claims in the event of a nuclear explosion. 'It is because of this risk (of being sued) that western industry has become increasingly reluctant to continue working in those states which have not signed and implemented the Vienna convention,' said Mr Jonathan Heller, of the Foratom secretariat. He pointed out that so far virtually no replacement work had been carried out in any of the nuclear plants in Russia or the Ukraine, although companies had been allowed to proceed with analysis. The Ukraine has five nuclear power plants, including the infamous Chernobyl plant. Russia has nine, with the plant in St Petersburg - of a similar design to Chenobyl - suppying 40 per cent of the city's electricity. Foratom said yesterday that efforts were now being made to develop interim commitments with the separate states which would allow western companies to evade liability. The Lithuanian government recently amended its laws to allow ABB group to renovate the Ignalina plant in Lithuania, and Foratom hopes that other groups like Siemens will also be able to benefit from similar agreements. Faced with a declining market in western Europe, eastern Europe is regarded as a rich source of potential business for the European and US nuclear industry. However, Foratom admitted that the uncertain outcome of the Russian elections was now making it increasingly difficult for them to persuade the Russian government to take similar action. 'It is not very high on the Russian government's agenda,' said Mr Heller, who added that even if the delay was resolved it would take some three to four years before eastern European nuclear plants were brought into line with western safety standards.</p>

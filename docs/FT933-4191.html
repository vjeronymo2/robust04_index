			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Russia and US build on military ties RUSSIAN and US and defence leaders met yesterday to further improve military ties between Moscow and Washington and to discuss nuclear and other issues, Reuter reports from Washington. General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, and US defence secretary, Mr Les Aspin, met at the Pentagon to sign a defence co-operation agreement as the two countries rapidly build bridges. The two met in Germany three months ago and said then that the agreement would pave the way for a range of moves, including joint peacekeeping manoeuvres. One future exercise is expected to involve Russia's big 27th Motorised Rifle Division and the 3rd US Infantry Division based at Frankfurt. Mr Aspin said that future joint peacekeeping exercises could take place in Russia, the US and Europe. Yesterday's agreement also improves telephone communications between the US and Russian defence ministries, enabling Gen Grachev and Mr Aspin, as well as top military officers, to discuss issues on a regular basis. Mr Aspin noted that the plan includes annual meetings between US and Russian defence ministers as well as senior military officers and one exchange involving about 100 promising young military officers each from Russia and the US. The two ministers also discussed nuclear and other issues, including Russia's moves to destroy hundreds of former Soviet nuclear weapons on its territory. At the Pentagon last week, senior Russian and US defence officials signed two agreements providing additional US assistance to help Russia destroy the weapons. The nuclear agreements signed at the Pentagon last week provide Dollars 85m in US equipment and training to help build a storage facility in Russia for nuclear material taken from former Soviet warheads and for protection of civilian nuclear material in Russia. The agreements, along with other nuclear aid memorandums already signed, brought to Dollars 370m the total being provided by Washington to Moscow to destroy nuclear arms and protect nuclear material from falling into terrorist hands.</p>

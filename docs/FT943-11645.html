			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Shielding consumers from costs One of the main aims of yesterday's review was to contain the upward pressure on water bills caused by the huge investment in the water system. This spending was made necessary partly by decades of neglect and partly by the Brussels-led drive to deal with urban waste water and put an end to the pumping of raw sewage into the sea. Mr Byatt estimated total water company investment plans for the next 10 years at Pounds 24bn, of which Pounds 11bn is needed for quality improvements, Pounds 12bn for maintaining the system and Pounds 1bn for improving customer service. He hopes to cushion the impact on household water bills in a number of ways. First, a more rigorous review of the costs has shown that savings can be achieved. The urban waste water treatment directive, originally costed at Pounds 10bn, now carries a price tag of Pounds 6bn, partly because the recession has driven down construction costs and partly because the government has reclassified some 'sensitive waters'. A relaxation of rules on sewage discharges into rivers - yet to be announced  -is also thought to have contributed to a further Pounds 2bn in savings. Against that, the government has added Pounds 522m in river clean-up costs, although this is half what was projected. Second, the investment is to be stretched over a longer period. Although this will not mean any work is cancelled it will make the financing easier. Third, more of the cost is to be borne by the water companies rather than being passed to the consumer. Mr Byatt made clear yesterday that he believed there was considerable scope for savings in the industry. He said that it could bring down its operating costs and live with lower rates of return on capital. He estimated that operating expenditure on existing services could be reduced by 2 per cent a year up to 2000, and by 1 per cent each year after that. The bulk of this investment - Pounds 14bn - will happen in the first five years, and the aim is to stop nearly all sewage being pumped into the sea by 1998. After 2000 capital spending will fall sharply from an annual peak of about Pounds 3bn. The cost of these investments falls heaviest on water companies with large stretches of coastline, which is why customers in coastal areas will see water bills rising faster than those living inland. But inland companies, particular Thames Water, will be investing about Pounds 500m to prevent houses being flooded by sewage. One effect of the tougher financial discipline will be to force companies to finance more investment through borrowings. This will spread the cost to the future, and to later generations which will benefit from the improvements.</p>

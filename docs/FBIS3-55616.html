			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As BELAPAN has learned, U.S. President Bill Clinton  will pay a visit to Belarus on 16 January 1994. During the  visit, Belarusian and U.S. officials are expected to specify  their positions on the issue of security guarantees for Belarus,  which has implemented its constitutional law to become a neutral  and nonnuclear state. Although it is unlikely that such  guarantees will be announced on 16 January, in a conversation  with BELAPAN, [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislav Shushkevich  said that he will present, within the framework of Bill  Clinton's Partnership for Peace initiative, Belarus' strategy  for establishing a belt of neutral countries in Central Europe.    Problems connected with the protection of U.S. investments  in  Belarus will also be discussed during the negotiations.</p>

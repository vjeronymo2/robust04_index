			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Minister cleared of corruption Malaysia's official anti-corruption agency has cleared Mr S Samy Vellu, Malaysia's energy minister and head of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) political party, of any criminal offence in relation to a share transaction nearly three years ago, writes Kieran Cooke from Singapore. The Malaysian opposition had accused Mr Samy Vellu of 'hijacking' millions of shares in Telekom Malaysia when the telecommunications company was partially privatised in October 1990. The shares had originally been allocated by the government to the MIC and Malaysia's Indian community.</p>

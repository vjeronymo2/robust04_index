			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIUMPHANT YELTSIN WANTS TO LEAD KREMLIN'S 'LOYAL OPPOSITION'  </P> <P> Boris N. Yeltsin, the maverick Communist Party politician whose radical  populism brought him a dramatic victory in the Soviet Union's parliamentary  elections, immediately set out Monday to become the leader of what may in  future be called "the loyal opposition" in the country's new legislature.  </P> <P> After winning a stunning 89% of the 5.7 million votes cast in Moscow's citywide  constituency in the Congress of People's Deputies, Yeltsin declared his  candidacy for the Supreme Soviet, the new, full-time legislature to be elected  next month by members of the congress.  </P> <P> From there, he hopes to form a group of like-minded deputies, interested both  in better meeting the demands of what he calls "social justice" and in  accelerating the country's political, economic and social reforms to a pace  faster than favored by the Communist Party leadership.  </P> <P> And this could make Yeltsin, 58, a plain-spoken, burly construction engineer  from Siberia who reached the party's top ranks before breaking with the  leadership, the focus for those critical of the party, its policies and style  and looking for political alternatives.  </P> <P> "This has given perestroika (restructuring) greater urgency," an ebullient  Yeltsin said of his victory as supporters and journalists crowded into his  central Moscow office. "When nearly 90% of the people make clear their views,  how can you ignore them? We will proceed now with what the people want."  </P> <P> Even before the election, he calculated he could put together a bloc of perhaps  30 or 40 deputies in the Supreme Soviet. That is not quite a tenth of the  likely membership, but it holds the potential for what Yeltsin described as "a  very active, very influential and perhaps strategic force."  </P> <P> "We can perhaps take positions that will have an impact on (party and  government) policy, positions that cannot be ignored,positions that we can  present quite effectively, quite forcefully," he told The Times in a  pre-election interview. "Don't worry -- Yeltsin is not going into the Congress  of People's Deputies to sit quietly. I am not that type of man."  </P> <P> He also talked Monday of forming alliances with other groups -- the  nationalists from the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, other  rebels who have won in cities scattered around Russia and the Ukraine, the  environmentalists from across the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> His first task, however, will be to win election to the Supreme Soviet from the  Congress of People's Deputies, a body of 2,250 that will hold "supreme  authority" but will generally meet only once a year.  </P> <P> About 450 deputies are expected to be elected late next month to this new  legislature, but the exact number and the procedures are not yet known. As the  overwhelming winner in the country's biggest constituency, Yeltsin has a good  claim for inclusion, but Monday he described this as "my next struggle" against  party leaders who may try to keep him out.  </P> <P> Yeltsin had run on a platform calling upon the government to concentrate its  resources on improving living standards and focusing economic development far  more narrowly than in the past. He called for massive cuts in defense spending  and in the space program -- with the money to be transferred to the civilian  sector -- and for even greater cuts in industrial construction, which has long  been the motor of economic growth here.  </P> <P> But most of all, he had campaigned against the special privileges enjoyed by  party and government officials and against the rampant corruption in Soviet  society, particularly at official levels.  </P> <P> He supported President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on foreign policy and on the  overall strategy for perestroika, Yeltsin told The Times this month, but he  differed on some priorities and on many points of tactics.  </P> <P> His election rallies grew from hundreds at the start of the election campaign  to more than 10,000 on Saturday, the day before voters went to the polls.  </P> <P> But as his popularity became increasingly evident, the party apparatus grew  more and more worried. He had to fight for his nomination and then for every  meeting hall while his opponent, the director of an automobile plant, here,  benefited from the party's full organization powers.  </P> <P> Prevented from holding public rallies, Yeltsin's supporters took to the  streets, demonstrating twice last week in front of the Moscow City Hall.  Finally, battalions of younger soldiers were brought into Moscow to vote  against him.  </P> <P> "You can't fool the people," Yeltsin said Monday. "The more certain comrades in  the apparat (party) tried to defeat Yeltsin, the more that the people were  determined that Yeltsin should be elected and they should be heard. So be it."  </P> <P> Yeltsin was brought to Moscow by Gorbachev in 1985 to clean the political hacks  out the local party machine built under the late Leonid I. Brezhnev and to  crack down on corruption.  </P> <P> But he was denounced by Gorbachev for his "over-weening ambition" and dismissed  as the Moscow party leader in November, 1987; he was later removed as a  candidate, or non-voting, member of the ruling Politburo and given the  ministerial-level post of deputy chairman of the State Construction Committee.  </P> <P> "To be a people's deputy, I would happily give up this job, this office and all  of the paper work that go with them," Yeltsin said earlier this month. "To be a  people's deputy, to speak for the people in Parliament, that is what I want."  </P></p>

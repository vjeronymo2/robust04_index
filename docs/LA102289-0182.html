Va., in defiance of official warnings that flooding of  landing sites made the jump too dangerous on the one day a year it is allowed.  No injuries were reported in the jumps from the New River Gorge National  Bridge. Police cited one parachutist who landed in a parking lot for  parachuting onto federal property without a permit.  </P></p>

Chen Xitong said: Beijing's enterprise signed a cooperation  contract with the Matsushita Company eight or nine years ago.  Now the Beijing-Matsushita Color Kinescope Company Limited has  built three production lines and put its new product "Huawang"  on the market. This shows that our cooperation has blossomed  and has borne fruit.    He said: Mr. Matsushita Konosuke died several months before  the inauguration of the Beijing-Matsushita Company, which was  very regrettable. However, he had great foresight to select  such a man as Mr. Ninagawa Chikayoshi to carry on his  unfulfilled wish. Chinese people have a good tradition of  remembering all the friends who have helped us. When China is  conducting reform and opening up today, we particularly need the  cooperation of the friends in the world and are also very  grateful to them.    Mr. Ninagawa Chikayoshi expressed thanks for his appraisal.  He said: This project in Beijing is merely the first step of  the ideals of Mr. Matsushita Konosuke and it must succeed.  Therefore, I have exerted my utmost efforts during my six-year  stay in Beijing. The success should be attributed to the  comprehensive support of Beijing Municipality and the selfless  workers of the entire company.    After the meeting, Chen Xitong gave a wall carpet bearing  the  drawing of the Great Wall and an album to Mr. Ninagawa  Chikayoshi and his wife.    Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing, also met with Mr. Ninagawa  Chikayoshi and his wife recently. Li Qiyan said: Today's  development of the Beijing-Matsushita Color Kinescope Company  Limited is the result of the concerted efforts of both sides.  You are a very competent entrepreneur and we thank you for your  contributions. After returning to your country, it is hoped  that you will continue to publicize the friendly causes  developed by China and Japan and draw more Japanese friends to  Beijing to make investments and build plants. You and your wife  are also welcome to visit Beijing anytime. Li Qiyan also  presented a certificate of honor to Mr. Ninagawa Chikayoshi.  Municipal leaders Tie Ying, Lu Yucheng, Li Runwu, and Zhang  Peng were present at the meetings.</p>

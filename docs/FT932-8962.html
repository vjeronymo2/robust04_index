			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Books: The very Irish PM - The mixed life of Charles Haughey HAUGHEY: HIS LIFE AND UNLUCKY DEEDS by Bruce Arnold HarperCollins Pounds 17.50, 308 pages THERE ARE two ways of looking at this thoroughly recommendable biography of Charles Haughey, the former Irish prime minister. One is to admire the professionalism of the research and the quality of the writing and to be swept along to the author's seemingly objective conclusion that Haughey was a poseur who thought he could walk on water and sometimes almost did. The other is to stand back a bit and notice how much Ireland has changed over the years. Surely Haughey and his friends cannot have done everything wrong? Haughey was prime minister on and off for about the same period as Margaret Thatcher was prime minister of Britain, though without her continuity. Bruce Arnold has also written a biography of Lady Thatcher and thinks that the pair of them had something in common, 'including a shared disdain for those under them, and a fearful, obsessive concern for control and power'. Yet perhaps that is simply a truism about leaders who remain a long time in office. It may be more instructive to look at Haughey in an Irish context. Few will remember how backward Ireland was in the 1950s. It was cut off not only from mainstream Europe but also from mainstream Britain. It was excessively under the influence of the Catholic church. Then it began to change. The top of the civil service picked up the example of Italy, a country with some of the same problems, and Ireland began a process of liberalisation, mostly economic yet also political. It is now a matter of course that meetings of the European Council should take place in Dublin. Even the British no longer look down on the Irish Republic, as once they did: friendliness towards the Irish has grown, in spite of the IRA. All of those changes took place within Haughey's political career. It would be an exaggeration to give him too much of the credit for them, except to say that he was a liberal when he was at the department of justice and a relatively free market economist when he was minister of finance. Even when he made a wrong judgment, he was capable of reversing it. For example, he was luke-cold at most about the New Ireland Forum and the Anglo-Irish accord to which it led, but as prime minister he respected the agreement. He had one singular achievement in that he promoted the arts. He did so by providing tax breaks for the artists rather than subsidies for the audience, which is an enlightened as well as an economic approach. Ireland has done well out of its writers. Nevertheless, Haughey is a tainted figure. The main reason is his involvement in the arms scandal at the end of the 1960s. Until then the main case against him was simply that he was a bit of a show-off, 'a man in a mohair suit' seeking to combine new wealth and old. It was never clear, and Arnold provides no new evidence, where the money came from. Haughey had not been conspicuously interested in Northern Ireland before. Arnold suggests that he changed opportunistically because he saw the cause of the Catholic minority in the north as a route to power in the south and a way of keeping up with his rival, Neil Blaney. To be fair, events in Ulster had taken a turn for the worse and there was room for apprehension. Haughey as minister became at least party to illegal arms imports designed to cross the border, and was at least partly found out. Arnold says that the full details of the case will probably never be known. It took nearly a decade for Haughey to rebuild his reputation, yet the striking fact is that he did. There were other suggestions of scandals and errors of judgment to come, but where I think Arnold is unduly censorious is in pressing that these were peculiar to Haughey. They are more in the nature of Irish politics. True, Haughey was the son-in-law of a former prime minister, Sean Lemass, but there is a lot of nepotism about. The Irish system is very inbred: there are plenty of FitzGerald relations about as well as Haughey's. And when Haughey finally left office, his successor, Albert Reynolds, became involved in the kind of scandals that were familiar in the past. Arnold makes a revealing choice of word when he writes that Haughey was 'recruited' into Fianna Fail in 1947, just as he might have been recruited into the KGB or MI5. The party has its authoritarian tendencies and fondness for expulsions, but it does have achievements. This book is a wonderful demonstration of the Irish talent for attacking other Irishmen: it would be even better if it were less unremittingly hostile.</p>

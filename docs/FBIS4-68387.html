			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pavel Felgengauer: "Balkanization of History"] </F>   [Text] The Balkans are an unfortunate region for Russia.  Peter's Prut campaign, the Crimean War, the war of 1878 and the  subsequent Congress of Berlin--in hardly any other region have  the Russian military and diplomats experienced such humiliation  and failures. Nonetheless, Russia intervened time after time in  the bloody Balkan quarrels in the vain hope that the local  Slavs, close both in language and in faith, would appreciate it,  would be inspired, and would become for all time a dependable  outpost of the empire. But the whole problem is that the Balkans  were for Russia merely a military theater: Political and  military expansion was never seriously accompanied by economic  expansion. The region (Yugoslavia particularly) has always  gravitated toward Central Europe, primarily toward Germany.  Millions of former Yugoslavs, Serbs included, are working in the  FRG today also. The Deutsche mark is the main currency both in  Serbia and in Bosnia. It is to it that the "new" Yugoslav dinar  is tied.    Slav brethren have always at a difficult moment sought armed  assistance in Moscow, and when the storm has abated, they have,  perfectly naturally, forgotten about their "great northern  brother." In the summer of 1914 Russia emphatically supported  Serbia (having begun mobilization of the army) in the diplomatic  conflict with Austria-Hungary following the assassination of the  Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo. In the ensuing world war and the  revolution it caused, Russia was devastated, losing, according  to certain estimates, up to 10 million killed. And what remained  became the USSR. Serbia, on the other hand, as a result of the  war enlarged its territory several times over, annexing Bosnia,  Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, and Vojvodina.    Today the Serbs are once again attempting to draw Russia  into  their war in the Balkans. The "unprecedented success of Russian  diplomacy" in Sarajevo at the end of February was (this is now  perfectly obvious) prepared in Belgrade and Pale by no means for  reconciliation in earnest in Bosnia. The Serbs, it would seem,  are of a mind to fight until they have taken all the surrounded  Muslim cities (Sarajevo included). And several hundred of our  airborne forces have found themselves in Sarajevo simultaneously  hostages of Russia's future behavior in the region (totally  dependent on the mood of local field commanders) and, on top of  that, a live shield against possible NATO bombing raids.    When the Serbian tanks tore into Gorazde, all the same  (during the latest armistice negotiations), Mr. Churkin threw up  his hands--"he had, alas, been deceived." In which there is, of  course, no particular perfidy--the internationally isolated  Serbs have no other solution. It was, after all, the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (not the Serbs) that should have  done everything possible to prevent Russia's involvement in the  war, having concentrated its efforts instead in republics in  which the ruble, not the Deutsche mark, is the main currency.  There are, for that matter, no dazzling conditions for  "unprecedented successes" in the "near abroad."    The lessons of history have yet to teach anyone anything.  Last night a new contingent of crack Russian airborne forces  flew to the former Yugoslavia to show that Russia is still a  world power with global interests.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (4): The deciding factors - Where to locate 'whatever the ultimate decision, it always ends up as a compromise,' according to Dr Wilfried Vossen, managing director of Plant Location International. PLI, part of the Price Waterhouse group, has expanded quickly on the back of the immense complexities facing businesses increasingly forced to consider the best locations within Europe from which to manufacture, distribute and manage, writes Michael Cassell. According to Dr Vossen, although the science of location has improved beyond recognition in recent years, many mistakes are still being made. The consequences of getting it wrong can be calamitous,involving crippling financial costs and heavy damage to relationships with local communities and customers. 'Many important decisions are still being decided in head office, thousands of miles away from the action. Remote bosses come up with ideas which are not feasible. The local, Europe-based management can be excellent but the people upstairs are still inclined to think they know better.' Ernst &amp; Young, which has its own location advisory service, also acknowledges that there are many long-held myths about European countries which can often cloud corporate decision-making. According to 'Regions of the New Europe', jointly produced by Ernst &amp; Young and Corporate Location, the corporate investment specialist: 'Cliches and stereotypes about countries and their customs can blind a corporate manager to a particular area's benefits. 'Governments and regional authorities are increasingly active in trying to play up their area's attractiveness to corporate investors. 'For those companies seeking to set up a new facility it can be all too confusing as rival locations try to convince you that they are situated at the centre of Europe and are the best location for your business, regardless of activity'. Organisations like PLI and Ernst &amp; Young insist, predictably enough, that no company is likely to have at its finger-tips the breadth and depth of information necessary as a pre-condition of taking a decision on where to locate. Bring in the specialists, they suggest. But the fact that even the very largest of multinational companies now resort to the help of outside consultants, at least during some stage of the process, suggests that they might have a point. With giants like Ford Motor, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Memorex, Mobil, Ricoh, Texas Instruments, Wellcome Foundation and Westinghouse all seeking external advice on the issue, the message is getting home. Even the Japanese, who began cautiously by using location specialists to provide limited information to feed into their own decision-making structure, now increasingly delegate a growing proportion of location work to outside experts. So what are the common fundamentals which any enterprise will have to consider before making a decision which could involve investment running into many millions of dollars? Given that the company's overall strategy is clear, most experts agree that the single most important factor is market proximity. Quality of transport infrastructure and information systems can have an impact on market accessibility but crude distances between supplier and end-market matter most. It may be an obvious point but it is not the only one. The nearest location may well be the most populous and expensive, with high labour costs and skill shortages. Dr Vossen's 'compromise' comes into play. Labour costs themselves rank high up the list of comparative factors. But while the peripheral regions of Europe may offer the lowest manpower costs, what levels of skill and education come with them? Productivity remains another key factor, with labour attitudes and performance varying widely across Europe. So while some former eastern European countries might offer labour rates more usually associated with parts of the Far East and much closer market proximity, poor labour productivity might easily outweigh other advantages. There is evidence, however, that improved productivity performances can be 'imported' by the inward investor, who discovers there is little wrong with the available, local labour that more efficient machinery and good working practices cannot significantly improve. Many other factors also come into play. PLI recently conducted a survey among more than 300 international companies to establish their priorities when choosing locations for various operational functions. The survey demonstrated that the main priorities for consideration by potential corporate investors centred initially on operating and investment costs, followed by general and then more specific operating conditions in respective locations. When it came to more detailed location factors, companies clearly demonstrated the crucial importance to them of good business communications. Respondents repeatedly put telephone, fax and data lines at the top of their shopping list, ranking their availability alongside any of the supposedly more important location factors. A great deal of emphasis is also placed on the presence of a stable political situation and social climate, low labour costs and reliable power supplies. Another vital ingredient in any location decision can be the availability or otherwise of investment incentives offered by a range of state and regional bodies. The packages on offer vary widely, although given the restricted funds available in many countries and regions, success can depend on how well the applicant company argues its case. In most countries, factors determining the level of grant will include the number of jobs created, the degree of export business generated and the high-tech content of the particular process. Dr Vossen says: 'Before an investor gets to an appraisal of incentives, there may be 20 technical chapters and numerous cost-structure considerations to go through. Only then will available incentives enter the equation, though they can certainly prove critical in the final decision-making process.' But the pattern has been changing. Given the recession and the continuing drive to reduce investment costs, potential inward investors are tending to look at the extent of financial help available from outside agencies at a much earlier stage in their calculations. More than ever, the financial help on offer locally will help decide which parts of the community prosper from the next wave of corporate investment.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A RATING OF DETAILED LOCATION FACTORS: WHAT COMPANIES ARE LOOKING FOR  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In a survey of more than 300 international companies, the figures below indicate their priorities when choosing locations for various operational functions.

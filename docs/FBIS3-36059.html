The law would outline the powers of the National Security  Council and the government in managing security-related  institutions.    The projected Satversme (Constitution) Protection Bureau,  the  Defense Ministry's military counterintelligence service, the  Home Guards informative service and the Interior Ministry's  security police are the basic institutions to ensure the  national security, under the bill.    The laws on the Satversme Protection Bureau and the national  security could become a foundation for the country's all-round  security doctrine, the committee said.    The Defense Committee's bill is designed as an alternative  to  the Cabinet's counterintelligence plan.    Silars claims that the bill is ready for acceptance in the  first reading in the Saeima plenary session.    The committee meeting was attended by Defense Minister  Valdis  Pavlovskis, Interior Minister Girts Kristovskis and related  security officers.</p>

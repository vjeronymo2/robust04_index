			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 16, IRNA -- Foreign Ministry spokesman  Mahmoud Mohammadi Monday condemned the Austrian Government's  granting of an award to sentenced apostate Salman Rushdie and  interpreted it as background for more disrespect to divine  religions.    The Austrian minister of education and arts recently gave an  award to the writer of the highly sacrilegious book `The Satanic  Verses'.    The Iranian official said this measure is condemned not only  by the Islamic republic but also by all world Muslims and  followers of other divine religions.    Rushdie sentenced to death for his crime is in hiding in  Britain since 1989 with world Muslims determined to bring him to  justice.    The apostate who has hurt the feelings of the world's over  one billion Muslims, is being backed by certain Western  countries who from time to time reward him for his misdeed, in  scant respect of Muslim sentiments.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries It is not only pharmaceutical companies that catch colds when the US Food and Drug Administration sneezes. BAT's shares, too, have spluttered after the FDA attacked high-nicotine tobacco. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the latest row, the trend towards tighter regulation is unmistakable. BAT describes the FDA as an 'agency with an agenda' aiming 'to acquire jurisdiction over tobacco so that it can regulate it out of existence'. That makes its Dollars 1bn acquisition of American Tobacco appear all the more heroic - or foolhardy. BAT's shares have underperformed the market by 8 per cent since it moved to increase its exposure to US tobacco, although other unsettling factors have been at work. BAT has been hit by the dollar's weakness and it has only recently become apparent how badly Farmers was knocked by the Californian earthquake. Yet if BAT's tobacco worries are confined to the US, its rating looks decidedly mean. Its tobacco interests are valued on an earnings multiple of around five when insurance is given a market rating. That may only reinforce the logic of hiving off tobacco, even though Philip Morris has just baulked at the idea. After all, cigarette sales in the developing world should more than offset shrinking US demand.</p>

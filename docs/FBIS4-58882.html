			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-'Azim Darwish: "The Decision of the </F> Labor and Nasirite Parties To Coordinate Policies Could Be the  Prelude To Setting Up a United Opposition Front"]    [Text] The Islamist-oriented Labour Party of Ibrahim Shukri  and the erstwhile anti-Islamist Nasserist Democratic Party of  Dia'-al- Din Dawud have decided to establish a joint secretariat  for policy coordination in a move seen by some opposition  sources as the first step toward the creation of an opposition  "national front."    The move was reminiscent of Labour's attempt seven years ago  to set up a national front to contest the 1987 parliamentary  elections. The result, however, was smaller in scale--a  trilateral alliance grouping Labour, the Liberal Party of  Mustafa Kamil Murad and the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, which  was dubbed the Islamic Alliance at the time.    Labour's rapprochement with the Nasserists--who are  traditionally anti-Islamist--raised a few eye-brows because its  alliance with the Brotherhood is very much alive. The Liberals  walked out last year.    Hilmi Murad, Labour's deputy chairman, denied that the  decision to close ranks with the Nasserists signalled that they  were "in" and the Brotherhood was "out." For his part,  Dia'-al-Din Dawud said the Nasserist Party was prepared for  cooperation with all, and not only Labour.    Murad told Al-Ahram Weekly the move is "the start of forging  cooperation with all opposition parties which may be ready to  cooperate. By coordinating policies and exchanging views on  public issues, the opposition will gain in strength and some  type of front may be born." He said other opposition parties  will be "contacted."    Dia'-al-Din Dawud said the Nasserist Party has no "political  animosities. Our hands are stretched out for cooperation with  all, in any sphere where a meeting of viewpoints may be  possible." He said the Nasserists' relationship with Labour was  "not of a special nature."    Offering his explanation of the developments that led to the  coordination agreement, Dawud said that since the call for a  national dialogue was issued by President Husni Mubarak,  opposition parties have been holding coordination meetings.  These meetings, he said, grouped not only the Nasserists and  Labour but also the Wafd and the Progressive Unionist  (al-Tajammu') parties and others. "Cooperation with all parties  is continuing... The decision (to coordinate policies) with  Labour is part of this framework and is part of meetings that  are also taking place with others, and even more intensively  with al-Tajammu'."    Murad did not deny the apparent contradiction between the  Nasserists and Labour's Islamist orientation. "Yes, there are  contradictions between us and any other opposition party... It  is only natural that our programmers should be different. But  some sort of cooperation and coordination is necessary."    Dawud, speaking in the same vein, said the leaders of all  opposition parties had agreed to set up a coordination  committee, but it has not been formed yet. "This goes to show  that coordination will not be confined to Labour and the  Nasserists. The principle has been approved in general."    Murad, asked why the rapprochement began with the  Nasserists,  although other parties appeared to be closer in position to  Labour, said the Labour-Nasserists agreement "came by chance."  He said the meeting between the two parties was also to include  the Wafd and the al-Tajammu' "but this did not happen, for  emergency reasons." He expressed hope the rapprochement will be  "the nucleus of a national front." Asked whether the  rapprochement was meant to make up for dwindling popular support  resulting from Labour-Brotherhood differences, Murad replied:  "Who said that popular support is declining? The attendance at  party rallies is overwhelming and our newspaper has a gret  readership." He said Labour's close relations with the  Brotherhood will continue.    Dawud, answering a similar question, claimed the Nasserists  have a stronger political presence than any other party,  including the ruling National Democratic Party. "This is  because we are the party which cares about the interests of the  masses and which has been associated with policies that realised  justice, equality and security for all the working factions of  the people," he said.    Like Murad, Dawud expressed hope that a national front would  be born. "I do not believe that the formation of this front  will be difficult. I think that we are being driven by  developments in the direction of its formation."</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Trade Indemnity sees 15% fall in company failures A CLEAR sign of an end to the UK recession was given yesterday by Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurance company. It estimated that the number of UK company failures would be 15 per cent lower this year than last. A further 5 per cent fall could be expected next year, according to the company's estimates - based on reports from its 4,500 clients. In the first six months of this year business failures were down 19 per cent on the same period of 1992. Mr Vic Jacob, managing director, said: 'It's nice to have some bright comments. All of the major trends are in the right direction. I think it is almost three and a half years since we have been able to take a more positive view.' Trade Indemnity had not had to make any adjustments to underwriting provisions because of the fewer claims and failures. The first-half results, released yesterday, showed gross claims from continuing operations down by a fifth to Pounds 51.4m. But Mr Jacob warned that turnover was still static or even declining at many companies. This was highlighted in Trade Indemnity's premium growth - which tends to rise with company turnover - of just 2.3 per cent to Pounds 71.3m. 'So far our policyholders are not reporting increased expectations of turnover.' Mr Jacob also said that a Pounds 1m provision released because of the improving economic position in the UK had been offset by increased provisions to cover worsening conditions in the rest of Europe. Net premiums written were unchanged at Pounds 26.4m and net claims fell to Pounds 24m, from Pounds 27.6m. There were exceptional costs of Pounds 917,000 from the voluntary redundancy of about 40 staff. The company also showed a tax credit of Pounds 2.1m, from its total unused tax losses from past underwriting of more than Pounds 30m. Historically the rate of company failures continues to rise for 18 months after the beginning of economic recovery, partly as a result of over-trading. But Mr Jacob said it was too early in the recovery to see these effects. Premium income from the export cover division - which sells primarily to businesses in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development - had risen by 20 per cent. This partly reflected the recovery of sterling and strength of British exporters.</p>

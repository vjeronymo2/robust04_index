			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's latest half yearly Outlook is expected to forecast modest growth and rising unemployment in the industrialised world next year. Tuesday: A majority of analysts expects the US Federal Open Markets Committee to maintain a neutral stance on monetary policy at its meeting today. Thursday: In Japan, markets are closed for the emperor's birthday. In the US, minutes from the November 16 open markets committee meeting are released. Friday: Most markets, other than in Japan, shut down early on Christmas Eve, or are closed for the entire day. In London, the stock exchange has a half-day session and Liffe closes at lunchtime. The week between Christmas and the New Year is relatively quiet for statistics in Europe, although there is a steady stream from Japan and the US. In the UK, the British Bankers Association publishes monthly figures for mortgage lending.

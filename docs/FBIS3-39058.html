			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Brussels] </F>   [Text] The NATO allies tonight issued an ultimatum to the  warring factions in Bosnia, paving the way for the first  military action in its history. After 12 hours of talks in  Brussels, they agreed to launch air strikes against the Bosnian  Serbs unless they withdraw from Sarajevo within 10 days.    The ultimatum, after tortuous negotiations and detailed  consideration of all military and political implications for the  West, requires a withdrawal out of the Bosnian capital of all  heavy artillery by at least 13 miles, or the handing-over of  weaponry to UN forces.    Tonight's historic declaration also threatens air strikes  immediately if any shelling resumes in the wake of last  weekend's street market massacre which killed 68 civilians.    Britain's Ambassador to NATO, John Weston, endorsed the move  on the Government's behalf after assurances that the decision  will not endanger three key goals:     -  The continuation of  humanitarian aid supplies to the besieged citizens of  Sarajevo.    -  The maintenance of the peace process.    -  The containment  of the 22-month conflict within the borders of the former  Yugoslavia.    Mr Weston had insisted that air strikes had to be seen to be  of practical benefit and not just punitive retaliation in  response to last Saturday's [5 February] atrocity. Only if air  strikes can be justified as of practical military benefit to  safeguard lives and help end the war can the NATO allies rely on  support from elsewhere in the world.    The talks lasted much longer than expected. Greece insisted  from the start that it did not want any involvement in the air  strikes which, if they go ahead, are likely to be launched from  Italy and from aircraft carriers.    Argument raged throughout the day over the precise terms of  the ultimatum, with the Americans pressing for a tighter  seven-day deadline and a requirement to withdraw heavy artillery  20 miles.    An announcement from Sarajevo that the Bosnian Serbs were  already preparing to pull back by noon tomorrow did not deter  the NATO allies. Officials at NATO headquarters said such  pledges could not be relied upon and would play little part in  tonight's final decision.    The most reluctant signatories to tonight's agreement remain  the British, Canadians and Greeks, and hopes remain high that  the Serbs will fulfil all requirements and avert a NATO response  which -- even with the best military soundings from on the spot  -- could have unforseen consequences.    Britain's General Sir Michael Rose, who has just taken  command of UN Forces in Bosnia, has been instrumental in  supplying his political masters with the necessary strategic  information for a tough political decision to be taken.    Britain's endorsement follows recognition that Saturday's  massacre was "a turning point," in the words of Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd.    [The declaration made clear there would be no extension of  the deadline offered to the Serbs.    [It called for "the withdrawal or regrouping and placing  under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] control, within 10 days, of  heavy weapons (including tanks, artillery pieces, mortars,  multiple rocket launchers, missiles and anti-aircraft weapons)  of the Bosnian Serb forces located in an area within 20 km of  the centre of Sarajevo and excluding an area within 2 km of the  centre Pale."    [The allies also called on the Bosnian government to hand  over its heavy weapons to UN control within the same deadline.    ["Ten days from 24 GMT February 10 heavy weapons of any of  the parties found within the Sarajevon exclusion zone, unless  controlled by UNPROFOR, will, along with their direct and  essential military support facilities, be subject to NATO  airstrikes which will be conducted in close co-ordination with  the UN Secretary General and will be consistent with the North  Atlantic Council's decisions of August 2 and 9, 1993."    [The declaration authorised air strikes, at UN request,  against artillery or mortar positions in or around Sarajevo,  from 0001, Friday, February 21, which were determined by  UNPROFOR to be responsible for attacks against civilian targets  in the city.    [At British insistence the final communique made direct  reference to the need to secure a negotiated settlement, and  pointed out "the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo could be a  step toward the placing of Sarajevo under UN administration, in  comformity with that plan."    [This met the British demand that air strikes must be in the  context of improving the situation and not merely exacting  revenge.    [The 13-paragraph document demanded "strict respect" for the  safety of UNPROFOR and other UN and relief agency workers  throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the right of free access  for them to Sarajevo.    [The allies also expressed "indignation" at "indiscriminate  attacks which have once again struck the people of Sarajevo in  recent days." The siege of the city was continuing, "and that  consequently the Bosnian Serbs bear the main responsibility for  the tragic loss of civilian life that results from it."    [A key element in NATO deliberations was the longer term  consequence of air strikes.    [Mr Hurd made clear earlier this week that "one day of  satisfaction" was not justified without advance knowledge of  what happens on the second day and the third day.    [Britain's troops on the ground in Sarajevo would be  vulnerable if the Serbs launched retaliatory strikes.    [But NATO aircraft and spy satellites have been monitoring  all Serb gun emplacements, ammunition dumps and command centres  for months and believe they can isolate key targets if necessary  and pre-empt any effective retaliation.    [Already eight RAF Jaguar fighter aircraft are on stand-by  in  Italy with a further four available in Britain, plus six Navy  Sea Harriers from the aircraft carrier Ark Royal in the Adriatic.    [But the hope in the Foreign Office tonight was that the  NATO  threat would be enough to convince the Bosnian Serbs to ease  their stranglehold and make life more tolerable for Sarajevo's  beleaguered citizens while efforts towards a negotiated peace  acceptable to all sides carry on.]</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Markets: The predator grows leaner and sleeker - The Bottom Line ONE OF the more familiar claims made by chief executives of acquisitive conglomerates is: 'We don't need an acquisition'. On cue this week it was the turn of Greg Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins as he announced an 18 per cent increase in profits in the year to May and a 15 per cent dividend rise. 'We don't need an acquisition to outperform,' Hutchings said. 'If we can get cream on the coffee from an acquisition, then great.' But as the group, whose interests span Smith &amp; Wesson handguns, bathroom fittings and mechanical valves, enters its first full year in the FT-SE 100 index - only 11 years after Hutchings started on the acquisition trail - the claim is increasingly questioned. The growing urgency stems, ironically, from the fierce pursuit of return on assets and cash flow which have underpinned the group's success during the recession. Managers of the operating companies are rewarded on their ability to meet targets for the return on the capital they control in their businesses, a strategy that has generated a strong cash flow and profits. Last year Tomkins' cash balances rose from Pounds 46m to Pounds 110m. If a business is facing a bad patch and sales volume is falling, managers are not encouraged to maintain market share but to cut the assets utilised and return cash to the Tomkins corporate centre. Not for Tomkins the approach adopted by Williams Holdings, the main rival conglomerate to emerge in the 1980s, which puts much greater store on investments which maintain market share and can take longer to pay back. As a result of these tight return-on-capital criteria, Tomkins has opened itself to the charge that it is under-investing. Last year Tomkins' capital expenditure was lower than its depreciation charge, not what one would expect from a group encouraging organic growth from its businesses. Hutchings says Tomkins always ensures operating managers have access to funds if they can justify the investment. 'All our 45 companies would say we are not under-invested to produce organic growth,' Hutchings says. Once the recession ends, he says, high operational gearing will fuel rapid organic growth. Tomkins has never promised more than 'above average growth'. Nevertheless, the City has got used to more. Some analysts question whether Tomkins can continue to out perform the market to the extent it has grown to expect unless it makes another acquisition. Not that this is a bad thing. The acquisition of Philips Industries of the US in 1990 - only the seventh in 11 years - contributed Pounds 50m to operating profits of Pounds 116.7m last year and was an essential ingredient of Tomkins' 5 per cent earnings-per-share rise. This acquisition helped Tomkins shares outperform the market last year by 40 per cent. However, if an acquisition is in the offing, this alone may provide a cap to further share price outperformance. Large acquisitions - and Tomkins tends not to bother with small bolt-ons - means a sizeable rights issue. As for targets? It will probably be in the UK as Tomkins is approaching the time when it wil not pay pay enough mainstream tax to offset against advance corporation tax. And timing? This year's interim results reporting season, which peaks in September, could be the last straw for bombed out companies whose hopes for a second quarter upturn were not justified. Slashed dividends and profits forecasts may accompany a gloomy season and lead to a fall in asset prices that Tomkins now says are too expensive. Hawker Siddeley fell prey to BTR after a dismal interim statement last year; others may go the same way this year. Tomkins will be among the circling predators.</p>

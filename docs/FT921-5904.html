			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / The European Market: UK stays away from E Europe BRITISH companies must change their attitudes towards doing business in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union or face a continuing decline in market share in the region, according to Mr Norman Wooding, chairman of the London-based East European Trade Council (EETC). 'Despite the revolutions of 1989, the British are not doing business with eastern Europe or the CIS,' said Mr Wooding, a former director of Courtaulds, which ventured into the Soviet market in the 1950s. 'The opportunities are enormous, but we are not taking advantage of them,' he added. Certainly, the political instability in the CIS acts as a deterrent for UK companies. Mr Janek Geller, managing director of Golodetz (Overseas), a family firm which first started trading with Russia in 1921, says confidence has been further dented by the failure of Russian enterprises to meet their payments. 'Payments can no longer be guaranteed,' he said. Officials at the EETC estimate that outstanding payments due by former Soviet firms to British companies total Pounds 2bn. The break-up of the Soviet Union has also disrupted links between traditional trading partners. The foreign trade organisations, which acted on behalf of Soviet enterprises have disappeared. Shipping goods in and out of the CIS is another problem. 'You can no longer be sure if you can move goods across from one republic into another. The republics are putting up their own trade barriers, and have different currencies,' Mr Geller explained. Mr Wooding from the EETC says the CIS is likely to attract the big companies, particularly the oil conglomerates. 'Its a vast market. Only 3 per cent of the identified oil reserves have been extracted; only 9 per cent of gas reserves. What are UK oil companies waiting for?" Officials at Britain's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), point out that many British companies are waiting for the CIS to draw up legislation on foreign investment, property rights and repatriation of profits. In addition, UK companies are waiting for cover from the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), an arm of the DTI. Earlier this month, the ECGD made Pounds 280m available for medium-term export credit cover, and investment insurance for Russia and other republics. But the release of credit is conditional upon all the CIS republics adopting IMF-backed reforms. They must also be up-to-date in their existing debt obligations. In eastern Europe, the ECGD provides cover for only Hungary and Czechoslovakia. UK companies interested in trading with the CIS and eastern Europe are impatient with the ECGD'S cautious approach. 'ECGD cover is hedged with restrictions, and their premiums are too high,' an official from the EETC said. 'Their premium is 50 per cent higher than other countries in Europe. UK companies are forced to add the ECGD premium on to their prices. How can we be competitive?' Mr Michael Cooper, who now runs a consultancy company, was instrumental in getting Lee Cooper jeans into eastern Europe in the 1970s. He believes that the ECGD's premiums, coupled with the credit squeeze by British banks, are inhibiting UK companies from venturing into eastern Europe. 'The really determined ones', he says, 'simply by-pass British financial institutions and go to Vienna or Frankfurt to seek financing'. Mr John Busby of APV Baker, a British food processing company which has been trading with the Soviet Union since the 1970s, says German and Austrian banks understand industry's needs better than their UK counterparts. 'The Germans, whose trade links with the region go back centuries, take a long view on investments,' explained Mr Busby. 'Many UK companies, in the case of eastern Europe, expect profits in the short term. That is a mistake. They still do not realise that eastern Europe and the CIS is a long haul, a long commitment, and requires lots of hard work and expertise.' Mr Wooding believes that innate conservatism, and a persistent ignorance about eastern Europe and the CIS, have also contributed to the reluctance to tackle this vast market. 'UK companies hated communism more than their counterparts on the Continent,' a DTI official explains. The DTI and the EETC believe attitudes are changing, but slowly.</p>

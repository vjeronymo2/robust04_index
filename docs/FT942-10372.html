			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Environment failures rapped The government has failed to keep more than 27 environmental commitments, according to the annual audit of its environmental performance published yesterday. The count does not include some of the slippages in policy implementation for which the government has been most heavily criticised. Environmentalists yesterday attacked the government's failure to develop an underground store for nuclear waste, and the lack of finance for the newly created Energy Saving Trust, which is intended to promote energy efficiency. The 200-page report lists the action taken on 657 separate environmental commitments. The report is the third annual assessment of This Common Inheritance, the government's environmental strategy published in 1990. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said yesterday that there had been action 'on almost all commitments'. While the government was determined to maintain high environmental standards this could be achieved within the framework of competitiveness and by reducing regulation. The National Audit Office yesterday criticised English Nature, the government-funded conservation body, for its management of England's 3,700 sites of special scientific interest. It said many reserves were hard to find and few were signposted. This Common Inheritance - The Third Year Report. HMSO. Pounds 21.

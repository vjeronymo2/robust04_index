			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Black Sea fleet compromise agreed UKRAINE and Russia averted a clash over the future of the Black Sea fleet yesterday by suspending their unilateral claims to the former Soviet Union's most powerful warm-water naval force. The compromise was negotiated by telephone between Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Mr Boris Yeltsin, his Russian counterpart. It followed a day of acute tension in Sevastopol, the fleet's headquarters in the Crimea. Admiral Igor Kasatonov, the fleet's commander, revealed that he had deployed armoured personnel carriers to patrol the streets following rumours of a Ukrainian attack. The carriers have now returned to base. The fleet personnel is made up largely of Ukrainians although its command is mainly Russian. Crimea itself was once part of Russia and is now a district of Ukraine. Conflict over the fleet has marked a low point in increasingly hostile relations between Ukraine and Russia, the two most powerful members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Ukraine had threatened to leave the CIS over the issue, it emerged. The row has caused anxiety among western leaders concerned about the former Soviet Union's nuclear capacity. In Brussels yesterday, Nato officials said the alliance had told Moscow and Kiev of 'serious allied concerns' about Ukraine's decision to suspend the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to Russia for destruction as previously agreed. It said in a statement that the transfer of all such weapons to Russia should be completed by the agreed deadline of July 1. However the Ukrainian parliament yesterday ratified the government's decision not to hand over its tactical weapons to Russia for destruction until satisfactory international guarantees were in place. Ukrainian authorities and the commander of the fleet announced the agreement on the Black Sea fleet yesterday. A commission will be set up to negotiate the division of the fleet between the two Slavic giants. Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers are due to meet in the next few days to discuss the issue. Earlier this week, Mr Kravchuk claimed jurisdiction over the entire fleet. Mr Yeltsin responded with a decree also laying claim to the fleet, numbering 350 ships, including 45 battleships, more than 150 aircraft, and 28 submarines with nuclear capacity. The fleet is strategically important because of its nuclear capacity and because of its access to the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It was traditionally, in the former Soviet Union, a counterbalance to the US Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. Only 1 per cent of Black Sea fleet sailors had sworn an oath of allegiance to Ukraine, according to the admiral. But Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, a member of the Ukrainian negotiating team, said 70 per cent of sailors would like to swear allegiance to Ukraine. Symbols were at the heart of the compromise between the two states. Admiral Kasatonov confirmed that Mr Yeltsin's order to hoist the Russian tricolour over the ships of the Black Sea fleet had been suspended. The fleet still flies the old Soviet naval flag, which Admiral Kasatonov acknowledged was inappropriate since the Soviet Union no longer existed. The Ukrainians said the second article of the Ukrainian presidential decree, which provided for the creation of a Ukrainian navy based on the fleet, has been temporarily rescinded. Mr Pavlychko said that the compromise was the result of Ukrainian brinkmanship. Congress trembles, Page 2 Yeltsin to pay a price, Page 2</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpt" of address by Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze </F> to a meeting of the Citizens Union party on 26 February; place  not given -- recorded]    [Text] Our prime concern is Abkhazia, our return to  Abkhazia, and the resolution of the Samachablo [South Ossetia]  issue.    Unfortunately, the Geneva meeting [Georgian-Abkhaz talks  held  22-25 February] ended without result. Even so, one important  thing happened there. When there was talk about Abkhazia's  status -- we should also make compromises -- the positions of  our delegation, the Russian delegation, UN representatives, and  our friends -- the United States, France, and Germany --  coincided. This is very important.    It also emerged that separatism is what it is and that a  different language would probably be necessary in talking to  them. Not only at our level, but also at the Security Council,  in Russia and elsewhere. This was very important as far as  political settlement and political solution are concerned. By  the way, speaking about status, we found Russia's Constitution  and experience, as well as the world experience, rather useful.    Anyway, the fact that our positions coincided gives us an  opportunity to work more actively.    To tell you the truth, what interests me most in my visit to  the United States is to establish relations with the IMF, the  World Bank and, especially, to visit the Security Council. I do  not rule out the possibility that a Security Council meeting may  be held on 8 or 9 March in which I will participate, provided we  succeed in having this issue included in the agenda. Then, it  is possible that the issue of peacekeeping forces will be  decided.</p>

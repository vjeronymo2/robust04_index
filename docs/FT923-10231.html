			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / ICI sets out radical plan to split its operations: Two units envisaged to cover drugs and bulk chemicals operations IMPERIAL Chemical Industries yesterday signalled the European chemicals industry's most important shake-up since the second world war by proposing to split itself into two separate companies. Under the radical proposal, ICI, founded in 1926, would float off its drugs and agrochemicals operations, to be known as ICI Bio, as a separate publicly-listed company. The remaining bulk chemical business would be known as ICI. The company also said ICI Bio would plan to raise cash through a share issue at the time of the demerger. The surprise move was welcomed by analysts, although some said the company still had to answer questions about the allocation of debt and tax liabilities before the demerger's benefits could be evaluated. In spite of poor half-year results announced yesterday, ICI's shares ended 76p up at Pounds 11.71. Sir Denys Henderson would be chairman of the two groups which would continue to share the headquarters at Millbank in London for at least two years. Mr Ronnie Hampel, presently chief operating officer, would be chief executive of ICI. Mr David Barnes, presently a board member with responsibility for the Americas and Europe, would become chief executive of ICI Bio. Shareholders would receive one share in each of the new companies for every existing ICI share. ICI, with a turnover of about Pounds 9bn, would drop from number five in the world chemicals industry to number seven. The pharmaceuticals company, with turnover of about Pounds 4bn, would become the world's ninth largest drugs group. The decision to draw up detailed plans to split the company was taken in December last year, seven months after Lord Hanson surprised the City by taking a 2.8 per cent stake in the chemicals giant, prompting speculation that he might make a bid. The proposal was put forward by Mr John Mayo of SG Warburg, ICI's financial adviser. Mr Mayo, a 36-year-old corporate finance director at Warburg, worked with a small team on the proposal for four months. It was unofficially put to the board in April, and was finally approved in principle on Wednesday. A final decision on whether to demerge will not be taken until the publication of the group's preliminary results in February 1993. Sir Denys said the proposals would allow the separate groups to take part more fully in the coming restructuring of the world's chemicals industry. 'For the businesses, the move would provide the chance to seize opportunities for global expansion from a firm financial platform,' Sir Denys said. 'Each of the new groupings would enable each company to respond better to future opportunities. 'ICI now comprises two distinct families of businesses with the same values, but very different technologies, operating requirements and market needs.' Analysts argue that the separation would also make the two groups far less vulnerable to takeover. ICI's Bio would be too expensive for a contested takeover. The group's remaining operations would be unattractive as a target. Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries, the conglomerate's North American arm, and partner of Lord Hanson, said yesterday: 'If ICI had not spent so much time during the last year fighting a bid that was never made and spent it on seeing how it could improve shareholder value it might have come up with a better solution a lot earlier.' The plan would represent one of the largest restructurings of the European chemicals industry since the Allies broke up I G Farben of Germany. The plan envisages ICI consisting of its existing paints, materials, industrial chemicals and explosives businesses. ICI Bio would have the pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, seeds and remaining specialty chemicals operations.

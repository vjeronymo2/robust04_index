			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi by </F> Michael Kadereit in Arcore; date not given: "Berlusconi: I Had  To Intervene Myself"]    [Excerpts] [Kadereit] What drove you into politics?    [Berlusconi] The only important thing was my country. A  great change has taken place here; as a result of the corruption  scandals, the old political class has disappeared. After the  Left won the local elections in December and no opposition  formed, I felt compelled to intervene myself to fulfill  Italians' desire for a new political power. [passage omitted]    [Kadereit] But what do you, an entrepreneur, want to achieve  in politics?    [Berlusconi] We want to lead this country out of the state  of real socialism in which it is still ensconced....    [Kadereit] But here the Christian Democrats were in power?    [Berlusconi] We want the state to have less say in the  economy.    [Kadereit] You call the 45-point program of your Forza  Italia "absolutely liberalistic." What does that mean?    [Berlusconi] We believe in freedom, the individual, family,  tolerance, and, of course, in competition and free market  economy, that is, the values of the large European democracies.    [Kadereit] But in southern Italy you have concluded an  election alliance with the extreme right...    [Berlusconi] The political and economic program of Alleanza  Nazionale is absolutely liberal. I take any bet on that.    [Kadereit] How compatible is a liberal program with the  great concentration of power in your hand -- industry, media,  now also political power? In other countries your appearance  has certainly given rise to some concern.    [Berlusconi] Other countries have a completely distorted  picture of Forza Italia and of me. The majority of Italian  correspondents abroad are part of a group that is fighting under  the flag of the communists.    You see, the idea that I would use my media for my own  purposes as a politician is completely wrong. Without having  any law tell me to do so, I have resigned from all functions  within my Fininvest group. I am only the president of my soccer  club AC Milan.    [Kadereit] But your are still the sole owner of Fininvest.    [Berlusconi] I tell you one thing: If I become prime  minister I will, of course, keep far away from all decisions  that might directly or indirectly affect my industrial group.  And all Italians will have the opportunity to examine my  behavior.    [Kadereit] This sounds as if you expected to get the highest  government office?    [Berlusconi] The latest polls show that I predicted  correctly that there is a desire for change. Forza Italia keeps  rising in the polls. Italians believe in an entrepreneur like  myself, who has worked in many sectors and founded companies  everywhere, which became number one. According to the polls, I  am by far the most appreciated politician. Asked "Do you trust  Silvio Berlusconi?" 61.3 percent of the Italians say yes.  [passage omitted]</p>

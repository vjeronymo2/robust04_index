			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Coalition failure in Tokyo may hurt summit Japan's seven-party coalition failed to agree a compromise on how to fund tax cuts to stimulate the economy yesterday, undermining prospects for a successful outcome to the US-Japan summit at the end of this week. Exhausted coalition members in Tokyo agreed to resume talks on economic measures this morning after four rounds of discussion brought them little closer on prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's plan for an immediate Y6,000bn (Pounds 36bn) a year tax cut, to be funded by a controversial new 7 per cent tax on goods and services from 1997. Mr Hosokawa is under pressure from the US to show hard evidence of Japan's plans to cut its fast growing current account surplus when he meets US President Bill Clinton in Washington on Friday. The surplus rose by 11.7 per cent from Dollars 117.55bn in 1992 to a record Dollars 131.35bn last year, the Finance Ministry said. Mr Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic party, called on Mr Hosokawa to live up to his tax-cutting promise or hand over power. The government 'cannot take a sweeping political decision without the co-operation of the LDP', Mr Kono said, 'but we are reluctant to extend support since the government is so indecisive.' The powerful Finance Ministry is equally keen for a decision before Mr Hosokawa leaves for the US, not least because it wants to avoid the risk that he will unilaterally offer Mr Clinton an unfunded income tax cut, said Mr Minoru Morita, a political commentator in Tokyo. Mr Hosokawa asked the ministry yesterday to help prepare a compromise. The proposed tax cuts are the centrepiece of a record Y15,100bn economic stimulus, shelved since last week when Mr Hosokawa's announcement of a so-called 'welfare tax' caused rebellion in coalition ranks. The Finance Ministry supports Mr Hosokawa's insistence that any tax cut must be combined with a plan to fund the loss of revenue, preferably not through a permanent rise in government borrowing. Yet the Social Democratic party, the coalition's largest partner, stuck to its demand for a tax cut now, to be followed by a two-year grace period in which to discuss funding. Figures announced yesterday show a reverse for the downward trend in the current account surplus. The surplus fell in dollar terms for three months running until November, when it reached Dollars 8.2bn for the month, only to rise to Dollars 12.6bn in December, up 9.3 per cent on December 1992. The trade surplus alone rose to Dollars 141.43bn for the whole of last year, from Dollars 132.6bn in 1992. In yen terms, however, the current account surplus fell by 2 per cent to Y14,610bn in 1993, the first drop for three years. The rise in December reflects increased demand for Japanese goods from the pick-up in the US economy and a decline in the net outflow of capital, said Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo. When the Japanese economy starts to follow the US recovery, Japan's surplus should start to contract again, he said. The gloomy outlook for a Japanese recovery was reinforced yesterday by the first year-on-year drop in lending recorded by Japan's biggest 11 commercial banks since their industry association started records 40 years ago. Their outstanding loans fell by 0.7 per cent to Y222,160bn in January, from the same month last year. The Keidanren, Japan's leading business federation, yesterday confirmed that its next chairman would be Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the car group Toyota. Mr Toyoda, 68, who has spent nearly all his life in the family car company, is a vigorous opponent of US demands for numerically-measured increases in market shares of imported goods. The car industry is one of the most sensitive parts of the present trade talks between the US and Japan. He will succeed the current chairman, Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, 79, at the Keidanren's annual general meeting in late May.</p>

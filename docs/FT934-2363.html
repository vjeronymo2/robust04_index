			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Scandinavian tale of the red and the black - Swedish banks needed government help to change colour Bailing out Nordbanken and Gota Bank has cost the Swedish taxpayer a cool SKr81.6bn (Dollars 9.8bn) and the state has swallowed a further SKr110bn of their bad loans, but their merger, announced last week, was still presented as a success. Two factors explain the paradox. First, the merger should mark the end of a series of emergency operations mounted over the past year to keep Sweden's banking system afloat. Second, there is general relief that the banking crisis proved neither as expensive nor as prolonged as feared only a few months ago. 'I think we have managed the crisis in the financial system rather well,' said Mrs Anne Wibble, the tough finance minister not usually given to bouts of public self-congratulation. 'It could really have been a disaster, but the problems now seem to be becoming a thing of the past - touch wood.' The marriage of Nordbanken and Gota Bank, which will be preceded by the state's recapitalisation of Gota, is the last in a string of rescue acts performed by the government since a spate of loan losses plunged Sweden's banks into crisis last autumn. The two, which together will have a leading 24 per cent of Sweden's lending and deposit market, were the hardest hit. Both had to be wholly taken over the by the state. In both cases, direct aid injections were not enough to keep them in business. The Bank Support Authority (BSA), established to manage the bank crisis, set up so-called 'bad banks' to group the bulk of their bad loans. These will stay in state hands and could take as long as 15 years to unwind. Bad loans worth SKr67bn were lifted out of Nordbanken into a new company called Securum - which required SKr35bn in state capital. A similar operation at Gota Bank will create Retriva, holding Gota loans worth SKr43bn and needing SKr7.3bn in capital. In the meantime, the BSA has forked out SKr8bn to Swedbank and SKr2.5bn to Foreningsbank, bringing to SKr92.1bn the total amount of state aid committed to the banking system. Some SKr60bn of this has a direct impact on the state budget, exacerbating a deficit which this year runs to more than 13 per cent of GNP. But the government's feeling of relief is understandable when what might have been is taken into account. In May, when the BSA was officially inaugurated, the banking system was still in distress. An application for state aid was still outstanding from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the leading commercial bank and a flagship of the Wallenberg family empire, which feared it would fall below the 8 per cent international capital adequacy standard. Both Swedbank and Foreningsbank were also negotiating for further substantial assistance. But they have all since withdrawn their applications, as the 25 per cent fall in the value of the Swedish krona and tumbling interest rates transformed their earning power over the summer. Instead, S-E Banken, Swedbank and Svenska Handelsbanken have raised SKr16bn between them to rebuild their capital bases, mainly from share issues launched in a fast-rising stock market. Moreover, the government anticipates the final net cost of its bank rescue operation may not be much more than SKr50bn, once it recoups the yet-to-be determined price Nordbanken will pay for Gota Bank, the proceeds of the planned privatisation of the merged bank and the sale of assets held by Securum and Retriva. The latter hold extensive property claims in Europe and beyond, making the Swedish state one of Europe's leading real estate owners. There is a lingering question over the Nordbanken-Gota merger. Instead of using the bank crisis to engineer greater competition in the bank sector - and bring in foreign participation, as Mrs Wibble earlier advocated - the two worst-performing banks have had their balance sheets thoroughly laundered by the state and been set up in a powerful market position. Nordbanken is already back in profit and Gota is set to follow. Criticism from rival banks has been muted, however. One Stockholm analyst said there was wide acceptance that no one would have benefited from the collapse of Nordbanken or Gota Bank, which could have triggered a general loss of confidence in an already weakened banking system. Given a continued downward trend in interest rates and the prospect of a modest recovery in the economy next year, the banks appear set to leave the dramas of the past year behind them. All should show a profit in 1994 - a far cry from the red ink in 1992, when losses in the system amounted to SKr50bn. But there is little room for complacency. BSA officials estimate the banks are still carrying problem loans worth as much as SKr100bn, leaving them perilously exposed to any unexpected upturn in interest rates. The government says it is keeping in place a blanket guarantee to honour bank commitments issued at the beginning of the crisis - just in case of more trouble.</p>

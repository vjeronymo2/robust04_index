			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD disagrees with these comments. Both the 1988 and 1994 proposed rules provide that an individual who has received a letter denying or terminating assistance may request an informal hearing at which he or she can meet with any person designated by the owner *&blank;*&blank;* other than a person who made or approved the decision under review, or other than a person who is a subordinate of the person who made or approved the decision under review. HUD believes that this language comports with due process requirements for impartiality and, as a result, the provision remains unchanged in the 1994 proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter suggested that the rule provide for hearing officers to be bilingual, or to provide the applicant or tenant with interpreters when circumstances require.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1994 proposed rule does not require hearing officers to be bilingual. With respect to interpreters, the 1994 proposed rule provides that an applicant or tenant is entitled to have an interpreter present at the denial or termination hearing, at his or her own expense, or at the owner's expense, as may be agreed upon by the parties. The owner may already have in his employ a person who speaks the language of the applicant or tenant, and is willing to have this person serve as an interpreter. Alternatively, the applicant or tenant may prefer to select their own interpreter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Record of Hearing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters claimed that it was essential to the fair hearing procedure that the responsible entity maintain a record of the hearing for judicial review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The informal hearing process does not require that a record be generated and maintained, and HUD declines to impose such requirement in this rule. The 1994 proposed rule provides for the responsible entity to allow an audiotape of the hearing, but no transcript is required to be made that would meet court standards and facilitate judicial review. In addition, and in accordance with HUD practice in the administration of many of its programs, the 1994 proposed rule requires that documents used by the responsible entity in processing an application or verification of eligibility of a tenant be maintained for a period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Notices <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters requested that the notice of denial or termination of assistance include a brief statement of the reasons for the denial or termination, and an explanation of any documents found to be missing or inadequate. In addition, four commenters asked that the rule be revised to require the responsible entity to inform applicants and tenants not only of the right to obtain a hearing, but also of the procedures for initiating the hearing and the INS appeal. HUD agrees with both of these suggestions and has adopted these changes in the 1994 proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters asked that all notices issued under the rule to applicants and tenants be required to be bilingual or multilingual, as necessary. As discussed in section VI.A.12 of this preamble, the 1994 proposed rule imposes a duty on the responsible entity to provide, where feasible, documents or notices in a language that is understood by the applicant or tenant if the applicant or tenant is not proficient in English.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> K. Removal of Resumption of Assistance and Retention of Assistance Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four commenters claimed that HUD's position on the resumption of assistance to tenants after required evidence is submitted is unduly harsh. The commenters referred to the preamble of the 1988 proposed rule, in which HUD stated that after financial assistance for a tenant is terminated, assistance would not resume unless all of the required evidence was submitted by the tenant to the owner, ``*&blank;*&blank;* and resumption of assistance is authorized in accordance with HUD requirements.'' (HUD indicated in the 1988 proposed rule that these requirements would be described in greater detail in program handbooks.) The commenters maintained that assistance should always be restored to an eligible family when necessary to prevent homelessness, or when a delay in the submission of documentation is caused by circumstances beyond the control of the tenant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that resuming assistance to a family after assistance has been terminated can be programmatically burdensome, since HA units are typically fully leased and there are waiting lists. This commenter urged HUD to provide HAs, in advance of the implementation of the final rule, with the handbook requirements on the resumption of assistance so that necessary procedures can be developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter objected to HUD's statement in the preamble of the rule that program handbooks would contain the requirements governing resumption of assistance. The commenter claimed that these requirements should be published in the final rule and not in a program handbook.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On further consideration of this issue, HUD has determined that once assistance to a tenant has been terminated for ineligible immigration status, the tenant should be treated the same as if the assistance were terminated for any other reason. No special procedure needs to be developed for purposes of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, the 1988 regulatory provision concerning ``Retention of Financial Assistance'' has been removed. This provision prohibited a responsible entity from receiving or retaining financial assistance paid for the benefit of a tenant admitted for participation in a program when required evidence of eligible status has not been submitted or verified by the INS in accordance with the regulations. This prohibition applies whether a responsible entity admitted a person who has ineligible immigration status, or who is ineligible on some other basis (e.g., the person's income makes them ineligible for assistance).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

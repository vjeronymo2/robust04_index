			<p>BFN     [Text] Wellington, April 12 (AFP) -- New Zealand appears to  have engaged in some form of spying on India, a cryptic entry in  a the diary of an army officer lost here reveals, the EVENING  POST reported here Tuesday.    The bulky, black-leather Filofax, owned by Major Scott  Turner  who is assistant director of electronic warfare in the Ministry  of Defence, was leaked to various media outlets after it was  found in long grass last week.    The POST said the man who found the Filofax, identified only  as Mike, had decided to release the diary after he saw what it  contained.    "This is public information. It is important this be  released because we spend millions of dollars on the  organisation this guy works for and it suggests we spy on people  we consider our allies like India," "Mike" said. One Filofax  entry, under the heading RNZN (apparently a reference to the  Royal New Zealand Navy), says: "Indian photos [word indistinct]  DSD get them." The POST suggested that this entry disclosed  some espionage operation against India. It interpreted DSD to  mean the Australian Defence Signals Directorate.    The Filofax includes a diary, work plans for 1994, duties'  lists, notes of meetings with others in the New Zealand  intelligence community, four used train tickets, two business  cards and details of the officer's recent purchase of a house.    Contents of the Filofax show Turner was coordinating with  the  secret Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), which  runs two large electronic listening bases linked into Australia,  Britain and the US.    There are also references such as "Tropic Twilight -- Cook  Islands Aug-Sep, Intercept range upgrade 2MHz - GHz" as well as  some action regarding tensions between Papua New Guinea [PNG]  and the Solomons over Bougainville, a PNG province affected by  civil war.    Defence spokesman John Seward said Tuesday the owner was  getting legal advice "and will seek police assistance to get it  back".    Seward said electronic warfare was not spying and the  Filofax  was "not in itself a classified document.    "Electronic warfare is a long-established legitimate and  widely known part of military operations."    Seward said the Filofax was the personal diary of a staff  officer although he said he believed it was unusual for a staff  officer to record classified acronyms in a personal book.</p>

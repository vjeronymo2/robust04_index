			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Slim gains for Dow as Appleeffect remains Wall Street EQUITIES posted slim gains on Wall Street yesterday in spite of the shock waves which continued to reverberate in the technology sector following Apple Computer's disappointing results released last week, writes Karen Zagor in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.99 at 3,535.28. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended a slight 0.28 firmer at 446.03, but the American SE composite slipped 2.99 to 433.48 and the Nasdaq composite lost 3.90 to 695.83. Volume on the New York SE was a moderate 216m shares and declines outnumbered rises by 1,056 to 854. On Friday the Dow fell 22.64 to 3,528.29. Apple Computer declined Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 25 5/8 as investors continued to register their disappointment with the company's third-quarter performance. The stock dropped Dollars 7 3/4 on Friday. Among other Nasdaq technology issues, Adobe Systems shed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 52, Cisco Systems slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 49 1/2 and Microsoft lost Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 78 3/4 . On the big board, International Business Machines fell Dollars 2 to a 52-week low of Dollars 43 5/8 , Digital Equipment lost Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 37 5/8 and Hewlett Packard dipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 73 3/4 , but Compaq held steady at Dollars 43 5/8 . Oil shares moved higher in tandem with oil futures, after Opec announced an extraordinary meeting for July. Mobil gained Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 70 1/4 , Chevron improved Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 83 5/8 and Texaco rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 . Pharmaceutical issues dominated NYSE trading, with Merck, the world's biggest drugs company, falling Dollars 1 to a 52-week low of Dollars 32 1/8 . Wellcome's ADRs closed unchanged at Dollars 9 1/8 in heavy trading, Glaxo Holdings' ADRs lost Dollars  1/4 to a year's low of Dollars 15 5/8 , but Schering-Plough put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 64 7/8 . In morning trading the sector was hit by reports that some analysts believe that the industry has not responded sufficiently to protect earnings from generic competition for own name-brand drugs, and from pressure in the private sector to contain costs. The banks sector, however, was lifted by strong earnings from Chase Manhattan, which added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 32 3/4 . Citicorp moved forward Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 32 and Bank of New York firmed Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 57. Transportation stocks benefited from news that employees at United Airlines have proposed taking a stake in the company in exchange for making substantial labour concessions. The Dow Jones Transportation Average was 3.21 higher at 1,551.13. UAL, parent of United Airlines, fell Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 133, AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 61, USAir held steady at Dollars 14 7/8 and Delta Air Lines gained Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 48 1/2 . Canada TORONTO finished a shaky session sharply weaker but off the day's low as oil and gas issues began to pull out of their steep retreat. A trader said stocks are beginning to look attractive at these levels, especially some of the energy shares. The TSE 300 index lost 34.0 at 3,867.7. Declining issues outpaced advances by 463 to 237 and volume was 48.2m shares. Twelve of the 14 sub-indices lost ground. Transportation fell 2.2 per cent, the communications group receded 2 per cent and the energy sub-index was a net 1.8 per cent lower.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / FT Ski Expedition: Caught on the hop Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker have reached the Australasian stage of their round-the-world expedition, on which they are trying to ski every day of 1994. In the Australian Alps, where the pied currawong gargles and warbles and crimson rosellas dart through the snow-gums, they worry a lot about your welfare. 'If you drink and then drive, you are an idiot,' is a common road sign. So is 'buckle up in the Bush' and 'Drive to Survive'. My main survival problem is driving on the left. After eight months and 23,000 miles of driving on the right, I am finding it difficult to adjust back and we have already had one near-miss. In Mount Buller we were urged not to forget the 'slip slap slop' (suncream). It is unseasonably warm and the snow is suffering. Appropriately in the land of the kangaroo, what is required for the kind of snow conditions we have here in Mount Hotham (slushy moguls) is 'the hop'. 'There is absolutely no doubt about it,' said Norman Wilson, one-time designer of Formula One engines, 'you have just got to get the tails of your skis out of the snow'. He went on: 'We were taught the hop by Peter Zirknitzer, one of the first ski instructors in the resort in the early 1960s.' Wilson and his wife Liz put this technique to good use on a recent visit to Stuben, Austria. 'There were some excellent German skiers in our class,' he says. 'Liz and I were content to bring up the rear on the first day. Then next day the sun had got at the snow and we were skiing in the kind of slush you sometimes get in the Victoria Alps at the end of the season. This time, Liz and I were right behind the instructor and the rest were falling like ninepins.' Zirknitzer - a boyish-looking 61 who can still ski the pants off most of the locals - runs Zirky's, one of Mount Hotham's ski lodges that combines accommodation with a restaurant and ski hire. Peter Malkin, probably the most laid-back man in town, if not Australia, runs another, called Jack Frost, where we have been staying. In his spare time he runs a gold mine. Zirknitzer is one of many Europeans in the mountains of Victoria and New South Wales. At Mount Buller, we skied with Paul Romagna, the newly appointed director of St Anton's Bundessportheim ski school for Austrian ski instructors at St Christoph. He is about to complete 21 double winters as ski school director in Mount Buller and Schruns. Why does he keep coming back to Victoria? 'It's the scenery,' he said. 'At the end of a day's skiing I like to gaze across the mountains as the sun sets. The different ranges change colour from green to grey to blue. Even though I have a wonderful view of the Montafon Valley back home, this is superb - and very different from Austria.' I notice that Romagna skis sublimely, but with his legs bolted together. Surely this style is very passe. He replies: 'It is not a question of skiing with either legs together or apart. One is functional, the other aesthetic. 'When you are being watched and want to look good, you should ski with your legs together, although it has to be said your balance is more fragile. When you are skiing faster, then you gradually adopt a more functional stance with your legs a little further apart.' Our last Victorian ski area was Falls Creek. Some still sneer at the idea of skiing in Australia, but Falls Creek, like Mount Buller and Mount Hotham, has a vertical drop of 1,181ft, considerably more than most resorts east of the Mississippi, and 22 lifts. Australia's top six resorts - Thredbo, Perisher Valley, Buller, Hotham, Falls Creek and Blue Cow - have more than 100 lifts between them and an average vertical drop of 1,430ft.</p>

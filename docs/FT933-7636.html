			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Technology: New focus for camera maker - Leica's latest and unlikely product, a sophisticated pair of binoculars, is selling fast For the price of a small second-hand car or a luxury cruise, Leica Camera can sell you a pair of binoculars which contains such an array of electronic and other advanced technology that it can work out distance and direction as well as display a sharp image. The German camera and optical company has deliberately made its new product  -called the Geovid - as simple to use as possible. Apart from a small wheel to adjust the eyepieces, there are only two controls: one button to read the distance, another for the built-in compass. 'We wanted to keep the electronics in the background,' says Thorsten Kortemeier, product manager for binoculars. 'We don't want to sell mainly to technology freaks. We want to stress the uses.' Despite its DM6,500 (Pounds 2,576) retail price (UK cost is about Pounds 3,000), this year's production run is already sold out to yacht crews, balloonists, mountaineers, foresters, hunters, surveyors, rescue services and other specialised interest groups. For a renowned camera maker such as Leica, the Geovid is an unusual departure. Not only does it draw on technology from other parts of the Leica group, owned by Swiss industrialist Stephan Schmidheiny, it is made in Switzerland by the sensor division, rather than at Leica's headquarters north of Frankfurt near Wetzlar. The camera side, however, provided the technology for the sophisticated lenses, which have wide prisms - porro prisms - for better light transmission, even in fading twilight. 'We want to become stronger in sporting optics (binoculars),' says Werner Simon, chief executive of Leica. 'The Geovid is part of that strategy.' The new binoculars use infra-red laser beams to measure distance, with a microcomputer making calculations to the nearest metre up to 1,000m or more. A digital magnetic compass works out the angle of direction, even when the binoculars are tilted. The user simply presses one of the two buttons twice, once to fix a red aiming light on the target and again to display the measurement. Yet however successful the Geovid proves to be, binocular sales will continue to be dwarfed by sales of the company's classic and robust cameras and lenses, projectors and enlargers, together accounting for 80 per cent of business. Last year, Leica Camera's turnover rose by 3 per cent to DM214m. The company's reputation is based on its camera work, with advances in lens, mechanical and electronic technology matched by a typically German dedication to continuity. Thus when Henri Cartier-Bresson, the French photographer, was presented with a new Leica camera on his 75th birthday in 1983, he declined the offer of a new lens, says Simon. 'He took out the lens he had owned since 1954, fitted it into the 1983 Leica with a neat plop, and said 'Voila, ca c'est Leica'.' There are other intriguing Leica anecdotes. A few years ago, perched precariously on a Nepalese rockface to take pictures of wild honey gatherers, Eric Valli, a French photographer, dropped his Leica lens. When he found it, the lens was still usable in spite of a fall of 80 metres, with no optical damage and only a slight centring error. Leica's reputation is bolstered by such tales. But, as Simon stresses, it takes more than stories to protect the company's position as a producer of quality, consumer products. Leica's spending of a high 4 per cent of turnover on research and development underlines this point. 'We're not in our niche because of 'the myth of the past',' Simon adds. 'A myth lasts perhaps five years, but quality has to be achieved anew each day.' The first Leica camera was shown in 1925 at the Leipzig trade fair, although Oskar Barnack, its inventor, made the prototype before the first world war. The camera was made by the Leitz microscope company, the word Leica deriving from Leitz camera. Since then, Leica has developed a unique position as a maker of products which meet the most demanding standards and are priced accordingly. Along the way, the company has had to cope with the almost total dominance of Japanese companies in the photographic sector. Its main German rivals such as Rollei, Zeiss Ikon, Voigtlander and Agfa have either left the camera scene or occupy much smaller segments. In common with Hasselblad of Sweden, which makes medium format cameras - totally different from Leica's 35mm products - the German company occupies its own corner in the world camera market. Leica's speciality is the M6 rangefinder camera - a descendant of Barnack's original camera - which combines high-speed lenses with highly accurate focusing and an almost noiseless shutter release. In the single lens reflex market, where Japanese companies such as Nikon, Minolta, Canon, Pentax, and Olympus predominate, Leica has developed its R-series, the latest R7 automatic version costing DM3,900 (Pounds 1,795 in the UK); lenses are extra, from DM1,180 to DM32,000. Simon says Leica has weathered the worldwide recession well, but admits it can no longer raise prices as it would like. Its move five years ago to a new building in Solms, near Wetzlar, has helped it hold down production costs. It also offsets some of the high expense of doing business in Germany by carrying out pre-assembly and other work, such as small binocular manufacture, at its plant in Portugal. Leica's main lens work is kept in-house. It has spent DM1.2m on a computer-controlled lens manufacturing line in Solms, cutting the time taken to grind, polish, coat and mount its complex lenses from 12 to three weeks and lifting productivity by 20 per cent. Final camera assembly takes 26 hours; the rangefinder alone for the M6 camera has 104 parts. Thus, says Burkard Kiesel, vice-president for development and operations, further efficiency gains will be elusive, even with the most advanced design and production software. 'It's hard to see what further savings we can make without losing any features on our products,' says Kiesel. Leica's profitability will depend on customers' continuing willingness to pay heavily for top quality products. The innovatory Geovid will be the latest test of the company's high-priced appeal.</p>

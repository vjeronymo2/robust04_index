			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / International Company News: IBM sets up committee of non-executive directors INTERNATIONAL Business Machines has set up a committee of non-executive directors with responsibility for corporate governance issues, such as the appointment and powers of directors, writes Richard Waters in New York. The move was seen as a further attempt by Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman, to ease shareholder concerns over the composition of the struggling computer group's board. Mr Gerstner indicated at the time of his appointment in April that the make-up of the board would be reviewed to ensure it was 'relevant, appropriate and evolving'. The committee is chaired by Mr James Burke, a former chairman of Johnson &amp; Johnson and head of the committee of non-executive directors which picked Mr Gerstner to head IBM earlier this year. Mr Burke, an IBM director since 1980, is joined in the committee by other long-standing IBM directors, including Mr John Opal, a former chairman. Mr Charles Knight, chairman of Emerson Electric, who was appointed a director last Tuesday, is the only member of the five-man committee not involved with the pre-Gerstner regime at IBM. The board will be responsible for nominating directors for appointment and 'all other issues of corporate governance', IBM said.</p>

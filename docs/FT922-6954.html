			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Currie has 65% of Pacific MARTIN Currie Pacific Trust said that it has received more than 65 per cent acceptances for its offer for Pacific Horizon Investment Trust, which is managed by Jupiter Tyndall. Valid acceptances have been received for 65.79 per cent of the ordinary shares and 44.55 per cent of the warrants. A further 4.92 per cent of ordinary shareholders and 6.46 per cent of warrant holders have sent in acceptances, which are in the process of being validated. The offer has been extended until June 2. Jupiter Tyndall has been battling to block the takeover and has assembled a 25.1 per cent stake in the trust's warrants. Last week, it voted down a resolution which required a 75 per cent majority of warrant holders. As a result, Martin Currie dropped an improved offer for the ordinary shares of Pacific Horizon. Jupiter has said that it will put forward its own propo-sals to enhance shareholder value and enable share and warrant holders to receive cash for all or part of their holdings. Jupiter has a 15.4 per cent stake in the ordinary shares and has said that it will not accept the offer, thus preventing Martin Currie from passing the 90 per cent mark at which it could compulsorily acquire the outstanding shares. In these circumstances Jupiter says that the rights of the warrant holders will have to be substantially enhanced; Martin Currie Pacific says it has received legal advice that this is not the case.</p>

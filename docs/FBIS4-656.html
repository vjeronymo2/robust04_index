			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the bloody violence that claimed more than  20,000 people in Kigali, including the prime minister, Madame  Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and some of her cabinet ministers, some  forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] have moved to Kigali  in order to stop the massacre and establish law and order in the  capital of Rwanda.    Latest reports from Kigali say that the Rwandan Patriotic  Army [RPA] have captured some positions of strategic importance  in Kigali. Fighting has also been going on between the RPA and  the government forces in the northern part of Rwanda. The RPA  has liberated Mutara zone completely. The government forces are  now fleeing in disarray. In Byumba, the town is besieged by the  RPA, ready to flush out the government forces but the operation  has been halted by a request from the UNAMIR [UN Assistance  Mission in Rwanda], who requested the RPA to hold fire so that  the UNAMIR can evacuate its forces that are in Byumba.    The current offensive by the RPA in Kigali is primarily  intended to reinforce the RPA forces in Kigali who have been  under attack by the presidential guard. A representative of the  UNAMIR has confirmed that the RPA forces from the north have now  linked with the RPA battalion in Kigali and there is no sign of  resistance from the Rwandan Government forces.</p>

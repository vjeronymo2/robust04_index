			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / US economy continues to expand All regions of the US are continuing to expand, and higher prices are starting to work their way into the economy, the Federal Reserve said in its 'beige book' survey of economic conditions, writes George Graham in Washington. The beige book, which is released two weeks before each meeting of the Federal Open Markets Committee, which sets Fed interest rate policy, said consumer spending remained strong and labour markets are tight or tightening in most of the country's 12 Federal Reserve districts, though only in specific sectors. The latest report was prepared by the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank and will be used at the November 15 FOMC meeting, at which the Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by at least half a percentage point. The Fed said there was little rise in retail prices, but 'pressure is building in some districts.' The Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators, however, was flat in September, despite a sharp rise in building activity that had been expected to drive the index higher. The department said yesterday the index was unchanged at 102.2 in September, after rising 0.5 in August, with weaker orders for consumer goods helping to offset the jump in building permits announced last month. Separately, the Commerce Department said that new orders for manufactured goods decreased by 0.2 per cent in September. While orders for durable goods increased by 0.4 per cent, non-durable orders dropped by 0.8 per cent, their first decline for almost a year. Shipments of manufactured goods fell by 0.6 per cent in September, after rising 4.6 per cent in August: inventories dropped 0.2 per cent. The index of leading economic indicators is compiled from eleven statistics and is intended to signal turning points in the economic cycle six to nine months before they occur. The Commerce Department said six of the eleven components pushed the index higher in September, while four pushed it lower, with one unchanged.</p>

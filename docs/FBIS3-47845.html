			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- Russia signed a contract  to sell North Korea 10 Golf II class submarines not long after  it exported four Fox-Trot class submarines to the communist  country, a senior official of the Russian Pacific Fleet Command  is quoted as saying in a report by the TOKYO SHIMBUN.    North Korea made the deal at its consulate in Nakhodka with  a  company that sells submarines it has salvaged from the sea,  according to the dispatch from Russian fleet headquarters in  Vladivostok.    Although the company has a permit to export submarines under  the Pacific Fleet's arms reduction plan, it needs formal  approval from the central government to sell intact submarines.    In an abnormal procedure, the submarines are likely to be  towed by Russian warships to North Korea to escape inspection by  customs officers, the vernacular Japanese paper said.    Once the submarines leave Russian waters, they will be  handed  over to North Korean ships for the rest of their journey to  Chongjin, the daily said.    The Golf II submarines are similiar to the Fox-Trot types in  size, but excel them in speed and cruising range and can carry  three SS-N-5 ballistic missiles.    They were sold for 130 U.S. dollars a ton, with the total  2,126 tons selling at 276,000 dollars. They were initially for  sale to a Japanese company, but went to North Korea after the  first contract was called off, the TOKYO SHIMBUN said.    The Russian Navy officially confirmed earlier the sale of  four Fox-Trot submarines to North Korea, which have reportedly  been delivered through a Japanese trader. It added that the  sales were under condition that North Korea use the vessels for  scrap.</p>

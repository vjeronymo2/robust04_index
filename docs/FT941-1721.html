			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Debt trading reform rejected in Bank U-turn The Bank of England yesterday 'firmly rejected' its own controversial suggestion that lenders be prohibited from trading the debt of companies while a financial restructuring is taking place. The Bank, after discussions with British bankers, has decided that even a formal code of practice governing sales of distressed company debt is unwise.

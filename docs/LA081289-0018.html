			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY'S FIGHT FOR POLITICAL SURVIVAL  </P> <P> Regarding the article on Bradley's financial investments -- I think his  personal business affairs are of no concern to the public. The article was mean  and uncalled for. Bradley has made mistakes (who hasn't?), but he has done a  good job for Los Angeles. He has many friends and supporters even if we do not  make a lot of noise.  </P> <P> HELEN R. SMITH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

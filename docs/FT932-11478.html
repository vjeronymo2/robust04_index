			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Observer: Schmidt to do his bit Helmut Schmidt, the former West German chancellor, has been growing ever crosser about what he sees as the shortcomings of his successor Helmut Kohl in steering a unified Germany towards a healthy future. Not content with doling out schoolmasterly advice in his recent book Handeln fur Deutschland (Action for Germany), the crusty 74-year-old is putting his money where his mouth is. Banking on a bumper first print-run of 200,000 copies, he plans to sink the ensuing DM1m (Pounds 400,000) profit into a charitable foundation, based in Weimar. He is also well on the way to persuading five other likely dignitaries from the world of business and finance to dig into their pockets to the tune of DM1m each to help get the foundation going. The loot will be devoted principally to that great German pastime, organising talking-shops to dissect the country's ever-complicated future. One of Schmidt's main worries is that ordinary Germans do not yet feel a common bond of 'Germanness'. He says he wants people from Dresden to feel at home in Aachen. Since he thinks that happy state may be about 40 years off, the Schmidt foundation should be assured of a healthy life long after its founder passes on.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Digital doubts So much is said about digital television that the creation of a new channel is practically warranted just to carry the verbiage. Yet there are reasons to be sceptical. Politicians have been particularly guilty of talking up the prospects. But in their desire to predict the future of one of the world's fastest-changing industries from a single piece of technology, they are overlooking, not for the first time, that the technology is still in search of a market. The debate is heating up because the technology to compress a television signal digitally has only just begun to work. In increasing greatly the amount of information which can be delivered, it enables television operators either to send out 10 times as many channels or to improve the quality of the picture, through high-definition or wide-screen pictures, for example. But there are snags: most importantly, the need for expensive new equipment at some points along the line between the studio and the viewer's home. Such additional costs are likely to be highest for digital terrestrial television, which would need new equipment at almost every stage along that line: studios, transmitters and, most problematically, further black boxes on top of viewers' sets. One slice of those costs - the need for new transmitters - would be removed if the signal were distributed by satellite direct to viewers' homes. The costs would be lowest if the signal were sent by satellite to cable television systems for onward distribution: cable operators would need new reception equipment, but not viewers. Of those three options, the two which depend on satellite distribution are worth taking seriously at present. Yesterday Canal Plus, the French pay-TV channel, said it planned to be the first in Europe to deliver digital satellite services to homes. It remains to be seen, however, whether demand for enhanced services will emerge - either for dozens more channels or for better quality pictures - and how much viewers will be prepared to pay for them. The option which is least worth taking seriously is the one the UK government has most enthusiastically embraced: digital terrestrial television. This summer, the government said that it would reserve for future digital services one of the two frequencies it had previously set aside for a fifth terrestrial television channel. The result is to reduce the proportion of the country which Channel 5 will cover from about 70 per cent to just over 52 per cent, although the range may yet be boosted if other frequencies become available. Yesterday the Independent Television Commission advertised the Channel 5 licence for a second time, although its coverage and commercial viability remain uncertain. What is clear, however, is that the full potential of a new service which could be immediately available to viewers has been jeopardised for a technology which may remain unwanted.</p>

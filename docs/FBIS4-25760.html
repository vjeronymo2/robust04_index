			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 10 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. State  Department said today it has ordered the departure of U.S.  Embassy dependents and some Embassy employees from Haiti and  urged all private U.S. citizens in Haiti to leave as soon as  possible.    "We are advising Americans not engaged in essential  diplomatic or humanitarian work and to depart Haiti as early as  possible," Department Spokeswoman Christine Shelly told  reporters at a regular news briefing.    "The political situation in Haiti remains unstable with  potential throughout the country for random violence, sporadic  disturbances and criminal acts," she said.    Shelly also issued a new travel warning on Haiti, saying  that  "U.S. citizens are warned against travel to Haiti" because of  the suspension of the commercial air passenger service.    U.S. President Bill Clinton announced earlier today a ban on  commercial air traffic between the United States and Haiti,  which will take effect as of June 25 in order to allow those  Americans who wish to leave Haiti to do so.    "U.S. citizens should make arrangements to leave as early as  possible as airline seating may be limited," Shelly said.    She told reporters that about 120 Americans at the U.S.  Embassy would be departing and approximately 80 would remain to  provide services to American citizens, to continue refugee  processing and to report on the situation in Haiti.</p>

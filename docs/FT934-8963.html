			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Penna losses at Pounds 118,000 PENNA, the USM-quoted holding company for the Sanders &amp; Sidney outplacement consultancy, yesterday announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 118,000 for the half year to September 30 against profits of Pounds 1.03m. In September, when the company issued a statement warning of an interim loss, the shares fell by 35p to 130p. Yesterday they closed unchanged at 127p. Mr John Beard, chief executive, said the outplacement market was less active than last year and the group's focus had been to cut overheads and introduce new levels of service in response to the highly competitive environment and client requirements. He added that the directors would continue to review appropriate opportunities for expansion or diversification into related business sectors. Turnover fell to Pounds 3.89m (Pounds 5.42m). Losses per share came through at 2p (13.9p earnings) and the interim dividend is cut to 1p (3p).</p>

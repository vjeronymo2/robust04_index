			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / The Week Ahead: Results Due FYFFES, the Irish-based fruit and vegetable distributor, is heading for a modest increase in pre-tax profits tomorrow, having weathered recession in Europe and ERM currency upheavals during its year to end October 1992. Profits of IPounds 28.5m are expected against IPounds 27.1m last year, with the dividend likely to rise to 0.8939p (0.8126p) after the interim was upped to 0.3549p (0.3226p). Earnings per share, diluted by issues in 1992, are likely to fall to 5.7p from 6.73p. The group's expansion into continental Europe has come at a difficult time, given lower prices and the currency turmoil. Its year-end coincided with sterling's 15 per cent decline in value against the Irish currency, something of a blow because 50 per cent of its turnover is from UK operations. However, Fyffes will benefit longer-term from the new banana regime in the EC, which slapped a 2m tonne a year quota on Latin American banana exporters in December, with a 170 per cent tariff on exports above that level. Bullough, the office products and refrigeration group, is expected to produce results today in line with its December profit warning of a slump from Pounds 20.8m to Pounds 8.5m pre-tax profits in the year to October 31. Earnings per share are likely to be between 4.5p and 4.6p (11.55p). The dividend is to be held at 6.05p. The group has had to absorb Pounds 3.3m in redundancy costs However, profits this year could rise to Pounds 12m, confirming the group's position as a potential recovery stock. Northumbrian Fine Foods, the biscuit, confectionery and health food maker, has seen its profitability slide in spite recent expansion of its expansion in the past two years. Interim results on Wednesday will show whether the group has reaped the benefits of improving market conditions. The USM-quoted company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 155,000 (Pounds 264,000) on turnover of Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 7.89m) in the year to March 31 1992, but passed its final dividend after a 0.75p interim payout.</p>

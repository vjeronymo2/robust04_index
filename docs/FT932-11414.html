			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (2): 'LegCo' shows newfound assertiveness - Political scene, changing role for Hong Kong's Legislative Council IN the central business district on Hong Kong island, lying diagonally between the Hong Kong Club and Hongkong Bank - arguably two of the colony's most powerful institutions - is a fine example of late colonial architecture in the classical vein. Once the colony's High Court, today it is occupied by Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo), its law-making body, and an institution which is trying to match the power of its neighbours. For most of its near 150-year history, LegCo was a sleepy organ of British colonial power, the epitome of rule by bureaucrat and plutocrat. It was an institution where the government held sway both through its own 'official' members and by its ability to appoint Hong Kong's great and good to the assembly. The advent of elections in 1984, covering a restricted franchise known as 'functional constituencies,' began to change that. Arguably, however, the biggest changes to LegCo - and the ones with which the Hong Kong government, China and Britain, are still trying coming to terms - occurred in 1990 and 1991. In 1990, LegCo rejected and Anglo-Chinese agreement concerning the Court of Final Appeal - the court which, post-1997, is meant to be Hong Kong's highest appellate court. Then, in 1991, Britain and China allowed the people of Hong Kong to elect, through universal suffrage, 18 members to the 60-strong council. 'The Court of Final Appeal was something of a watershed,' said a British Foreign Office official. 'We found that we had a LegCo that was not grateful for all our efforts - which we believed had been considerable - but, on the contrary, thought that the agreement we struck with Beijing was poor, and asked why they had not been consulted.' The advent of democratic elections was no less significant. It brought, for the first time, a populism to Hong Kong politics which the colony had never seen before; it also brought social issues - housing, education, the environment, and the like - to the forefront of debate in the colony's community. What both developments have underlined is that, unlike before, LegCo cannot be taken for granted. Mr Hamish Mcleod, the colony's financial secretary, was strongly reminded of this a year ago when he nearly had his budget thrown back at him. This time around, Mr Mcleod consulted widely with individual members and groups in LegCo - throwing money at members' pet projects - and his budget was passed virtually without complaint. Since then, LegCo has humiliated the government over its mismanagement of the construction of a new science and technology university - its cost rose to HKDollars 3.4bn from an estimated HKDollars 1.9bn - and its, and the British government's, attitude to the nationality of non-Chinese Asians in the colony. Yet for all its newfound assertiveness, LegCo remains a curious institution. Its proceedings resemble more the decorous ways of the House of Lords rather than the rowdiness of the House of Commons. And, like the Lords it is essentially a chamber of review, not one which forms the government. To some this is a cause of some regret. Mr Andrew Wong, one of the 18 democratically-elected members of LegCo and an independent democrat, says that LegCo has been harmed by the growth of party and faction which has come in the wake of elections. 'The old role has continued, not to govern but to criticise and seek changes to policy,' he says. 'But with the formation of parties, when one group criticises something, they all do. We all are critics, with no governing power and that's the problem. What we need in LegCo is a governing party and an opposition.' Mr Wong readily concedes that this is not a realistic prospect. China, for one, would not permit it. Its aim, say local politicians, is a LegCo on the old British colonial model - one consisting of 'lackeys.' China has watched, with growing alarm, LegCo's flexing of muscles. In spite of the anti-British rhetoric which is published daily in the pro-communist media in Hong Kong, Beijing has no interest in seeing LegCo, a colonial institution par excellence, scoring victories over the executive branch of government. In last year's debate about Mr Mcleod's budget, it instructed its supporters in LegCo to abstain - thereby affording Mr Mcleod the majority he need to get his budget passed. China wants the executive branch to remain all powerful; its fear of pluralism, even in Hong Kong's tiny community of six million, is one of the reasons why it agreed to talk to Britain about Governor Chris Patten's proposals for more democracy in Hong Kong. At bottom, say government officials, what China wants is an election in 1995 the result of which is the fewest possible dissenting voices. China failed to get very many of its supporters into LegCo through the 1991 polls. It hopes that after talks with Britain it can so arrange the playing field that its supporters have less difficulty being elected in 1995. But Beijing is taking no chances. It has put up candidates for election to six seats on the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce's board. The Chamber's members return one councillor to LegCo, and China hopes that by winning control of the board that it can influence the outcome of the 1995 election for the Chamber's seat. Its current sitting member, Mr Jimmy McGregor, won in 1991 in one of the few contested elections for a 'functional constituencies.' His main supporters, he says, were small and medium-sized Chinese businesses. Mr McGregor believes there have been substantial positive changes to the work of LegCo since the introduction of elections - 'the examination of public policy is a lot more thorough than before,' he says. 'The balance between economic and social interests is much better now and that is because of the strong representation of Hong Kong people in LegCo.' These changes have also had an impact on the way companies deal with government and the legislature. With greater publicity given to councillors' views in the press, companies are making an effort to keep LegCo abreast of their business. 'Interest and pressure groups in Hong Kong have become easier to identify,' says an executive with a leading utility. 'LegCo members are beginning to specialise - and we want them to have a good understanding of our business because they will decide how we are regulated.' LegCo's frequent challenges to the government to provide more information about policy, and to be open to the legislature's advice during policy formulation, have won plaudits from the local community. Hong Kong may not have turned out in droves to participate in the 1991 elections, but there can be little doubt that it likes the result.</p>

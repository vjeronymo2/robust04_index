			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / People: Sotheby's - Lord Gowrie departs, Lord Camoys arrives After months of speculation about his future, Lord Gowrie, chairman of Sotheby's Europe, is to give up his post on January 1, but will remain on the board of Sotheby's Holdings and will continue to seek new business. Lord Gowrie has been chairman for seven years during which time the power base in the American-owned company has moved remorselessly from London to New York. A former cabinet minister and minister for the arts, Lord Gowrie leaves at a time when some important appointments in the arts and heritage world are about to be made, most notably chairman of the Arts Council and chief executive of the Millennium Fund. He is replaced by two men. Simon de Pury moves up from deputy chairman to chairman of Sotheby's Europe while Henry Wyndham, 40, comes in as chairman of Sotheby's UK. His is a surprise appointment. He spent most of his working life at arch rival Christie's where he was a paintings specialist, but since 1987 has been a partner in the Mayfair picture dealers, the St James's Group. Lord Gowrie was instrumental in appointing Wyndham, and another newcomer to Sotheby's, Lord Camoys (right), who arrives to take up the newly created post of deputy chairman of Sotheby's Holdings. For 32 years Lord Camoys, 53, has been a banker. He joins Sotheby's on April 1 next year from Barclays de Zoete Wedd; he is to leave the Barclays group and Barclays Bank boards and his executive role at BZW, but will remain non-executive deputy chairman of BZW. In a final move, Roger Faxon, who came over from the US as managing director to mastermind a cost-cutting re-organisation at Sotheby's Europe, returns to New York. He will be replaced by George Bailey, who was responsible for business development. Announcing the changes yesterday Diana Brooks, president and chief executive officer of Sotheby's, said that Europe, and especially the UK, was helping to lead the company out of the recession in the art market. In the first nine months of the year Sotheby's turnover in the UK was up by 34 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (2) The only groups permitted are those established in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Each manufacturer who chooses to enroll a fuel or fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive in a group of similar fuels and fuel additives as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated in this section may satisfy the registration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements through a group submission of jointly-sponsored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing and analysis conducted on a product which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative of all products in that group, provided that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group representative is chosen according to the specifications in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The health effects information submitted by a group shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered applicable to all fuels and fuel additives in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group. A fuel or fuel additive manufacturer who has chosen to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in a group may subsequently choose to perform testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of such fuel or fuel additive on an individual basis; however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until such independent registration information has been received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reviewed by EPA, the information initially submitted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group on behalf of the manufacturer's fuel or fuel additive shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be considered applicable and valid for that fuel or fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive. It could therefore be used to support requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further testing under the provisions of Tier 3 or to support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory decisions affecting that fuel or fuel additive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Manufacturers are responsible for determining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate groups for their products according to the criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this section and for enrolling their products into those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups under industry-sponsored or other independent brokering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Manufacturers who enroll a fuel or fuel additive into a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group shall share the applicable costs according to appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangements established by the group. The organization and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of group functions and the development of cost-sharing arrangements are the responsibility of the participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers. If manufacturers are unable to agree on fair and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equitable cost sharing arrangements and if such dispute is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referred by one or more manufacturers to EPA for resolution, then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provisions in &sect;79.56(c) (1) and (2) shall apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In complying with the registration requirements for a given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel or fuel additive, notwithstanding the enrollment of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel or additive in a group, a manufacturer may make use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available information for any product which conforms to the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grouping criteria as the given product. If, for this purpose, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer wishes to rely upon the information previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted by another manufacturer (or group of manufacturers) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration of a similar product (or group of products), then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the previous submitter is entitled to reimbursement by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer for an appropriate portion of the applicable costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred to obtain and report such information. Such entitlement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall remain in effect for a period of fifteen years following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date on which the original information was submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to &sect;79.59(b)(4)(ii), the manufacturer who relies on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously-submitted registration data shall certify to EPA that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the original submitter has been notified and that appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement arrangements have been made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) When private efforts have failed to resolve a dispute about a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fair amount or method of cost-sharing or reimbursement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing costs incurred under this subpart, then any party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved in that dispute may initiate a hearing by filing two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> signed copies of a request for a hearing with a regional office  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the American Arbitration Association and mailing a copy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request to EPA. A copy must also be sent to each person from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whom the filing party seeks reimbursement or who seeks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement from that party. The information and fees to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the request for hearing are specified in 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 791.20(b) and (c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Additional procedures and requirements governing the hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process are those specified in 40 CFR 791.22 through 791.50,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 791.60, 791.85, and 791.105, excluding 40 CFR 791.39(a)(3) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 791.48(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for Classification.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Rather than segregating fuels and fuel additives into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate groups, the grouping system applies the same grouping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria and creates a single set of groups applicable both to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuels and fuel additives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

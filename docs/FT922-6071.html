			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / London office glut worsens EMPTY OFFICE space in central London increased by 5 per cent in the first quarter of this year to stand at 34.2m sq ft - enough to fill London's Centre Point tower 190 times over. The proportion of empty offices in the capital now totals 18 per cent, according to Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, property advisers. That record availability figure is largely responsible for the severe decline in central London property values since 1990. Debenham Tewson believes that the rise in vacant property over the past two years is coming to an end. It said: 'Availability will fluctuate about its current level until the end of the year, when it will start to fall gradually.' The rise in availability was inclusion of large developments at Ludgate in the City and East India Dock in Docklands, which together contributed more than 800,000 sq ft of space. Recovery is being hampered by the low level of demand. The rate of take-up in the first quarter of this year was the same as last year, with about 2m sq ft of offices let. Media companies and government departments were the most important sources of demand. Debenham Tewson expects the low level of demand to continue because it believes office employment in central London will fall in the short term. It expects the amount of new offices becoming available to vary between 3m sq ft and 4m sq ft a quarter for the rest of the year. That is a sharp reduction from the levels of 1990 and last year, when the quarterly average was about 7m sq ft. Construction starts in the first quarter of this year were just less than 500,000 sq ft, one of the lowest quarterly levels since 1986. The report highlights the poor quality of much of the available space. It says that older, second-hand buildings in fringe locations may be converted for residential uses. 'Given the poor prognosis for central London office employment over the foreseeable future, there will be growing pressure to identify alternative uses for apparently unlettable offices,' the report adds.

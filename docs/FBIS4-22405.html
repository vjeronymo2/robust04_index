			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by the News Department: "Armenian Deserters Will Be </F> Discussed in Krasnodar"]    [Text] As was reported to a RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA  correspondent in the press center of the Republic of Armenia, an  Armenian delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Vigen  Chitechyan, returned to Yerevan from Krasnodar yesterday. The  purpose of the official visit was to settle trade-economic  relations and to resolve questions on the renewal of air  transportation from Krasnodar to Armenia, which was halted two  months ago after the crash of a cargo plane that was heading for  Gyumri. Besides other questions discussed by members of the  delegation with Nikolay Yegorov, the head of the local  administration, and Viktor Gladskiy, his deputy, problems were  also touched upon that are associated with the migration of  citizens of Armenia to Krasnodarskiy Kray. In the course of the  conversations with the leadership of the kray, the possibility  of the cooperation of law enforcement organs was discussed, and,  in particular, the question was broached on the return of  Armenian citizens located on the territory of Krasnodarskiy Kray  who were army draft evaders.    Three documents were signed as a result of the negotiations:  "Agreement on the Principles of Trade-Economic Cooperation for  1994," "Provisional Agreement on the Conveyance of Cargoes by  Air Transport," and an "Agreement on Cooperation in the  Cultural- Educational and Scientific Sphere, and in the Sphere  of Sports and Tourism."    The members of the Armenian delegation had a meeting with  representatives of the Armenian communities of Krasnodarskiy  Kray.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Power but no glory Did the electricity regulator get it right after all? Professor Stephen Littlechild drew strong criticism two months ago when he announced a set of price controls on regional electricity companies that sent share prices soaring to record levels. The view among politicians was that he had been too soft and even the City acknowledged he was less tough than he could have been. In the past six weeks or so, however, the shares have under-performed. In some cases, they have sunk to levels below where they were immediately before Littlechild's announcement. So, after three years of largely uninterrupted growth, has the bubble burst? The question will have particular concern for shareholders in Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric. When price controls were imposed on them last week, shares fell immediately as the market judged they had been given a tough time by the regulator. National Power and PowerGen, and Northern Ireland Electricity, have been feeling the breeze, too. Although not subjected to regulatory reviews recently, they have been hit by falls in the sector and the market. So what, then, are the prospects for electricity companies? In general, they remain at least reasonably good but there are some clouds around. The Labour party is perhaps the biggest threat. Although it seems to have ruled out re-nationalising the companies, it could impose a windfall tax on the profits of privatised utilities - a possibility confirmed this week by Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor. Although change is much less likely under the Tories, it cannot be ruled out. The government appears increasingly sensitive to criticism that the utilities, particularly electricity, are not policed tightly enough, and a cabinet committee is examining regulation. Politics apart, there is plenty of potential to keep shareholders smiling in the medium to long term, so reinforcing the arguments of Littlechild's critics. Some of the uncertainty surrounding most of the companies recently will lift in the next few months, particularly in the case of the regional electricity companies (RECs) in England and Wales. The main doubts for REC shareholders have centred on the National Grid, the transmission company which the companies plan to float next summer. The RECs are putting considerable effort into minimising the capital gains tax they will have to pay. The outcome of talks with the Inland Revenue could make a difference of up to Pounds 1bn in their bill, although most analysts believe the market has made allowance already for the worst scenario and that share values will grow when the details of flotation have been decided. Sorting out the National Grid will allow the companies to press ahead with other ways of improving share earnings. Most have started share buy-backs but completion will, in most cases, have to wait until after the results season, which starts next month and ends in mid-December. Analysts expect the results, from the first half of the year, to produce pleasant surprises. With Littlechild's review over, dividend growth is more likely to exceed expectations than disappoint them. Indeed, the City is expecting at least 6 to 8 per cent real growth a year from all RECs for the rest of the decade. For all of these reasons, analysts view the shares as good value. But there is less enthusiasm for the Scottish companies. Privatised later than the RECs, they have always been squeezed by tougher controls. Hopes that the regulator might ease these significantly in his review were dashed. The Scots have no National Grid to sell and no immediate plans to buy back shares. Most analysts think they have less scope to increase dividends, even if real growth is likely to be 5 per cent minimum a year. Even so, some analysts feel the Scottish shares have fallen too much since the review; they point out that both companies have potential to increase their unregulated earnings by exporting power to the rest of the UK. Nonetheless, the companies - Hydro, in particular - are struggling to overcome the feeling that their prospects are less exciting than those of the RECs. National Power and PowerGen are considered to have better basics although their shares have been unsettled recently. One reason was the uncertainty created by the government's sale next February of its remaining 40 per cent stakes in the companies. Another is the revival in the dash for gas by rivals: the more independent gas-fired stations that come on stream, the less room there is in the market for the two companies' older, coal-fired stations. A further problem is that they have agreed a deal with the electricity regulator under which they will try to sell off 6,000mw of capacity by the end of next year. Failure to do so could cause them to be referred to the Monopolies Commission, although that seems unlikely. But the two companies do have strong balance sheets and above-average dividend growth is expected of both: indeed, some analysts believe they can increase dividends by more than 15 per cent a year. Northern Ireland Electricity's image as sector star has been dented following the reviews involving the mainland companies. While these were under way, some investors bought NIE as a hedge against tough price controls in England, Scotland and Wales. Still, NIE continues to be regarded highly and, as it was privatised only last year, many of the rewards of cost-cutting lie ahead.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          ELECTRIFYING FACTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     Market     Dividend                                 Pre-tax profits       Value      yield                             Year end    Pounds m    Pounds m    percent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Midland Electricity       3/94        51.2      1,562.3       3.96 Eastern Group                  3/94       176.8      1,912.7       3.87 London Electricity             3/94       186.5      1,493.7       4.11 Manweb                         3/94       126.3        904.5       3.99 Midlands Electricity           3/94       195.4      1,514.0       4.06 National Power                 3/94       677.0      5,995.1       3.34 Northern Electricity           3/94       128.7        931.6       4.10 Norweb                         3/94       178.3      1,300.6       3.82 Northern Ireland Electricity   3/94        74.9        597.5       3.92 Powergen                       4/94       476.0      4,173.7       2.98 Scottish Hydro-Electricity     3/94       164.2      1,207.9       5.02 Scottish Power                 3/94       351.1      2,717.3       4.65 Seeboard                       3/94       131.7      1,013.2       3.64 South Wales Electricity        3/94       104.0        780.3       4.17 South Western Electricity      3/94       116.8        910.7       3.97 Southern Electricity           3/94       222.0      1,937.7       3.97 Yorkshire Electricity          3/94       149.0      1,447.8       4.23  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

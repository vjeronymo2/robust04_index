			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANXIOUS WAIT ENDING FOR KIN OF BANKER WHO ESCAPED  </P> <P> Abdalla Touny's timing couldn't have been worse.  </P> <P> The 44-year-old American bank officer flew halfway around the globe to arrive  in Kuwait City on Aug. 2, just one hour before Iraqi troops invaded the tiny  desert emirate, trapping him in the midst of an international crisis.  </P> <P> With the borders closed and troops moving through the countryside, Touny hid in  the basement of the family home near Kuwait city and from there, he spoke only  once with his wife, Abla, who was in the United States, wrapping up the family  vacation just as he became trapped.  </P> <P> She did not hear from him again for three weeks. "Oh God, you have no idea what  it was like," she said.  </P> <P> On Thursday night, as TWA Flight 861, landed at Los Angeles International  Airport, Abla Touny waited nervously for her husband, as did their children,  who carried yellow and red flowers and a yellow cardboard sign with hearts on  it, and the legend: "Welcome home dad."  </P> <P> For three weeks "we kept calling the State Department and they kept telling us  everything was fine. We asked them to send a message (to Touny) but there was  no answer." Abdalla Touny is one of the small number of foreigners who have  managed to escape Kuwait across the desert. About 12,000 Westerners are  believed to be still held in Iraq and Kuwait, including about 2,900 Americans.  </P> <P> Abla Touny said her husband left their home and headed across the desert by  car. His first try was for the Saudi Arabian border, but he was turned back  there by Iraqi soldiers, his wife said. When he reached Jordan, he was broke  and exhausted, and had ditched his American passport, knowing the Iraqis were  looking for Americans.  </P> <P> The Egyptian-born Tounys, naturalized U.S. citizens, had lived in Kuwait for  two years. Abdalla worked as an officer for the Bank of Kuwait; his wife was a  clinical chemist at the University of Kuwait.  </P> <P> The couple and their two children, Dinah, 13, and Sharif, 18, came here on June  3 for a summer vacation. They expected go back to Kuwait and spend at least  another year there before returning to their permanent home in Ontario.  </P> <P> Abdalla decided to return to Kuwait first. His wife and daughter were to follow  two weeks later. Sharif would stay on as a student at UC Riverside.  </P> <P> The day after the invasion, Touny was still unaware that Iraqi forces had  occupied the country until his wife called him. Abdalla then called the U.S.  Embassy in Kuwait, where officials suggested he "just stay put" at his villa,  his wife said.  </P> <P> He kept up phone contact with the embassy, but his wife did not hear from him  again until six days ago, and was startled to hear he had escaped.  </P> <P> Two days later, Abdalla called again from Cairo; he said he was on his way  home.  </P></p>

[Bahman] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful.  Declaring a day of solidarity with Bosnia-Herzegovina is a  commendable move but a verbal expression of sympathy alone  should not suffice. You should persuade them [not further  identified] to adopt clear and definite decisions. Those who  believe it is enough to pay mere lipservice should remember that  they can become involved in similar predicaments.    [ETTELA'AT] How do you appraise the reaction of Islamic  countries on Bosnia-Herzegovina? Have they met Bosnian  expectations?    [Bahman] Islamic countries have not done all they should in  the face of such atrocities. Unfortunately, when assistance was  needed, it did not come. Now it is too late.    [ETTELA'AT] There have been numerous rounds of peace talks  by  the EC and the United Nations to end the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. What has been the outcome for Bosnia?    [Bahman] As I said, the Islamic countries have not met  Bosnian expectations and some still deal with the aggressors.  Some have thought only of keeping their governments in power  and, since they demand assistance from abroad, these foreigners  motivate them to act against Islamic countries. Tomorrow, they  will meet the same fate.    [ETTELA'AT] How do you view the recent peace talks in Geneva  and Brussels? Can the sides reach a compromise in these talks?    [Bahman] The sole objective of these conferences is to have  Europe free itself of the problems of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  objective is to terminate the war but without bearing in mind  the rights of the Bosnian Muslims. This conference will resolve  nothing and misfortune and hardship will still prevail.    [ETTELA'AT] How do you see the current position of the  secessionists of the Bihac uprising?    [Bahman] The Bihac scenario was staged by a group who were  safeguarding the former regime's interests. They are the  supporters of the former (Bolshevik) regime. They wish to rule  regardless and clearly, this country's enemies are assisting  them. [passage omitted]    [ETTELA'AT] How do you view relations between Iran and the  Bosnian Muslim government and their future?    [Bahman] The Islamic Republic of Iran continues to extend  assistance to the extent it can. This is why conditions for  greater cooperation have been created. Iran is one of the  greater countries for trade and construction and if peace is  restored in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the two sides can forge  bilateral cooperation.    [ETTELA'AT] What message do you have for our readers?    [Bahman] There are many things that should be said but my  message to the Iranian people is that first, solidarity among  Muslims is important, as there can be no progress without it.  Second, wisdom and intelligence are necessary everywhere.  Specialists and youth should seek to acquire new technology and  grapple with problems. The Islamic Republic of Iran has a  competent specialized cadre. No one should content himself with  dependence on foreign specialists or seek solutions from them.</p>

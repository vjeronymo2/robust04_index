			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Buba introduces element of doubt Last week saw almost as striking a succession of new highs in global equity markets as did the week before. However, in continental Europe, the Bundesbank's decision to leave German key interest rates unchanged brought in an element of doubt. Although the French and Spanish markets closed at new peaks last Friday, seven of the 13 Continental bourses featured in the FT-Actuaries World Index series produced declines on the week. Nordic countries seemed to suffer from the sheer vigour of an earlier recovery in the financial sector: a drop of nearly 8 per cent in Sweden's banking shares index last Tuesday was followed by one of 11.4 per cent in Finnish banks a day later, although the Stockholm market produced a big recovery last Friday. Belgium, down 2.1 per cent on the week, was one of the few bourses to show a decline in the month of August, over which Europe as a whole has been about 6 per cent ahead. Kleinwort Benson says that social policy reform, covering the method of financing social security, employment and competitiveness, offers the Belgian government its greatest political challenge so far. Meanwhile, Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley, and his colleague, Mr Richard Davidson, look at the relationship between Germany, France and their respective equity markets. They say that last week's Bundesbank action confirmed that Germany is more concerned with its own domestic priorities than with preserving the structure of the ERM. 'France now has the choice of continuing with the Swedish way of shadowing the D-Mark with high interest rates,' they say, 'or adopting the British way of cutting rates and stimulating a recessionary economy. We believe that it will adopt the latter course.' They expect the French market, therefore, to outperform Germany in the short term.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 % change                                                      % change     in US                    % change in local currency*       sterling*  Dollars*               1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of    Start of   Start of                                            1993        1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria        +0.47     +5.56   +34.66    +26.71      +23.55    +22.45 Belgium        -2.13     -1.36   +25.77    +18.49      +11.98    +10.97 Denmark        -1.86     +6.13   +23.70    +30.60      +20.36    +19.29 Finland        -3.13     +9.04  +177.87    +78.45      +61.24    +59.82 France         +2.36     +5.25   +29.95    +20.40      +15.13    +14.10 Germany        -1.04     +5.49   +25.36    +22.80      +20.42    +19.34 Ireland        -0.48     +5.68   +44.29    +45.09      +26.32    +25.20 Italy          +2.64    +11.62   +83.49    +55.53      +45.06    +43.76 Netherlands    +1.06     +4.25   +29.04    +24.56      +22.08    +21.00 Norway         -0.80     +5.70   +44.71    +32.15      +27.23    +26.09 Spain          +3.69    +12.33   +50.78    +41.75      +20.78    +19.71 Sweden         -2.15     +4.46   +55.53    +26.83      +12.50    +11.49 Switzerland    +0.26     +3.24   +41.15    +20.71      +21.25    +20.17 UK             +1.35     +6.02   +38.29    +10.93      +10.94     +9.94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE         +0.89     +5.76   +37.35    +19.82      +16.69    +15.65 Australia      +0.96     +5.34   +20.54    +20.42      +17.78    +16.73 Hong Kong      -1.82     +4.46   +30.89    +32.29      +33.35    +32.15 Japan          +0.60     +0.41   +23.36    +26.44      +53.24    +51.87 Malaysia       +2.71     +9.85   +69.95    +44.44      +49.54    +48.21 New Zealand    -1.10    +10.97   +41.57    +33.97      +45.33    +44.04 Singapore      +1.00    +13.23   +50.39    +30.85      +34.90    +33.70 Canada         +0.91     +3.84   +12.13    +14.69      +11.30    +10.31 USA            +0.81     +2.65   +11.64     +5.64       +6.59     +5.64 Mexico         +3.24     +9.71   +37.11     +6.79       +8.06     +7.10 South Africa   -1.23     -5.53   +29.54    +27.01      +32.37    +31.19 WORLD INDEX    +0.73     +2.77   +22.14    +15.84      +22.16    +21.08  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Based on August 27th 1993.

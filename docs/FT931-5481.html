			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Commercial loans undermine Skipton PRE-TAX PROFITS of the Skipton Building Society fell 50 per cent to Pounds 4.1m in 1992 as the society increased its bad debt provision to Pounds 42.2m, writes Philip Coggan. The society was also forced to restate its 1991 accounts to address a 'fundamental error'. Having taken the advice of its auditors and other advisers, a further provision of Pounds 3.25m was taken in respect of one commercial loan. This reduced the 1991 pre-tax profits, previously stated as Pounds 11.5m, to Pounds 8.2m, and increased that year's bad debt provision to Pounds 27.5m. Over half the society's provision for bad debts in 1992 relate to commercial loans. Mr John Goodfellow, chief executive, said that the society had been exposed to the leisure sector and that pubs and hotels had been badly hit by recession. Mr Ian Hepworth, finance director, and another director, Mr Arthur Jeanes, have resigned; three new directors have joined the board, Mr Ronald McCormick (as finance director), Mr Stephen Blizzard (as operations director) and Mr Alan Scotter (as sales and marketing director). Operating profits rose 30 per cent to Pounds 46.3m (Pounds 35.7m) in 1992 helped by an increase in interest margins and a reduction in management expenses. The cost to income ratio fell from 39.8 per cent to 32.7 per cent. 'Despite the huge fall in profits and the fact that capital ratios are on the low side, Skipton is now over the worst,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.</p>

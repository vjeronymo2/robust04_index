			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Tougher waste rules will cost Pounds 19m a year TOUGHER NEW licences for the disposing of waste, which come into effect next year, will cost businesses about Pounds 19m a year, the government said yesterday. A consultation paper from the Department of the Environment proposes that the maximum penalty in a magistrates court for dumping waste or treating it without a licence will rise from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 20,000 and/or six months in prison, The proposals are intended to reduce discrepancies between local standards and to help move the cost of waste disposal from the taxpayer to the producer of waste. Local authorities, which will retain responsibility for waste disposal until the government's Environment Agency is created, will judge whether licence holders are 'fit and proper' by looking at whether they have criminal convictions for environmental offences, at their technical competence and at their financial resources. They will charge for licences, at a rate set nationally, to help pay for enforcement. There is no charge at present. Licence holders will not be able to cancel licences until they have satisfied authorities that there is unlikely to be long-term pollution from gases or from poisons leaching into the soil. At present, holders can cancel the licence when they choose, usually when they finish dumping. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said yesterday: 'This is a step in the right direction, but there is a risk that unscrupulous waste disposers will now rush to turn in their licences before next April.'</p>

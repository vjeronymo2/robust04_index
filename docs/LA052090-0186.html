			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENER'S CHECKLIST: FOR DEDICATED GARDENERS, HERE ARE SUGGESTIONS FROM THE  CALIFORNIA ASSN. OF NURSERYMEN ON WHAT TO DO IN THE GARDEN THIS WEEK:  </P> <P> Divide crowded clumps of bearded iris after the bloom is finished.  </P> <P> This should be done every third year or so.  </P> <P> If you have bedding plants waiting to be transplanted into the garden, remember  to keep them watered.  </P> <P> Garden-fresh herbs can add more flavor to your outdoor barbecuing. Plant them  in pots near the barbecue area to have them close at hand while cooking.  </P> <P> Shallow-rooted plants like camellias, rhododendrons, azaleas and fuchsias will  benefit from a thick application of mulch to conserve moisture and keep roots  cool.  </P></p>

My brother, His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal; brother  struggler Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine;  brother leaders of sisterly Jordan; their excellencies the heads  of Arab and foreign diplomatic missions: Allow me in the name  of the steadfast Yemeni people to lavishly thank my dear brother  His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal [applause], who exerted great  efforts, along with his government and people and all the good  in the Arab homeland, led, too, by my brother struggler Yasir  'Arafat [applause] and many sisterly and friendly states,  including the United States of America and the EEC and others in  the world, who were concerned about Yemeni unity, which was  proclaimed on 22 May 1990 in a peaceful and democratic way.    God be praised, we are here in sisterly Jordan to sign the  document of pledge and accord drafted by the Political Forces  Dialogue Committee of national parties and independent  personalities. We -- the leadership, the government, and the  people, led by the three coalition parties, the General People's  Congress, the Yemeni Socialist Party, and the Yemeni Reform  Grouping and the rest of the political forces -- hope that with  this signing we will really move on to practical implementation,  as stated in the document of pledge and accord.    Your majesty, we highly appreciate your hosting of this  large  gathering of social and political personalities, national  figures, and historic leaders, led by brother Field Marshal  'Abdallah al-Sallal, brother 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, brother  'Abd-al-Rahman al-Baydani, and many other national figures and  historic Yemeni leaders. Our father, great struggler  'Abd-al-Rahman Bin-Yahya al- Iryani, was supposed to be with us,  but he was delayed in Damascus for some reason. We thank you in  the name of these forces and in the name of your people and  brothers in Yemen for your eagerness to maintain Yemeni unity.    God willing, we will not disappoint you or our people in  Jordan and the entire good Arab nation, which is concerned about  the Yemeni unity. We will measure up to the good opinion of  all. We will break with all past pages, in all their forms,  tragedies, rivalries, and problems. We make the promise of  loyal men that with this document we will move to the stage of  pledge, success, and implementation, God willing. From the  bottom of my heart and in the name of these leaders, I once  again thank you very much. God's peace and blessings be upon  you. [applause]</p>

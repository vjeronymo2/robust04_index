			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Campbell sets pace in Canada succession race: The forceful defence minister widely tipped to replace Brian Mulroney as prime minister later this year IT HAS taken less than two months for Ms Kim Campbell to make her mark as Canada's defence minister. Foreign diplomats have already detected a more forceful articulation of defence policy, ranging from a blunt affirmation of Ottawa's contentious order for 50 European-built helicopters, to the deployment of Canadian troops on a risky new mission in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The diplomats have also noticed that, since Ms Campbell took over the portfolio in January, statements which used to be made by the chief of defence staff now come from the minister's office. Such evidence of decisiveness and ambition help explain why Ms Campbell  - whose real first name is Avril - has quickly emerged as the front-runner to succeed Mr Brian Mulroney as Canada's 19th prime minister. Mr Mulroney announced his resignation last week but, as is normal in Canada, will remain in office until his party holds a convention to choose a new leader. The convention will probably be held in June, giving the new leader no more than five months to prepare for the general election, which must be called by November. No one has yet stepped forward as an official candidate. For the moment all those who may be in the running are taking the lie of the land, putting together alliances and organisations, and scraping together the substantial funds required for a leadership campaign. Besides Ms Campbell, the candidates are expected to include Mr Perrin Beatty, communications minister, and Mr Jean Charest, who holds the environment portfolio. Mr Michael Wilson, the veteran trade minister, may also throw his hat into the ring. Each of these men appears, however, to have a weak spot. Mr Beatty, who is in his early 40s, has been in parliament for 21 years but is widely regarded as lacking substance. Mr Charest, 34, is bright, personable and bilingual. But convention delegates, many of them from western Canada, are unlikely to favour one Quebecker handing over the leadership to another. Mr Charest will probably emerge from the convention as a man to watch in the future. Mr Wilson's seniority is offset by his plodding manner, his poor French and his identification with the most unpopular policies of the Mulroney era, such as free trade and the goods and services sales tax. Early opinion polls indicate that, of all the prospective candidates, Ms Campbell has the best chance of narrowing the gap which has opened between the Conservatives and the opposition Liberals. Before last week, the Liberals could count on the backing of about 45 per cent of decided voters, against less than 19 per cent for the Conservatives. But according to a Gallup poll taken shortly after Mr Mulroney's announcement, the two parties would be almost neck-and-neck with Ms Campbell at the helm. Mr Wilson was the second most popular choice. Ms Campbell, who turns 46 next week, has the rare combination in Canadian politics of being a woman from British Columbia who speaks fluent French. She gained a reputation during three years as justice minister as an intelligent, ambitious and forthright politician with a knack for pushing legislation through parliament. 'She knows what she wants, but she's able to work in a team and to convince people that she has the right solution,' says Mrs Paule Gauthier, president of the Canadian Bar Association. The UK government will have an opportunity to size up Ms Campbell when she visits London later this month for talks with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, her British counterpart. Political observers say Ms Campbell's biggest handicap is an intellectual aloofness. She studied Soviet government at the London School of Economics (and speaks passable Russian), lectured in political science at the University of British Columbia and, in her mid-30s, qualified as a lawyer. Her hobbies include painting and playing the cello. Opinions are divided on whether Ms Campbell can repeat Mr Mulroney's success in persuading Quebeckers to vote Conservative; she is not well known in the francophone province. The Tories have yet to cement the Quebec political organisation crucial to victories in 1984 and 1988. One favourite convention scenario is that Ms Campbell will emerge as the winner, but with a Quebec 'lieutenant' at her side, perhaps Mr Charest or Mr Benoit Bouchard, the popular health and welfare minister. But with three months to go before delegates gather, no firm bets are being placed.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Technology: Part of the office furniture - Microsoft is unveiling a new partnership Imagine being able to operate all the equipment in your office from one screen, or each entertainment product in your home from a single remote control device. Instead of pressing different buttons on different machines for different functions, these could all be connected to save users' time, money and the frustrating need to remember which machine does what and how. Companies in the electronics, computer, office equipment and entertainment industries have been thinking along these lines for some time. Now that wireless communications look like replacing endless lines of cable, such ideas have been given a new impetus. Tomorrow, Microsoft, the dominant US software company, will take a significant step toward the future linking of electronic equipment by unveiling partnerships with office equipment makers to produce photocopiers, facsimile machines and laser printers controlled by the company's software. Microsoft's contribution will be a new office equipment 'operating system' that will let users control this equipment by merely pointing at pictorial representations of their functions on a built-in computer screen. The company has been working on this technology for more than four years and it is similar to the company's Windows software. The software operating these new devices will, however, include the ability to be controlled by Microsoft Windows when connected to a personal computer. It will also be 'multi-tasking' so that it can allow the office equipment in question to handle more than one job at once. One of the partners in this deal - Hewlett-Packard - says it can foresee the day when this technology will allow it to produce printers with no external switches, buttons or controls. All of these tasks will be handled by software and controlled by a PC running Windows. The devices, to be produced initially under Microsoft's new office equipment partnership, however, will be capable of operating without a PC connection, although a small, PC-style flat screen and computer-generated 'icons' will be used to provide the control. Other partners are Compaq, Ricoh, Minolta, and Ericsson. These partnerships are only one element in the long-term strategy outlined by Bill Gates, the head of Microsoft. He wants to put Microsoft technology in almost anything that uses electricity. His intention is to make Microsoft software an integral part of office equipment. Gates also foresees Microsoft's involvement in the design of specialist software for 'broadcast' information to and from portable computers over wireless networks, personal information management applications for use on hand-held computers, electronic and voice mail from portable systems and the transfer of data to and from desktop systems automatically. Finally, he has committed Microsoft to work on designing Windows into consumer electronic machines such as video cassette recorders, audio systems, home telephones and information browsing systems run over cable television networks, as well as advanced computer games, Windows-based photography systems and multi-media education software. Gates says many of these projects will require partnerships with companies in different industries, but Microsoft has enough funds for such strategic investments. He cites the company's investment last year in London publishing house Dorling Kindersley and the subsequent development of multi-media products based around the company's educational books. 'Partnership is the key - getting people to build these devices in an intelligent form so that other people's machines can talk to their machines,' says Gates. 'We don't want to dictate partners or form factors - we are working with dozens of manufacturers to bring out systems that contain specialised (software) code.' Gates sees a future where more and more consumer electronics technology is built around the PC - and that which is not will at least use a form of Windows as an underlying control technology. He predicts that in the future many people will have a few wall-mounted colour, flat screens in their house for TV, video games and information management, with the controls all condensed onto a single hand-held unit. In the short term, Gates does not want to let video game manufacturers maintain 'control of the television' as an interactive entertainment medium and is investigating the role Microsoft can play here. 'It's a question of who controls intelligence to TV - which at the moment is Nintendo and Sega,' he says. 'But what about resolution (sharpness of the TV), what about desire to sit far away from the device and regulatory issues. These are the kinds of things Microsoft explores very carefully and we expect to make some bets here - on telephone control, information browsing and the idea of the PC as an advanced entertainment machine. This will take some time to shape up and see exactly what will emerge - but we will be working with lots of partners on this.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Igor Borisenko, Pavel </F> Vanichkin, and Oleg Velichko]    [Text] Washington, 23 Jun -- The meeting that Viktor  Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Government held with  members of the American-Russian business council was an  important element in the program of his stay in the U.S.  capital. The meeting was closed to the press but the ITAR-TASS  correspondents managed to learn from informed sources that  during the meeting the Russian prime minister gave most  attention to two problems -- the development of reforms and the  prospects for Russian-U.S. business cooperation.    Acknowledging that the economic situation in the country  remains very complicated, Chernomyrdin at the same time pointed  out that some encouraging signs had appeared, which indicated  that the situation was improving. He singled out among these  the fact that inflation was being brought under control and this  makes it possible to really get down to improving the climate  for investment and to tackle problems of social protection for  the population.    Touching on problems of foreign aid for Russia, Chernomyrdin  noted that the period when the country needed direct massive  support from the United States had passed and what was on the  agenda now was the question of how to arrange mutually  advantageous cooperation. The demand for foreign investment was  vast -- in the order of $15-20 billion per year. In other  words, over the next 15 years Russia is in a position to  "digest" about $300 billion from abroad, primarily from the  United States. However, Moscow is interested in attracting  primarily private investors.    The Russian prime minister stressed that the increase in  foreign investments in the economy depends on two basic factors.  First, his government must draw up measures to create the most  favorable national regime for foreign businessmen to operate in.  Second, U.S. businessmen must display initiative in response to  this.    Chernomyrdin expressed concern over some obstacles that  still  exist in the United States and which obstruct the development of  bilateral trade. In particular, he cited the fact that Russia  had still not been given permanent most favored nation status in  trade with the U.S. and he also recalled the anti-dumping  restrictions on Russian exports.    The head of the Russian Government said that the results of  the third session of the "Gore-Chernomyrdin" commission show  that the two countries are moving in the right direction and  that in line with this movement an increasing role is beginning  to be played by bilateral links between private businesses.</p>

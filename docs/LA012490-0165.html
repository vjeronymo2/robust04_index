			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM CAUTIONED  </P> <P> The president of Little League Inc., concerned about exploitation of  youngsters, has told the world champion Trumbull Little League baseball team to  halt its public appearances or risk losing its charter.  </P> <P> Creighton Hale, president of the Little League Inc. in Williamsport, Pa., said  he wants to see everything come to a halt, John DelVecchio, president of the  Trumbull Little League, said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Hale is concerned about exploitation, said DelVecchio, who has canceled the  team's appearance at the Connecticut Sports Writers' Alliance Gold Key dinner  on Feb. 4.  </P> <P> Hale, in a statement, said the youngsters are not grown men and they really  aren't great athletes. "We need to protect them from what adults sometimes do,  which is over-glorify them for the things they sometimes accomplish."  </P> <P> Manager Tom Galla, whose squad became the first American team to win the Little  League World Series since 1983, said he welcomes the directive from  Williamsport.  </P></p>

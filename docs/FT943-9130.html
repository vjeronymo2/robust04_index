			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Clinton's anti-crime drive suffers setback The House of Representatives dealt a heavy blow to President Bill Clinton yesterday, defeating a Dollars 33.2bn (Pounds 21.4bn) multi-faceted anti-crime package for which the president had personally lobbied. Voting 225 to 210, the House defeated a procedural rule need to bring the legislation, known as the crime bill, to the floor. The vote effectively kills the bill in this form and denies Mr Clinton an anti-crime initiative he had promised during his 1992 election campaign. The defeat could undermine the effectiveness of the Clinton presidency; political analysts said it seemed certain to make life more difficult for the president in his efforts to get the centrepiece of his legislative agenda - the healthcare bill - through Congress. In an unusual twist, the powerful US gun lobby and the influential Congressional Black Caucus - which normally favours gun control - teamed up to delay and ultimately defeat the bill. The gun lobby opposed a ban on 19 types of assault weapons included in the legislation, while the black caucus was angered that a controversial 'racial justice provision' had been removed from the bill in the face of stiff Republican opposition. The measure would have allowed minority defendants facing the death penalty to use statistics to challenge capital punishment as racially biased. Mr Clinton had sent Mr Leon Panetta, his chief of staff, to Capitol Hill earlier in the day to lobby for passage of the procedural vote. The president and Vice-President Al Gore had also called several members in an attempt to secure their support. Later Mr Clinton, who blamed Republicans for the defeat, accused the House of 'failing the American people'. The crime bill would have given local communities grants to hire 100,000 more police and provided billions of dollars over six years for new prisons and crime prevention programmes. It would also have instituted harsher penalties for certain crimes, raising to 60 the number of federal crimes for which US attorneys would be allowed to seek the death penalty and mandating life sentences for third-time felons.</p>

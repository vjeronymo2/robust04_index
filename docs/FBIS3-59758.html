Concrete plans for field trials  are being finalized. B-ISDN will be realized and total  communication and broadcasting services will be the goal with  several trials to begin in 1994.    The real purpose is to develop new applications using high  speed and wide area networks that will become the 21st century  infrastructure. Verification of market needs, and the resolution  of legal problems that may arise along with the provision of  service will take place concurrently. The experiments will be  conducted mainly by the private sector with the support of  government agencies such as MPT (Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications).    By building high speed and wide area networks, multimedia  communication service will be provided to businesses and homes.  Led by MPT, plans for multimedia communication service field  trials that will be conducted by private companies are reaching  concrete levels. Emphasis will be on verification of application  development, feasibility of the business, and problem  resolution. Experiments will start in 1994 (see Table 1 and  Figure 1).     <H3>  Two Experiments In Kansai Area Are Planned To Start In July  1994 </H3>   At the end of July, equipment specifications provided by the  ``Pilot Business Model for New Generation Communication  Network'' (Experiment In Total Communication And Broadcasting)  lead by MPT were finalized and plans reached a concrete level.  In reality, optical fiber was installed at 300 locations  centered around the homes of the nearby Kansai Cultural and  Academic Research City. The infrastructure model of total  communication and broadcasting service, Fiber-To-The-Home, is to  be constructed there. Free from the constraints of extant  communication broadcasting systems, a new multimedia  communication system for homes will be developed. Thus needs  will be determined and at the same time, this project has an  aspect of an ``experiment in reform.'' Companies will be  recruited and the experiment is planned to continue for 3 years  starting from July of 1994.    Also, near the Kansai Cultural and Academic Research City,  B-ISDN will be constructed. This ``Experiment For A New  Generation Of Communication Network Businesses'' aims at the  development of business applications and is being actively  explored with a possible starting date of July 1994. The purpose  is ``to create business opportunities in B-ISDN,'' the project  is identified in English as, ``BBCC: Broadband - ISDN Business  Chance Creation'' by the Research Institute Of New Generation  Communication Networking, that is the main organization  conducting the research (headquartered in Kyoto City). One  hundred thirty seven companies including communication  businesses such as NTT, leading communication equipment makers,  home electronic makers, and trading and construction companies  are participating in BBCC. Execution of 13 projects is planned.       Table 1.

The plan  is to realize an electronic newspaper by upgrading the pc  communication service quite active in Oita Prefecture by sending  images through existing N-ISDN at high speed. The purpose is to  develop and provide multimedia communication services, and to  resolve various problems such as privacy and copyright violation  that may arise in a future in multimedia society. Also  vitalization of the area is another big part of the project.  This experiment is still in the stage of conceptualization but  will be ready for execution beginning in 1994.    Plans for new multimedia communication services in various  fields are appearing. Key words for these experiments include:  B-ISDN for research on a New Generation Of Communication Network  Businesses; Fiber-To-The-Home and Experiment In Total  Communication and Broadcasting for a Pilot Business Model For  New Generation Communication Network. The purpose of Hyper  Network Social Experiment is to explore high speed personal  computer communication.  <H5>  Two Experiments In Kansai Area Linked Together </H5>   Although the research on B-ISDN and the pilot model are to  be  conducted in the same area of the Kansai Cultural And Academic  Research City, they were derived differently.       The following explains the history of each project. First of  all, practical experiments on a new generation of communication  network were conducted in April of 1992, and then Promotion of  New Generation Communication Network Society (PNES:  Headquartered in Tokyo) was formed after MPT issued the permit.  PNES decided to conduct its first experiment in Kansai area,  thus BBCC was born.    On the other hand, the Experiment In Total Communication And  Broadcasting was hurriedly developed since the supplementary  budget of &yen;2 billion was granted for the purpose of bringing  up the economy. The allocated budget had to be spent within the  year, and the organization to conduct the project had to be  public corporation. To aid economic recovery, the experiment was  needed immediately, and since the PNES was already in existence  as a non-profit organization it was selected as the project  executor.    Thus the experiments on B-ISDN and broadcasting developed  separately. However both projects share the same application  experiment. BBCC and PNES will conduct the experiments sharing  the same equipment at the center and the network. They are  currently working out the logistics.  <H6>  B-ISDN Includes Thirteen Projects </H6>   ``A large high resolution video screen will be built on  three  sides of a wall, and video, taped at the nearby aquarium, will  be projected on the screen creating a space with the feeling of  being in the aquarium,'' and ``a computer at an architectural  company and a terminal at the customer service counter will  connected so that design specifications of a house to be built  can be discussed interactively using 3D graphics.'' These are  just two of the goals for B-ISDN.    ``Keihanna Plaza'' in Kansai Cultural And Academic Research  City, and Osaka, Kyoto, and Nara will be connected with optical  fiber. Experimental applications of B-ISDN will be conducted by  connecting each network access point to a corporate participant.  A video studio for high vision images will also be established  as a B-ISDN experience corner.     <H5>  Common And Specific Projects Conducted </H5>   The planned total of 13 experiments is divided into common  and specific projects. The common projects will be conducted by  137 companies associated with the BBCC.

Although participating companies have not yet been  announced publicly, as an example, communication equipment  makers will participate in the study of high speed LANs. The  router that interfaces with ATM (Asynchronous Transmission Mode)  developed by the participating makers will be established at  existing LANs (FDDI or EtherNet), so that actually ATM circuits  will be connected and used between LANs.    Home appliance makers will participate in projects involving  the design and architecture of houses by using interactive  computer graphics. Printing companies will participate in  projects on satellite electronic editing and printing, and  medical equipment makers will participate in the investigation  of remote medical treatment.    Also for applications aiming at the home market such as  electronic catalogs using multimedia, a study will be conducted  in which optical fiber connected to homes for the Experiment In  Total Communication And Broadcasting is extended and leased out  as an accompanying project.  <H5>  Permanent Virtual Circuits Used In ATM Network </H5>   The specifications for the ATM network used in this  experiment employ PVC (Permanent Virtual Circuits) that requires  the registration of a party with an ATM node. The reason why the  party is not selectable freely is that the specifications for  ATM public network service (signal protocol) have not yet been  standardized. Circuits with a physical speed of 156M bit/second  are used to access an ATM node from the user's side and for  links between ATM nodes.    Data from the user's side is divided into an ATM cell with a  unit of 53 bytes, then the signal is sent to an ATM network at  various speeds ranging from several M to 10's of M bit/second  depending on the terminal.    Also, at this time the network is divided into a video image  group and a communication group. This is because the main  concern of the experiment is not placed on technical development  but rather on the development of applications. In the video  image group, high vision images will be transmitted with digital  compression. And the image codec (digital compression, and  enlargement device) employs a 150 M bit/second fixed speed  rather than the newly developed codec which is a variable rate  device. For this reason, the speed of the video image is fixed,  and the video image group became separate.    BBCC will use this network application, and experiments will  be conducted. As the experiments advance, the fee structure of  B-ISDN paid by users will become clear. However, quite a few  express the opinion that if service is extended to homes, the  collection of fees would be difficult unless the service  includes not only communication but also a wide range of  broadcasting services such as those offered by CATV. Study is  still needed to provide the total communication and broadcasting  service.  <H3>  New Service With Existing Technology In The Experiment In  Total Communication And Broadcasting </H3>   On the other hand, in the Pilot Business Model For New  Generation Communication Network, CATV broadcasting service (61  channels) and N-ISDN (64k - 1.5M bit/second) will be provided  simultaneously on a single optical fiber cable. The homes in the  area of Kansai Cultural And Academic Research City will be  connected with optical fiber, and research will be conducted.  This experiment will be executed using a fund of &yen;2 billion  supplemented by the government and &yen;3 billion collected by  the private sector.    At present, companies are being widely recruited, and an  increased number of participants including the corporations  associated with BBCC as well as companies outside of BBCC are  sought. Foreign companies such as CATV businesses in the U.S.  have also been contacted for their participation. In the middle  of this coming October, the overall members including equipment  makers and participating companies will be finalized. The  experiment is planned to continue for three years.  <H3>  Possible Production Of TV Program By Participation Of  Audience </H3>   In this experiment, the dividing wall between communication  and broadcasting systems will be eliminated, so that new  applications will be developed by integrating communication and  broadcasting as a whole, and the feasibility of business  development will be studied. Although detailed contents of the  experiments are not yet finalized, Table 3 shows the  applications that are envisioned.       Table 3.

Utilizing the merit of multiple channels, Near-Video-On-Demand,  by which the same TV program is broadcast on several channels at  30 minute intervals, and Video-On-Demand by which a viewer can  request programs at any time from a central location equipped  with a video server will be realized. Also for example, the  experiment conceptualizes the viewer able to select and switch  screen views that are broadcast with multiple video cameras  using multiple channels.    New applications combining broadcasting and communication  will become possible. For example, it will become possible to  produce a TV program in which the viewer can participate through  telephone or alter the story by voting.    Through the use of N-ISDN, remote medical treatment or  telecommuting by using TV conferencing and video phone will  become feasible. Also, high resolution image and text  information may be stored in a still picture database so that an  electronic library and electronic catalog shopping become  possible.    In order to study the business feasibility of these  services,  a fee structure will be established for each application and the  service will be provided to users.  <H5>  Ready Within the Year By Using Existing Technology </H5>   Looking at the system, the experiment this time employs  existing technology and products. This is because the experiment  was conceived to stimulate the economy, and immediate execution  is needed. Analog video images will be transmitted using optical  fiber. The transmission of data will use N-ISDN rather than ATM.       The equipment and machines to be used at the center were  announced publicly on 30 July. The specifications for the  network are based on the system that NTT developed. By using  optical wavelength multiplexing technology, analog video images  and N-ISDN can be transmitted simultaneously over a single  optical fiber.    Also, for video image transmission such as CATV, the  ``Demand  Access Optical CATV System,'' a technology developed by the NHK  technical research lab, will be employed. Two hundred fifty out  of 300 households participating in the experiment are using the  NTT system, and 50 households are based on NHK system.    Both system will commonly support 61 channels. Thirty one  channels are set for continuous flow video transmission. The  remaining 30 channels are allocated for each household to use  individually (simultaneous use is maximum of 30 households per  system). Either way, control signals such as data to request  programming is transmitted to the center via N-ISDN.    The difference between the two systems is whether all  channels are transmitted to a home via optical fiber (NTT  System), or only channels selected by the household are  transmitted (NHK System). In other words, the channel selection  function will be enabled at either the terminal side, or center  side. That difference is viewed as depending on whether the cost  can be allocated for the terminal side or center side. Whether  the equipment cost is distributed at the center side and  terminal side will make a difference in the total cost. In this  experiment, the economy of the systems will be studied.  <H3>  Advancement Of Personal Computer Toward Multimedia  Electronic Newspaper </H3>   Although it is at a conceptual stage, the Hyper Network  Social Research Lab based in Oita Prefecture is looking toward  the experiment to vitalize the local economy. As part of a  ``Hyper Network Social Experiment'', the center has tender  thoughts of a multimedia newspaper. The concept is that a few  minutes of news video can be provided by the existing TV station  or newspaper company as the basis for multimedia text or video  news. The video is compressed digitally, and then distributed to  users via the network from a multimedia news station. Also users  can send their comments by transmitting a digitally compressed  image to the multi-media news station.       Along with the emulation of new forms of news media, as it  progresses the experiment also has the purpose of resolving  various problems that may arise in a future multimedia society  such as privacy and copyright violation. By enabling multimedia,  vitalization of local economy is also a goal.    Although it is at a conceptual stage at this point, by  upgrading the personal computer system, the exploration of pc  communication is also under consideration. The area that the  experiment takes place, Oita Prefecture, is quite active in  personal computer communication (i.e. Toyo-No-Kuni Network). By  upgrading the base network to 1.5M bit/second, the communication  network is going to shift to the Internet protocol using TCP/IP.  For the main network and user circuits, existing communication  service will be used.    At present, the center is formulating concrete plans for the  experiment by studying communication networks, system  configurations, and video compression technology. After the cost  and plans are finalized, the center would like to start the  experiment as soon as possible which will likely be sometime in  1994.    Will these experiments be merely a test or lead to  commercial  use? Corporate participation will be influenced by this factor.  For example, if the experiment on communication and broadcasting  remains a special test case, then will corporate participants be  satisfied? The organization is having a tough time in recruiting  companies, and one of the reasons why not many companies so far  have shown interest is the uncertain outcome of the experiments.  In order to create the incentive for companies to participate,  the government must remove the barriers and it must clearly  demonstrate the attitude that these experiments will lead to  commercial applications.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government has rejected  reports that the supply of German submarines to Taiwan,  originally banned in early 1993, is to go ahead after all via a  different route. A government spokesman said today in response  to a query that Bonn has "no plans" to send Taiwan any  submarines via a cooperation agreement with U.S. firms.    Contrary to usual practice, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl  stated publicly following a secret meeting of the Federal  Security Council on 28 January 1993 that delivery is out of the  question as far as Bonn is concerned. This position has not  changed.    According to reports published in the HANDELSBLATT and NEUE  ZEIT, the submarine deal with Taiwan is supposed to be worth  around 10 billion German marks [DM]. In addition, the supply of  the submarines is intended to open the way for the sale of the  German Intercity Express high-speed train, a deal worth a total  of around DM30 billion.</p>

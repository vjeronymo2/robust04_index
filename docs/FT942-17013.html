			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Max on the move Pepsi-Cola International is to market its new diet cola drink, Pepsi Max, in more than 20 countries by the end of the year, following successful trials in selected markets. The company forecasts that the new drink will achieve retail sales of Dollars 250m (Pounds 171m) in 1994. Trials in the UK, the Netherlands, Ireland and Australia resulted in the brand gaining an average 3 per cent share of each country's cola market within five months. The drink is aimed particularly at the young male market - a group which has been traditionally resistant to such diet products. While Pepsi Max is sugar-free, it does not advertise itself as a diet drink but emphasises a sporting image and 'maximum' taste. The drink contains a new blend of sweeteners intended to overcome consumer objections to the after-taste associated with diet drinks, and perceptions that the flavour of low-calorie drinks are 'weaker' than regular versions. Coca-Cola outsells Pepsi worldwide by about three to one, and the gap is wider when it comes to diet versions of the cola drinks. Pepsi said the new drink had 'added significant net volume and share to the company's business' and that tests in the UK suggested the product was attracting previously loyal Coke drinkers. There are no immediate plans for the drink to go on sale in the US - one of the sweeteners used in the product, acesulfame-K, has yet to be approved there. In addition, Pepsi says it does not want to eat into its US sales of Diet Pepsi. While diet drinks make up more than a quarter of all soft drink sales in the US, the figure is only about 4 per cent elsewhere. Pepsi plans to launch the drink in 10 new markets by the end of next month, including Spain, Sweden, Japan and Thailand.</p>

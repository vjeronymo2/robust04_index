			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEINBRENNER LAWYER CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: VINCENT SAID TO BE RUNNING OUT OF PATIENCE WITH CHALLENGES TO HIS  AUTHORITY.  </P> <P> Claiming that Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent's conduct has constituted a  "mockery of justice," an attorney for George Steinbrenner has formally called  on major league baseball's executive council for an impartial investigation of  Vincent's handling of Steinbrenner's removal from baseball, according to  documents obtained Thursday by The Times.  </P> <P> In the 135-page petition and 450 additional pages of documents sent to each  council member, attorney Paul Curran claims that Vincent overstepped his bounds  by wielding his power "corruptly," during the course of the investigation,  hearing and resolution of Steinbrenner's involvement with known-gambler Howard  Spira.  </P> <P> In a strongly worded letter marked "confidential" and sent out Tuesday to  baseball's 11-member executive council, Steinbrenner's attorney charged Vincent  with "serious and oppressive conduct . . . which calls for extraordinary action  by the Executive Council."  </P> <P> But the council -- made up of Vincent, eight major league club owners, and the  presidents of the National and American League -- is basically an advisory  group. It has no jurisdiction over the actions of the commissioner, who has  enjoyed an autonomous role since the position was created in 1921. The  commissioner's term lasts five years, and there is no provision for an interim  performance review. Vincent's term ends April, 1994.  </P> <P> However, this latest move by Steinbrenner seemingly did little more than  further rankle the commissioner's office, where patience with Steinbrenner's  challenges to Vincent's authority is growing thin.  </P> <P> "The time is rapidly approaching at which patience with this campaign to  undermine the integrity of the commissioner and of major league baseball will  end," Stephen D. Greenberg, baseball's deputy commissioner, said Thursday in a  statement from New York. "Mr. Steinbrenner and his advisers must recognize this  and be prepared to accept the consequences of their behavior."  </P> <P> Greenberg dismissed Steinbrenner's petition as a further attempt to "circumvent  established procedures within baseball and to avoid the consequences" of the  July 30 agreement Steinbrenner entered into with Vincent. The agreement was the  result of a ruling that Steinbrenner did not act in the best interest of  baseball in his dealings with Spira, whom Steinbrenner allegedly paid $40,000  in return for information on former Yankee Dave Winfield and Winfield's  charitable foundation.  </P> <P> In that agreement, Steinbrenner accepted Vincent's decision to step down  permanently as managing partner of the day-to-day operations of the Yankees. In  return, Steinbrenner is allowed to retain up to 49% of the team's ownership and  to have input on specific major financial decisions, excluding player  transactions. Steinbrenner also agreed not to "litigate or challenge" the  decision or the sanctions imposed by Vincent.  </P> <P> According to the agreement, Steinbrenner's continual challenges to Vincent's  decision could result in further disciplinary action that could include his  total removal from the Yankees and baseball. Since Steinbrenner was forced to  resign as managing general partner of the Yankees on Aug. 20, he and his  advisers have raised objections and questions to the methods employed in the  investigation undertaken by Vincent and baseball's special prosecutor, John  Dowd.  </P> <P> Vincent, who was en route from Oakland to New York, could not be reached for  comment. Curran, reached in New York, did not wish to comment on the petition.  </P> <P> Last week, Steinbrenner filed a $1.56-million suit in Manhattan against a court  stenographer and his company for allegedly tampering with sworn statements made  by Steinbrenner and other Yankee officials during Vincent's investigation.  Steinbrenner contends the testimony was changed on orders from Dowd to make him  look bad.  </P> <P> Among the new material detailed in the petition, Curran charged that Vincent  and Dowd violated basic rights under attorney-client privilege by coercing them  to produce notes for the investigation that were taken by Steinbrenner's  attorneys during confidential communications.  </P> <P> The petition states that Vincent and Dowd forced Steinbrenner to turn over the  notes by the "bald and direct threat that if Steinbrenner persisted in  asserting those privileges, such would be deemed conduct 'not in the best  interests of baseball' and Steinbrenner would be suspended immediately."  </P> <P> Curran also asserts that the Pete Rose case was handled entirely different in  this regard. "Dowd specifically recognized the attorney-client privilege and,  in fact, hid behind it in refusing to review evidence presented by Rose's  attorneys," the petition said.  </P> <P> Some of the charges, previously reported, were detailed in the petition. They  include:  </P> <P>  -- Suppressing critical evidence exonerating Steinbrenner; fabricating  negative evidence and secretly tampering with deposition testimony given by  Steinbrenner and other Yankee personnel during the four-month investigation.  </P> <P>  -- Not providing Steinbrenner with the Dowd Report, which contains the alleged  evidence upon which Vincent's charges were predicated, denying him fair notice  of the charges against him.  </P> <P>  -- Denying Steinbrenner the right to a fair trial because he did not allow the  Yankee owner to present testimony from any witness other than himself or to  cross-examine any witness, despite a previous agreement with Vincent that he  would be able to do so.  </P> <P>  -- That Dowd arranged for the services of an attorney to defend Spira, at no  cost, during Dowd's investigation.  </P> <P>  -- That Vincent breached the July 30 agreement by feeding the public selected  information to encourage anti-Steinbrenner sentiment. It also claims that  Vincent made efforts to cover up his "numerous improprieties."  </P> <P> It is not clear if the executive council will address the petition. Dodger  owner Peter O'Malley, a council member, would not comment on the petition.  Other council members did not return phone calls.  </P></p>

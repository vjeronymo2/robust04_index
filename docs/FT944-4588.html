			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Aerospace signals sharp reduction in losses Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the aerospace division of Daimler-Benz, said it would 'substantially' reduce its losses this year and hoped to be back in profit by the end of 1995. However, turnover in 1994 is likely to slip below the DM18.6bn (Dollars 11.8bn) recorded last year because of growing competition. The group said the company was still hoping for last-minute orders from the German defence and research ministries, which have yet to exhaust their budgets for the current year. Speaking ahead of final profit figures, expected in April, Mr Manfred Bischoff, the designated chief executive, warned that the company's results continued to depend heavily on an unsteady dollar exchange rate. The company lost DM694m in 1993, but Mr Bischoff refused to give any further details about the extent to which these losses had been trimmed this year. Dasa, Europe's largest aerospace company, earns its money in dollars, the currency used to price aerospace products, but spends it in D-Marks, a policy which makes it particularly susceptible to exchange rate movements. The dollar is worth about DM1.57; if it continues towards DM1.70 Dasa will report 'fantastic' results, it said. The company is still pressing the government for more money to meet what it says is stiff competition from US competitors.</p>

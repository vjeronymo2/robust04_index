			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First installment of interview with Father Georgi </F> Gelemenov, leader of the extreme right-wing "Rebirth"  [Vuzrazhdane] Organization and cofounder of the "United  Bulgarian Soldiery" [Obedineno Bulgarsko Voynstvo] organization,  by Svetlana Krustev; place and date not given: "I Advocate A  New National Rebirth Process That Would Restore the Turks'  Bulgarian Names"]    [Text] [Krusteva] Father Gelemenov, in the last elections  you relied on the nationalist card and lost. What makes you  think that nationalism has more of a chance of success in  Bulgaria today?    [Gelemenov] We lost because we did not manage to accomplish  our task as we should have. Many other formations existed that  called themselves nationalist, and I have the feeling that the  election results were forged, anyway. Since, as you say, the  nationalist idea is fading, I created a new theory that is  actually an old one, namely the Nazi idea. I would like to  introduce this idea to Bulgaria, and as its promoter, I shall  propagate the theory of moderate racism.    [Krusteva] What does your theory represent?    [Gelemenov] I am planning to publish a pamphlet on the  subject in the near future, so that people can see it in print.  It is a theory that divides Bulgaria's population into three  groups, according to their ethnic origins, namely: Bulgarians  who are the indigenous residents of the country should represent  the first category. The Gypsies who immigrated during the  period of the great migration should represent the second  category, while the third category should be composed of the  Turks who were the invaders. The second and third categories of  people should be subject to the first category, according to my  moderate racial theory. This is so, because, we, the white  people in Bulgaria, are the indigenous residents of this  country. In this respect I include another subcategory that is  not racial, but represents a social group, intent on dividing  the Bulgarian nation and troubling the souls of Christians. I  am talking of the religious sects. This is actually the lowest  category of people on my list.    [Krusteva] Do you realize that all your theories are in  contradiction to the Bulgarian Constitution?    [Gelemenov] Yes, but it does not bother me, because the  Bulgarian Constitution is only a bunch of papers loosely bound  together with glue and string. On the other hand, my theory is  based on the natural moral code, which is deeply rooted in the  souls and hearts of the Bulgarian people and calls for such a  racial segregation.    [Krusteva] You had some relations with the Union of  Democratic Forces [SDS] in the past. Why did you not join that  formation?    [Gelemenov] On 18 April 1990, when we, all the well-known  dissidents, were supposed to gather and establish the grouping  that should have guaranteed the country's progress....    [Krusteva] You were not admitted to the conference?    [Gelemenov] Yes, indeed. The current president Zhelyu  Zhelev slammed the door in front of my face, without any  explanation. When I shook hands with him upon stepping down  from the bus, he took my hand for one second, and then dropped  it. It was suggested to him that he not work with me, as I  later heard, and he is supposed to have called me a fascist.    [Krusteva] Who suggested to him that he should not cooperate  with you?    [Gelemenov] It was that fellow Ivaylo Trifonov [one of  Zhelev's current advisers], I think. I already had several  interviews with Radio Free Europe [RFE]. Together with  Khristofor Subev we founded the formation called "In Defense of  Religious Rights, Freedom of Conscience, and Spiritual Values."  Naturally, we separated, later on. My most important action  was on 10 October 1989. I celebrated a requiem for the Polish  priest Jerzy Popieluszko. Only a few people learned about it,  but if you can find the GAZETA WYBORCZA of those days, you can  see my picture with my hand raised in the victory sign, and  wearing clerical robes. On that occasion RFE and BBC made a big  fuss about me, which seems to have evoked President Zhelev's  jealousy.    [Krusteva] Do you feel insulted by the term "fascist?"    [Gelemenov] I am not impressed. I am not a racist, this is  a leftist doctrine that has no place in my ideology. I am a  Nazi, which means an extreme right nationalist, and this is the  exact meaning of the term Nazi. It is an updated, accessible  form, aimed at introducing law and order, and discipline in our  country, and guaranteeing employment for all Bulgarians, mainly  for Bulgarians.    [Krusteva] Father Gelemenov, is all this not in  contradiction to your religion?    [Gelemenov] No. Christ himself said: "I have not came to  bring peace on earth, but the sword." When he saw the tradesmen  who had turned the temple into a "change office," he chased them  away with a whip. Hence, it is sometimes necessary to turn the  other page of Christian religion, which is rather militant and  even aggressive. The Bulgarian people were converted by force,  as a matter of fact.    [Krusteva] However, God said: "You must love your neighbor."    [Gelemenov] I love him, but the Bulgarian is my neighbor.  The Gypsy and the Turk are not my brothers, they are my enemies.    [Krusteva] Nevertheless, the Bible preaches that one should  love one's enemies....    [Gelemenov] Let us rid this divine commandment from our  memory for a while, and turn to history instead. The priest  Gruyo Banski is one of my favorite historical figures, a man for  whom I have the greatest respect. I come from Banya Village,  Panaguyrishte area, myself, a matter of fact. That man, when he  used to take Turkish prisoners during the 19th century  liberation war, had a peculiar method of converting them to  Christianity, namely with bacon. Knowing that they could not  stand pork meat, he used to stuff their mouths with a piece of  bacon and tell them: "You were Hassan, from now on you shall be  called Ivan." In this context, I advocate a new national  rebirth process that would restore the Bulgarian names of Turks  and Gypsies who have adopted Arab names. I have already  contributed to such actions by sending a telegram to the  headmaster of the local school in Kayaloba, Kurdzhali area, who  dismissed the ethnic Bulgarian Ivan Stoychev and took over his  post. I wrote to him the following letter: "The national  rebirth process is under way, and your post should be  immediately assigned to an ethnic Bulgarian."    [Krusteva] But, this is a threat.    [Gelemenov] Let them get a little frightened, it is only to  our advantage. Let them be afraid of us, so as to remind them  that we are the indigenous residents of this country.    [Krusteva] Have you no respect whatsoever for an  individual's right to self-identification [as published]?    [Gelemenov] Whenever our national security is affected,  there can be no question of human rights. All important local  government functions in Bulgarian rural areas should be assigned  to Bulgarians.    [Krusteva] What about your participation in the  establishment of armed units under the "United Bulgarian  Soldiery" formation that we already reported?    [Gelemenov] I am a cofounder of the formation, but the idea  of establishing such militant units for the defense of  Bulgaria's honor and national pride belongs to Krum Kumanov,  chairman of the Bulgarian Fatherland Party. I had to  participate in the establishment of the organization, because my  ideas coincide with his. As long as the units we decided to  establish yesterday are still unarmed, they shall act within the  framework of the extreme rightwing "Vuzrazhdane" organization,  namely, they will use force whenever necessary, applying methods  of oriental martial art and other forms of physical assault. As  far as the armed units are concerned, Mr. Kumanov expressly  stated that we shall consult with the police forces and the  Army, so as not to get involved with the law, which might cause  us difficulties.    [Krusteva] The police do not seem very enthusiastic about  your initiative....Do you have a sufficient number of volunteers?    [Gelemenov] This is something you should ask Mr. Kumanov.  However, volunteers, ready to defend the Bulgarian citizens  against the crimes of gangsters and Gypsy elements who are  killing, raping, and robbing all over the place, and against  those who are trying to split our motherland, namely the ethnic  Turks, can be easily found. However, we should not lay the  emphasis on the weapons of such units. In the first place, they  should be regarded as people who evoke the respect of those who  encroach upon discipline, and as people who are trying to  introduce discipline in our country.

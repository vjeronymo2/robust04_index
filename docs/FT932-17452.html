			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament beats the budget deadline THE Japanese budget for fiscal 1993 was passed last night by parliament, beating the April 1 starting date for the first time in 22 years and allowing the government to focus on drafting a new stimulatory package, writes Robert Thomson. A 26.4 per cent year-on-year drop in construction orders during February highlighted the need for the new package, which the ruling Liberal Democratic party says will be more than the Y10,700bn (Pounds 61.5bn) package announced last year. However, the LDP may struggle to get approval for a package of that size from the Ministry of Finance, which has yet to comment on the spending proposals. Other ministries and LDP members are preparing shopping lists, but the recent scandals in the party have weakened its influence at the ministry. The construction industry is hoping for a generous package, as private orders for the 57 leading general contractors in February were down 36.3 per cent to Y992bn. Public orders slipped 1.6 per cent to Y540.4bn, the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors said yesterday. But housing starts in February were 6.3 per cent higher than a year before, according to the Ministry of Construction, which said the increase could be a sign that property prices would begin to rise soon. Starts of houses for rent rose 13.1 per cent and of owner-occupied houses by 5.3 per cent, although starts of houses for sale were down 3.8 per cent. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the LDP's policy research council and the head of an 'economic stimulation task force', said the new package would stimulate the housing construction market by earmarking funds for the rebuilding of public housing estates. He also has plans for airports, aid to the banking industry, assistance for small business and a new network of train lines.</p>

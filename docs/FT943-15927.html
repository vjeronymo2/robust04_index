			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / North Yemeni forces seize Aden suburbs: South faces defeat as civil war rivals are reported to be negotiating surrender terms Yemen's civil war foes were reported last night to be negotiating the surrender of the remaining southern strongholds in Aden, after northern troops yesterday seized two outlying suburbs. Surrender of Aden would mark defeat for the South Yemeni leaders' two-month battle to secede from the unified state forged with North Yemen four years ago. Southern officials told Reuter's news agency the negotiations could lead to an agreement for southern leaders to flee or to stay on with unspecified guarantees. Officials in Sanaa, the North Yemen capital, confirmed there were direct contacts between north and south. After several days of fierce fighting, forces loyal to the Sanaa government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh have now secured the south's second city of Mukallah and its al-Rayan airport, which had been critical to the southern air force. They also seized the south's sole oil producing operations at Masilah, east of Aden. Witnesses quoted by news agencies in Aden said northern troops had captured the heavily populated suburbs of Sheikh Othman and Mansoura, 8km north of the rocky peninsula which houses the beleaguered port and city centre. Residents said dozens of people were killed or wounded. But as soon as fighting stopped, northern trucks distributed water, fruit juice and food to the hungry and parched people of the suburbs. The northerners let southern troops go free after seizing weapons and army vehicles, the residents said. South Yemeni leader Ali Salem al-Baidh was reported to have fled Mukallah, probably for the isolated desert area between the city and the Omani border. The self-declared South Yemeni government yesterday lost any hope of immediate formal recognition by its neighbours. A meeting of the Gulf-Co-operation Council, as well as Egypt and Syria, called for a ceasefire but shied from supporting southern secession. Arab League officials are due to fly to Sanaa today to urge enforcement of UN ceasefire resolutions, but diplomats said they thought President Saleh was determined to see the war through to victory. The International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva said humanitarian conditions in Aden continued to worsen, and fighting was so intense local Red Cross workers had been unable to repair damaged water wells, vital to the city of 450,000 now more than three weeks without fresh water. An official said two Red Cross-supplied vessels off Aden remained offshore, unable to dock and unload medical and sanitation equipment for want of security guarantees. He said hospitals were overcrowded in Aden, Mukallah and Taiz. Canadian Occidental said its Masilah operation - which produces 160,000 barrels a day - had resumed pumping after a brief overnight closure between Monday and Tuesday 'to test our shutdown mechanisms' and production continued 'without any problem at all'. The company said the Masilah area had come under northern control in the past two days. Diplomats in Sanaa were also quoted by Reuter as saying output was back on stream from the north's main Marib oilfield, which Yemeni officials said at the weekend had been halted by a southern air raid last week. The Dallas headquarters of Hunt Oil, which operates the 190,000 b/d operation, refused to comment.</p>

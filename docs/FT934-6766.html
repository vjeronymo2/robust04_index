			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Varity doubles net earnings to Dollars 22m Shares in Varity, the US automotive, farm and industrial machinery group, advanced yesterday after it said earnings more than doubled in the third quarter. For the three months to the end of October, the group posted net income of Dollars 22.2m, or 49 cents a share on a fully-diluted basis. It beat analysts' forecast of about 40 cents. In the comparable period of 1992, earnings were Dollars 10.5m, or 23 cents a share. After the announcement, the stock added Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The advance partly reflected Varity's moves to concentrate on core manufacturing businesses. As a result, revenues were lower at Dollars 692m, against Dollars 844m a year ago. However, the decline was attributable to several disposals last year. When adjusted to exclude discontinued operations, sales in the 1992 quarter were Dollars 656m. The restructuring, together with a series of stock moves, helped the company slash interest expense to Dollars 8m, from Dollars 35.3m in the year-earlier period. All three of Varity's main operating groups - Kelsey-Hayes, an automotive parts supplier; Perkins, a diesel-engine manufacturer; and the Massey-Ferguson farm-equipment division - contributed to a 23 per cent jump in operating income. The performance by Kelsey-Hayes, the world's largest producer of anti-lock braking systems, was particularly encouraging. Sales were up 14.3 per cent to Dollars 297m, suggesting a growing acceptance of such braking systems among car manufacturers. In the first nine months, Varity posted a net loss of Dollars 98.5, or Dollars 3.17 a share. With the effects of accounting changes and early debt retirement excluded, net income was Dollars 49.3m, or Dollars 1.13, on a fully-diluted basis.</p>

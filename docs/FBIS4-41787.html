			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 23/06/1994 -- "I consider the  agreement of economic and commercial cooperation between the  self-proclaimed Dniester Republic and the Russian Federation's  Novocherkask region as a bilateral relation between regions of  two independent states," declared to BASA Alexandru Buruian,  Moldovan vice-minister of foreign affairs. This agreement was  signed in Tiraspol ten days ago and stipulates the creation of  joint-ventures, raw-materials supplies, creation of  corresponding accounts between the State Bank of Dniester and  the Regional Bank of Novocherkask, free movement of transport on  the territories of both parties. Buruian stressed that, despite  the fact that the document's text is based on the notion of a  "Moldovan Dniester Republic," the Moldovan Department of Foreign  Relations will not protest to the Russian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, because it does not consider that the economic  relations between regions are managed by the Moscow Diplomatic  Department. Despite all, Buruian doubted the legality of the  relations between the official Russian banks and the Tiraspol  bank, unauthorized by Chisinau. Commenting on the agreement's  article on joint criminal persecution, Buruian stressed that  this point also violates Moldovan and Russian laws. "Besides,  taking into consideration recent sad events, this point of the  agreement could stimulate Russian military formations to enter  Dniester," declared Alexandru Buruian. Sources from the  Moldovan Department of Foreign Economic Relations stated to BASA  that Tiraspol representatives did not consult experts from  Chisinau before signing the agreement with Novocherkask.</p>

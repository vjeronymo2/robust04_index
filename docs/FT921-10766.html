			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Safeway tumbles to Dollars 54.9m after charges SAFEWAY, the California supermarket chain which was subject to a Dollars 4.2bn leveraged buy-out bid in 1986, yesterday reported a fall in profits last year to Dollars 54.9m after a series of special items cost the company Dollars 78.2m. Last year, the group made a profit of Dollars 87.1m The most significant of these was Dollars 71m reserve, taken because of liabilities related to its former Houston division. Safeway sold this operation to AppleTree Markets, which last month filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The Californian company had assigned certain leases to AppleTree but may be liable if AppleTree fails to make rental payments on these. Safeway also saw a Dollars 24.1m extraordinary loss from the early retirement of certain debt, partly offset by a Dollars 16.9m gain taken following the sale of shares by Vons Companies, another supermarket group in which Safeway has a 35 per cent stake. Safeway neither bought nor sold shares during the offering. However, even at the operating profit level and with the AppleTree charge added back, Safeway made Dollars 548.3m in 1991, only modestly increased from the Dollars 535.3m seen in 1990. Sales for the year were Dollars 15.1bn, up by 1.7 per cent on 1990, but same-store sales were virtually flat, and actually declined by 1.2 per cent in the final quarter. Mr Peter Magowan, chairman, said the recession had 'run deeper and longer than most experts forecast' and that it had been increasingly difficult to generate sales growth. The company, which operates 1,100 stores and counts as one of the largest food retailers in the US and Canada, spent Dollars 635m on capital expenditure during the year, opening 32 new stores and completing 77 remodels. Net earnings were helped by a fall in the interest charge, from Dollars 384.1m to Dollars 355.4m.</p>

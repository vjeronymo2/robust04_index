			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SONY'S 'PALMTOP' COMPUTER GETS ITS DATA IN HANDWRITING  </P> <P> Sony Corp. said Wednesday that it would begin marketing in April a computer  that it calls a "palmtop" that can recognize more than 3,500 handwritten  characters.  </P> <P> The machine is 8 inches wide, 6.2 inches deep and 1.8 inches high, and weighs  2.8 pounds.  </P> <P> It will retail for $1,320 (198,000 yen).  </P> <P> Like a laptop, the palmtop computer flips open. It has a screen on the lower  portion that a user writes on with a special pen. The computer then deciphers  the letters, partly with the use of fuzzy logic, a system adept at interpreting  imprecise data.  </P> <P> The product, unveiled late last year, is the latest to use  handwriting-recognition technology instead of a keyboard or mouse.  </P> <P> "We're targeting it at busy businessmen in their 20s and 30s who need a  portable mode of data entry," a Sony spokesman said.  </P> <P> The computer includes a software system that provides a word processor,  personal organizer and graphics capability.  </P> <P> Canon Inc., Tandy Corp. and other firms introduced similar models last year.  </P> <P> But Sony's palmtop, much smaller than rivals' "notebook computers" and more  powerful, can decipher handwritten Chinese characters, Roman letters and Arabic  numerals, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> The palmtop is capable of storing 110 pages of Japanese text and has a built-in  microphone and speaker to record and play up to eight seconds of sound.  </P> <P> An optional adapter will allow two-way communication of data through a  facsimile machine.  </P> <P> Additional software systems for salesman and the insurance industry are being  prepared, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Until new software is written, sales of the palmtop computer will be limited to  Japan.  </P></p>

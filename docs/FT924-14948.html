			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Former Maxwell director charged MR ROBERT BUNN, a former finance director of Robert Maxwell's group of private companies, yesterday became the fourth man to be arrested and charged with fraud following the Serious Fraud Office investigation into the collapse of the late publisher's business empire. Mr Bunn was arrested by City of London police yesterday morning and charged with a single count of conspiracy to defraud. He was released on police bail to face City of London magistrates on December 1. He will appear with Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell, and Mr Larry Trachtenberg - a financial adviser to Robert Maxwell - who jointly face 15 counts of theft and conspiracy to defraud involving Pounds 135m. The full charge against Mr Bunn is that between November 1 1990 and December 31 1991 he conspired with others to defraud a syndicate of 35 banks led by Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Lyonnais by knowingly and dishonestly being a party to the pledging of common stock in Berlitz International Inc by way of security for loans to third parties in breach of terms of a loan agree ment dated October 23 1989 between the syndicate and Maxwell Communication Corporation. Unlike the June arrests of the two Maxwell brothers and Mr Trachtenberg  - when police raided the men's homes early in the morning amid a blaze of publicity - Mr Bunn's arrest, at Snow Hill police station in the City, was low-key. After his arrest, Mr Bunn, who lives in the City, declined to comment. 'Mr Bunn will have no comment to make before his trial,' said his solicitor, Mr Jeffrey Bayes of Burton Copefield. Mr Bunn, who was finance director of Maxwell Communication Corporation, was also a director of Bishopsgate Investment management until September 1990. In May last year he was appointed to the board of London and Bishopsgate International Investment. Mr Kevin Maxwell yesterday failed in his second High Court attempt to win a judicial review of the Serious Fraud Office's refusal to disclose documentary evidence of the case against him. Mr Maxwell, who faces charges of theft and conspiracy to defraud, had claimed the SFO was acting unlawfully and unfairly in not disclosing such evidence before questioning him under powers which remove the right to silence.</p>

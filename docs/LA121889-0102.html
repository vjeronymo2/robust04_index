			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> SCROOGED: When your employer pleads poverty in explaining why there's no  company Christmas party this year, you might point out that even the IRS  disapproves of such Grinch-like behavior. . . . The cost of an office party is  fully tax-deductible, points out Ronald R. Williamson (D6), managing partner of  the accounting firm BDO Seidman's Orange County office. . . . Holiday  festivities are thus exempt from the normal 80% limit on write-offs for  business-related entertainment expenses. Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

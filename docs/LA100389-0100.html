			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MANUFACTURING SLOWS, EXPORTS RISE, SURVEY FINDS  </P> <P> The U.S. economy's manufacturing sector remained weak in September, although  orders for exports increased sharply despite a stronger dollar, the nation's  corporate purchasing managers said Monday.  </P> <P> The purchasing managers index, a widely watched barometer of the economy's  direction, rose to 46% from 45.2% in August and matched the rate for July.  </P> <P> A reading below 50% indicates that the manufacturing sector of the economy is  in decline while a reading above 50% indicates growth, according to the  National Assn. of Purchasing Management.  </P> <P> Survey responses indicated that new export orders rose during the month while  prices continued falling, and production, employment, new orders and  inventories all declined.  </P> <P> The mixed picture painted by the managers left economists divided in their  opinions about where U.S. manufacturing is headed in coming months.  </P> <P> "This is a report that is filled with crosscurrents. It doesn't have a  black-and-white picture that the economy is doing great," said Allen Sinai,  economist with Boston Co. and Economic Advisers Inc.  </P> <P> The monthly report is based on a survey of purchasing executives in more than  250 industrial companies. The index is a composite of five separate indicators,  including new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and  employment.  </P> <P> The September overall index represented only a slight upturn from the August  reading, which had been the lowest for the index since December, 1982, although  the overall index averaged 49.5% for the first three quarters of 1989.  </P> <P> "Past experience indicates that if this average were to continue for the final  quarter, it would be consistent with real GNP growth of about 1.7% for all of  1989," said Robert J. Bretz, survey chairman.  </P> <P> But Bretz also said the index would have to fall below 44% to show economic  contraction for the year.  </P> <P> A sharp increase in export orders came despite the strength in the U.S. dollar  during September. Some 60.5% of those surveyed reported that their volume of  new export orders rose during the month, compared to 56% in August. It was the  highest level since April when the new export order index was 62%.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HISTORY PROJECT' EXAMINES LOS ANGELES' TENSE PAST;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: SEGMENTS ON THE HOLLYWOOD STRIKES AND AIMEE SEMPLE MCPHERSON HELP  PBS SERIES ILLUMINATE THE PRESENT.  </P> <P> In the 1940s, Hollywood's glamorous movie industry suffered through more than a  year of violent strikes that laid the foundation for the witch hunts of the  McCarthy era, and for then-actor Ronald Reagan's conservative ideology and  political future.  </P> <P> In the 1930s, Los Angeles' original Chinatown was leveled to make room for  Union Station, forcing the immigrant residents of that persecuted community to  move and, without any compensation, start all over again.  </P> <P> You can live your whole life in Los Angeles without any awareness of the city's  rich and not-always-pretty history. KCET Channel 28's "Los Angeles History  Project," which begins its third season Sunday at 8 p.m. with a documentary  about the Hollywood strikes of 1945-46, attempts to remedy that for natives and  transplants alike.  </P> <P> "I remember I went to the head of a major foundation to ask for funding for the  project, and he asked, 'Is there anything interesting in the history of Los  Angeles?' " recalled Stephen Kulczycki, KCET's station manager. "And I hung  onto that for a long time. This is a city that invented itself out of nothing.  There is no reason for it to be here. No river, no port. Everything is self  made, and there are so many fascinating stories about the struggles and  disappointments and triumphs of the people who created this community."  </P> <P> In addition to "Hollywood Strike," this season's four stories include  documentaries on the life of famed Los Angeles evangelist Aimee Semple  McPherson; the city's two Chinatowns as seen through the eyes of three men who  helped build them; and the turn-of-the-century battle over where to build Los  Angeles Harbor.  </P> <P> "We try to pick stories that cover a span of time," said Arthur Barron, the  series producer for the last two years. "In the current series, you have an old  story in 'Harbor Wars' and a fairly modern story in 'Strike.' We try to show  history not so much as seen from the outside, but how history has been  experienced by ordinary people. We try to see if there is a way of  personalizing these stories, of making them interesting and human, rather than  dry textbook facts and dates."  </P> <P> Barron said that he looks for stories, such as the strikes and the battle over  the harbor, that are not well known. When the topic is familiar, such as  "Sister Aimee," he tries to tackle it in a new way.  </P> <P> "Most treatments of her had focused on the sexual scandal," Barron said. "We  tried to show what her genuine contribution was to Los Angeles, her  compassionate side, a woman who gave lonely immigrants to the city a sense of  identity, a balm for their alienation."  </P> <P> The series also attempts to reflect the city's ethnic diversity. Last season  offered documentaries on the black and Latino experiences in Los Angeles. This  season examines the rough and difficult road traveled by the city's Chinese  immigrants.  </P> <P> Perhaps the series' most compelling trait is that its stories are told through  the use of rarely seen archival photographs, films and newsreels that bring the  period to life. "Sister Aimee" includes 1920s home movies of the evangelist  preaching to thousands in her magnificent Angelus Temple. The Chinatown program  shows an old newsreel in which the narrator, over images of Chinese  schoolchildren undergoing medical checkups, reveals the rampant bigotry the  Chinese faced by casually referring to the children as "the future crop of  laundrymen."  </P> <P> "Hollywood Strike" features old footage of the strike and its violence. It also  juxtaposes a vintage Disney cartoon that depicts a strike orchestrated by a  bunch of overworked chickens with Walt Disney's own efforts to break the  cartoonists' union.  </P> <P> "We dig around with a pickax to find things," said Barron, who sends his staff  searching through the National Archives in Washington, D.C., public and private  libraries and the personal memorabilia of cooperative private citizens. "The  glory of this series is that we turn up so much that has never been seen."  </P> <P> Sunday's show strips the glitter off the movie industry, portraying the gritty  reality of the struggle for power between the blue-collar craft workers and the  moguls who ran the studios. It illustrates how organized crime infiltrated the  union and worked in conjunction with the studios to keep pay scales low. It  shows how "Commie-bashing" became a common tool in squashing rival unions and  labor sympathizers, and it focuses on Reagan's transformation from a "New Deal  Democrat" into an FBI informant and staunch conservative.  </P> <P> "One of the important things to be learned from this, I think, is that there is  really nothing about the glamour and tinsel of Hollywood that makes the  churning out of pictures any different than the churning out of refrigerators  or anything else," Barron said.  </P> <P> Such lessons, however, do not come cheap. Kulczycki said that producing the  four documentaries that will air over the next four Sundays cost close to $1  million, much of that covered by donations from various foundations and the Los  Angeles Cultural Affairs Department. But, Kulczycki said, a good deal of the  cost must be absorbed against KCET's own operating budget. At present, the  station does not have the money to continue the series.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying it's over," Kulczycki said. "We will continue to try to find  ways to do it, even if that means making them one at a time" -- on an  occasional basis.  </P> <P> Barron, who is currently producing a "reality-based" series set in New York's  Bellevue Hospital for ABC, said that it would be a shame if the series died  now. In such a sprawling community embracing so many styles, ethnic groups and  cultural enclaves, learning of their city's past, he believes, can be a  unifying experience.  </P> <P> "I think the series helps the audience to have a sense of connectedness to  their past," Barron said. "It serves as an antidote to an age of anxiety and  rootlessness by revealing and remembering the values that once sustained us. It  helps us to discover the other cultures, our neighbors, and that we all do  share a common heritage. That's something to be proud of."  </P></p>

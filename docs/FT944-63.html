			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Travel: To Jericho by bicycle - War and Peace (Travelling in Troublespots) Ibrahim Jadallah was insistent that we would be perfectly safe in Jericho. But, as the Director of Tourism, he wanted to be absolutely certain and so we were provided with a combined Israeli and Palestinian Authority armed escort. We streamed proudly into the previously occupied West Bank town, flanked by Israeli jeeps flying orange flags and saloon cars with curtained windows containing moustachioed men toting AK47s. We were VIPs on bicycles. In reality we were participants in a 250-mile sponsored cycle ride on behalf of the British Heart Foundation. But ours was a trail-blazing event, just 21 pioneers in advance of three much bigger rides to be held in April 1995. We were a mixed bunch, ranging in age from early 20s to mid 60s, all interested in visiting Israel at a time of great change and enormous optimism. Our journey took us from Hagoshrim along a 'J' shaped route through the Jordan valley to the Dead Sea and then up to Jerusalem. Each day the cycling was different. We pedalled through orchards of grapefruit and avocado, down fertile valleys, through small farms growing salad crops in the Occupied Territories, across deserts, beside glittering lakes and under shady trees. Sometimes we biked on main roads and at others on rough farm tracks. We cycled close to the heavily fenced Jordanian border along a road lined with minefields and barbed wire and with occasional signs of past engagements. Our intention to ride along a track parallel to the fence itself was thwarted by a remote Israeli officer, even though permission had already been granted. But the Israeli soldiers, who had waylaid us in their machine gun carrier, were relaxed and jovial as the organisers strove by radio to reach agreement with their headquarters. With the general air of optimism in the country, they had no qualms about passing over a flak jacket and gun for a fellow cyclist to pose for photographs. After all, the peace agreement with Jordan had just been signed and almost overnight a new road and checkpoint had been built at the border. Reaching an agreement with the cyclists proved less easy, however, and after an hour's negotiation, the soldiers were instructed to lead us away from the border along a tortuous route, using field tracks, to the main road. We found Jericho a green oasis after the desert, the latest of a series of 23 cities which have been built on the same site over the millennia. It claims to be the oldest permanently inhabited spot in the world, the place where man first gave up being a hunter-gatherer to become a farmer. Our route was littered with such gems, places made familiar by memories of religious education and Sunday school. We passed through the valley where David slew Goliath, cycled under the desiccated hill where Jesus spent 40 days and 40 nights in the wilderness and enjoyed a whole day in Jerusalem. We even stayed overnight in the lowest place in the world, a kibbutz built 1,200ft below sea level, where we learnt how the Dead Sea scrolls were discovered, hidden in large jars and concealed in caves which we cycled past on the following day. It was to be a day of desert storms, strictly meteorological of course, which hit us on our way to Massada. A brooding blue-black bruise hung over the Dead Sea as we set out after lunch on this empty section, 12 miles of exposed road snaking off into the distance. The wind came from the side, picking up stinging sand, buckling palm trees and hurling tumble weed across the tarmac. It was quickly followed by rain, hail and lightning causing flood water to flow across the road in brown rivers. Shortly before Massada we were turned back by floods and we had to make a rapid retreat by vehicle before the waters closed in behind us too. It all seemed terribly biblical. At a time when the National Lottery threatens to soak up the benevolent intentions of the British people, charities such as the British Heart Foundation are having to think of new ways to garner funds. The lure of the Israel Experience, a trip to the Holy Land with a 250-mile sponsored cycle ride included, is just one of these. In order to take part in the Israel Experience, every one of the participants paid an initial Pounds 175 registration fee, and undertook to raise a minimum of Pounds 1,500 through sponsorship, of which at least Pounds 1,000 goes to the British Heart Foundation Angina Research Appeal. Some, such as Sarah, a non-clinical research scientist, and medical students, Karen and Ingrid, were motivated by their interest in medicine. Others had relatives who had experienced heart disease including Robert, whose father had suffered from angina since his late 30s and who underwent extensive heart surgery in his 50s. Still others, such as Adam, a film student, just fancied going to Israel and wanted to support a good cause at the same time. And one, Tony, had even suffered a heart attack just a week before retiring from his marketing job with a pharmaceuticals company six months before. At that time he could hardly have imagined that less than half a year later he would be cycling into Jericho with a Palestinian Authority escort, still less that he would be crossing the desert with rain lashing his face and lightning searing the clouds in front. In retrospect, in an increasingly peaceful Israel, I suspect the desert storms were the more dangerous of the two. Michael Woods flew with El Al and the ride, including accommodation, transport and the bikes themselves, was organised by Classic Tours. Three further Israel Experiences will take place in April 1995 - to find out how to take part, freephone the British Heart Foundation on 0500-200 575.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Refuting `Japan Nuclear Armament Argument'"] </F>   [Text] The "Japan nuclear armament argument" is creating a  clamor. The clamor is coming mostly from the United States. The  Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (North Korea's)  suspected nuclear development is being discussed in relation to  Japan's nuclear development also.    In a recent issue of the U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS magazine, Lee  Kuan Yew, senior minister of Singapore, stated that "if Japan  decided on nuclear armament, it would be impossible to overturn  their decision. The United States cannot even stop North Korea's  action."    The end of last January, a British newspaper reported with  heavy headlines the possibility of Japan developing nuclear  weapons, as coming from a secret document of the British Defense  Ministry. The report was highly questionable. However, the U.S.  reacted immediately. Defense Secretary Perry testified in the  Congress that "if Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan judged that  North Korea was armed with nuclear weapons, it would be possible  that they each would move to possess nuclear weapons." Senator  Nunn, chairman of the Senate's military committee, also stated  that "Japan possesses the ability and technology (to develop  nuclear weapons), as well as plutonium." These statements  accidentally proved what the United States is fearing the most,  that is... North Korea's possession of nuclear bomb, East Asia  becoming unstable, Japan's nuclear development becoming  justified, Japan's becoming a militaristic giant.    Why is Japan's nuclear armament so often discussed in the  United States? One reason is because of the strategic necessity  of the U.S. hardliners (hawks), so that they may justify the  U.S. militaristic presence in Asia, with the excuse to keep an  eye on Japan. The other reason is because the Japanese  Government has not given a counterargument against it.    There are four possible stages in nuclear armament. Stage 1  is to possess several atomic bombs. Stage 2 is to possess  several hundred tactical nuclear bombs. Stage 3 is to be  equipped with strategic nuclear weapons in addition to the first  two. Stage 4 is to possess a nuclear strategy system equivalent  to what the United States has.    First, we will discuss stage 1. There remains a technical  problem. However, suppose the problem were cleared. Where would  we perform a test? Consider India's example. Although they did  the test in the middle of a dessert, they were troubled with the  residue of plutonium for a long time after that. It would not be  possible to test domestically.    Moreover, the international political reaction would be  great. The United States would stop exporting uranium fuel and  technology to Japan, and they would also demand the already  exported uranium back. Japan would be forced to cut down energy  demand (consumption), and the Japanese economy would result in  great confusion. Trade restrictions by the United States and  neighboring countries would be inevitable. However, just  possessing several atomic bombs would not do much for defense of  Japan, unless Japan were prepared to commit suicide.    Stage 2 could be reached within 10 years, if unrealistic  conditions, such as that Japan can borrow a place for testing  from another country, and that uranium can be obtained  abundantly, are met. However, this plan is fragile in terms of  security, and would be the worst choice. Stage 3 may be achieved  in 10 to 20 years, if public opinion concerning constitutional  reform is unified, and if the people are prepared for a life of  endurance. However, by then the military technology possessed by  some countries, such as the United States, would be more  advanced, and Japanese nuclear strategy would be out of date.  Stage 4 is out of the question.    Japan has influence in its own way, by sticking to being a  non-nuclear power nation, while being a potential nuclear power  nation. However, once it performs a nuclear test, Japan would  become nothing more than the smallest and the weakest country  among the nuclear powers.    Japanese people fully recognize that showing leadership in  nuclear disarmament as a nation, which has suffered from atomic  bombing, is the very purpose of Japan. Our government should let  the world know more aggressively that Japan's nuclear armament  is out of the bounds of possibility realistically as well as  ideally.</p>

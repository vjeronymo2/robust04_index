			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NEEDS OF PEOPLE ALREADY HERE  </P> <P> Instead of just listening to the proponents' tune that the Measure A sales tax  is a necessity, think about some alternatives. Think about needs that are not  being met in our neighborhoods and cities.  </P> <P> Think about the need for adequate child care in thousands of families every  day. Think about the need for adequate advance training to help high school  graduates enter the work force. Think about preservation of open space so that  Ventura County doesn't become wall-to-wall houses as is typical of the San  Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Before giving a half-billion dollars to pay for road improvements that will  open new land for development and help make certain landowners rich, think  instead about the needs of our families and neighbors. Then ask: Couldn't the  same money be better spent on meeting the health, education and environmental  quality needs of people who are already here?  </P> <P> ANDY PROKOPOW  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

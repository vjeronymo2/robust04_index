			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Finance minister pledges continued support for punt MR Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, denied yesterday the outgoing government planned to abandon its defence of the punt and said it would be up to the new administration to review its exchange rate policy. A new Fianna Fail-Labour coalition is expected to be formed next week. The minister said on Irish radio that the present government had 'unequivocally and consistently supported the existing parity of the Irish pound and has done so simply because it is the best policy for the long-term benefit of the Irish economy. I have. . . argued that since the Maastricht treaty was defeated in the Danish referendum on June 2.' Mr Ahern said he could not pre-empt or speak on behalf of the incoming government. This would be 'entirely wrong'. He stressed: 'I have no reason at this time to believe that the new government, if it is Fianna Fail and the Labour party, would change that policy.' He added that a report in the Financial Times on Tuesday had 'grossly misinterpreted' statements made by him on Monday evening in which he said: 'I said I was prepared to hold the line until the end of the year. That has now passed. If the system does not correct itself. . . the pressures on industry are something that cannot be lived with indefinitely'. He had emphasised his continued opposition to a unilateral devaluation, but added this was an issue 'the new government will have to look at very early on'. Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, told parliament on Monday he hoped to be in a position to form a new coalition government by early next week 'if budgetary matters can be agreed'. His Fianna Fail party and Labour have been negotiating terms for forming a coalition since the November 25 general election, in which no party won an overall majority.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (13): Pockets of hope sought - The textile sector's problems Pakistan's large textile industry is reeling under the pressure of more than two years of losses suffered by most of the country's spinning units. As a result, many textile industrialists are convinced that they will not be able to recover, unless bailed out by the government. 'The industry is heading towards collapse,' complains Mr Riaz Tata, chairman of the All Pakistan Textile Manufacturers Association, (APTMA) the national association of the textile industry. The spinning sector has been hit hardest by the crisis. According to Mr Tata, up to 30 per cent of the country's 8.3m spindles have been forced to stop production. Some officials estimate that up to 90 per cent of the largest 446 spinning units have defaulted on bank loans. Once again this year, the extent of the problem will be determined by the cotton crop, which the government hopes will reach its estimated 9.5m bales, as opposed to newspaper forecasts of a possible shortfall of at least 1m bales. After crop failures for two years in a row, Pakistan's textile sector can ill afford another year of failure which would only lead to higher raw material prices. Despite such concerns, the government is convinced that recent agreements with the European Union and the US to increase the quotas for Pakistan's textiles would help to improve exports. That could be crucial for the country's trade balance as it relies for up to 60 per cent of its export earnings on cotton-related products. At the same time, Islamabad has agreed to open up its domestic market to garment imports as part of the government's commitment to reduce tariffs to an average 35 per cent by July 1996, from more than 75 per cent. 'The sky is the limit. It now depends on the industry,' says Mr Ahmed Mukhtar, the commerce minister, who has been urging businesses to become more competitive in response to the new opportunities. Senior officials at the commerce ministry are convinced that improvements in the quality of T-shirts and fabrics during the past few years will help the country's exports, and create new pockets of hope for the textile sector. The ministry is urging exporters to enter into joint ventures with established foreign enterprises in quality garments, so that they can have a stronger edge over their international competitors. 'A shirt costing the equivalent of USDollars 8 in Pakistan can fetch at least twice that price in retail on Oxford Street in London. We have to become aggressive enough to be able to force our way ahead,' says one official. Some exporters take the cue from such encouragement and say that they are prepared to meet the challenge. 'There are countries that don't have cotton of their own, and they are competitive and surviving,' says Sheikh Mohammad Obaid, Pakistan's largest exporter of towels and bed-linen. Mr Obaid discounts fears over the effects of the cotton losses and expects the new quotas to generate increasedbusiness. He now wants to see a greater push towards manufacture of quality garments so that textile exports generate more revenue. However, Mr Tata is convinced that the textile sector will need to improve its own performance after years of neglect. He believes the government should immediately privatise the large public sector banks, so that the money which is wasted in the large administrative costs for running over-staffed and inefficient banks could instead be used to give more credit to businesses. Other industrialists are also urging the government to introduce stringent regulations for grading of cotton and improved quality of ginning, so that the textile business can prepare itself to produce internationally recognised products. 'The quality of ginning is not up to international standards,' concedes Mr Mukhtar. Senior officials say that the government has begun to look at these problems with a view to introducing a new system of selecting quality cotton before it is processed. Despite the country's ambitious targets, especially after the recent quota increases, some industrialists are convinced that a solution to the spinning crisis holds one of the most important keys to long-term growth prospects. In an effort to stimulate growth in all sectors of the economy including textiles, the maximum bank lending rate has been lowered from 19 per cent to 17.5 per cent this month. The government has also waived interest payments on loans given by the public sector banks since 1992 to help the textile sector repay its debts. However, it may be some time before any signs of recovery become evident.</p>

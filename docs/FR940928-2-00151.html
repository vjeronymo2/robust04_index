In the alternative, it petitioned NHTSA to grant the company a temporary exemption from the side impact standard's new performance requirements until September 1, 1996. On August 5, 1994, NHTSA denied Lamborghini's request to be included in Chrysler's fleet because Chrysler had sold its interest in Lamborghini on January 31, 1994, to a group of investors led by MegaTech Ltd., a Bermuda corporation. At the same time, NHTSA informed Lamborghini that it would proceed to consider the question of temporary exemption. Lamborghini supplemented its application on August 22, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lamborghini has manufactured only 1,475 motor vehicles over the past five years, approximately 25% of which have been sold in the United States. Denial of its petition would therefore mean loss of the important U.S. market until compliance could be achieved, an estimated 250 sales of 670 produced between January 1, 1995 and August 31, 1996. The applicant had operating losses in 1993 of approximately $5,000,000, and in 1992 of approximately $28,000,000. For 1991 it had an operating profit of almost $5,000,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While it was owned by Chrysler, Lamborghini vehicles were scheduled to be modified during the last year of the phase-in period which ends with vehicles produced on August 31, 1996, because of the low number of vehicles produced and the lead time necessary for engineering and tooling modifications. Chrysler's sale of Lamborghini, therefore, has placed the applicant in a difficult position since, before the sale, ``Lamborghini had a good faith basis for believing that it would not need to meet the requirements of Standard 214 until the production year beginning September 1, 1996 *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Lamborghini was left without sufficient lead time to comply 100% of its production by either September 1, 1994 or September 1, 1995, and, since it produces only a single model, cannot avail itself of the phase-in requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, it has begun the preliminary work required to effect compliance in production vehicles manufactured beginning July 1996. During that time, it estimates that it will spend between $500,000 and $900,000 on research, development, and tooling changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lamborghini argues that an exemption would be in the public interest and consistent with the objectives of motor vehicle safety because it is ``one of the last small, pioneering and independent automobile manufacturers *&blank;*&blank;* precisely the type of small manufacturer that the *&blank;*&blank;* temporary exemption authority is intended to assist.'' Its vehicles ``are used predominantly for shorter pleasure, rather than commuting or longer, trips'' so that an exemption ``would have an imperceptible impact on motor vehicle safety.'' It points out that the livelihoods of its workers in U.S. distributorships and dealerships would be affected by a denial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the application described above. Comments should refer to the docket number and the notice number, and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590.

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: OFT approves revision of Allied beer deal ALLIED-LYONS has secured approval from the Office of Fair Trading for a revised beer supply agreement with Pubmaster, the Brent Walker retail arm. The original seven year supply contract, agreed in November last year, has been reduced to three years; the minimum amount of beer that Pubmaster is obliged to buy has been cut by about half to 100,000 barrels a year. As a result of the revision, Sir Bryan Carsberg, the OFT's director general, confirmed that the 734 pubs which Allied has leased to Pubmaster would be considered free of tied beer supplies. Because the original agreement required Pubmaster to buy half its beer from Allied, the OFT had previously refused to include the leased pubs among the 2,380 outlets which Allied has to free from the tie to meet the requirements of the government's beer orders. Pubmaster will now be obliged to take no more than a quarter of its beer supplies from Allied, but with Allied's Tetley ale and Castlemaine lager being made available throughout Pubmaster's 1,983 pubs, it is expected to continue to buy well in excess of that amount. Both Allied and Pubmaster may terminate the new agreement by giving nine months' notice any time after Sep-tember 30 1995. If Allied ends the agreement, however, Pubmaster has an option to revert to the terms of the original supply agreement until 2002. Mr Roy Moss, chairman of Allied's brewing division, said yesterday: 'We are pleased to have settled matters with the OFT and we are confident that the deal will enable both parties to continue to operate effectively in the changing market place.' Mr John Brackenbury, chairman of Pubmaster, welcomed the deal as ' an important precedent for the beer industry.' He added:' We wanted a supply agreement with Allied as part of our commitment to extending consumer choice. We are taking a wide range of ales and lagers from a cross-section of national and regional suppliers.'</p>

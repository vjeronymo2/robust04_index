			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Leaders put faith in gaining voters' trust - This Week's Campaign MR JOHN MAJOR climbed on to his soapbox, Mr Neil Kinnock into his Daimler and Mr Paddy Ashdown stood on a self-made pedestal. The voters said they had not made up their minds. If there was a single lesson to be drawn from the final full week of the campaign it was that the outcome depends still on where the electorate strikes the balance between fear and resentment. For the moment, resentment of the Conservatives' economic record has an edge over fear of Labour's socialist past. Mr Kinnock travels the country in the style of a prime minister. Still a man of the people, but one who has earned the right to a black limousine and police outriders by rescuing his party from extremist oblivion. Labour's image-makers - the best by far in the business - have sculpted his front-bench team into a cabinet-in-waiting. Mr John Smith has the manner of a man who became chancellor some time ago and is waiting only for the voters to rubber-stamp his reappointment. In Mr Kinnock's entourage there is confidence that the Conservatives are beaten; but less certainty that he will lead a majority government on April 10. The Labour leader has told senior colleagues that there can be no fumbles during the last few days. They want him to rein in his frequently careless exuberance. He is cheered by two things. The message of the opinion polls - public and private - is that the voters' preoccupations are Labour's issues. Unemployment, health, education and the poll tax top the list of concerns. Tax, defence, trades unions and law and order - the issues at the heart of Mr Major's campaign - strike fewer chords in a recession. More important, Mr Kinnock's advisers insist that all the evidence suggests that their support has stayed firmly on the right side of 40 per cent through the campaign. They calculate that the same figure on April 9 would put Mr Kinnock in Downing Street, even if it did not give him an overall majority. Labour's glitzy campaign - jolted last week by the row over its controversial health broadcast - is now back into a steady stride. Its themes are self-reinforcing. After 13 years, there can be no more excuses for the recession, the poll tax or the run-down of the welfare state. Labour's alternative is sober, responsible and modern. The voters will get what they see - the tax changes set out in last month's shadow Budget and the programme outlined in yesterday's draft of Mr Kinnock's first Queen's Speech. The Labour leader has been careful to stress he is not seeking unfettered power.  His conciliatory language this week on electoral reform was aimed at voters in the centre ground rather than Mr Ashdown. Together, those threads create what remains the campaign's most potent slogan: 'It's time for change'. Mr Major has not given up. The crop of opinion polls earlier this week showing a decisive Labour lead created near-panic in Central Office. At least one cabinet minister was ready to speculate on whether Mr Michael Heseltine or Mr Kenneth Clarke would succeed Mr Major as leader in opposition. Veterans of previous campaigns complained that Mr Chris Patten's effort was a shambles. The subsequent surveys showing Mr Ashdown's Liberal Democrats drawing support from Labour as well as the Tories steadied nerves. By last night the view of senior ministers was that the election had not been won this week for Mr Major, but neither had it been lost. The theme for the final week - still based on the slogan You Can't Trust Labour - has at last been set in a coherent framework. Higher taxes, rising mortgage rates and a return to state intervention would stifle an emerging, if still scarcely visible, economic recovery. Mr Major's soapbox appearances in market squares around the country are incomprehensible to political sophisticates. But the message from his party activists is that the voters much prefer them to the prime minister's occasional attempts to emulate Mr Heseltine. So the sharpest attacks on Mr Kinnock's fitness for office - still, the Tories insist, an issue on the doorstep - are being left to the environment secretary. The strategy is to frighten waverers back into the fold: to persuade the stay-at-homes and would-be Liberal Democrats that there is no other choice but Mr Major or Mr Kinnock. Party activists insist that there are enough floating votes to be won back to deny the Labour leader the keys to Downing Street. Perhaps. But Mr Ashdown's decision to stand above the two-party fray has so far hurt the Tories more than Labour. There can be no certainty that Mr Heseltine's red-blooded attacks on Mr Kinnock will not intensify the mood of disenchantment from which the Liberal Democrats have prospered. The election may not have been lost to the Tories. But next week Mr Major will no longer be able to content himself with a campaign that does no more than prevent Mr Kinnock from extending his lead.</p>

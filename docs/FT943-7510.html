			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Support industry - A look at a confusing range of support services for businesses in north-east England North-east England was once described, by a local university academic, as 'a policy laboratory where every conceivable kind of economic development initiative has been tested, often to destruction'. From the wooing of Nissan and its Pounds 900m European car plant to advice on setting up creches on council estates, the economic regeneration industry is arguably the region's greatest growth sector. This month's loss of yet more jobs from shipbuilder Swan Hunter, where nearly 2,000 have gone since receivership 15 months ago, underlines how much Tyneside, in common with Britain's other traditional industrial heartlands, needs to succeed in creating new jobs. In such areas, substantial numbers of male manual jobs have been disappearing for two decades or more, eroding not only employment but the confident expectation of a lifetime's work with a large employer. Across all political parties and interest groups in Tyneside, there is widespread agreement that indigenous growth through expansion of small and medium-sized businesses is at least as important to economic restructuring as inward investment. But there is less clarity about how that growth can best be encouraged by the multiplicity of bodies set up to foster it. Graham Woosey, general manager of Tyneside's recently launched Business Link, admits the range of support services is confusing. A former company secretary at Swan Hunter and knowledgeable about the local business scene, Woosey was surprised to discover how many initiatives there were in the local job creation sector. In some parts of the country, he says, the government's one-stop shop Business Link initiative is operating in a 'greenfield' setting. Places such as Tyneside, Manchester and Merseyside already have many organisations geared up to helping the entrepreneur. Business Link Tyneside has 13 core partners and its 'wider partnership' includes a further 25 bodies and programmes, all active in encouraging the area's economic growth. The Business Link, says Woosey, is not a signposting mechanism, but a 'delivery organisation', working alongside its clients to help them through the bewildering range of advice and information available from local support bodies. Some of these organisations, such as enterprise and economic development agencies Project North East and Entrust, were founded in response to the recession of the late 1970s and have continued to evolve. Other initiatives set up around that time, by the now-defunct Tyne and Wear county council, have been joined by a raft of other projects. They range from university schemes, geared to spinning off businesses from top-level research and development, to central government-funded and private-sector led projects aimed at helping residents of some of the most deprived inner city areas create their own jobs. The five district councils of Tyne and Wear have also been highly active for many years in economic regeneration, offering business start-up training and counselling, grants and subsidised workspace. Vocal local industrialists have recently weighed in too with their own Manufacturing Challenge, aimed at doubling the region's manufacturing base and trebling exports within a decade. Figures from the Tyne and Wear Research and Intelligence Unit, based on the 1981 and 1991 census returns, indicate that this effort has borne fruit; over that period, self-employment rose by 43 per cent - representing about 10,000 people. David Irwin, chief executive of Project North East, detects a psychological sea change since the late 1970s, away from the belief that anybody starting up in business is 'one of them'. Business Link's four business advice centres in Tyneside, founded as a partnership between enterprise agencies, local authorities and the Tec, indicate just how far that change has gone; in the three years to April 1994, they dealt with more than 100,000 inquiries. In the four months since early April, 8,269 people passed through their doors. 'One of the problems we find in dealing with new government ministers, and even civil servants, is they are always looking for the new, sexy idea they can put a label on,' says Alan Clarke, Newcastle's chief economic development officer. 'The tendency is, let's have a competition to come up with a new idea, usually for less money. It's infuriating.' Irwin notes an underlying contradiction. 'We tell the clients they must be market driven; the government tries to make us policy driven.' For some agencies the thirst for newness is life-threatening. 'Fighting for funds takes all of my time,' says Jim Hedley, managing director of the Gateshead-based Innovation Centre, whose staff have assisted more than half the region's estimated 5,500 manufacturing companies since the centre was founded 13 years ago. The government says its objective in creating its Single Regeneration Budget (SRB), for which 1995-96 bids are now being prepared, is to tackle the plethora of separate programmes and target local needs more effectively. But the invitation to bid for new projects, and the winding down of the government-funded Urban Programme, has serious implications for bodies such as the Innovation Centre. Urban Programme, drawn from 20 north-east local authorities, was a key source of funding. European funding, another vital input, is also still unclear for next year. 'I really don't know if we will be in existence next April,' says Hedley. 'It seems crazy when the government places such emphasis on developing new processes and initiatives.' Yet the move to SRB is also seen by some Tyneside regeneration specialists as an opportunity - provided it is adequately funded - to inject greater coherence into the area's economic development activities. One review it has prompted is a rethink by Tyneside Tec of the Enterprise Allowance scheme, under which more than 2,500 small businesses have started in the area since 1990. A move is likely, says Tec operations manager Tom Arnott, away from automatic eligibility for those satisfying the rules towards a more discretionary system focused on business growth. The jury is still out on the question of whether all these support services have in fact worked. It is difficult to tell how many businesses which are successfully growing would have failed without their help.</p>

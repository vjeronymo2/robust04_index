			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Mapplethorpe Complaints Denied: Opponents of a Robert Mapplethorpe photo  exhibit lost a bid Wednesday in a Boston court to halt the show they say  violates obscenity laws.  </P> <P> Municipal Clerk Magistrate Rosemary Carr denied three complaints against the  exhibit by the American Family Assn., which would have prompted an  investigation by the district attorney. The group had sought a ruling that the  exhibit -- which includes nude photographs of children -- is exploitative,  constitutes dissemination of obscene materials and matter harmful to minors.  The complaints had been filed against the Institute of Contemporary Art, which  opened the Mapplethorpe exhibit five weeks ago. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

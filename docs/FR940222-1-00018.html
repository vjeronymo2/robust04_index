If the passive business exists in the form of a trust, the trust's grantor or trustee would be a ``principal'' if he or she owns at least 20 percent of the small business concern, and a beneficiary of at least 20 percent of the trust's assets would be a ``principal'' if he or she owns at least 20 percent of the small business concern. If members of the same family (father, mother, son, daughter, wife, husband, brother or sister) meet the 20 percent ownership requirement in both the passive business and the small business concern they would be considered to be the same ``principal'' for SBA purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 120_BUSINESS LOAN POLICY <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: MIM Holdings bounces back to black in quarter Higher commodity prices and a cost-control programme have allowed MIM Holdings, the Australian metals producer, to return to the black in the quarter to September, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. The company yesterday announced it had turned a ADollars 24.7m loss into a ADollars 16.6m (USDollars 12.20m) profit in the period, on a 28 per cent increase in sales to ADollars 530.8m from ADollars 413.6m. Directors said sales volumes for most products, notably copper and zinc, were up sharply and while prices were higher, they were offset by currency movements. The company's cost of sales increased 18.5 per cent to ADollars 463.5m. MIM's asset sale programme had raised ADollars 584m since July last year, strengthening the group's balance sheet and providing flexibility to fund new projects, the group said. The result followed a tax provision of ADollars 12.1m, compared with ADollars 3.5m, and excluded a net foreign exchange gain of ADollars 1.3m against ADollars 2.3m. There were no abnormal items, against a ADollars 17.8m loss last time.</p>

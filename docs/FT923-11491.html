			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Intel delays launch of next-generation chip INTEL, the leading manufacturer of microprocessor chips, said it would delay the introduction of its next-generation product, code-named P5, until the first quarter of 1993 to allow more time for testing. The P5, which will be renamed before its official launch, is the latest version of Intel's widely used microprocessor family, which includes the 386 and 486 devices that power most personal computers. Intel had planned to launch the P5 during the fourth quarter of 1992. Mr Paul Otellini, vice-president in charge of Intel's microprocessors, said the delay did not mean that there were problems with the P5. 'We have (prototype) parts running in multiple systems at Intel and with key customers. Sampling to a broader range of customers will not be delayed,' he said. However, by delaying full- scale production of the P5, Intel will allow more time to refine its manufacturing process, improve yields and avoid the bugs that have plagued new microprocessors in the past. Despite Intel's statements, analysts suspect that Intel has encountered technical problems, forcing it to delay full-scale production. Intel is facing rising competition in the high-performance end of the microprocessor market from makers of reduced instruction set computing (Risc) microprocessors. The P5 is Intel's response to this competition. Microsoft, the world's largest provider of software for personal computers, reported a 52 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 210.1m, or 48 cents a share, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The final quarter took Microsoft's earnings for its fiscal year to Dollars 708m, or Dollars 2.41 a share, well up on the Dollars 463m earned in fiscal 1991.</p>

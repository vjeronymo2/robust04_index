			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Gateway wines: Corrections IN some editions of yesterday's issue, it was stated that Gateway, the supermarket chain, had withdrawn from sale one of its Italian white wines, Pinot Bianco del Zenato. Gateway says that this was an error in its press release and the wine withdrawn was in fact Pinot Bianco del Veneto. No Zenato wines are involved in the recently reported withdrawals of wines feared to be contaminated with fungicides.</p>

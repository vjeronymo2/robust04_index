			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / John Major and the recurring Tory nightmare: Philip Stephens assesses the mutterings of backbench rebellion in the members' lobby at Westminster IT IS 2.30 pm in the members' lobby of the House of Commons, the marbled inner sanctum at Westminster where MPs and ministers gather on the threshold of the debating chamber. Sprawled on a green leather bench just outside the office of Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, four of the Tory party's most ardent Euro-sceptics are plotting against John Major. They are oblivious of the steady stream of colleagues visiting the man charged with delivering the votes of the Conservative party to its prime minister. Instead they are noisily confident that come next Wednesday's crucial vote on the Maastricht treaty, Ryder will fail and Major will be defeated. Just a few paces away a loyalist knight from the shires is admonishing a new boy - one of the 61 Tory MPs who first entered parliament after the April general election - about the 'enemy within'. The 'venomous Thatcherites' opposing Major, he declares gravely, are out to destroy the government and the party. They must be beaten, once and for all. A glance over their shoulders adds a third dimension to the surreal tableau. Another Tory knight is negotiating with a television reporter over an appearance on the evening news bulletins. This one, a member of the executive of the powerful 1922 committee of backbenchers, is ready to offer a soundbite telling the prime minister to listen more to his backbenchers. The deal is struck. As the bell rings to announce the daily prayer session with which MPs start each day's political mud-slinging, a cabinet minister scurries by. He dodges questions from the political reporters charting the latest twist in the government's struggle with its own supporters. An anxious countenance provides its own answer. A Tory Parliamentary Private Secretary, one of the unpaid bag-carriers on the first rung of the ministerial ladder, breaks off a conversation to head for the chamber: 'I'm going in. I want to pray. I think it might help'. He will not be alone on his knees during the next few days. Major has turned next week's debate on the Maastricht treaty into an issue of confidence in his premiership. A defeat at 10 o'clock on Wednesday evening would fulfil his worst nightmare, stripping him of what remains of his clothing of authority. He might well resign, forcing the second Tory leadership battle in as many years. Like that of Margaret Thatcher, the defeat would not be at the hands of the opposition, but at those of his own supporters. The proximate cause - Britain's place in Europe - would be identical, but with a bizarre twist. In 1990 the party would not be led by a Europhobe. Now it would be deciding to reject her successor's pragmatic Europeanism. The prime minister is gambling that the fever will abate. By the time the Commons division bell sounds, the party will have come to its collective senses. It will recoil from a course which would threaten an end to the longest period in government since Lord Liverpool's premiership 180 years ago. They may well be right. The noisy cheers which greeted Major when he issued a personal appeal to the backbenchers on Thursday night suggests that loyalty still finds a place in Tory party politics. Thatcher's demise was an occasional exception. More frequently the noise and smoke of the party's private wars have left the antagonists bloodied but still standing on the battlefield. The modern Conservative party has learnt that the price of being divided is opposition. It is more than 70 years since the struggles over Imperial Preference kept the Tories out of office for a generation. It is 150 years since the repeal of the Corn Laws split irrevocably the party then being shaped by Sir Robert Peel. Lord Whitelaw, the elder statesman who steered Thatcher away from many a disaster during her first years in Downing Street, is convinced the party can be held together. He blames the present malaise above all on the economic recession. Sterling's enforced departure from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was a significant national defeat. The plan for large-scale closures in the coal industry during the recession was a bad mistake. But with sensitive handling of his supporters Major can retrieve it. 'He needs now to calmly and quietly assert his authority . . . But let us never forget that it was this prime minister who won the election for us'. Part of the problem is simply the arithmetic. Large Tory majorities during most of the 1980s allowed the luxury of occasional rebellions. They accommodated the irreconcilable anti-Europeans who have never accepted Britain's entry into the European Community; and the dozen or so bloody-minded MPs who never need an excuse to rebel. Major has a majority of just 21. So as Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman puts it, Tory MPs must adjust: 'It isn't the case any more that they can vote as they like just as a demonstration. It is very much for real.' The new intake - most of them professional rather than part-time politicians  -has still to adjust to the reality of life on the backbenches. They find it hard to accept they have no executive powers, that they will have to wait years rather than months to secure the most junior post in the government. Over time they should settle down. But Major meanwhile has to live with that arithmetic. A batch of headlines on Thursday morning declaring him the victor in the battle over Europe may not be enough. The Autumn Statement next month will bring further harsh decisions. The economic recovery remains a distant prospect. The past few weeks have left the Conservatives and the government in sickly shape. It will take more than a single vote to restore them to health. Major's enemies are not alone in drawing parallels between the ERM defeat and the crippling blow which the Suez debacle delivered to Sir Anthony Eden's government in 1956. As Lady Thatcher returns to haunt her successor they recall that after Suez Eden could never escape from the shadow of Winston Churchill. The change in the mood at Westminster in six short months is breath-taking. In April Major had defied the pundits, the opinion polls and the odds to deliver a fourth election victory. He had confirmed his personal authority over the party. Now the Conservatives look like a party that has lost its way, lacking ideological purpose, unsure of its will to sustain its prime minister in office, fractious and rebellious. Britain faces the deepest political crisis since the winter of discontent in 1978. But the question being asked in the corridors of power is not whether the country, but whether the Conservative party is governable. Lady Thatcher scents blood. This week she took a break from the lucrative international lecture circuit to encourage the rebels from her oak-panelled office in the House of Lords. Her friends report she now regards her chosen successor as a 'footnote in history'. The Tory malcontents over Europe - the two dozen or so MPs who would belong more properly to an English National Party - have been joined by the disenchanted and dispossessed on the right of the party in challenging the prime minister's authority. Parliamentary motions designed to undercut Major's authority have attracted 60 or 70 signatures. The voice of the loyal silent majority has been drowned by the critics. Many have exulted in the national and personal defeat inflicted by sterling's ignominious retreat from the ERM. Fresh from its victories in driving David Mellor from the cabinet, in obliging Major to put the issue of ERM re-entry firmly on the backburners, and in forcing the U-turn over the coal industry, the executive of the 1922 has begun to behave like an alternative government. Led by Sir Marcus Fox, a garrulous and straight-talking Yorkshireman with a weakness for the media, the executive numbers 12 knights and one dame among its 18-strong membership. In a careful coup last May the executive was captured by the right. The constitution of 'The 22' is unequivocal as to its role: 'To render every assistance to the government and party whips in their efforts to carry on the affairs of the nation upon the sound basis of Conservative principles'. However, its behaviour recently has drawn more inspiration from its antecedents 70 years ago, when it was born of a successful rebellion against Austen Chamberlain's coalition with the Liberal Lloyd George. Now Sir Rhodes Boyson, the populist MP for Brent North and one of those in the forefront of the rebellion over pit closures, is unapologetic about the executive's outspokeness. Boyson was elected to parliament in 1974. He insists that the Whitehall cocoon has left Major's government out of touch with the mood in the country - above all with the despair caused by the 'disastrous economic depression.' 'There is a greater divide between the government and its backbenchers than I have ever seen'. Ministers 'had better listen to their backbenchers.' The anonymity guaranteed by conversations in the members' lobby encourages a right wing minister to offer a blunter assessment: 'Major bears full responsibility for this crisis. If he falls it will be no one's fault but his own'. Others on the right speak of betrayal, a sense that during the leadership election two years ago Major offered a false prospectus. They thought, in Margaret Thatcher's phrase, the prime minister was 'One of Us'. He turned out to be One of Them, more comfortable in the company of Chris Patten or Kenneth Clarke than the likes of Thatcher or Norman Tebbit. There is nothing new in a dislocation between a Tory cabinet and its foot soldiers at Westminster. In government, the party has always been divided into three distinct segments: the activists in the country, their representatives at Westminster, and their representatives in Whitehall's ministerial offices. The role of the cabinet frequently is to tame the wilder instincts of the rest of the party. But Major's opponents believe the gap had grown too wide. Many of the new boys (and girls) are instinctive Thatcherites, true believers. In the words of the left-wing, and semi-detached, MP for Aldershot, Julian Critchley, the 'loyal, dull and deferential' Tory party of old has been replaced by 'the floor of the party conference brought inland and mustered at Westminster'. The red faces on the platform during the outbursts of populist nationalism at the Brighton conference earlier this month underlined the cabinet's discomfort. There is also a problem of ideology. The certainties of the 1980s - the reflex confidence in markets, in privatisation, in liberalisation - have been shattered by the harsh realities of the recession. But a Conservative party reborn during the late 1970s as a party of ideas is finding it hard to revert to its once traditional role as 'the stupid party'. Major's best hope now is that the party retains enough good sense to pull back from the brink. There are signs this weekend that the loyalist and pro European majority is at last raising its voice. The Maastricht rebels show signs of crumbling. Another interest rate cut is on the horizon. Economic recovery would bind many of the party's wounds. The prime minister, however, desperately needs a breathing space. On the day he was elected leader two years ago a cabinet colleague described Major as 'a symbol of our exhaustion'. He may yet be proved right - not so much about Major, but about his party.</p>

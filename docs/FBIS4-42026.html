			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ukrainian Political Figures Answer </F> the Question by the Information Service VYBIR: `What Is Your  Opinion of [Prime Minister] Masol?'"]    [Text] Les Tanyuk, member of the Rukh  [Ukraine's People's Movement for Perestroyka] faction in the  parliament: "The choice of Masol is logical -- once Socialists  head the parliament, they must have a socialist prime minister."    Volodymyr Pylypchuk, member of the "Center"  faction: "After hearing his program, I must say that Masol has  changed. His program coincides with mine by 90 percent. Masol  has seriously changed -- he engaged in business for four years.  It is not bad that the left-wing forces have won. In the past,  they came out as an active separatist force, and now they have  got this state and must take care of it. Perhaps, today, they  are the only ones capable of keeping it united."    Serhiy Holovatyy, member of the faction "Reforms":  "There is one positive aspect to Masol's election -- this is  the first case when the prime minister was elected by the  parliamentary majority alone."    Oleksandr Yemets, member of the presidium of the  Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine: "With the beginning of  the formation of a procommunist government and victory of  communist forces in parliamentary elections, the `left-wing'  forces must form a government of like-minded people, since it is  impossible today to form a coalition government."    Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, Ukraine's people's deputy:  "Masol is a good specialist and an industrialist. The  government's policy will be maintained as long as he is in  power. We had many meetings when I was the acting prime  minister, and we could agree on the majority of issues."    Vyacheslav Kyrylenko, leader of MoNR [expansion  unknown] and former chairman of the USS [expansion unknown]: "A  power which advances past leaders to the political proscenium,  shows that it has no future."</p>

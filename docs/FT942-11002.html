			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: Atlas Copco advances 21% in first quarter Atlas Copco, the Swedish industrial components group, has reported a SKr380m (Dollars 49.5m) profit after financial items for the first quarter, up 21 per cent from a year ago. The group attributed the upturn mainly to the benefits from a SKr700m investment programme at an Antwerp compressor plant. A combination of acquisitions, currency effects, price rises and higher volumes took sales up 13 per cent to SKr4.83bn. Operating profit climbed 34 per cent to SKr382m, helping to offset a SKr27m currency loss. Orders were 12 per cent higher at SKr5.2bn. In Europe, orders rose in the UK, Spain and France, although the German market continued to decline. In many non-European markets, order levels were strong. The group's biggest division, Compressor Technique, lifted operating profits to SKr296m from SKr202m, due to better volumes and efficiency. This helped offset a slight fall in profits in its other divisions. Full-year profits are expected to exceed the 1993 SKr1.32bn level. Although orders are expected to rise in most European markets in 1994, German demand is likely to remain weak, the company said. The group has decided to close a Canadian plant which manufactures rock-drilling tools. Production will be switched to Sweden and Brazil.</p>

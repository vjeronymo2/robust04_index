			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / What they say in the North 'We're finding industry in this country generally unable to react to positive signs. It's totally frustrating . . . People are going to pull their orders; there's a limit to how long people will wait. My message is, wake up industry, there's a market out there.' Graham Bishop, Binns department store 'The UK finance market is being swallowed up by overseas players. I've said to my customers they are foolish in not looking outside the UK market . . . Their atititude seems to be, we'll let others find out how difficult it is to do overseas business. It's a sort of arrogant attitude.' David Haycox, Tenhill computers 'Our order book value today is infinitely better than it was 12 months ago . . . but I don't sense things (in the economy) are on the up at all. I honestly believe it's due to us getting off our backsides. If we had to rely on the UK market we wouldn't survive.' Brian McGuinness, Mitchell Shackleton</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (6): Little farms and little industry - Agriculture Beyond the high-tech centre of Toulouse and the industrial towns of Tarbes, Albi, and Rodez lies a vast rural region - bigger than Belgium or the Netherlands. A world apart from the space research and electronics design conducted in the regional capital, it has its own economic structure and its own concerns. Over the past few years, these concerns have become more pressing. Mr Etienne Lapeze, president of the regional agricultural industry federation, cites a lengthy list of problems, from rural migration to the effects of Europe's common agricultural policy and the impact of cheap imports. He believes that the challenges can be overcome, but not without significant adjustment. At the root of the various problems lie some traditional weaknesses in the region's agricultural sector. Despite steady growth in recent years, farms in the Midi-Pyrenees are relatively small - 51 per cent are less than 50 acres, and only 13 per cent bigger than 124 acres. As a result, investments to improve productivity or irrigation have been constrained. More seriously, the region suffers from a relative lack of agricultural industry. 'We have a huge agricultural region but a weak processing base,' says Mr Georges Bories of INRI, the agricultural research institute. 'Much of the raw materials are shipped elsewhere for treatment.' Such weaknesses have been compounded by the liberalisation of the French agricultural market - a result of the CAP and the Gatt accords concluded last year after much protest from French farmers, particularly in south-west France. The effects, says Mr Lapeze, have been severe. In addition to the reduction in prices for agricultural products such as cereals and oil seeds, he argues that the measures have penalised farmers who invested to make their land more productive. To illustrate the point, he cites the case of a farmer who produces three tonnes of cereal per hectare and another who produces just one tonne. With the fall in prices per tonne from FFr3 to FFr0.90, resulting from liberalisation, and with a subsidy of FFr3,000 per farmer, it is the more efficient producer who suffers. For Mr Lapeze, Gatt negotiations have brought few benefits to offset such costs. 'Gatt has weakened rather than strengthened the rules of agricultural trade,' he says, adding that factors such as social protection must be taken into account. The impact of Chilean apple imports, for example, would be much reduced, he argues, if there were international rules to safeguard working conditions and social protection there. To counter these challenges, the region's agricultural organisations have embarked on strategies of diversification and a focus on increasing the value of production in the sector. One example is the seeds industry, which has seen considerable development in production and research. Large companies in the sector, such as Rustica and France-Mais, have established bases in the region and are working with local research institutes to develop the sector. Successes include resistant and high yield seeds for maize, which have seen strong demand from French farmers. 'It is a sector which is very important for the future,' says Mr Bories. 'It has a high value added content, and the Midi-Pyrenees has already established a strong base in research and development.' Traditional products are also being steered towards an emphasis on higher value. This is partly being achieved through the introduction of labelling and the establishment of brand image. From Roquefort cheese to garlic, cassoulet and beef, local producers are seeking to establish brand identities. 'If you can distinguish yourself from other products, then you can establish an image of quality,' says one farmer. 'This brings protection against competitors and falling prices.' The biggest potential for value-added production, however, lies in the creation of large agro-industrial groups in the region. To encourage the process, the region's agricultural co-operatives and agro-industrial groups have formed a joint body, called Promia, to help develop links between research organisations and the public and financial sectors. 'The resources are present,' says one Promia member, 'but we have to strengthen our activities in processing and in areas like branding.' The success of such initiatives will determine whether the agricultural sector can resist the increasing pressures it faces. Mr Lapeze estimates that the region's 80,000 farms will fall to 60,000 as a result of demographic trends - in particular, the ageing of the rural population. A further 10,000 farms could be threatened by the impact of Gatt and the common agricultural policy. But he is optimistic. 'We have a resilient culture and some formidable trumps,' he says. 'A focus on quality and investment should allow us to keep many of these jobs.'</p>

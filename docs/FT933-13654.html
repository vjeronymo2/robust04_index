			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Cookery: Why the simple ways are best - Philippa Davenport concludes her short series on pasta with some home-made sauces GOOD PASTA needs little adornment. Often, it seems more appropriate to talk of dressing it rather than saucing it, of anointing it sparingly, not smothering it. Some of the most complementary finishing touches can be supplied by ingredients stocked in every self-respecting store cupboard. I find good pasta irresistible when simply tossed in melted butter and served with a hunk of Parmesan cheese to grate over it at table. Equally delicious is a smear of good olive oil, heated and perfumed with garlic and chilli. Toasted and crushed cumin seeds mixed with chopped green coriander are another flavour combination of which I am fond, while chopped fresh thyme and parsley or other garden herbs go well with lemon-scented olive oil. Beware, though, of ready-grated Parmesan. The worst is sawdust stale and the best is never as good as Parmesan grated at home when needed - and not a moment before. For, just as peppercorns and coffee beans lose their aroma rapidly after grinding, so does Parmesan's flavour fade after grating. SPAGHETTI ALLA CARBONARA (serves 3-4) Ingredients:  3/4 lb spaghetti or tagliatelle; 3 eggs; 3 tablespoons cream (optional); 4oz green streaky bacon or pancetta, cut into snippets; up to 2oz butter; 2oz Parmesan cheese, grated freshly, plus extra for serving if liked. Method: Beat the eggs as though for scrambling with plenty of pepper, some salt and 2oz freshly grated Parmesan. Add the cream if using it. While the pasta is boiling, fry the bacon gently until browned in a little butter in a Le Creuset casserole or other dish suitable for bringing to table. If not using cream, add more butter to the bacon. Let it melt and become hot. Add the cooked and drained spaghetti, pour on the egg mixture and draw the dish away from the heat. Turn the spaghetti gently over and over until the eggs are cooked creamily and every strand of pasta is coated with the bacon-flecked sauce. PASTA WITH FENNEL AND OLIVES (serves 3-4) Ingredients: 10oz-12oz small pasta shapes such as shells, farfalle or bucatini;  3/4 lb-1lb bulb fennel; 1 teaspoon fennel seed crushed to a powder; 1 1/2 oz-2oz black olives, halved and stoned; olive oil; 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan plus extra for serving if liked. Method: Trim the fennel, discarding any stringy outer parts, and reserve the green fronds. Chop the rest into small pieces and fry them in 1-1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil for a few minutes until the surfaces are scorched with gold here and there and the centres are tender, yet retain a little crunch. Add another teaspoon or two of olive oil to the pan and let it become hot. Then, tip the vegetable and its flavoursome oil into a warmed serving dish and stir in the crushed fennel seeds, the chopped fennel fronds, the olives and a little salt and pepper. Add the pasta as soon as it is cooked and drained. Sprinkle lightly with Parmesan and toss quickly to mix. FLORENTINE SPIRALS (serves 2-3) Ingredients: 8oz fusili or other small pasta shapes; 6oz-8oz spinach; 3oz-4oz streaky bacon, cut into snippets; a very generous nugget of butter; plenty of freshly-grated nutmeg and black pepper. Method: 6oz spinach is plenty here but I sometimes use 8oz to make more of a vegetable dish. Wash and dry the leaves and chop them finely by hand or whizz them briefly in a food processor. While the pasta is boiling, fry the bacon snippets in a smidgeon of butter. Remove them. Add a good lump of butter to the saute pan. Let it sizzle. Add the spinach, and stir and turn it until wilted. Season well and draw the pan away from the heat. Add quickly the cooked and drained pasta and the bacon, and toss until mixed. This is a very savoury mixture. I think it would be gilding the lily to offer Parmesan at table with it. Following last week's article on bought pastas a number of readers have asked for stockists of the Spinosi brand.

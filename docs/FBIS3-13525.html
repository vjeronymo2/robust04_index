After 13 years of  interruption the airport resumed its international flights as  the first plane left Abadan for Dubayy. There are two weekly  return flights by the Aseman [Sky] airways to Dubayy on Mondays  and Fridays, carrying 80 passengers in each flight.    Two return flights from Tehran to Abadan are also added to  the [Aseman] domestic flights. These flights are also scheduled  for Mondays and Fridays so as to assist the passengers in  Abadan. This brings the total number of Aseman airways return  flights from Tehran to Abadan to three flights per week.  [passage omitted]</p>

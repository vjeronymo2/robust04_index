			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> In his plausible account of the woes of Central America, Schram alludes to the  Soviet-Cuban funneling of military aid to Nicaragua and the rebels is El  Salvador. Immediately above it is a Conrad cartoon about El Salvador in the  form of a crucifix fashioned from a gun labeled "Made in U.S.A."  </P> <P> Conrad needs to be told that the old liberal wheeze about everything wrong in  the world being America's fault is now as passe as the Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> TONY THOMAS  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

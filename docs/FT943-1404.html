			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Coal faces renewed dash for gas The threat to coal from other fuel sources was underlined yesterday when Midlands Electricity and three overseas companies said they had reached agreement on financing a 750MW gas-fired power station on Humberside. Construction of Humber Power will start immediately. As with several other proposed gas stations, plans for Humber Power were put on hold after an agreement in February between the electricity regulator and the two largest UK generators to peg prices in the wholesale power pool. Yesterday's announcement dashed coal industry hopes that the pricing agreement would end the so-called 'dash for gas'. Further gas-fired power stations are being considered. British Gas is thought to be considering whether to participate in a 1,200MW station at Seabank, near Bristol, while Eastern Electricity is negotiating on a 350MW station at King's Lynn, Norfolk. The Humber Power station alone could displace 2m tonnes of coal a year from the market when it is completed in April 1997. This would rise to more than 3.5m if the project's partners build a second phase of the station, taking the full capacity to 1,200MW. Midlands Electricity has taken a 25 per cent stake, investing about Pounds 11m on completion in 1997. It forecasts the investment will provide a real post-tax return of more than 15 per cent. The company will also buy 174MW of the station's output. Midlands' partners are IVO of Finland (30 per cent), ABB, the international engineer (20 per cent), and Tomen, the Japanese trading company (25 per cent). IVO will operate the station and ABB will be the turnkey contractor. Like Midlands, IVO and Tomen have entered 15-year hedging contracts for output from the station. This is the first time that companies other than regional electricity concerns have entered long-term contracts of this nature. IVO and Tomen said yesterday that they expected to be trading in the power contract market 'in due course'. Mr Kari Huopalahti, IVO group director, said the contractual structure which made the project possible represented a step forward for power generation in the UK. Gas will be supplied by Total Oil Marine and Elf Exploration. Project credit facilities of Pounds 520m were arranged by NatWest Markets and Union Bank of Switzerland.</p>

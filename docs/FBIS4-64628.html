			<p>BFN     [Text] "The Northern League has requested the suspension of  the negotiations with the National Alliance and Forza Italia on  the formation of the new government. Our request is for a pause  for thought, because we maintain that in this way the  governability of the country will be guaranteed, but only within  a framework of democracy and liberalism." The statement was  made by Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League.    "The League," according to the communique, "is favorable to  the division and not the concentration of powers." Only if this  principle will be adhered to "will the League continue with the  negotiations." For the time being Silvio Berlusconi has not  replied directly to the communique. He did say: "We are here to  work, and we hope the others are here to do the same."</p>

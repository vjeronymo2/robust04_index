			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / International Company News: Olivetti to seek further 2,500 job cuts in Italy OLIVETTI, the loss-making Italian computers and office equipment group, yesterday announced it would be seeking a further 2,500 redundancies in its Italian workforce in a further bid to reduce costs. Olivetti, which reported a L73.7bn (Dollars 61.82m) interim loss last year, has already won agreement for 3,500 lay-offs, shrinking its workforce to around 47,000. Some 3,000 of the redundancies will come through a state-backed early retirement scheme, while the remining 500 will be offered alternative public sector employment. However, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the group's majority shareholder, who returned to full-time management control last November, has stressed the need for further savings if Olivetti is to survive the current crisis in the world information technology industry. Mr De Benedetti has not hidden his pessimism about prospects for economic recovery this year and has been harshly critical of Italy's declining industrial competitiveness. Since his return to full-time management, Olivetti has announced the scrapping of its previous organsational structure, in existence for barely three years, in favour of a simpler system which it is claimed could save L400bn a year. The latest round of redundancies presented at the start of a three-day negotiating session with the unions may also include proposals to transfer further manufacturing abroad. Olivetti currently has production facilities in Singapore and Mexico, apart from its numerous plants in Italy. According to Mr De Benedetti, costs in Singapore are around one-tenth those at home. With Italy in an election year, political considerations may have constrained the company's job-cutting targets. But prospects of heavy losses for 1991 - some analysts predict L200bn - have given Mr De Benedetti a strong bargaining counter with both unions and the government, which Olivetti has long been pressing for more orders.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The pendulum seems to be swinging back. In the  United States, President Bill Clinton has replaced the radical  free-market policy of his predecessors with a policy of  intelligent state intervention. And in countries closer to  Colombia, such as Mexico and Chile, where neoliberalism also  held sway, the respective governments launched ambitious social  programs several months ago to include a larger number of  citizens in their liberalization processes.    Along the same lines--closer to Clinton than to Bush or  Reagan--Liberal candidate Ernesto Samper announced the basic  features of his economic and social program in October of last  year. And just 10 days ago, acting on the conviction that "a  social policy is above all an employment policy," and that state  intervention is necessary in many areas, he turned his proposal  into an ambitious employment plan that seeks to generate 1.5  million new jobs in the next four years.    The plan is the fruit of many months of discussion within  his  campaign. Since the middle of last year, the Program Committee,  coordinated by Guillermo Perry (other members include such  experts on the subject as Antonio Urdinola, Luis Bernardo  Florez, Cecilia Lopez, Marta Lucia Ramirez, and Antonio  Hernandez), reached the conclusion that the centerpiece of the  candidate's economic and social program should be jobs. And they  set to work to make it a reality.    There were several reasons for choosing jobs, they said.  First of all, more than 45 percent of Colombians live in  poverty, and the only way to emerge from poverty is by getting a  job. Second, the latest advancements in economic theory suggest  that growth requires competitiveness, and this can be achieved  only by generating productive employment. And third, the  country's security problems--urban and rural--are closely  related to the lack of job opportunities.  <H5>  Sectoral Plans </H5>   The plan's first component is growth itself. In other words,  it is economic policy in general. "The employment plan," said  Samper in Medellin the week before last, "will operate in the  context of an economic policy that will facilitate the dynamic  behavior of private investment and economic growth above six  percent a year, without causing inflationary pressure." If these  goals are accomplished, more than a million jobs could be  created in the next four years.    The question is how to achieve these growth rates. And that  is the first way in which Samper's proposal differs from  policies currently in vogue. Although the candidate has repeated  on several occasions that he will not reverse the liberalization  and will maintain the principles of deregulation and efficiency  that have guided the policy of the current administration--and  in that sense his program would guarantee continuity--Samper  believes that to accelerate growth it is necessary to return to  sectoral policies, in which the state plays a critical role of  supporting the private sector.    One of these policies has to do with the export sector.  According to the plan, macroeconomic policy should be oriented  toward preventing revaluation and guaranteeing exporters  expanding markets. Specifically, Samper proposes the acquisition  of marketing channels abroad, aggressive negotiating to open  foreign markets, allocating more resources to Proexport,  strengthening the Tax Rebate Certificate (Cert) program, and  supporting industrial free-trade zones. That, according to the  plan, will double minor exports in four years and generate more  than 150,000 jobs.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Plan Goals                                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Strategy                 |New Jobs                 |Net Total                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

In this field, Samper promises to  increase investment in land management and in the development  and widespread use of improved varieties; to create price  stabilization funds; to establish subsidies for the  capitalization of the farm sector; to strengthen the Agrarian  Savings Bank, the National Rehabilitation Plan (PNR), and the  Integrated Rural Development Program (DRI); and to support the  coffee-growers' committees and the coffee sector in general. The  goal, in this case, is to achieve a growth rate of four percent  per year, which could generate more than 120,000 jobs in the  countryside.    The other policy is industrial modernization. Its aims are  to  establish a modernization fund for industrial restructuring,  create sectoral and regional productivity centers, support  business incubators, encourage subcontracting between large  businesses and small and medium ones, and pursue a state  procurement policy that favors Colombian goods and services. The  objective is an industrial growth rate above 7.5 percent and  approximately 150,000 new jobs in the sector.    In addition to the sectoral policies, however, the plan  calls  for three major investment programs that could generate 320,000  more jobs: the infrastructure investment program, which seeks to  bring the country up to date in terms of highways,  communications, and power; the human capital investment program,  which aims to boost the productivity of workers by improving  their health and education; and the low-income housing program,  which would extend the current subsidy system.  <H5>  Growth Is Not Enough </H5>   Samper and his advisers believe, however, that to overcome  employment problems--and in particular the tremendous  inequalities that exist among the different segments of the  population--it is not enough to raise growth rates. After all,  they say, at least a dozen industrialized countries have  unemployment rates above 10 percent today. For this reason, the  plan contains several specific jobs programs--and on this point  as well it differs from the neoliberal credo--targeting  microbusinesses, the vulnerable segments of the population, and  training for employed workers.    The most ambitious program is the one for microbusinesses  and  small businesses, which seeks to generate 350,000 new jobs. Its  objective is to facilitate microbusinesses' access to credit and  technology by strengthening the Guarantee Fund in that sector,  setting up a Finurbano (a kind of urban Finagro), supporting the  foundations of microbusiness owners, expanding credit programs  for professionals who establish productive businesses, and  strengthening the channels for technical assistance and the  spread of technology.    The training and recruitment programs for vulnerable groups  are designed to establish special jobs programs, with the active  participation of municipal and departmental governments, in the  poorest parts of the country, targeting youths, women, jobless  workers, and the handicapped. The idea is for the territorial  entities that promote these programs to receive compensation  from an Employment Solidarity Fund, which in turn would be  funded by the national budget.    The goal, according to Samper, is for trade associations,  the  labor movement, professional associations, and the departmental  and municipal governments to get involved in a great social pact  to get the plan going. "An ambitious, but realistic plan," say  his advisers.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Racal and Chubb double dividend SIR Ernest Harrison yesterday demonstrated the value to shareholders of breaking up large conglomerate businesses when he reported the first separate interim profits from Racal Electronics and Chubb Security, which demerged from the communications group in October. After profit rises broadly in line with expectations, Sir Ernest, chairman of both companies, announced a doubling of the combined interim dividend. Racal shareholders, who were distributed Chubb shares at no cost, have already seen the combined share price of Racal and Chubb rise from 58p ahead of demerger to a price equivalent to 76p. The demerger follows the demerger and flotation of Vodafone, the cellular radio network operator, now capitalised at Pounds 4bn. It tended to obscure the value of Racal's other businesses. Yesterday Racal Electronics reported pre-tax profits in the six months to October 9 of Pounds 23.1m, up from losses of Pounds 2.4m, and an interim dividend of 1.5p. Racal Chubb reported profits of Pounds 26.9m, up 92 per cent from the pro-forma result for the same period last year. Chubb will also pay a 1.5p interim dividend. Last year shareholders received one interim dividend equivalent to 1.5p before share consolidation. Both the demerger and flotation of Vodafone two years ago and the demerger of Chubb emerged after bids or the threat of a bid. Sir Ernest argued that Racal's value had not been adequately reflected in its market capitalisation. Mr David Elsbury, Racal chief executive, said the group was still on target to achieve a 5 per cent return on sales for the year ending March 1994. At this half-year, margins were below 2 per cent on sales that accounted for 38 per cent of group sales. However, suspicion that these margin improvements are unlikely to continue helped knock 17p - 10 per cent - off the Racal share price. Mr Elsbury also announced the first commercial application of its Government Data Network technology which is used to link 37 government departments. The group has won a contract to supply a UK-wide service to Exel Logistics, the Bedfordshire-based distribution and storage group. Details, Page 24</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] NATO members are all agreed: More  pressure on Bosnian Serbs is needed. [passage omitted]    Today, NATO ambassadors are discussing how long the Serbs  should be given to lift the siege of Sarajevo. [passage  omitted].    We have Foreign Minister Durao Barroso on the line from  Brazil.    [Unidentified correspondent] Can you comment on this  situation? What attitude will Portugal take as a member of NATO?    [Barroso] We agree that it is time to act. At the same time,  we seek to do it with clear and well-defined objectives. We  think that it is important to stress that the situation we seek  is not exactly a military one, but, quite the contrary, we seek  to exercise military pressure to achieve a negotiated solution.  Portugal's objective, the same as that of the European Union  [EU] and we can say of all the international community,  continues to be peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina and not a  declaration of war against any of the sides.    [Correspondent] Do you share the view that it is necessary  to  give the Bosnian Serbs an ultimatum now?    [Barroso] The expression ultimatum is perhaps not the most  appropriate. And perhaps the Bosnian Serbs should not be  singled out. In our opinion -- and it is not only our opinion,  everyone is responsible in that situation -- the blame does not  fall on one side only. What could be done, and what we would  like to see happen, is that a deadline should be set, a date  beyond which no heavy artillery can be found in a certain  region. No matter who it belongs to.    [Correspondent] How long before the deadline? [passage  omitted]    [Barroso] That is a technical, a military matter. I cannot  define it here. It is up to NATO to decide after hearing views,  above all those of the military, the views of the NATO Military  Committee. These are issues concerning military tactics, and it  is not up to us. It is up to us to define the political line,  and this is the political line: we are going to use, if  necessary, air strikes to bring about an accord, but we are not  going to here, publicly, define deadlines or targets, obviously.    [Correspondent] As you know, we are talking about deadlines  because that is one of the differences between NATO members.  But what you are telling me, really, is that as soon as it is  possible to remove all weapons, that is what is desired, that is  what you would like.    [Barroso] The idea we supported at the EU ministers' meeting  is that the siege of Sarajevo be lifted. That is, to make it  possible to enter and leave Sarajevo freely, to distribute  humanitarian aid, and to put an end to this horrible situation  that the city is experiencing where the civilian population is a  target for snipers who surround Sarajevo. This is the  objective. As for the deadlines, I repeat, it is a matter to be  decided, above all after hearing the military experts. It is  not up to us on a political and diplomatic level to decide. At  least in my opinion, that discussion like that should not be  carried out publicly.    [Correspondent] If there is a military intervention, if  there  is the need for a military intervention, will Portugal  participate with its air force?    [Barroso] In principle, that is not on the cards.    [Announcer] That was Minister Durao Barroso speaking to us  from Brazil. [passage omitted]</p>

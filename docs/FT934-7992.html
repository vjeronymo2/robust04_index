			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (9): In search of full integration - Foreign policy FULL integration into suitably expanded European economic and defence structures as soon as possible is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, the over-arching aim of Hungarian foreign policy. It could hardly be otherwise. The dulling effect of distance from the traditional fault lines of European politics is a luxury not available to Hungary. The war in former Yugoslavia has already cost Hungary an estimated Dollars 1bn in lost trade, increased military spending and aid to refugees. The destruction of Slavonia, including whole cities such as Vukovar and Osijek, by Serb forces in the early months of the Serb-Croat war took place just across Hungary's southern border. The fighting also destroyed the homes and livelihood of many of the 40,000 ethnic Hungarians who have lived for centuries in these lands. Thousands are now refugees in southern Hungary. Their counterparts, the more than 400,000 ethnic Hungarians living in the Serbian province of Vojvodina, have not suffered war and destruction. But the delicate ethnic and sociopolitical balance of the communities in which they live has been dangerously upset by the influx of Serb refugees from the fighting in Croatia and Bosnia, and the grinding poverty which war and the UN trade embargo has brought upon Serbian citizens of all ethnic groups and convictions. Bitterness at the consequences of a war largely brought about by Slobodan Milosevic, the Serb leader, and his coterie of Serbian army officers, nationalist academics and former commissars, is compounded by the deliberate drafting of ethnic Hungarian youths to fight on the Serbian side of the tribal war against Croats and Muslims. Rather than fight, many young men have slipped across the border to relatives and friends in Hungary. As in Serbia itself, the exodus includes many of the best, those with transferable skills and energy who have no wish to endure the risks of a senseless war or the poverty of a future hate-filled peace. Fearful of further undermining the fragile viability of ethnic Hungarian communities across the former Yugoslav borders, Budapest has kept its protests low key, while acquiring new Mig-29 fighters from Russia to defend its airspace and quietly building up the strength and equipment of its formerly depleted and badly equipped army. Above all, Budapest officials plead with the amorphous post-cold war 'west', to take a firm stand against ethnic purging and the insidious undermining of regional security which results from the successful use of violent means to change the ethnic balance of ancient communities. The trouble is that Nato, already taxed by the Greek-Turkish rivalry, and with Britain already embroiled in its own inextricable ethnic conflict in Northern Ireland, is deeply reluctant to extend membership in a way which would bring in new members with unresolved historical disputes in their knapsacks. So Budapest knows it must be circumspect in its defence of the 3.5m ethnic Hungarians who are descendants of those left outside the historical boundaries of greater Hungary when the borders of the Carpathian basin states were redrawn by the victors in the 1920 Trianon Treaty and re-affirmed, with only minimal changes, in 1947. Hence Budapest's espousal of the principle of minimal borders, maximum porosity and respect for minority rights. These are principles, tirelessly put forward by Mr Geza Jeszenszky, who has become the longest serving foreign minister in post-communist Europe, and his able senior advisers. But he fears that Hungary's contribution to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region is undervalued. 'Hungary's position is not sufficiently recognised. My biggest pre-occupation is to ensure that central Europe is not overlooked by the west,' he says. Budapest is concerned,for example,at what it perceives as EC appeasement over the controversial Gabcikovo dam. At the EC sponsored meeting of central European leaders in London last year Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak leader, promised that 95 per cent of the Danube's water would be allowed to flow through the old channels which define the international border and would not start the hydro-power facility in the dam complex. Both promises were broken, virtually without protest from the EC. Drawing a parallel between inter-war appeasement and the west's impotence over Yugoslavia, Mr Jeszenszky recalls Winston Churchill's summing up of the 1938 Munich agreement: 'We chose shame and got war.' In spite of the legitimate reasons for Hungarian nervousness over the possible evolution of events in the region, and concern to prevent Hungary being tarred with the brush of regional instability, the last four years have also had their positive side. On the trade and investment front Hungary has successfully shifted the bulk of its trade away from Comecon to EC markets and attracted Dollars 5.5bn in foreign equity investment. At the same time the dissolution of the Soviet Union means that Hungary no longer has Soviet troops on its territory and no longer has Russia as a direct neighbour. It sets a high priority on building up links with an independent Ukraine. With an eye on longer term prospects for a resumption of trade and other links with Russia, however, Budapest is also acutely aware of the need to maintain good relations with Moscow. Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, openly backed President Boris Yeltsin in his recent fight with parliament. But foreign policy analysts look with concern on the reluctance of the Nato allies to press Moscow for a complete pull-out of Soviet troops from the Baltic states or to define clearly the kind of relationship the west wants with Russia. Above all, Hungarian analysts want the west to avoid leaving the impression of a vacuum of power anywhere in central Europe, given the historical propensity of Russia to push on open doors when it has the strength and the temptation to do so.</p>

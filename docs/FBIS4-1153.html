			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>   [Text] In Angola, the government has confirmed that the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  forces have taken the area of Chongoroi, in coastal Benguela  Province. However, that does not appear to be the sole military  development in the Angolan conflict. Reginaldo Silva, our  correspondent in Luanda, reports on a war that appears to be  entering a new stage:    [Begin Silva recording] In Angola, the more there is talk  about an urgent need for peace, the more one hears war-related  news. According to a statement yesterday by Prime Minister  Marcolino Jose Carlos Moco on his return from a visit to  Benguela Province, this happens at a time when the UNITA forces  have just reoccupied the capital of Benguela Province's  Chongoroi District. It is difficult at this stage to assess the  importance of UNITA's advances in Benguela. Its occupation of  Chongoroi appears to be part of a response to the attacks UNITA  forces have been coming under in northern Angola. To all  intents and purposes, the UNITA troops appear to have  considerably eased government pressure in Benguela Province and  to have the military initiative in their hands, after government  forces had made progress along the Bocoio-Balombo and  Cubal-Ganda lines in the direction of Huambo.    Observers in Luanda believe that the war in Angola is  entering a new stage after the government forces showed an  apparent inability to make major progress in their northern  offensive, where the taking of the city of N'dalatando, the  capital of Cuanza Norte Province, was one of the main goals.  Contradictory reports may have been going the rounds over the  last few days, but it appears to be certain that N'dalatando is  still in UNITA's hands and its forces now enjoy more breathing  space.    Luanda's independent IMPARTIAL FAX publication has reported  that, after receiving large quantities of war materiel it bought  from Arab countries, UNITA is determined to change the situation  in northern Angola so that it will be completely in its favor.  That war materiel is being assembled in Uige.    IMPARTIAL FAX also says that UNITA may soon have PC-7 and  PC-9 aircraft. Should such reports prove to be true, the  military situation in Angola may soon suffer major changes. [end  recording]</p>

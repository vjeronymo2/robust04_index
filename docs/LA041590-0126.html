			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. FILM FESTIVAL COMES OF AGE;  </P> <P> FROM FRIEDKIN TO DONEN AND THE WHOLE WORLD IN BETWEEN, THE FEST LIST INCLUDES  200 FILMS FROM 40 COUNTRIES  </P> <P> If passion and enthusiasm are life's blood for true movie lovers, there's  something to get passionate about in Los Angeles, beginning next week. The  4-year-old American Film Institute/Los Angeles International Film Festival --  conceived in turbulence, born in confusion, weaned on controversy -- has  finally come of age.  </P> <P> Gone for now are the days of Icelandic documentaries on servicemen's wives, of  Czechoslovakian horror films about vampire automobiles, of Finnish fairy tales,  Yugoslavian message movies. In the past, AFI / L.A. FilmFest, at its worst, has  seemed like a kindly uncle who let every wide-eyed relative and vagrant into  the door -- tolerating almost any kind of misbehavior, especially from  independent American movies without distributors. But the kindly uncle has  grown more selective. At the same time, paradoxically, he's opening up more  rooms and lengthening his guest list.  </P> <P> Approximately 200 films from 40 different countries are on the bill this year,  beginning with the gala Thursday opening of William Friedkin's new movie, "The  Guardian," and ending May 3, with Stanley Donen's great 1957 Fred  Astaire-Audrey Hepburn-George Gershwin musical, "Funny Face." So far, after  more than 50 press screenings, the ardor is undampened. Quite the contrary.  </P> <P> What has happened? There's been a radical alteration in the old format AFI /  L.A. FilmFest inherited from its 15-year predecessor, Filmex. Gone almost  totally are some of the elements that often made Filmex delightful: the classic  revivals and historical programs, the Hollywood hoopla, the 50-hour marathons  of musicals, Westerns, horror movies. In a period of dwindling revival houses,  this is a sad loss. But director Ken Wlaschin and his fellow programmers are  finally beginning to realize their dream: to make Los Angeles' local film  festival, in the back yard of Hollywood itself, a gathering place and forum for  the rest of the world's cinema.  </P> <P> To that end, AFI / L.A. FilmFest is holding seminars with the Eastern European  filmmakers, with local independent and with independent black filmmakers based  in Los Angeles, while at the same time staging tributes to some revered  industry figures: musical legend Donen, producer David Wolper and cartoon  pioneer Walter Lantz.  </P> <P> Serendipitously, the theme of this year's festival is Hollywood Glasnost: a  celebration of the new democratic reforms and movements in the old Eastern Bloc  countries and of the new, less circumscribed cinema they've helped generate.  Several films on the Glasnost program -- Jiri Menzel's "Larks on a String,"  Hungary's "The Agitators," Czechoslovakia's "Pictures of Old Times," Romania's  "The Reenactment" -- have been banned in their own countries for decades. And  while the new outpouring isn't uniformly good -- freedom can breed chaos and  license as well as creativity -- we get startling glimpses of a Russia and  Eastern Europe not much seen until recently: gray, sad, riddled with social  inequities.  </P> <P> Positives, unfortunately, sometimes have negative inspirations. If AFI/L.A.  FilmFest has had a number of excellent, unseen foreign films to choose from  this year, it's because foreign film distribution is collapsing in the United  States -- a sorry situation not even one excellent festival can cure.  </P> <P> How does the current festival cope in an era of vanishing screens, timid  distributors, of college students who are apparently too sapped or dizzy to try  to read subtitles? The following wrap-up, which partially covers the event's  first week, is an attempt to summarize its riches.  </P> <P> The recommendations of The Times reviewing staff -- including Sheila Benson,  Kevin Thomas, Peter Rainer, Chris Willman and this writer -- leads off each  category. All Eastern European films are shown at the Cineplex Odeon Fairfax;  all others at the Cineplex Century Plaza. Information: (213) 480-2323 or  856-7707.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Theo Angelopoulos Retrospective  </P> <P> Highly Recommended: "The Travelling Players.""Landscape in the Mist," "Days of  '36," "The Beekeeper," "Alexander the Great," "Journey to Cythera."  </P> <P> Recommended: "The Reconstruction," "The Huntsmen,"  </P> <P> Last year, my pick as the best of AFI / L.A. FilmFest was Theo Angelopoulos'  "Landscape in the Mist," a spellbindingly beautiful Greek "road" movie, which  went on to win the Felix as the best film released in Europe in 1989. This  year, the festival brings back "Landscape," and all of Angelopoulos' other  seven features -- including his 1976 modern classic, "The Travelling Players,"  selected in an Italian Critic's poll as the best film of the 1970s, and in a  British poll as the best film of the past two decades.  </P> <P> Angelopoulos may be the greatest living filmmaker still relatively unknown and  unseen in the West. Despite the many international awards they've won over the  last 22 years, no Angelopoulos film has received widespread U.S. release -- not  even his 1986 "The Beekeeper," which starred Marcello Mastroianni. It would be  a wonderful irony if Angelopoulos, 54 and at his creative peak, made his major  U.S. breakthrough in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> A great "road" director, he has a predilection for oblique, despairing views of  Greek history and politics; he's also a master at conveying modern alienation.  But the most striking elements of his style -- other than his bewitchingly  beautiful landscape scenes, usually shot near dawn or dusk in a wintry  countryside -- are his obsessions with minimal dialogue and the long take. "The  Travelling Players" is over four hours long and contains only 80 shots, about  one every three minutes. Despite this seeming austerity, the films bristle with  tension.  </P> <P> Angelopoulos' three masterpieces are probably "Landscape in the Mist" (April  27), the 1972 "Days of '36" (April 21, 22) and "The Travelling Players" (April  22). "The Travelling Players" is obviously his magnum opus. In it, a rag-tag  Greek theatrical troupe criss-crosses the countryside from 1940 to 1952,  experiencing all the social upheavals of World War II and its turbulent  aftermath. Their play, Spiridonos Perisiadis' hackneyed but popular pastoral  romance, "Golfo the Shepherdess," never changes -- but offstage, their lives  begin to take on the shape of a Sophoclean tragedy. "Days of '36," centering on  a prison hostage crisis which helps bring on the rise of the Metaxas  dictatorship, is one of his most overtly anti-Fascist statements. "Landscape"  is a seemingly simpler story in which two runaway children travel through  modern Greece in search of their absent, far-off father: a father as  mythological as the Greek gods. All of Angelopoulos' previous work echoes  poetically through it; the Travelling Players themselves reappear in one  sequence.  </P> <P> The other films, if not quite as perfect, are often equally fascinating:  </P> <P> "The Reconstruction," (Friday) , Agelopolous' 1970 debut film, is a hard-edged,  black-and-white true-crime story the seems to mix neo-realism, Brecht and the  Hawks-Huston-Wilder gangster tradition: movies Angelopoulos loved as a boy.  </P> <P> In "The Huntsmen," (April 23) a rebel Communist guerrilla, killed in 1949, is  found frozen in the snow by a 1976 party of hunters; as his body thaws so does  the entire history of an era.  </P> <P> "Alexander the Great" (April 24), a Grand Prize winner at Venice, is a  dance-like fable of rebellion turning to despotism, set in a breathtakingly  picturesque Macedonian mountain village.  </P> <P> "Journey to Cythera" (April 25) is an almost freezingly austere portrayal of a  situation that might seem booby-trapped with sentimentalism: an old radical,  returning to his mountain home after years of political exile in Russia, finds  that he's still a rebellious anachronism, that his world will cast him out  again.  </P> <P> "The Beekeeper" (April 27), another road film and Antonioni homage, starring  Mastroianni, is a definitive poetic portrait of an aging man, facing  disillusionment and youth, becoming consumed and destroyed. Like all  Angelopoulos, it's hauntingly sad, mysteriously beautiful.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Krzyzstof Kieslowski Retrospective  </P> <P> Highly Recommended: "The Decalogue, Pts. 1-10," "A Short Film About Killing,"  "A Short Film About Love."  </P> <P> Like Angelopoulos, Kieslowski has been a consistent international award winner.  Like Angelopoulos, he has won the all-European Oscar equivalent, the Felix, in  1988 for "A Short Film About Killing." Like Angelopoulos, he remains virtually  unseen in the United States.  </P> <P> Unlike Angelopoulos, whose uncompromising approach can alienate unsympathetic  viewers, Kieslowski's virtues are more obvious and immediate: great ensemble  performances, compelling visual style, dramatic immediacy, deep emotional and  intellectual content -- all wrapped up in taut narrative structures worthy of a  first-class director of movie thrillers.  </P> <P> Kieslowski's masterwork is the "Decalogue," a 10-hour, 10-part Polish TV  series, each part based on one of the Ten Commandments. In each story,  Kieslowski and co-scenarist Krzysztof Piesiewicz examine a specific "sin"  committed among the inhabitants of a drab, forbidding high-rise in Warsaw.  Their conclusions vary; so does the tone. Some stories are tragic, some  poignant, some seemingly moralistic. Some are unabashedly comic.  </P> <P> Decalogue 10 on "Thou Shalt Not Covet Thy Neighbor's Goods" is a hilarious  portrayal of two knuckleheaded brothers, a punk rock star and a "square," who  became obsessed with their late father's stamp collection. Decalogue 6, about a  voyeur and his obsession, is a near variation on Hitchcock's "Rear Window."  Decalogue Five, "Thou Shalt Not Kill," is a crime story of hair-raising force,  perhaps the most powerful argument against capital punishment the movies have  ever given us.  </P> <P> In sick, twisted green-gray perspectives, Kieslowski shows us a pointless,  brutal murder; then, in equal terrifying detail, the murderer's execution. In  both cases, the victims, initially repellent, become sympathetic by virtue of  their plight.  </P> <P> The 10 films are an interlocking whole: major characters from one episode  appear in minor roles or as passers-by in the others, and one common character,  a mysterious, silent observer, appears in all of them. The film proves that  great art and television are not incompatible. It also proves that the wages of  sin are never predictable.  </P> <P> "A Short Film About Killing" and "A Short Film About Love" are expanded  versions of Parts 5 and 6 of the "Decalogue."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Western Europe  </P> <P> Recommended: "3 Seats for the 26th," "A Handful of Time."  </P> <P> "Three Seats for the 26th" (April 20), a return to the musical for French  director Jacques Demy and composer Michel LeGrand ("The Umbrellas of  Cherbourg") is, in many ways, a pretty, foolish little movie. Yves Montand  returns to Marseilles for a stage show that presents his biography in song;  Demy tries to reprise the era of MGM musicals, Donen and Minnelli. By  comparison, Demy's dances are wispy, his tunes frail, his colors cartoonish and  his climax tasteless: it's briefly suggested that Montand is seducing his own  illegitimate daughter. Yet "Three Seats" so unabashedly loves musicals and  Montand is so effortless a show-stopper, that there's something giddy and  delightful about it all. It's like champagne in a plastic flute.  </P> <P> Sheila Benson found Martin Asphaug's "A Handful of Time" (Friday) "an extremely  assured Norwegian film" with "gorgeous exteriors" about a guilt-ridden old man  coming to terms with harsh nature: inner and outer. Peter Rainer, on the other  hand, thought Pupi Avanti's "A Story of Boys and Girls" (Saturday) a comedy,  set in 1936 at a 30-course family dinner, was allegedly "life-embracing" but  actually "tedious."  </P> <P> Andi Engel's British-West German "Melancholia" (April 25) seems bent on  producing the same feeling in its audience. Jeroen Krabbe, looking unhappy, is  torn between a melancholy life as an art critic, mulling over joyless  seductions, and another career as a melancholy man of action, conducting glum  assassinations. It's a dispirited movie. Benson considered West German director  Bernhard Wicki's "The Spider's Web" (April 25) "big, opulent, almost operatic,"  "played to the hilt" by Klaus-Maria Brandauer and Ulrich Muhe . . . but  ultimately short of the mark. She and I were disappointed with Karl Francis'  "Angry Earth" (April 26), a Welsh social drama about the rise of the Labor  Movement, recalled by a 110-year-old woman through a slow haze of bawdy joy,  battered heads, bright sermons and labored sentiment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eastern European  </P> <P> Recommended: "Standoff," "Time of Violence," "That Summer of White Roses,"  "Elysium," "The Reenactment."  </P> <P> Hungarian Gyula Gazdag makes surreal dramas and hilarious documentaries.  "Standoff" (April 22) is a thriller, shot with the immediacy of life. In it,  two Hungarian macho punks hold a girl's dormitory hostage, demanding free  passage to the West. The machinations around them, painfully plausible, drive a  ridiculous situation toward realistic catastrophe.  </P> <P> "Time of Violence" (April 24), shot by the director of the Bulgarian film  industry may arouse intense political and religious controversy. It's a  brutally effective historical epic about Christian mountain people under siege  by fanatical janizaries bent on forcibly converting the entire village. Lyudmil  Staikov has the temperament for this kind of epic; he likes big gestures, broad  vistas, bold strokes.  </P> <P> Kevin Thomas says Rajko Grlic's "That Summer of White Roses" (Saturday), set  during the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia, has "one of Tom Conti's best roles."  Erika Szanto's "Elysium" (April 24) focuses sensitively on the dramatic  turbulence around a children's concentration camp and the fantasies that reign  inside. Szanto's other film, "Mission to Evian" (April 24), also has a  Holocaust theme: it's about a Jewish doctor's desperate attempt to convince the  Allies to ransom Jews after Austria's collapse.  </P> <P> Lucian Pintille's "The Reenactment" (April 24) is a long-banned Romanian film,  a darkly jovial absurdist comedy about the charades of totalitarian justice.  Ivan Nichev's "Ivan and Alexandra" (April 22) parallels Bulgaria's descent into  repression with a fitfully sprightly coming-of-age romance. According to Peter  Rainer, Karen Shaknazarov's "Zero City" (Saturday) has a "creepy 'Twilight  Zone' premise" that leaves us "caught in a Stalinist time warp." Another Soviet  film, "Commentary on an Appeal for Mercy" (April 26), directed by Sergei Primak  and Inessa Tumanian, is a "walk" film, a kaleidoscopic and over-obvious tour of  modern Moscow by a bureacratic criminal on his last day and night of freedom.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Asian / African / Australian  </P> <P> Highly Recommended: "City of Sadness," "An Enemy of the People," "A Terra-Cotta  Warrior," "Birth."  </P> <P> Recommended: "Don't Let Them Shoot the Kite," "Rikyu."  </P> <P> Hou Hsai-hsien's "City of Sadness" (April 23), the first Taiwanese film ever to  take a major festival award -- grand prize at the Venice Film Festival -- is  remarkable in many ways. It has the density of a good novel, compressing years  of frenzied social history -- from the end of World War II to the Chinese  Revolution -- into the experiences of one family. Involved in the local  underworld, this family slides dizzily down to disaster; meanwhile, their  country careens through one social convulsion after another. The movie's view  is calm and ironic, even during the most horrendous events. It's so packed with  life, incident and rich detail, it can barely be assimilated on a single  viewing.  </P> <P> "Birth" (April 22), the story of an old villager waiting in vain for the return  of a son arrested in an anti-government rally, marks the directorial debut of  noted Indian cinematographer Shaji. Sheila Benson worries "that harried  Americans can't (won't) slow their pulses down to the tempo of this fine,  moving and heartfelt film." Peter Rainer consider's Satyajit Ray's first film  in four years, "An Enemy of the People" (April 21), adapted from Henrik Ibsen's  play about plague and principle, "a beautiful transcription . . . one of the  most cinematically expressive 'filmed plays' ever made."  </P> <P> From Hong Kong, where they know how to make action movies, "A Terra Cotta  Warrior" (April 21), directed by Ching Siu Tung, is the slambang  fantasy-romance of your dreams: an Indiana Jones-style adventure about a  faithful 3,000-year-old warrior. The major pure-fun movie of the festival, it  features unusual collaborators: the special effects are by Tsui Hark, director  of "Peking Opera Blues," and the male star is Zhang Yimou, mainland Chinese  director of 1988's arthouse hit, "Red Sorghum."  </P> <P> After a 17-year absence, Japan's Hiroshi Teshigahara, director of "Woman in the  Dunes," returns to fiction features with "Rikyu" (April 24), in which the  legendary Buddhist priest and master of the tea ceremony clashes with his  hot-tempered warlord employer. Kevin Thomas finds it "an exquisite historical  tragedy . . . reminiscent in theme of 'A Man for All Seasons.' " Thomas also  recommends Turkish director Tunc Basaran's "Don't Let Them Shoot the Kite"  (Friday, Saturday), a film about a little boy incarcerated with his mother in a  women's prison.  </P> <P> "Island" (May 3), by Australian director Paul Cox ("Man of Flowers,"  "Vincent"), is about three women of different nationalities philosophizing  about life on a Greek isle. It's a beautifully shot, but enervated drama,  enlivened mostly by the fiery performance of Irene Papas.  </P> <P> The South African "Jobman" (Friday, Saturday), directed by Darrel Roodt, is an  exciting, unsurprising action fable in which a mythical black hero and his  white boss and former playmate head toward inevitable, murderous collision.  </P> <P> Eros Djarot's "Woman of Courage" (April 23), based on the Dutch wars and the  career of rebel-heroine Tjoet Nja 'Dhien, is one of the most lavish productions  in Indonesian history. That money has bought a lot of nobility, sacrifice,  betrayal, capering clowns, scowling villains, cynical go-betweens, stirring  sermons and glorious defeats. It still wasn't well-spent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cine Latino  </P> <P> This section, usually one of the strongest at AFI / L.A. FilmFest, gets no  recommendations from Times reviewers. Kevin Thomas considered the Brazilian  "Better Days Ahead" from Carlos ("Bye Bye Brazil") Digues "a major  disappointment," and its tale of a Rio actress dreaming of Hollywood stardom  "too wan for us to take seriously any of the implications, cultural, political  or otherwise." Chris Willman, thought Arturo Ripstein's cynical romance, "White  Lies" (April 22) a "nicely shot and utterly bleak Mexican psychodrama...strong  stuff, but mostly for diehard anti-romantics." Peter Rainer found Beda Docampo  Feijoo's Argentinian "Loves of Kafka" (April 22) a "dreary oddity" and thought  Jorge Marrale, the actor playing Kafka, bore "an unfortunate resemblance to  Albert Brooks."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Los Angeles Black Independent Cinema  </P> <P> The meat of the L.A. black independent film selections -- including  </P> <P> Charles Burnett's superb "Killer of Sheep" -- turns up in the festival's second  week. Meanwhile, Billy Woodberry's "Bless Their Little Hearts" (Saturday),  scripted by Burnett, is a sympathetic Cassavetes-style look at lower-class  black family life in Watts. Wendell Harris' "Chameleon Street" (Friday), a film  about an agile, amoral impersonator, won the grand prize at the U.S. Film  Festival in Park City, Utah, but Sheila Benson demurs: "It overreaches fatally,  in direction, writing, in the director's egocentric central performance and in  the film's erratic tone."  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Independent Features  </P> <P> Recommended: "Water and Power."  </P> <P> Pat O'Neill's "Water and Power" (April 25) is a genuinely inventive film:  chockful of ideas, witty, surprising, occasionally poetic. It's a many-leveled  portrait of Southern California, that uses multiple images,  "Koyaanisqatsi"-style time-lapse photography, snatches of TV shows and  Sternberg movies, a bright jazz score and ironically fractured wisps of  narration to drag us onto a floating tour of the state's body and soul.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Documentaries  </P> <P> Highly Recommended: Seminar with Michael Moore and "Roger &amp; Me." (AFI Mark  Goodson).  </P> <P> Recommended: "I Went to the Dance," "The Long Way Home," "Berkeley in the  '60s," "Preston Sturges: The Rise and Fall of an American Dreamer," "Hollywood  Mavericks."  </P> <P> Among the highlights of this strong section is an appearance by Michael Moore,  with his controversial "Roger &amp; Me" (Saturday.) Les Blank's "I Went to the  Dance" (April 22) is so rich you can taste it, a flavorsome gumbo of a movie  that spreads out a host of joyous Cajun music makers, zydeco stylists and such  geniuses as late accordionist Clifton Chenier. Michael Apted's mordant "A Long  Way Home" (April 26, 27) has a priceless subject which it reveals with  dispassionate skill: the rocky road of the idolized underground Leningrad band,  Aquarium, after well-meaning Americans sign them to record in the West.  </P> <P> Sheila Benson believes Kenneth Bowser and Todd McCarthy's "Preston Sturges"  (Saturday), about the great Hollywood comedy writer-director, "captures the  savor of the man for everyone not fortunate enough to know him, or his work,  well." Benson, who lived just across the Bay at the time, found "Berkeley in  the '60s" (April 25, 27) "outstanding . . . a careful, balanced job on a  complex, many-layered period," but thought "To Protect Mother Earth" (April 21,  24), with Robert Redford narrating the plight of Shoshones theatened by  government encroachment, "unthrilling, dogged stuff . . . no matter how good  its heart."  </P> <P> "Hollywood Mavericks" (Friday) is probably only for hard-core movie buffs, but  they'll enjoy the chance to hear people like Martin Scorsese and Alan Rudolph  talk about John Ford, Erich Von Stroheim and Orson Welles. Chris Willman was  sympathetic to the intentions of "Teatro" (April 21,22), about a Honduran  acting troupe directed by an American Jesuit, but thought it was ultimately,  "an interesting subject, haphazardly handled." Two more competent but  uninspired works are Jeff B. Harmon's "Afghan Trilogy" (April 26, 27) and Adam  Horowitz's "Home on the Range" (April 25, 26). The first follows the bizarre  attempts of the old residents of the Kwajalein Atoll, now a nuclear test  center, to reclaim their island. The second takes an idiosyncratic look at the  participants in a surprising war, including the local Ismaeli Defense Chief,  whose favorite song is AC / DC's "Highway to Hell."  </P></p>

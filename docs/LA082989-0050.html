			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOY, 16, IS CHASED, BEATEN, FATALLY SHOT  </P> <P> A 16-year-old Sylmar boy was killed Monday morning in San Fernando by four  assailants, apparently in the mistaken belief that he had killed a member of a  gang they associated with, authorities said.  </P> <P> The four suspects rammed the motorcycle Jimmie Torrez was riding and, when he  fell off, beat him and shot him with a rifle, authorities said.  </P> <P> Shortly after the shooting, three men and a 16-year-old boy were arrested on  suspicion of murder and were being held without bail at the San Fernando Jail.  </P> <P> Torrez "was wrongly identified as a suspect in a gang killing," San Fernando  Police Sgt. Michael Harvey said. "The guys who chased him down thought he had  killed a friend of theirs. But he was not a suspect."  </P> <P> The earlier killing occurred several weeks ago in the Pacoima area, Harvey  said. He said the victim of that slaying was a gang member and the four  suspects in the Torrez killing were associated with the same gang. Police said  they had no information that Torrez belonged to a gang.  </P> <P> Witnesses described the assailant's car to San Fernando police and the vehicle  was sighted shortly afterward about a half-mile from the shooting scene,  Sheriff's Deputy Chris Wahla said. The car was halted and the suspects were  arrested without incident.  </P></p>

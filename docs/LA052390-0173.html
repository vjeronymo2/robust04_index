			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THOMPSON ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL  </P> <P> A producer of pornographic movies testified Tuesday that she saw widespread  drug use during a five-hour visit to the home of gonzo journalist Hunter S.  Thompson last winter.  </P> <P> Thompson, 52, charged with four felony counts of possession of illegal drugs  and dynamite, appeared in Pitkin County District Court for a pretrial hearing,  where he was ordered to stand trial.  </P> <P> The writer had originally faced an additional felony cocaine possession charge  and one misdemeanor count of sexual assault, but those charges were dismissed  at the daylong hearing.  </P> <P> The charges were filed after the producer, Gail Palmer-Slater, 35, told  sheriff's deputies she was assaulted during a visit with Thompson at his Woody  Creek home outside Aspen on Feb. 21. She told deputies Thompson grabbed her  left breast.  </P> <P> Presiding Judge Charles Buss of Grand Junction said there was enough evidence  to establish probable cause for a trial, but dismissed one count charging  cocaine use and one of sexual assault. He scheduled a motions hearing for June  25-26 in Pitkin County District Court.  </P> <P> Thompson did not testify at the hearing. At the conclusion, when the judge read  the charges against him, Thompson stood and pleaded innocent to all counts.  </P> <P> "If this is the American legal system, we're all in trouble, we're all in  trouble," Thompson said as he left the courtroom.  </P> <P> Palmer-Slater said her purpose in meeting with Thompson was to obtain the movie  rights to his novel, "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."  </P> <P> After arriving at Thompson's house about 7 p.m., Palmer-Slater testified, she  witnessed use of drugs by Thompson and several of his friends. She said she was  offered some "white powdery fluffy stuff," which she refused.  </P> <P> At one point, she said, Thompson walked into the kitchen, looked at the counter  and said, "Oh look, coke," and dipped his head into the substance.  </P> <P> Thompson, his nostrils covered with a white residue, said, "There's coke  everywhere I look in this house. That's why I love this house," Palmer-Slater  testified.  </P></p>

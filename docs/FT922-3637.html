			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / India's bankers back interbank market overhaul CHIEF executives of most of the largest banks in India met the governor of the central bank, Mr S. Venkitaraman, yesterday to agree to an overhaul of the country's interbank market in the wake of the Rs30.8bn (Pounds 600m) Bombay stock market fraud disclosed in recent weeks. Sweeping changes , proposed in a report last week by Mr R. Janakiraman, the bank's deputy governor, have been agreed, including the separation of banks' securities activities into three units: investment management, record keeping and safe-keeping of securities. Failure to separate these functions has made it easier for executives in some of the country's largest banks to generate fictitious deals and divert money from the market. 'Everyone wants a market place that reduces risk,' said one chief executive present at the meeting. Mr Venkitaraman is to travel to London this week for a meeting of central bank governors, and expects to meet the chairman of Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank that has total exposure of Rs10.55bn (Pounds 195m) in the affair. Standard Chartered is understood to hold 15 trunkloads of securities lodged with it by Mr Hiten Dalal, one of the brokers who has been named in the affair. The bank is still in the process of itemising these piles of shares, public sector bonds and other securities, and has yet to put a total value on them. However, it believes they will cover a substantial part of its exposure. All the assets of Mr Dalal and others named in the affair were impounded on Monday by Mr A K Menon, the custodian appointed by the government to recover money lost by the banks.</p>

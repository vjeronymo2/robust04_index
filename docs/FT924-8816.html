			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Colombia squeezes guerrilla cash flow PRESIDENT Cesar Gaviria of Colombia has outlined a series of security measures designed to strike at the financial heart of Colombia's guerrilla groups. In particular, the government will be able to cancel contracts with foreign and domestic companies found to be paying protection money to the guerrillas. Banks will be held responsible for accounts containing ransom money. The measures, outlined at the weekend in response to a wave of attacks by the country's guerrilla groups, are part of a 90-day state of emergency. Mr Gaviria virtually shut the door on any further peace dialogue with the rebels, warning that officials who maintained contacts with the guerrillas might be sacked. The guerrillas, he said, were no longer the vanguard of the revolution but the rearguard of the drugs traffickers, pursuing riches through kidnaps, blackmail and paid killings. Over the last four years some 17,000 people have died in Colombia's political violence. The two main guerrilla armies - the old-style Soviet-line Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and the Castro-oriented National Liberation Army (ELN) - have some 80 fronts with over 8,000 combatants between them and control large areas of the country. Both the FARC and the ELN exact payments from companies working in areas they control. Documents captured by the security forces apparently show that the ELN gained nearly Dollars 30m from kidnapping and extortion in 1991. The government now plans to embargo funds and properties linked to guerrilla groups and to support an anti-kidnap law which would allow the freezing of all bank accounts belonging to kidnap victims. The guerrillas' power in oil-producing areas is such that they have forced local governments into handing over money from oil royalties. The royalties will now be administered by the central government. Mr Garivia also announced restrictions on the press. All these measures will go hand in hand with the strengthening of counter-guerrilla units, improved intelligence and a nationwide communications network to supply information on guerrillas.</p>

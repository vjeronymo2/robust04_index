			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Walesa makes his peace with Solidarity union President Lech Walesa made peace with the Solidarity trade union movement and attacked Poland's centre-left coalition government at the weekend for slowing down reform, in the opening salvoes of what promises to be a long campaign to win him a second term in elections due in November 1995. 'The left wing's paw has grown too large,' he told sceptical delegates at Solidarity's annual congress. Mr Walesa led the movement to victory over the communists five years ago but the union last year refused to invite him, for failing to support the movement's shop floor aims and being 'too soft' on the former communists, the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD). The SLD has been in government with the PSL farmers' party since the autumn of 1993. 'Old methods of government are returning, Poland faces the threat of stagnation,' Mr Walesa said as he appealed to the union to agree to become part of a federation of Solidarity-based parties to win parliamentary elections in 1997 and next year's presidential ballot. Soon after the president's speech Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister, went on television to say that Poland's Mass Privatisation Scheme (MPP), covering 460 state sector enterprises, would be going ahead ahead. Mr Pawlak has recently come under attack from opposition politicians and the media for delaying the scheme, under which the Polish people are to be given shares in specially established investment funds. The funds, which will stay in existence for 10 years, are in turn to be handed equity in the 460 companies. The scheme has acquired a significance far outweighing its actual impact on privatising Poland's 5,000 or so state sector enterprises as both the World Bank and the IMF have made disbursement of loans, helping to finance Poland's recent London Club commercial bank debt reduction deal, conditional on the MPP moving ahead. Mr Pawlak, however, dismissed opposition warnings that Poland's standing with these institutions would plummet and the debt agreements collapse as a result of the delay since July. Instead Mr Pawlak explained he was worried that foreign fund managers were being given too great a role in the MPP. He also expressed his view that the enterprises which were to be privatised through the scheme had been undervalued. Once these doubts had been removed the plan would go ahead, Mr Pawlak said. A cabinet meeting is to examine the programme tommorrow.</p>

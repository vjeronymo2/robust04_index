			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 29 (TANJUG) -- Vice President of the  State Duma (lower chamber of Russian parliament) and of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia Aleksandr Vengerovskiy said  in Belgrade on Tuesday that a military-political alliance should  be formed between Russia and Yugoslavia, that Russia should  return to the Balkans and that it supports those peace  initiatives which really lead to peace in the territory of  former Yugoslavia.    Summing up the impressions and conclusions of the several  days long visit of the Russian parliamentary delegation,  Vengerovskiy told a press conference that the sanctions against  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are not necessary. If Europe  does not understand this, we can do the same thing, already  tomorrow Europe might be left without Russian gas, Vengerovskiy  threatened.    Vengerovskiy told reporters that he had not had the chance  to  find out the official stand of Belgrade on the conclusions  reached by the Russian delegation during their visit to  Yugoslavia.    Official stands, he added, are interpreted through official  statements by state organs. When we return to Moscow, we shall  make a list of proposals, on the basis of what our impressions,  for further actions which will be assessed not only here but  also in New York, Vengerovski said in the familiar style of the  controversial leaders of this Russian party, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy.    The Russian delegation arrived in Yugoslavia last week at  the  invitation of the extra-parliamentrary rightist party, the  Serbian National Renewal Party.    Member of the Committee for Security and Defence,  independent  deputy Yevgeniy Fedorov said that serious changes had taken  place in the Russian Army now, which voted for the  Liberal-Democratic Party practically 100 percent at the last  elections. In spirit the army is ready for changes in the  country's foreign policy, he said, and for military cooperation  with Yugoslavia.    Deputy President of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia  Valentin Minakhov assessed that the U.N. Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia were there only for appearances'  sake and were protecting the interests of only one side.  Minakhov announced that they would raise the question of the  deployment of Russian troops in Prevlaka, a controversial  peninsula on the border between the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia and Croatia where UNPROFOR are deployed, because the  U.N. peace-keepers did not permit the Russian parliamentarians  to visit Prevlaka.    Minakhov also announced that Zhirinovskiy would visit  Belgrade again in mid-May this year. Serbian National Renewal  Leader Mirko Jovic, who is host to the Russian delegation, said  that the main objective of the visit and cooperation with  Russian parties was to renew old friendships and the military  alliance with Russia.</p>

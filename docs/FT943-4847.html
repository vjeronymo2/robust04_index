			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Wrong number .. The government was accused yesterday of allowing the commercial interests of foreign manufacturers of tele-communications equipment to override the needs of up to 8m partially deaf phone users in the UK. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, alleged that the Department of Trade and Industry had bowed to concerted lobbying and had agreed to a new specification for the earpiece of phones which would reduce the volume level by 25 per cent. He claimed that leaked documents showed that the change had been agreed by the DTI and the British Standards Institute 'in secret' to avoid a public outcry. Mr Griffiths said: 'The DTI's handling of this issue is an insult to deaf people. I am seeking a meeting with the prime minister to demand that this policy is reversed.'</p>

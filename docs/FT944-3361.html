			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Clinton may propose a cut in taxes In an effort to recapture the initiative from the new Republican majority in Congress President Bill Clinton is tomorrow considering proposing a middle class tax cut when he outlines his plans for the next two years. The Republicans intend to push through a tax credit of Dollars 500 per child for families earning up to Dollars 200,000 a year, a measure which they expect would cost Dollars 107bn over five years. Congressman Richard Gephardt, the new leader of the minority Democrats in the House of Representatives, yesterday proposed his own income tax cut, which would apply only to those earning less than Dollars 75,000 a year but regardless of whether or not they have children. Mr Clinton says he will only propose a 'middle class tax cut' if he thinks he can pay for it with offsetting savings. However, the White House remains split on how exactly to structure a tax cut and on how the president should shape his overall strategy in the wake of the Democrats' devastating defeat in the congressional elections on November 8. White House discussions are centred on a tax break for families with children, like the Republican plan, but with a much lower income ceiling, costing between Dollars 50bn and Dollars 80bn over five years. In a number of small but symbolic ways Mr Clinton's decisions over the last month have seemed calculated to position him further to the right - a swift intervention to persuade the Postal Service not to cancel its traditional Christmas stamp featuring a Madonna, the firing of Surgeon-General Joycelyn Elders, a favourite target for right wingers, and encouragement for allowing prayer in schools. The Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank, last week proposed its own policy agenda for the defeated Democrats to 'reclaim the vital centre in American politics' while left-wing Democrats have simultaneously warned Mr Clinton that it would be political suicide to paint himself as a watered-down Republican. Mr Gephardt's tax cut proposal yesterday appeared designed to distance congressional Democrats from a president who many now feel is a liability for the party, and the House Democratic leader went out of his way to point out that the plan had not been co-ordinated with the Clinton administration. Doubts about the right strategy have been reflected in the White House's to-ing and fro-ing about Thursday night's speech. Although Mr Clinton wanted to lay out his plans for the next two years sometime before Christmas, it was not until Monday evening that the speech was firmly written into his diary. The battle over who can propose the most attractive tax cut for the middle class - defined, as is usual in American politics, to include virtually everyone - has dismayed the Congress's purest fiscal conservatives, who worry about the persistence of high budget deficits.</p>

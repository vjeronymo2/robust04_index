			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rafael Candanedo] </F>   [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- The  chiefs of state and government, who are attending the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit, will call for a deepening of regional  integration and economic expansion processes to revive their  economies and create more jobs.    This goal is contained in the Cartagena de Indias  Declaration, a 19-page document, which will be signed tomorrow  by the leaders, as they close the two-day meeting that opened  today at the Convention Center of this city on the Colombian  Caribbean coast, a city that was declared a historic heritage of  humanity.    The text, which was negotiated at initial meetings involving  foreign ministers and technicians of 21 countries, promotes a  reinforcement of economic relations and of the various  integration processes. It followed the general topic of the  meeting, "Trade and Integration as Factors for Ibero-American  Development."    The document calls for the "convergence" of existing  integration mechanisms, for an American trade liberalization,  for the expansion of economic relations with all countries and  regions, even with the Pacific Rim, and for an expansion of  trade and investment between Latin America and the EU. As for  the latter, the declaration points out that Spain and Portugal  constitute "privileged points of contact" between the two  continents.    This fourth summit was attended by 20 chiefs of state, and  by  Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Portuguese Prime  Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, and Vice President Carlos Morales,  who represented Dominican Republic President Joaquin Balaguer,  87, who was advised by his doctors to not travel due to his  glaucoma problem.    "It is expected that the liberalization process and the  promotion of multilateral trade and investment will create new  and necessary vigor for international economic activity that  will bring about and higher employment levels," the final  document states.    The Ibero-American summit voices hope that GATT and its  future transformation into the World Trade Organization, in  keeping with an agreement signed in April, will be an instrument  that will help strengthen the sector's multilateral system.    The declaration states that the pact clearly regulates the  commercial stands of the countries, strengthens mechanisms to  settle controversies, and decreases the risk of applying  unilateral measures to protect inefficient sectors of the  economy.    The spirit of open regionalism, which should rule the  regional integration processes, is considered to be a complement  of the main elements of development such as the strengthening of  the democratic system, access to new technologies, macroeconomic  stability, economic revival, social cohesion, and environmental  policies.    The Cartagena summit reviewed such Latin American  sub-regional integration agreements as the Central American  Integration System, the Free Trade Agreement of the Group of  Three (Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia), the Caribbean Common  Market (Caricom), the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), and  the complementary economic pacts within the framework of the  Latin American Integration Association (ALADI).    The summit also mentioned the importance of the Brazilian  proposal to create a South American Free Trade Area (ALCSA)  based on Mercosur and pointed out that NAFTA, signed by the  United States, Mexico, and Canada, will have reverberating  effects throughout the American continent.    The rulers are recommending the strengthening of Latin  American-European relations in order to promote a balanced trade  by means of identifying the adequate mechanisms to hold talks  and to promote cooperation.    In addition, the heads of state are advocating the  modernization of state apparatuses through programs to modernize  and minimize bureaucratic procedures, increases in the  participation of the private sector in the construction of  infrastructure, and the creation of a scientific community.    In what constitutes a direct reference to the historic  dispute between the United States and Cuba, the Cartagena de  Indias Declaration advocates the elimination of "coercive" and  unilateral economic and commercial measures that could affect  free international trade movements and could "hamper" the Latin  American peoples' living conditions.    For the past 32 years, the United States has imposed an  economic and commercial embargo on Cuba as a punishment, because  leader Fidel Castro implemented a communist political system in  1959.    The Fifth Ibero-American Summit will take place next year in  Argentina, possibly at the tourist resort city of San Carlos de  Bariloche, in southern Argentina.</p>

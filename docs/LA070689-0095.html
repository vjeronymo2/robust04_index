			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: HE CAN TRADE PLAYERS BUT NOT IMAGE  </P> <P> On Page 168 of his book, "Jack of All Trades," Jack McKeon says: "I promise  you, I will never manage the San Diego Padres."  </P> <P> There are those who think he has kept his word, that what he has done since  stepping down -- or sideways -- from the general manager's job can hardly be  construed as managing.  </P> <P> Or, it's possible that the San Diego Padres cannot be managed. They are, like  San Diego itself, kind of bland, mild, not terribly interesting, a team with an  annual average temperature of 70, light winds out of the southwest and tomorrow  more of the same. Pure vanilla. White bread. Naturally decaffeinated. Unleaded  regular. Sea World East.  </P> <P> They keep getting cranky managers to see if they can light a fire under this  bunch, but it always fizzles out. This is a team that traded away Ozzie Smith,  who is only the greatest shortstop who ever turned a double play; Kevin  McReynolds, Dave Winfield, Kevin Mitchell.  </P> <P> They once had a 20-game winner whose fastball looked like a changeup. You got  two swings at it. They're not a team, they're a drag.  </P> <P> They drove tough-guy managers Dick Williams and Larry Bowa up the wall.  </P> <P> It is a team that needed a couple of characters. So they got Jack McKeon to  come out from behind a desk and onto the field to see if he could get these  guys to, at least, frost a mirror.  </P> <P> Baseball lately has been getting like the rest of American business --  computerized, depersonalized, a kind of commodity market in spikes. They get  managers up through the ranks -- organization men. B-o-r-r-r-i-n-g.  </P> <P> Many years ago, when the New York Yankees hired Casey Stengel, a man who had  never won anything but laughs, who was widely regarded as a buffoon, not a  baseball man, the reaction was, "Well, there goes the dynasty!"  </P> <P> Well, Casey won 10 pennants in 12 years, rewrote English syntax and, above all,  made it fun.  </P> <P> A lot of us thought Jack McKeon might do somewhat the same for the San Diego  Padres. The Padres, to be sure, are not to be confused with the Stengel Yankees  -- or any other kind of Yankees, for that matter -- but they figured McKeon  might liven them up. The Padres had tried the Obersturmbannfuhrer approach and  it didn't work, maybe the light approach could do it.  </P> <P> Jack is not one of those guys who goes around letting birds out of his cap. But  he does have a sense of humor and that right there would be a switch for San  Diego.  </P> <P> Jack is a guy who once pulled a gun out of his pocket and fired blanks at one  of his players who ran through his stop sign in the third base coaching box.  The fellow was out anyway when he covered his head and hit the deck halfway to  the plate, but Jack thinks his lesson got home even if his runner didn't.  </P> <P> Another time, Jack bought a clothesline to tether one of his adventurous  runners.  </P> <P> "It's all in my book," reminded Jack the other night as he stood on the steps  of the dugout in Dodger Stadium and watched his pitcher warming up. "You could  do those things in the minor leagues. You could have fun."  </P> <P> Jack once wired up his pitcher to a two-way hookup and radioed him when a guy  would take too big a lead at first.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, I forgot to tell my first baseman, and the first throw over  there hit him right in the head," McKeon said.  </P> <P> The minor leagues, contends Jack, had a higher concentration of flakes than  Kellogg's. For instance, you ever hear of a pitcher protesting a called third  strike? McKeon did.  </P> <P> His pitching staff had been burned so often on 0-2 pitches that he announced he  would fine any pitcher throwing an 0-2 strike. His pitcher, on an 0-2 count,  threw a pitch so high and away the catcher had to leap for it.  </P> <P> "Strike Three!" yelled the ump.  </P> <P> Off the mound came the irate pitcher, screaming, "That ball was high! That's no  strike!"  </P> <P> As a wheeler-dealer, Jack had a reputation of a guy who would trade Ruth and  Gehrig just to shake things up. Since he didn't have them, he did the next best  thing: Smith and Kevin Mitchell.  </P> <P> Actually, Jack traded players by the carload -- an 11-player deal once, an  eight-player swap another time, two seven-player transactions, two involving  six and two involving five. Unaccountably, it worked. Jack actually put  together the team that won the 1984 National League pennant.  </P> <P> It's not likely that Jack McKeon can turn the Padres into the Gashouse Gang,  but they do need a little lightening up. They need a little fizz. They have the  talent to win. Provided Jack doesn't trade it away. All he has to do is make  the Padres exciting.  </P> <P> If he can do that, think what a cinch Calvin Coolidge would have been for him.  </P></p>

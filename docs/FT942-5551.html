			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: ISMA moves on settlement period The International Securities Market Association (ISMA) is to move to a three-day settlement period for all international securities trades with effect from June 1 1995. The change, announced at ISMA's annual meeting, coincides with a reduction to three-day settlement in the US corporate bond market. Currently, the standard settlement period for international bonds is seven calendar days. The reduction to three business days, rather than two, was favoured due to time zone, funding and foreign exchange difficulties. 'It became apparent early on in our meetings that (two-day settlement) would not be a realistic option for all ISMA members, due to the passing of information such as settlement instructions in different time zones,' said Mr John Dowsett, chairman of the settlement working committee. For three-day settlement, a business day is defined as 'a day when both the major international clearing systems (Euroclear and Cedel) and the relevant cash markets of the underlying cash transaction are open.' Allowance will also be made for public holidays falling between trade and settlement dates. There are three main reasons for the change, according to Mr Dowsett: it will reduce systemic risk (the potential knock-on effect created by the failure of one institution to meet its obligations); market risk (the effect of price swings between trading and settlement dates); and counterparty risk (the risk of the financial failure of one party). The shorter settlement period will also apply to domestic securities traded under ISMA rules, subject to local rules. The working committee's decision was not unanimous. Mr Alain Servais, of Dewaay Servais, a Belgian broking firm, registered reservations on behalf of members from his region. A shortening of the settlement period presents special difficulties for Belgian members as many Belgian retail investors hold their bonds in physical form.</p>

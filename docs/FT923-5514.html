			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Improved position at Lincoln House Despite the worsened economic recession in the UK, Lincoln House, the furniture maker, has continued to improve its position. In the first half of 1992, it cut pre-tax loss to Pounds 24,000, against Pounds 247,000 and Pounds 853,000 in the two corresponding periods. Furniture making - other businesses have been discontinued - made an operating profit of Pounds 99,000 (loss Pounds 31,000) on turnover of Pounds 4.06m (Pounds 4.61m). That was the result of substantial improvements in the product range and customer base combined with tight managerial controls. Mr David Harland, chairman, said that the large interest burden had been partially addressed by the sale of Impala Displays and Mayers &amp; Shaw, but 'there is still some way to go in reducing this cost'. Losses per share were cut to 0.15p (1.53p).</p>

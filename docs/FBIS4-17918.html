			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tair Mansurov, ambassador of the Republic of </F> Kazakhstan to Russia, by Pavel Shinkarenko, under the rubric  "Event of the Day"; place and date not given: "Instead of the  CIS -- the Eurasian Union? In Conversation with your  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Correspondent, Tair Mansurov, Ambassador of  the Republic of Kazakhstan, Considers New Forms of Deepening the  Integration of the Post-Soviet Republics"]    [Text] The idea of creating a Eurasian Union consisting of  the CIS member countries belongs to Nursultan Nazarbayev,  president of Kazakhstan. When putting this idea forward at a  meeting with professors and students of the Moscow State  University, Nursultan Abishevich was being consistent. Several  times previously he had put the proposal to strengthen  cooperation among the former Union republics to his colleagues  in the Commonwealth. He received the Treaty on Economic Union  with satisfaction and supported the Collective Security Treaty.  Now there is this new initiative.    "It is hard to call the present CIS a Commonwealth,"  Kazakhstani Ambassador Tair Mansurov said, explaining his  president's proposal. "In the three years of its existence over  400 joint documents have been adopted, but more than half of  them have not been ratified by the national parliaments and  those which have been ratified are not operating. In addition,  some members of the CIS are in a state of open war and many are  waging economic battles against one another. In these  conditions it is hard to talk about the mutual aid and support,  characteristic of a really integrated association..."    My interlocutor was a builder by trade, a politician by  necessity. For more than 10 years he built homes and industrial  facilities, worked for the party, was elected to Kazakhstan's  Supreme Soviet, and represented his people in the USSR  parliament's Soviet of the Republics. At the same time he  directed the "Kazakhstan" development fund, which performs  educational and cultural functions. In January 1994 he accepted  N. Nazarbayev's proposal to head the embassy in Moscow. He  recently presented his credentials to President Yeltsin. He is  a convinced supporter of political and economic union with  Russia. He took part in the top-level talks during the  Kazakhstani President's first official visit to Russia recently.  He is proud of the fact that he has contributed to the  elaboration of 23 draft interstate agreements signed at the  level of presidents and heads of government, including the  treaties on Baykonur and the simplification of the procedure for  obtaining citizenship when residents move from Russia to  Kazakhstan or vice versa.    "Nursultan Abishevich's new initiative -- on the Eurasian  Union -- is on the same plane," Tair Mansurov explained. "The  president's idea is that now, in conditions of the independence  and equal rights of the republics, it is possible to create a  completely new interstate association capable of overcoming the  shortcomings of the present CIS...."    Tair Mansurov said that President Nazarbayev sees three main  corner stones at the basis of the Eurasian Union:    -- Common supranational organs for the coordination  (management) of the economy, defense, and foreign policy;    -- A single economic area; and    -- A common defense complex.    The supranational institutions include councils of the heads  of state and the heads of government, the parliament, councils  of defense ministers and foreign ministers, and the interstate  executive committee -- a standing organ whose leader is  appointed by the heads of state for a term specified by them.  As for the single economic area, it can be built, for example,  on such foundations as the coordination of economic policy and  the adoption of obligatory joint programs, a common legislative  base to regulate relations among the economic components, a  supranational currency along the lines of the European ECU, the  coordination of direct ties between enterprises, the creation of  mixed and joint industrial-financial and transport firms,  trading houses, and commodity exchanges. The defense and  foreign policy complexes can be equally effective. Through its  executive committee the Eurasian Union should receive the status  of a fully-fledged representative in all the leading interstate  organizations.    "It goes without saying that innovation is always greeted  with caution," the ambassador said. "So it was that the  reaction to the Eurasian Union was mixed too. It is a pity that  Nursultan Abishevich was sick and unable to share his ideas with  the participants in the Moscow summit. But we know that many  projects that seemed unfeasible have in time been put into  practice. I believe that the same fate is in store for the  President of Kazakhstan's initiative.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There can be no question of resuming nuclear tests  at the Semipalatinsk test site, Kazakh leader Nursultan  Nazarbayev told Russian mass media leaders in Moscow on  Wednesday.    He said as many as 526 aerial, surface and underground  nuclear blasts had been carried out in eastern Kazakhstan in the  past 40 years. An estimated 500,000 people fell victim to the  tests and serious environmental damage was caused.    "Kazakhstan has so far been left alone to face those  problems. The Russian president and I discussed this at length  and I can now say with confidence that Russia will help us in  utilizing that large scientific complex for peaceful purposes.  For example, the Semipalatinsk site can be used for testing  safety systems of the nuclear power plants or as a space  training center in concert with Baikonur," Nazarbayev said.    At the same time, he called for an international commission  to be set up, Russia included, to assess the volume and nature  of damage caused to the people and environment. "This can at  least help set priorities in eliminating the harmful effects  from testing," Nazarbayev said.</p>

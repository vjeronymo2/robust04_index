			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WACHS URGES BAN ON USE OF AIRPORTS IN  MEDFLY WAR  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs on Friday proposed keeping city-operated  airports off-limits to helicopters used by the state to spray residential areas  with pesticide in the ongoing Medfly battle.  </P> <P> He said the state, which recently moved its Southern California Mediterranean  fruit fly helicopter operations from El Monte to the Riverside Municipal  Airport, is interested in using the Van Nuys Airport.  </P> <P> Wachs said that residents, who have endured repeated sprayings of malathion,  should not have to suffer also from having noisy helicopters taking off and  landing in their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Larry Cooper, a spokesman for the state's Cooperative Medfly Project, confirmed  that officials are negotiating with airport officials at Van Nuys. But he said  the state does not expect to use the San Fernando Valley airport more than once  or twice unless more Medflies are found in the Los Angeles area.  </P></p>

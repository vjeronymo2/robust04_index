Box 468, Piketon, Ohio 45661, an electric public-utility subsidiary company of American Electric Power Company, Inc. and Allegheny Power System, Inc., both registered holding companies, has filed an application under sections 9 and 10 of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OVEC requests authority to purchase or lease 515 railcars for approximately $22.7 million. OVEC proposes to use the railcars to deliver coal to its associate company, Indiana-Kentucky Electric Corporation's Clifty Creek Plant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To minimize the costs associated with the railcars, OVEC also proposes to sublease the railcars to its associate companies and, during times of non-utilization by OVEC and its associate companies, to non-affiliates. OVEC states that it would sublease the railcars only if the revenue generated by the sublease covered all variable costs and makes a contribution to the fixed costs of the railcars. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Central Power and Light Company, et al. (70&hyph;8345) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Central Power and Light Company, 539 North Carancahua Street, Corpus Christi, Texas 78401, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, 212 East 6th Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74119, Southwestern Electric Power Company, 428 Travis Street, Shreveport, Louisiana 71156, and West Texas Utilities Company, 301 Cypress, Abilene, Texas 79601 (collectively, ``Applicants''), all electric public-utility subsidiary companies of Central and South West Corporation, a registered holding company, have filed an application under sections 9(a)(1) and 10 of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants propose to lease owned unit trains and railcars to nonaffiliates through July 1, 1999.

Any leases will provide for lease rates at or near market rates at the time such leases are entered into. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants anticipate that leases of the owned unit trains and railcars to nonaffiliates will be a small percentage not expected to exceed an average of 50% of available unit trains and railcars for each Applicant. Rental income received from the leasing of unit trains and railcars will be recorded as credit to fuel stock account number 151 and will go to offset the depreciation of railcars and unit trains which is charged to this account.

In the event Rule 50 is rescinded as proposed by the Commission in HCAR No. 25668 (November 4, 1992), CNG requests authority to be permitted to issue and sell Debentures under competitive bidding including the aforesaid alternative procedures without prior Commission approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures will be added to CNG's treasury fund and subsequently used for general corporate purpose to: (1) Finance, in part, capital expenditures of CNG and CNG's subsidiaries, (2) displace roll-over of commercial paper previously issued for working capital purposes, (3) finance the purchase of CNG's common stock in the open market, and/or (4) acquire, retire, or redeem securities of which CNG is an issuer without the need for prior Commission approval pursuant to Rule 42 under the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

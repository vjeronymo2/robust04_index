Palestinian sources said 27 people were shot in the West  Bank, including 10 in a clash between troops and demonstrators  in the village of Nahalian near Bethlehem.    Seven Arabs were hit by army bullets in Gaza, they said.  Also on the strip, an alleged collaborator with the Israelis  was killed. PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat's mainstream Fatah group  claimed responsibility for the killing of Salim Alibani, who was  40. [passage omitted]    The army also sealed off the territories on Sunday  preventing  70,000 Palestinians from reaching their jobs in Israel. The  closure is to be enforced for another week, according to Israeli  television.    Troops were on alert for Friday, the day of Moslem prayers  and a week after the Hebron killings.</p>

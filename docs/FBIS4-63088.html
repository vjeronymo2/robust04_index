This fact is being  persistently concealed from the people, although I do not think  that the people will condemn their president because of this.  This information is still unofficial, but if the facts about  the signing of the agreement are confirmed, the government's  initiative can be understood only if the agreement was signed  with Russia's real masters."    How did the Armenian authorities react to this report? Levon  Zurabyan the president's press secretary described this  information as "gibberish and a completely groundless  fabrication."</p>

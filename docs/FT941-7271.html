			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: British Gas It is funny how British Gas, having spent 18 months claiming that it was being crushed by regulatory pressure, suddenly finds that 38 per cent of its staff and Pounds 600m of costs are surplus to requirements. The company argues that it has long had plans to retrench, but that without a clear regulatory framework it was unable to act. Yet the gas business has not had the kind of technological change which has, for example, transformed BT's manning needs. Nor can the Pounds 1.65bn restructuring cost have been an excuse for avoiding the issue, since the operation has an enviable 50 per cent rate of return. The suspicion must be that if these people are not needed now, they have not been needed since the company was privatised. It seems the monopoly was comfortably immovable until it was hit by the irresistible force that is Sir James McKinnon. Nor has British Gas found relief from regulatory pressure. In the medium term, the RPI-4 price cap and continued loss of market share will be hard to offset, even with these cuts. Gearing is still rising, despite a 27 per cent fall in capital expenditure on exploration and production. The sale of Consumers Gas in Canada will broadly cover the restructuring costs, but that only underlines how international ambitions will have to become more selective. A 5.4 per cent yield on the shares offers some defence. Even so, it is hard to see how real dividend increases can be sustained if the aim really is for a twice-covered payout.</p>

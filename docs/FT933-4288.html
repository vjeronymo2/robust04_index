			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Royal sells US reinsurance arm for Dollars 59m ROYAL Insurance, the composite insurer, yesterday announced the sale of its US reinsurance arm, American Royal, to the Australian group, QBE Insurance Group, for Dollars 59m (Pounds 39m). The sale represents 'a significant diminution of our reinsurance exposure which has been identified as non-core business longer term,' said Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive. Royal took the decision to withdraw from reinsurance earlier this year. At the end of 1992 American Royal had net written premiums of Dollars 41m and statutory net assets of Dollars 54m. Royal bought the group for Pounds 15m in 1983, when it was seeking to diversify the base of its reinsurance business outside Europe. The group made profits until 1992, when it sustained losses as a result of heavy losses from Hurricane Andrew.</p>

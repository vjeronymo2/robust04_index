			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / International Bonds: French franc Eurobonds attract strong interest STRONG international interest in French franc Eurobonds is being fuelled by the likelihood of further interest rate cuts. Real interest rates in France are among the highest in Europe, and the strength of the franc since the elections has restored confidence in the currency. New issue volume has already reached FFr60bn so far this year, almost half of last year's total, according to IFR Securities Data. With rates set to fall further, some borrowers may bide their time. But further cuts are likely to have limited impact on the long end of the market, as the yield curve is widely expected to steepen. Several French borrowers are looking at the long end, following a highly successful 19-year issue by Electricite de France last week. 'There has been consistent demand at the long end of the market, while buying at the short end is more speculative,' said Mr Luc Cardyn, head of syndicate at Banque Paribas. The anticipated cuts are expected to complete the transformation of the yield curve from negative to positive, making the market easier to trade. Currently, a trader holding 10-year French bonds yielding, say, 7 1/2 per cent, has to fund that position in the money market at, say, 9 per cent. This is called a negative cost of carry and it deters traders from holding inventory. Foreign borrowers have been encouraged by the narrowing of the yield differential between German bunds and French OATs, which is at a historically tight 50 basis points for 10-year bonds. This means some sovereign borrowers, which had found the market too expensive, are now reconsidering. However, there is still a lack of swap opportunities in the French market, which is likely to deter borrowers who do not want to take French francs. Nevertheless, the recent decline in rates has encouraged Spain to look again at the market, with a view to raising 20-year funds, without swapping the proceeds, bankers said. Other sovereign borrowers, such as Finland and Sweden, have also been eyeing the market. But the French market is less dependent than most on attracting foreign borrowers, since it boasts a wealth of strongly-rated French borrowers with a heavy requirement for French franc funding, mainly state-owned monopolies and financial agencies. The existence of a core of French borrowers has helped establish a strong domestic market. But the strength of investor demand from overseas investors has shifted attention from the domestic market. So far this year, there has been FFr46bn worth of domestic issues, compared with FFr52bn during the same period last year, according to Credit Commercial de France. Stronger demand from international investors has caused a tightening of yield spreads in the Eurobond market relative to the domestic market. Dealers said that new issues in the Eurobond market can be launched as much as five basis points tighter than in the domestic market. In spite of the potentially higher cost, the European Investment Bank is expected to launch a domestic issue this week. In practice, the dividing line between international and domestic issues has been largely eroded, as many overseas institutions now buy both Eurobonds and domestic bonds. The main technical difference between the two markets is that Eurobonds are in bearer form and domestic bonds are registered. More importantly, Eurobonds cannot be marketed by French banks through their retail networks, so domestic bonds are more widely held by small investors.</p>

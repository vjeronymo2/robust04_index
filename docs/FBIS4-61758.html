Following three hours of negotiations  behind closed doors, journalists' questions were answered by  Afiyaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Azerbaijan National  Assembly.    "It is hard to say whether some document will be signed at  the meeting," the head of the Azerbaijani delegation declared.  "Discussions are taking place, primarily concerning the  withdrawal of the Armenian armed formations from the territory  of Azerbaijan, the return of the refugees, and the establishment  of a lasting cease-fire." A. Dzhalilov observed that the  question of observers would be decided today. To the question:  "How does the Azerbaijani delegation view this request," A.  Dzhalilov said:    "We proceed from the fact that the conflict has grown into a  war and that Armenia and Azerbaijan should resolve this by  peaceful means. It is today a question of not burying the  problem in the `sand,' a war is under way on the territory of  Azerbaijan. One million refugees are living under tent-city  conditions. Because of this, reason must prevail."</p>

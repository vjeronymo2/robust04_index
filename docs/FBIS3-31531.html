In his  closing address to the National Convention of the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] Boross said that legislation should  continue to be given a dominant role in the future. However,  the executive power should also be given adequate scope.    According to Boross, there is a need for a foreign policy  which keeps in view the integration into the West as well as the  life of Hungarians beyond the borders.

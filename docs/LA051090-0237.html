Inc. today reported a 7% profit decline in the third  fiscal quarter despite a 9.5% jump in revenue.  </P> <P> The publishing and direct-mail concern, based in Pleasantville, N.Y., said net  income in the quarter ended March 31 totaled $59.3 million, or 50 cents a  share, down from $64.1 million, or 54 cents a share, in the year-ago period.  </P> <P> The company attributed the decline to a higher effective tax rate and a  non-recurring $13.1-million expense associated with the appreciation of stock  incentives offered to senior managers and editors.  </P> <P> Excluding the charge, net income would have totaled about $67 million.  </P></p>

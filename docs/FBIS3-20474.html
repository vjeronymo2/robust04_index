			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Installments No. 134, 135 of the serialized memoirs of Xu </F> Jiatun: "Xu Jiatun's Hong Kong Memoirs"]  <H5>  [15 Sep p 2] </H5>   [Text] A Second Set of Sharpening Political-System  Controversies (Part One of Two) -- The "Two-Council Consensus,"  "New 190," and "One Legislature in Two Bodies" Plans    Let us return again to the period after 4 June, to the  sharpening political-system controversy.    The British Government on one hand took a hard-line stand  with the Chinese Government, breaking off contacts between  senior Chinese and British officials, as well as refusing to  participate in the routine meetings of the Sino-British Joint  Liaison Group. On the other, it promoted, along with other  social forces with which it had ties, political-system plans,  such as the "two-council consensus plan," attempting to speed up  the pace of democracy, by putting pressure on the Chinese, while  vying for public influence with the radical democracy faction,  to limit its continued expansion. Teng Lien-ju [6772 5571 1172,  then chief member of the Executive Council [EXCO], stated  publicly that "whether the two councils [EXCO and LEGCO] could  reach a consensus (on shaping plans), would be affected to a  certain degree by the Beijing student movement of the time, as  well as the actions taken by Hong Kong residents in support of  it."    The radical democracy faction reproposed a new "190" plan,  recommending that the legislature in 1991 should have one-half  directly elected members, with all being directly elected by  1995. And they maintained their original proposal that the Chief  Executive be directly elected by the whole people in 1997.  They claimed that if Hong Kong could not establish a  democratic political system before 1997, it would be impossible  to practice democracy afterwards.    Even those in the industrial and business world and the  "middle-of-the-roaders," who had previously endorsed orderly and  gradual political-system development, changed to endorsing a  faster pace of democracy.    This situation sharpened the possibility that, as political  parties of all strata had not yet formed and the radical  democracy faction's forces were growing unprecedentedly, the  future legislature might be slanted toward the middle and lower  strata, or even toward the radical democracy faction.    At the time, Shao Shan-po [6730 0810 3134], deputy secretary  general of the Advisory Committee, suggested a "one legislature  in two bodies" plan, which Mao Junnian, deputy director of the  Hong Kong Office of the NCNA, delivered to me, noting that this  plan might be considered by the Working Committee.    This plan divided the legislature into two bodies, a  "district electoral body," and a "functional electoral body."  The "district electoral body" would use mixed elections, with  more than one-half of its members for the first two sessions  being directly elected, while the "functional electoral body"  would have its members elected by all functional circles,  similar to the Western upper and lower houses or two-body senate  and house.    If a bill was passed by both bodies, there would naturally  be  no problem. But if a bill was not passed by the body with the  directly elected legislators, but was passed by the other body,  creating a legislative impasse, then it would be decided by the  Chief Executive, or the two bodies would choose delegates to  study amendments, in an attempt to get it passed by both bodies.  And if this did not work, it could be decided by a two-thirds  majority of the whole legislature.    Shao Shan-po's plan at the time was merely a general  outline,  with the details yet to be considered. So I took this plan to  Beijing to be studied by the Hong Kong and Macao Working  Committee chaired by Ji Pengfei, where all supported it, holding  it to be a way out under the new situation since 4 June. But  after I returned to Hong Kong, while we were just studying how  to promote it and had not yet made specific plans, Lo Te-ch'eng  [5012 1795 0015] suddenly publicized it. I was very surprised.  How could Lo Te-ch'eng have known about this plan? And how  could he have gotten hold of it? I investigated this carefully  but to no avail.    Once Lo Te-ch'eng had presented the "one legislature in two  bodies" plan, the political-system controversy sharpened  immediately, with the various public forces that had been  promoting their respective plans now all directing their  spearheads at the "one legislature in two bodies," holding that  it was supported by the Chinese, which Lo Te-ch'eng had  asserted, and which was true. And certain coordination  movements also went into action in an attempt to join forces in  opposition to the "one legislature in two bodies."    As the "one legislature in two bodies" plan was not  consistent with the them climate of public demand for a faster  pace of democracy, we considered appropriately adapting to the  public tide, while keeping the legislative body from becoming  too slanted, to prevent an immediate sharp change in the SAR  political situation after 1997. In light of the over-emotional  public climate, in which it would be hard to keep this plan from  being criticized once it was out, we had planned to release it  step by step, to reduce the resistance to it. But who would  have guessed that Lo Te-ch'eng would rush it out ahead of us.  Lo Te-ch'eng's public image was not too good at the time, as  he had publicly stated his opposition to a faster pace of  democracy due to the 4 June incident, which had aroused an even  stronger public outcry. So the "one legislature in two bodies"  plan being put out by him made him a target "of attack" for a  time.  <H5>  [16 Sep p 2] </H5>   [Text] A Second Set of Sharpening Political-System  Controversies (Part Two of Two) -- The "One Legislature in Two  Bodies" and "4:4:2" Plans Become Points of Controversy; the  Chinese Side Recommends the "New Comprehensive Plan"; Results  Unclear    Before long, figures from industrial and business circles,  such as Lo K'ang-jui [5012 1660 3843], and  middle-of-the-roaders, such as Ch'eng Chieh-nan [4453 0094  0589], also put forth a new balanced "4:4:2" plan, for the Hong  Kong SAR's first legislative-body members to be 40 percent  directly elected, 40 percent from functional groups, and 20  percent through general elections. They emphasized that this  plan was coordinated by Hongkongers, being one that all could  accept.    Lo K'ang-jui and Lo Te-ch'eng were originally both members  of  the 89-person Industrial and Business Advisory Committee, but  were now each putting forth respective plans, which were  publicly called the "elder Lo" and "younger Lo" plans,  coexisting around the time of the "dual-Cha" plan, with the  "elder Lo" and "younger Lo" plans being originally two parts of  a confederation that were now diametrically opposed to each  other.    But the radical democracy faction held that these plans made  too many concessions, so continued to stick to its new "190"  plan.    By this time, we had received the news that the British Hong  Kong Government was also supporting the "4:4:2" plan, with other  sources claiming that this plan had come from the British Hong  Kong Government. We considered this second possibility unlikely,  with the greater likelihood being that British Hong Kong had  "received" and then supported it. The British Hong Kong  Government had probably considered the "two-council consensus"  plan to have too much of a British flavor, with very little  possibility of being accepted by the Chinese, so had tried to  have this [4:4:2] plan accepted by the Chinese through a  so-called three-faction coordination--of the industrial and  business world, the democracy faction, and the  middle-of-the-roaders. When [then Hong Kong Governor] Wilson  later clearly "recommended" the "4:4:2" plan to the Chinese,  this confirmed our guess.    Through contacts with certain senior British businessmen, we  indirectly confirmed this information, as they bluntly  "suggested" that they hoped that the Chinese would accept Lo  K'ang-jui's plan.    Many of my colleagues at the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA  knew Lo K'ang-jui, mostly having a good impression of him. It  was said that Lo K'ang-jui had built on the $100,000 HK that he  had received from his father, doing very well in business, as  well as taking unique political stands and views, being a rare  talent, about which I had the same impression.    In order to sell his "4:4:2" plan, Lo K'ang-jui asked for a  special meeting with me. While I listened to his briefing,  saying that we would consider his views, I also explained that I  really did not agree much with his stand, whereupon he shook  my hand in parting with a disappointed expresson on his face.    And when middle-of-the-roaders Chang Chia-min [1728 1367  2404] and Ch'eng Chieh-nan also asked to see me to brief me on  the "4:4:2" plan, I gave them the same response as I had to Lo  K'ang-jui.    In the debate over the many plans, public opinion sharpened,  focused mainly in areas, such as the "4:4:2," "one legislature  in two bodies," and "new 109" plans, with the "one legislature  in two bodies" and "4:4:2" plans becoming the points at issue.  At this time, some of the members of the 89-person Advisory  Committee from industrial and commercial circles proposed  synthesizing the two plans into a "new comprehensive plan," by  dividing the composition of LEGCO members into three  groups--functional, directly elected, and generally elected; and  changing the two bodies in the "one legislature in two bodies"  plan to a counting of votes by category. This was taken to  Beijing by Advisory Committee Deputy Director Kuo Chih-ch'uan  [6753 1807 2938], who introduced it to the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, winning real support. After they returned to  Hong Kong, they publicly recommended it to the public.    A working meeting on Hong Kong and Macao chaired by Ji  Pengfei discussed the matter of the political-system plans, with  all endorsing Li Hou's proposal to take the "new comprehensive  plan" as the base, and to synthesize it with the views of all  parties, in order to draw up a plan to be voted on at the last  meeting of the Drafting Committee. As to the number of  directly-elected legislative seats, while the British had  proposed 24 for 1995 and 20 for 1991, this meeting set the  "bottom line" at 20 for 1995 and 18 for 1991. This was the  basis on which we had to not only work with the Hong Kong  public, but also consult with the British.    In order to coordinate the setting forth of the "new  comprehensive plan," I gave a speech at a meeting of the Hong  Kong Preparatory Committee on the occasion of the 1989 National  Day [1 October], calling on all parties to cooperate  harmoniously, naturally hoping not only to ease the  political-system controversy, but also to alleviate somewhat the  antagonistic mindset of Hongkongers toward China after the 4  June incident. I originally guessed that this would have a  limited impact, and that the debate over the political-system  plans would not stop.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, May 12 (AFP) -- Southern forces in  Yemen's civil war shot down three northern warplanes and sank a  warship west of the vital port city of Aden, a southern  commander announced Thursday [12 May].    Colonel 'Ali Qasim Taleb, the sacked Yemeni Navy chief, told  the Aden daily OCTOBER 14 the northern targets were hit late  Wednesday in the Kharaz region, near the strategic Bab el-Mandeb  Straits on the Red Sea.    Earlier the northern forces loyal to President 'Ali  'Abdallah  Salih claimed they had captured a southern mechanised brigade  based at Kharaz.    A northern military communique quoted by the official news  agency SABA said northern forces had captured all the tanks and  artillery of the southern 25th Mechanised Brigade, and many of  the brigade's 1,200 soldiers had surrendered.    Southern leaders told AFP Wednesday that the north was  attempting to open up a new front in the Bab al-Mandeb Straits  area.    Both sides appeared to be heading for a stalemate along the  pre-unification border formerly dividing conservative North  Yemen and the Marxist south.    Salih's southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid, sacked by the  northern-dominated parliament last week, said a ceasefire  depended on the withdrawal of northern forces from the south.    "The return of forces to their positions (before unification  in May 1990) is an important condition for ending the fighting,"  al-Bid told reporters at his home overlooking Aden.    A simmering feud between Salih and al-Bid over political and  economic reforms boiled over into all-out war a week ago.</p>

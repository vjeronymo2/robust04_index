			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Christa Friedl: "Increased Recycling </F> Rewards Recyclers with Boom"; Subheadlines: "Entsorga 94: Every  Third Exhibitor Offers Waste Recycling Products and Services";  "Community Facilities to Produce High-Quality Products from Used  Materials Still Missing"]    [Text]Duesseldorf, 13 May 1994 -- Exhibitors at this year's  Entsorga fair are encountering an optimum basis for business in  Germany: the piles of waste are higher than ever before.  According to estimates by the Federal Association for German  Waste Disposal [BDE], last year they consisted of nearly 55  million tons [t] of household waste.    For this reason, recycling has never yet been so important  as  it is today. First, according to a forecast by the Berlin  federal environmental department, by the year 2000, every other  German household waste landfill will have used up its capacity.  Second, against the backdrop of the fair, BDE's principal  managing director, Frank-Rainer Billigmann, remarked: "Secondary  raw materials afford the sector great opportunities." Numerous  companies have already acknowledged this: almost every third one  of the nearly 1,550 exhibitors at Entsorga, from 18 to 21 May in  Cologne, is offering technologies, products and services  centered on secondary raw materials.    Still, it is easier to champion recycling than to practice  it. On the one hand, the recycling bill passed by the federal  parliament in April, expands the amounts of used material piling  up each year for recycling. On the other hand, private waste  disposers and communities for the most part still do have  facilities to produce products from used materials using modern  technology. The market itself is another hurdle for recycling.  As noted in a report on the sector that has just been submitted  by the market research firm of AIK [expansion not given]  Kohlhaas &amp; Partner in Krefeld: "Only if the price of used  materials covers the cost of collection systems can one expect a  working waste recycling system." The Krefeld firm considers  continued development of environmental engineering in the  direction of improved processes for recycling of used material  as the greatest prospect for the used materials business. Better  analysis and more effective sorting techniques will result in  purer sorting and, as a result, more valuable secondary  materials.    The sector's response to the recycling boom is the creation  of financially powerful waste disposal companies. But this  development is not meeting with general approval. Michael  Mueller, environmental spokesman for the Social Democratic Party  of Germany [SPD] remarks: "The processes leading to  concentration in the waste disposal business undercut  competition." A major parliamentary question to the federal  administration in March by the SPD aims at examining the threat  of monopolization. BDE spokesman Hanskarl Willms is also  convinced: "Concentration will continue in the sector. Many  waste disposal tasks can be tackled only by financially powerful  companies because of their sophisticated facilities and  technologies."    There is hardly any doubt that the large number of waste  disposal tasks will grow even more in the future. The reason is  that waste avoidance has so far been hardly successful.  According to AIK managing director Edgar Kohlhaas: "The  political machinery is missing." According to his prediction,  even in the future there will be no decline in the amounts of  waste material, at best they will hold steady. The new recycling  law already acknowledges this: in it recycling is not valued any  higher than incineration.</p>

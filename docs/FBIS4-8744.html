			<p>BFN     [Text] Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the Srpska republic  assembly, in Pale today held long talks with Russian special  envoy Vitaliy Churkin. Reporter Mirjana Kursmuk talked to  Chairman Krajisnik.    [Begin recording] [Kursmuk] Today you were supposed to meet  with the UN secretary general's special envoy Yasushi Akashi.  However, the meeting never took place. Can you tell us what  really happened?    [Krajisnik] Well, we received information that Mr. Akashi  and Mr. Churkin wished to meet with us. The first meeting was  set for 1130, and later for 1340. Only Mr. Churkin arrived, and  not Mr. Akashi. He told us that unforeseen difficulties had  arisen, and that Mr. Churkin [as heard] was called to return to  Sarajevo, so that he actually turned back when he was already on  his way and went back to Sarajevo [sentence as heard]. We  spent almost the entire day in talks with Mr. Churkin, trying to  find a solution, because the situation was very dramatic around  Gorazde itself and on the international level because there was  constant danger of another air attack. There were several  unconfirmed reports that our tank had entered the town of  Gorazde, that it was firing at Gorazde, and that this would be  reason for a military intervention. Not only support for the UN  Protection Force in the form of a military strike [as heard],  but a military intervention which would mean a general attack.  We managed to dispel this dilemma through constant contact with  our General Staff and our commanders on the ground, because our  tank was not in that position. We nevertheless issued orders  that fire was not to be opened on the town itself. After that,  pressure eased, and dilemmas regarding our attacks on Gorazde  were dispelled. We are still in the midst of talks, because  there is pressure for Serbs to withdraw away from Gorazde, but  the Serbs cannot withdraw. Moreover, they did not advance in  the course of the day. That was inaccurate information launched  by the Muslims. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Dewar denies delay in devolution THE LABOUR party in Scotland yesterday denied Scottish National party charges that it was backtracking on its promise to create a Scottish parliament as soon as possible after it was elected. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said a Scottish parliament could be established in the autumn of next year. Legislation would be announced in the first Queen's Speech of a Labour government and would be passed by July of next year. Mr Dewar was responding to a claim by Mr Jim Sillars, SNP deputy leader. He quoted Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, who said on Friday that the Scottish parliament would be created in 1994. Mr Sillars pointed to Labour advertisements saying 'a Labour government this year, a Scottish parliament next year'. He warned people not to trust Mr Kinnock - he had always opposed devolution and would find some way to wriggle out of the commitment. Mr Dewar said that once the act setting up a Scottish parliament was law, the procedure for setting it up would begin and elections would be held with time allowed for the parties to campaign. Meanwhile, Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat MP for Fife North-East, said a Scottish parliament would be law within six months of a election victory by Mr Paddy Ashdown. Mr Alex Salmond, Scottish National party leader, yesterday said an independent Scotland would honour existing North Sea oil licences.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / A less than settled future for Lt-Gen Ehud: The defence considerations of the new Israeli Chief of Staff WHEN Lt-Gen Ehud Barak, an officer whose academic record is almost as eyecatching as his impressive military exploits, took over as Chief of Staff of the Israel Defence Forces last month, he inherited a strategic outlook for Israel which looked a good deal rosier than it did four months ago, before the Gulf war. The Iraqi military threat to Israel, previously a top concern, had been dismantled; ascendant Arab leaders were moderates such as President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt while Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which backed Iraq, had been weakened. But there are other elements which are seen as less reassuring and are likely to preoccupy Gen Barak as he settles into his new post. They include the question of whether Israel's lack of response to Iraqi Scud missile attacks, damaged its all-important deterrent credibility, and concern about Syria. But probably the issue most immediately pressing is how to fund the hugely expensive high-tech weapons Israel now wants to acquire. Israel wants its own real-time satellite intelligence capability to combat surface-to-surface missiles like the Scuds, its own Patriot anti-missile batteries and wants to complete development, jointly with the US, of its still-nascent Arrow anti-missile system. The IDF says it will also continue to stress its offensive capability. It possesses - and Israel itself can produce - many of the precision weapons and systems used to such effect by the allies during the war against Iraq. But it wants more and better. The costs, however, are huge and the IDF has for some years been under considerable budgetary restraint. This is set to continue as the country is forced to devote big resources to the absorption of large-scale Soviet immigration. Already, Gen Barak has signalled that the IDF must slim down in size in order to be able to afford the weapons it wants. 'There is no escaping this,' said Col Ra'anan Gissin, the IDF deputy spokesman. 'We have to decrease the order of battle so we have less units but of higher quality. This is the major challenge that the new Chief of Staff will have to deal with.' Maintaining a qualitative edge is an important element in Israel's deterrent posture. One argument says this posture was undermined during the war when Israel, under pressure from the US, failed to deliver on its promise of massive retaliation. There is also some concern that the severe disruption to civilian life caused by the Scuds, despite low casualties, exposed an Israeli weakness to missile attacks on its civilian 'rear'. 'There is no doubt that more than a few strategists in Damascus and Tripoli estimate that if missiles based on 30-year-old technology can paralyse an entire country for two weeks, then the preferred action now is to acquire a greater number of more advanced ballistic missiles,' wrote military commentator Reuven Pedatzur. The contrary view is that the war showed Washington's willingness to defend Israel directly against unprovoked attack by sending Patriot missiles, enhancing Israel's deterrent strength. The IDF insists publicly on the latter view. But Col Gissin acknowledged that in future, the military will have to consider external restraints on its use of force. 'There may be situations where you have to hold back, not because of lack of necessary force or motivation,' he said. With Iraq removed as a threat, the main focus of IDF strategic concern has once again swung back to Syria. The outgoing Chief of Staff, Gen Dan Shomron, said Damascus does not look in a position to wage war against Israel, having lost the important possibility of heavyweight Iraqi support and unable to count on the backing of the Soviet Union, its traditional superpower sponsor. But the Israeli perception is that President Hafez al-Assad remains committed to achieving 'strategic parity' with Israel to give himself a credible military threat. Much concern has been voiced since the Gulf war ended over shipments of Scud-C missiles of much greater accuracy than the enhanced Scud-Bs used by Iraq, said to have been sent by North Korea to Syria. The other ever-present issue for Gen Barak is the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, now in its 40th month. At times  - most recently in remarks by Gen Shomron  - the IDF has appeared to suggest that it would favour some exchange of West Bank and Gaza territory for a political settlement that would free the military from policing a hostile population. This, however, cuts across the stance of the present government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, and Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, who appointed Gen Barak. They show no sign of shifting their position, whatever advice the army might offer. Illust. Ehud Bahak: Facing challenge of funding new weapons</p>

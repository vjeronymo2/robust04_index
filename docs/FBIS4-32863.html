			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bette Veloso from the federal Congress in </F> Brasilia]    [Text] Senator Joao Rocha [Liberal Front Party-Tocantins],  chairman of the Senate Economic Affairs Committee, has announced  that the committee will next week resume its debate on the draft  patents law.    Rocha said he awaits only the final report of Senator Jose  Richa [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Parana State], who is  the rapporteur of the proposal, to open the debate. The draft  patents law is designed to protect patents rights against acts  of piracy. The United States has gone so far as to demand the  approval of the law in order to continue to maintain trade  relations with Brazil.    The Brazilian Government had promised to have the law  approved by the middle of this month. Senator Rocha noted,  however, that this deadline is unfeasible. He noted that the  committee is not hurrying because it wants to pass a law that  will be in the best interests of the country.    Rocha believes that the draft industrial property law will  be  voted on only during the extension of the congressional recess  in July--if there is one--or during the second half of this year  during the electoral campaign.    The rapporteur has already announced that the proposal will  be amended in order to have its provisions conform with the  decisions included in the GATT accord, and it will have to go  back to the Chamber of Deputies after the Senate vote.</p>

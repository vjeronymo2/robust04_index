			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Lutfi Shatarah in London, </F> Naji al-Harazi and Hammud Munsir in Sanaa, 'Abd-al-'Aziz  al-Sadiqi in Abu-Dhabi, Muhammad Sadiq in Washington, and  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT bureaus in Aden and Cairo: "Shaykh Zayid  Holds Salih Responsible for the Continuation of the War"]    [Excerpt] As the fierce fighting intensifies between the  northern and southern forces on the al-'Anad-Kirsh and  al-Dali'-al-Rahidah fronts, it seems that the military  operations launched by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  from Sanaa have reached red lines which cannot be crossed and  that the situation now makes it necessary for the Arab and  international powers to take a clear stand. Signs of such a  stand have come from the United Arab Emirates [UAE] in holding  President Salih responsible for the continuation of the war. A  number of Yemeni leaderships have meanwhile considered a number  of options including secession.    UAE diplomatic sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that UAE  President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan frankly stated the  UAE's position to the Yemeni president in a telephone  conversation with him the day before yesterday, and said that he  "regrets the Yemeni president's failure to respond to repeated  appeals for a cease-fire."    The sources added that the UAE frankly stated its position  because "it has no common borders with Yemen and no direct  interest, and, therefore, being frank on the Yemeni conflict  does not place any political or diplomatic burdens on it and  would not leave room for anyone to doubt the UAE's goodwill and  objectivity."    The sources hope that the UAE position will be an incentive  for a number of other Arab states who are reluctant to declare  "a frank position on the crisis to follow the example of the UAE  as a way of putting pressure on Sanaa to agree to a cease-fire."  They also said that although the UAE was the first Gulf state  to sound the alarm, Shaykh Zayid "is still willing to make every  sincere and true effort to contain the situation, prevent  deterioration, and settle the dispute through dialogue in favor  of the Yemeni people's interests and stability."    Shaykh Zayid emphasized that "dialogue is the only way to  settle the Yemeni crisis. Yemen's interests must come before  all other considerations."    Observers saw indications of the UAE position in the  noticeable attention given to the visit of Salih Abu-Bakr  Bin-Husaynun, the Yemeni oil and mineral resources minister who  went there as an envoy of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice president  and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP],  compared with the cool official reception accorded to Foreign  Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah who went there as an envoy of  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that the announcement of the  Higher Salvation Council in Aden the day before yesterday came  after comprehensive discussions by the leaders of the YSP and  five other Yemeni opposition parties with the participation of  30 House of Representatives members from the southern and  eastern governorates. The discussions covered five main points  relating to the current options in the Yemen arena, as follows:    1. Appeal to the Arab kings and presidents, the United  Nations, and the world's parliaments to intervene to stop the  fighting, spare Yemeni blood, and prevent fragmentation of the  Yemeni homeland.    2. Announce partition and restoration of south Yemen's  independent international identity.    3. Ask a committee of deputies to visit some Arab and  foreign capitals and UN centers to inform the world of the  deputies' support for the YSP leadership.    4. Draw attention to the dangers of the emergence of a  regime that supports forces which violate Arab consensus and  forces of extremism.    5. Reaffirm the importance of the southern patriotic forces'  determination to resist the northern invasion of the southern  governorates.    The YSP leadership in Aden, however, has disclosed that it  is  currently studying a number of political options, especially  mobilizing national support in the north and the south for the  preservation of the unity state, and international support  against the "alleged legitimacy which is in fact seeking to  destroy that unity state and destroy all chances of a better  future for the Yemeni people."    A responsible source at the U.S. State Department has  confirmed that the United States "supports the efforts of the  Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] and the Arab League to stop the  fighting and settle the Yemeni crisis."

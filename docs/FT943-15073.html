			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Born-again Brazil find their rhythm - Paulo Sotero says his team's destiny is to win a fourth title If the teams playing in the World Cup are reflections of the countries they represent, as the experts in these things claim, the Brazilian national selecao is the perfect example. It could be said that we play like we govern ourselves. As in other fields, it is not for lack of individual talent or an abundance of collective resources that we are not doing better in the World Cup, though our 3-2 win against Holland at the weekend, which put us into tomorrow's semi-finals, against Sweden, has steadied our nerves somewhat. Not that our hearts weren't in our mouths as Holland rallied from 0-2 to 2-2 in Dallas, before Branco scored with nine minutes to go. After a draw with Sweden and a brush with disaster against the US, we were confronted with the reality that has afflicted us for years. The problem is leadership. As powerful as our team is, and as determined as they are to reclaim their status as a world soccer power, they have lacked direction and sense of purpose. Prior to Holland at the weekend, the game plan had resembled some features of the constitution we adopted in 1988: it does not allow the team to play to their full potential. More, our very ability gives our players an exaggerated sense of self-confidence. You could compare this to the abiding love we have demonstrated lately for democracy in the face of great disarray. We believe that somehow we are going to get through. But it is a messy way of doing things. It has worked so far, but it does not assure us of ultimate triumph. The same has been happening in the World Cup. Masters of their trade, our boys play with abandon, as if the outcome was guaranteed in advance. There is no sense of urgency. After all, we have always believed that God is Brazilian. Then, as happened in the game against the US, our shots on goal start hitting the post. We cannot find the net with shots that are impossible to miss. What's going on, we ask ourselves? The fear is that the Almighty, perhaps angry with our presumption, our arrogance and our carelessness, has applied for a green card (the US ticket for immigrants). And then bad luck - another feature of our recent play - sets in. With less than 20 minutes left we were still tied with the US. The unthinkable became possible. If we had been kicked out of the Cup by the inexperienced Americans, it would have been a catastrophe worse than the defeat by Uruguay in the 1950 final in Rio. It would have been the end of out self-esteem, the collapse of futbol in Brazil. We needed a miracle. The feeling was strangely familiar. It resembled the lousy game we have been playing with inflation, that infamous adversary of all national teams. First, we show complacency, believing that we can live with it. Then, as inflation starts to score big against our wallets, the possibility of a disaster becomes apparent. Put against the wall, we finally act. To dribble inflation, we use an elaborate play known as changing the currency. We are good at that. It is true that so far the magic has worked only temporarily. But it does put the adversary on the defensive for a while. The problem is that we have not explored the opportunities for scoring. But things may be changing. Recently, after the worrisome draw with Sweden and an alarming defeat in the monthly tournament against inflation (we lost 50 per cent to nothing), we reacted with the 'real,' our new currency. The name has less to do with 'reality' than with 'royal,' (strange in a country that actually bothered only a couple of years back to vote in a plebiscite to reject a monarchy). We Brazilians are tired of playing the same game against inflation. But the scenario is more favourable this time and the experts are optimistic. Things may be ready to change on the soccer field, too. After the scary game against the US, the people cried for change and the players themselves moved to take charge, organise themselves and liberate the team from the straitjacket imposed by coach Carlos Alberto. What we may be seeing, starting with the game against Holland, is a strategy that could make Brazil great again: a free market approach to futbol, with more reliance on personal initiative and individual talent and less interference from a coaching bench that has been acting like a bunch of bureaucrats, unwilling to take risks. This is not an imported neo-liberal idea. It is as Brazilian as the Sugar Loaf and has always worked for us. Vicente Feola, who led us to our first World Cup in 1958, was a laissez faire coach. Legend has it that he used to take a nap during practice. The only instruction his players ever remember receiving from him was: 'Boys, go in there and score.' We switched coaches in 1962, but not philosophy - and won again. In 1970, with the game already under the threat of bureaucratisation, it took a rebellion by Pele and company against coach Mario Zagalo to assure the glory of the tricampeonato in Mexico. Indications are that it will work again this time. Recent setbacks have made us more realistic and demanding. But, as you may have noticed, we are a happy, optimistic and confident lot. And, contrary to current belief, when the going gets tough Brazil is still the only Latin American country that can really play with the big guys from Europe - even if the 'big guys' are now represented only by Italy.

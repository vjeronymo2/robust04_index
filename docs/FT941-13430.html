			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Total of Dollars 7.5bn sought for California: Congress to be asked for emergency earthquake relief funds The Clinton administration will ask Congress for Dollars 6.6bn in emergency funds to help California recover from last week's earthquake, on top of the Dollars 900m it has already released, bringing the total to Dollars 7.5bn. Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, said yesterday that a bill would be sent to Congress today asking for Dollars 3.9bn for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Dollars 1.4bn for road repairs and Dollars 1.3bn for emergency loans to small businesses; the final bill could climb higher, he said. Members of Congress representing the battered state said they hoped the measure could be passed by mid-February, but controversy could still arise over whether the emergency money should be treated outside normal federal budget ceilings or be offset by other spending cuts. Although emergency spending for natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes is usually handled outside the constraints of the budget ceilings, last summer both Democrats and Republicans held up aid for the Mississippi and Missouri floods over this issue. More than 1,000 buildings have been declared unsafe as a result of the earthquake, which measured 6.6 on the Richter scale and killed 57 people. Los Angeles will also have to rebuild some of its biggest roads. Because of the urgency the Environmental Protection Agency has cancelled an order preventing California from receiving about Dollars 800m in federal road construction funds in a dispute over the state's smog control measures.</p>

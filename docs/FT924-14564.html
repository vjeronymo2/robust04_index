			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Lamont's guiding star We now know the British government's economic policy. Every morning the chancellor of the exchequer will read the newspapers, check the markets, lick his finger and put it up to the wind, tap, perhaps, at a lightly boiled egg, and decide what to do. He may, of course, take advice. He will be able to draw upon the distilled wisdom of the economists, forecasters and officials who got us where we are today. He will not be entirely rudderless. He has chosen a guiding star. Over the next four or five years underlying inflation will be kept down to between 1 and 4 per cent. This is a firm objective, to be met with determination, unless it suits the government to break it. Since the experience of the past few weeks teaches us that events control the chancellor, and not the other way around, the meaningfulness of this aspiration is elusive. I summarise, but in the two paragraphs above you have the essence of Mr Norman Lamont's speech to the Conservative party conference. The technicalities of what he had to say were set out in a letter to the Treasury and civil service committee of the Commons. The speech plus the letter appear to have been received with some bemusement by the markets. The address itself was greeted with less than rapturous applause by the assembled Tories at their convention in Brighton. This is hardly surprising. Most of the Tory party workers are aware that the devaluation of the pound will work its way through to inflation. Some appreciate that there is a political limit to the amount of deflation that the public will stand. The conclusion is inescapable. Decisions well within the government's control may lead it to abandon Mr Lamont's guiding star. Politics could yet drive the Tories to cut and run. I do not wish to be unfair to the chancellor. He has been consistent in his determination to reduce inflation. While Britain was inside the exchange rate mechanism his policy in that respect succeeded remarkably well. It is wholly characteristic of him to indicate that he wishes to persevere now that the foundations of his previous strategy have crumbled. It is, equally, in character for the prime minister to encourage Mr Lamont. Both are aware that to reduce interest rates rapidly, as called for by some at the conference, would constitute a hugely expensive purchase of short-lived popularity. It is to their credit that they have not succumbed to that temptation. All of this would be more enthusiastically received if the government was politically secure, or if the chancellor had a bottomless fund of credibility upon which to draw. Unfortunately neither condition prevails. The government has yet to regain its authority. Mr Lamont's political difficulties diminish his effectiveness. He may win through, and surprise many of his detractors, but he has a way to go. He is fighting to rebuild his reputation, with the zest and energy of a cornered politician. A series of four long-standing public engagements could make or break him. Success at all four would go a long way towards restoring his image; sustained market approval would put him on the road to rehabilitation. The first of these appearances, at a fringe meeting on Wednesday night, was revealing. He gave a lecture on European policy. It stuck faithfully to the government's line, which is currently 'support Maastricht, as amended'. Yet the tone of his remarks, well understood by his Euro-sceptical audience, belied their content. He was saying: 'I am one of you.' He thus exposed himself as not pure metal, but an alloy. It was the same yesterday. He did not mention Maastricht to a conference whose nationalists are loud and vociferous. An inattentive listener might conclude that there was no intention to return to the ERM. In the accompanying technical letter he set conditions for re-entry which anyone with a knowledge of recent history would realise could be met. As one observer, close to Mr John Major, remarked, Mr Lamont wobbles. He does it for understandable political reasons, but it does not help the government or the prime minister. We shall see whether the pattern is continued when he addresses the Commons committee on Monday, or at his Mansion House speech later on. His colleagues will be watching closely. For the moment the inner core of the government seems united. Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Major and Mr Lamont are co-operating, although the first three are Euro-enthusiasts and the latter is anxious to maintain his reputation as a sceptic. The five sat together through Black Wednesday, their amazement growing as Mr Lamont and his officials told them the news. The Tories' world had fallen apart in the chancellor's hands. The foreign and home secretaries, not to mention the president of the board of trade, may find it uncomfortable if they are obliged to sit back as the chancellor makes all the decisions on his own once more.</p>

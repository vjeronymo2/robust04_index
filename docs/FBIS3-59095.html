Imset: "...and Turkey Is Mobilized </F> Against Terrorism"]    [Text] Determined to end the Kurdish separatist campaign in  southeastern Turkey with military measures by next summer at the  latest, Ankara last week revealed a major decision taken under  pressure from the Office of the Chief of Staff. Following  hundreds of protest calls to newspapers from relatives of  soldiers who had already heard the news, officials were forced  to announce that Turkey had frozen all Army discharges for  periods ranging from three to five months.    But, if expectations are correct, the decision is to be  followed now with a brand new measure that will increase  compulsory military service for all future conscript s--  resulting in a step backward on a political promise that had  been made to the Turkish nation by now President Suleyman  Demirel, with the aim of being elected to power.    The move was clearly implemented in accordance with demands  voiced by the Turkish military and was intended to give the  country's military commanders a free hand in fulfilling their  pledge to break the backbone of terrorism by spring at the  latest.    Even Prime Minister Tansu Ciller had to go on record saying  that the development was not designed by her coalition  government but was the result of a demand that had originated  from the Office of the Chief of Staff.    The words she used to describe what had happened somewhat  shed light on the behind-the-scenes events. According to her,  the Cabinet decision had been adopted as a result of "an  absolute demand" presented to the government by both the  National Security Council (MGK) and security forces. Her  remarks also revealed who has the final say on major national  issues in Turkey.    According to sources close to the government, following last  month's MGK meeting, the "decision" was drafted and delivered to  each Cabinet minister, one by one, to be signed. By Dec. 20,  all of the signatures had been obtained and the decision was  passed. With absolutely no legal right to protest, criticize or  even express any views at all on this extension, tens of  thousands of Turkish soldiers were told by their superior  officers that their eagerly anticipated discharges were not to  come. Instead, they would have to wait for at least three more  months and "defend" their country.    From the moment the measure was drafted at the chief of  staff's office and relayed to regional and unit commanders and  then to soldiers, not a single word of the extension had been  leaked to the press, despite Turkey's record of leakages on all  issues.    The head of the government, Ciller, knew how much such a  freeze would hurt her politically as it would every other  Cabinet minister. Yet, Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan was  comfortably touring Tunisia at the time and Turkey's senior  commanders were clearly preferring to place the responsibility  for the decision on the politicians.    It was so sensitive an issue that, according to Parliament's  National Defense Commission Chairman Baki Tug, even he had to  wait to hear the news from the newspapers after the horn was  finally blown.    When the decision had been relayed to Turkey's 500,000 plus  soldiers, they phoned their families to notify them of the  extension. Once the families were informed, as if in chorus,  they phoned the press which finally brought the news out.  Military officials, who often search for opportunities to  comment on national issues and, in private, criticize "the  politicians" for interfering in their affairs, were no more  willing than the politicians to announce this decision. Cabinet  members contacted by the TURKISH PROBE were telling the press to  get their confirmation of the new measure from the Office of the  Chief of Staff. Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry claimed that  they had not been informed of such a development and only the  prime minister's office could comment. As for military  officials, pressed too much by the press, all they did was to  tell journalists that the report was true, but added that  Defense Minister Golhan "wanted to make the announcement  himself" and that they should not be quoted on their  confirmation of the decision.    Clearly, no one wanted to take immediate responsibility for  -- and thus face the immediate consequences of -- this decision.  It was too controversial a subject to go public with, at least  as the one responsible for the measure.  <H5>  The Verdict </H5>   Although the official jargon on the recent freeze on  discharges is jumbled and somewhat difficult to understand for  the foreigner, what it basically means is that all conscripts,  including regular compulsory soldiers and noncommissioned  officers, will be serving in the military longer than they had  originally planned.    But because Turkish law prevents criticism of this decision,  no one can openly protest it.    Thus, all Turks -- those who at very young ages had planned  their futures based on the former discharge period; those with  businesses to return to; those who have families to support;  those who have scheduled their whole lives: employment,  marriages, business trips and debt repayments -- must wait.  Even soldiers with only 20 days to go -- those who have  exhausted their handmade calendars marking off each day of the  past 14 months -- will have to add at least 100 days more to new  calenders. And, in the meantime, the press is banned from  reporting the resulting frustration or even writing what could  be construed as protests, for this too is a crime.    In other words, despite the careful way the news was broken  to the Turkish public, there is nothing much to fear. For  protest, if there are any, can only be worded by those who have  little to loose and even in the media, by those who have now  gotten accustomed to being closed down or seized on court  orders. Thus, even though there has been a serious shock among  soldiers and their families, the recent decision -- or verdict  -- was passed without a problem.    It appears that had the prime minister been kind enough to  consult with her aides before giving in to the "absolute  demand," she could have at least prevented a reaction from  within her own party. But she did not, and was consequently met  with a strong response.    Addressing her party's General Executive Board meeting a day  after the extension decision was publicized, Ciller faced her  first problem; not from the legally silenced Turkish public, but  from her own executives who clearly enjoyed the immunity of  being part of a ruling party.    And, they were tough on her. Not because of their concern  for what such a decision could hold for the future on Turkey as  a nation, but for what it could hold for them, politically.    The reaction demonstrated, to an extent, how ignorant of  national issues the True Path Party (DYP) had become and how  little it cared for such domestic topics.    Indeed, the strongest reaction Ciller did get was from her  own party. The reasons for this reaction were perhaps best  expressed both in a question posed by Tug and in a remark made  by DYP Deputy Tevfik Diker: Tug, chairman of Parliament's  Defense Commission, asked Ciller, "Why was such an important  decision hidden from us?" while Diker, a member of the same  commission, said openly that the Cabinet decision would lose  votes for the party.    "We have already lost the families of soldiers who will be  discharged three months late. The elections are ahead of us and  most of the families with children serving in the Southeast are  concerned. This will reflect negatively on the elections," was  how Diker put it.    At about the same time, private ATV television anchor man  and  SABAH chief columnist Guneri Civaoglu asked the government why  such a decision had been adopted in haste and what legitimized  such an extension, as there was neither a war nor a mobilization.    Perhaps unknown to him, there was a mobilization being  conducted in Turkey even before the decision was released. In  fact, the main aim of the extensions was to ensure that this  mobilization would be of use.    For, months ago, Turkey's Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan Gures  had  sworn that the military would wipe out the terrorists by next  spring but there seemed to be no way of doing this without  changing some of the principles of the new Turkish system.    As Gures does not have too much time to make such changes --  for he himself will be retiring next August -- whatever happens  must happen before then.  <H5>  The Reasons </H5>   This also explains many other developments in recent days,  especially the reasons behind Gures' most recent furor over  criticism toward the Army and his now-traditional argument that  the risks Turkey faces in the region are far greater than they  were during the Cold War era.    At last, after the collapse of the concept of New World  Order, the "New World Disorder" had surfaced which required that  Turkey's military be constantly prepared.    According to Turkish military officials, the main reason  behind the freeze of military discharges was the increased draft  evasion throughout Turkey which had seriously hindered  recruitment efforts.    This was best expressed by Gen. Hursit Tolon, secretary  general of the Office of the Chief of Staff, who said in a  written statement that the Turkish Army was 110,000 soldiers  short.    When seen in light of Ciller's announcement that Turkey had  554,000 soldiers, this put the current shortage at about  one-fifth of the Armed Forces' total strength.    According to Golhan, who made an announcement on draft  evasion last month, there were approximately 250,000 draft  dodgers in Turkey and most of them were from the terror-ridden  southeast region.    Thus, Tolon argued, the decision to freeze military  discharges was made because the peacetime staff apparently did  not meet the requirements of the Armed Forces.    Both he and Ciller explained to Turkey that Demirel's  decision -- made when he was elected to office as prime minister  -- to decrease the military service period from 18 to 15 months,  had created some serious problems. Meanwhile, expectations for  new recruits had not been met following the Cold War and  "uncertainties, instability and threats" had increased. This  called for a revision of the previous decrease. According to  one senior officer, reducing the term of military service was a  mistake in the first place since it was nothing more than  fulfilling an electoral promise. "Fifteen months of compulsory  service" was a slogan frequently used by the DYP and Gen. Gures  agreed to make the necessary arrangements, but only in order not  create problems for the new administration. However the burden  of the decision had become too great.  <H5>  The Southeast </H5>   What was evident, though, was that the impetus for adopting  the Dec. 20 decision did not come in the form of a perception of  a global threat, but was a result of escalating events in the  southeast region. Statistics from 1993 indicated that, despite  official statements, there was a 100 percent increase in the  number of armed activities in that region and Kurdish separatism  had claimed a twofold increase in lives that year compared to  1992.    As Tolon put it, Turkey was seeking now to keep trained  personnel at hand in the combat zone, especially before the  military launches its massive crackdown.    In the words of Interior Minister Nahit Mentese, winter  operations against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)  are to continue with full steam in the coming days. And in the  spring and summer, the "final blow" is to be delivered. As  Golhan has put it, "We need trained soldiers for several months.  We have ordered a freeze on the discharge of trained soldiers  in view of the continuing domestic threat and the upcoming  operations to be carried out in southeast Anatolia during the  winter and spring."    Thus, there is no doubt that the main reason behind the  freeze is neither "the increased threat from Greece," as some  papers have reported, nor the developments in the former Soviet  republics. Perhaps these have had some influence on the  decision, but the extension appears primarily as a result of  domestic issues.    Several issues ago, TURKISH PROBE had informed its readers  that a countdown had begun for the southeast region and that by  March 1994, there would be an immense operation in this trouble  spot of Turkey. It now appears as though the operation is  currently underway and may gain momentum in the coming weeks.  March, though, is still the most crucial month.    Not only because it is the month of "uprisings" for the PKK,  but also because all developments during that month are to  affect the whole of Turkish democracy, most probably to be  reflected in military appointments, promotions and retirements  in August. During the debate over military service, one "leak"  to the press was of interest to the outside observer, although  the military later denied its authenticity. According to  several reports in large circulation newspapers, along with the  extension of military service, "all resignations and retirements  from the Armed Forces" had also been frozen.    This is indeed not true -- for the time being. But cynics  say there may be a reason behind such a "leak." Perhaps it was  aimed at putting the possibility into the heads of millions of  Turks only to prepare everyone for such a development.    To be more open, if in March the final clash begins and  things get out of hand, if the PKK cannot be crushed by the  spring and if speculation on the real intentions of the current  Turkish command structure do take place, Gen. Dogan Gures and  others waiting their turn to retire, may not have to this in  August. Gures' term in office had already been extended by a  special decree for an additional year, although his retirement  had come up in 1993. After the extension though, the  Constitutional Court ruled against the government's authority to  make such decisions. But, because no application had been made  against Gures' extension in the legally required time, he  remained in his position.    But there has been no legal -- or constitutional --  extension  for him this year. The only way his stay, and those of his  close aides, could be extended would be if heavy increase in  violence to the point of civil war occurred. In that case, all  retirement and resignations from the Armed Forces could be  legally halted. As for what is happening in the Southeast, a  brief summary of how the recent decision will affect the country  is as follows: At least 40,000 soldiers who would have been  discharged in the southeast region next March will remain on  duty.    In other words, the decision is designed to increase the  manpower of the Turkish Armed Forces at an accelerated rate,  with new conscripts to be added to those not being discharged.  Turkey, which under normal peacetime conditions should have  some 90,000 to 95,000 troops (or nine divisions) in the region,  currently has about 160,000 there. If these were discharged,  some 40,000 trained soldiers would have left the service. To  replace them, 40,000 new recruits would have to go through main  training for four months and then be sent to the region where  they would be starting from zero. For many commanders, at a time  as crucial as this, such a move could be disastrous. According  to one officer who asked not to be identified, the most  difficult thing for Turkey was to train commando soldiers which  were a vital part of Turkey's campaign against the guerrillas.  "Now there is time and the conditions are present to place more  trained personnel in the region," he explained.    Another military officer disclosed that a decision had  already been made, in secrecy, to send a majority of Turkey's  fresh conscripts to the Southeast. The transfers have already  begun. On Wednesday, there were reports that two Turkish naval  soldiers were killed in Sirnak. The reports said that they were  first transferred to Iskenderun from Izmir and then sent to  Sirnak. This fits in with reports reaching the Turkish capital  that there has been intensified military preparation throughout  the region and that new armored personnel carriers, tanks,  attack helicopters, armored vehicles and warplanes had been  deployed. Reports also disclosed that gendarmerie depots are so  full that newly deployed equipment, including Russian-made  BTR-80 armored vehicles, are now being stocked at depots of the  Land Forces Command.    According to a senior general interviewed by the TDN  [Turkish  Daily News] last week, "trained units from everywhere around  Turkey, even from Istanbul, are being sent there."    And, despite Ciller's own announcement that the extension of  military service is a one-time-only decision, senior sources at  the Chief of Staff's Office say that they are working on a  completely new system whereby compulsory service periods will be  extended up to 18 months. Currently, military service is 15  months for private and 12 months for noncommissioned officers.    What all of this means is that Turkey is on its way to a  full  mobilization to counter separatist activities and that many new  developments should be expected in the near future. These may  include the declaration of a state of emergency throughout the  country, the declaration of martial law and even the  constitutional declaration of the existence of "civil war"  conditions.    Whatever happens, it is evident that in one way or another,  as long as terrorism remains on Turkey's agenda, it will be the  military that runs the country and makes the final decisions on  national affairs....</p>

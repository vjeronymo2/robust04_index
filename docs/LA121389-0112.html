			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> CAMPEAU CORP. REPORTS LOSSES OF $190 MILLION  </P> <P> Campeau Corp., an ailing retailing and real estate empire, reported on Tuesday  that its losses more than doubled in the third quarter to $190 million despite  a 5% gain in revenue to $2.56 billion. In the same quarter a year earlier,  Campeau lost $83 million.  </P> <P> The Toronto-based company, the parent of Ralphs supermarkets in Southern  California, has been struggling under the burden of heavy debt stemming largely  from its $6.6-billion acquisition in May, 1988, of Federated Department Stores.  </P> <P> In September, Campeau was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy by a  $250-million loan from Olympia &amp; York Developments, and the company is  trying to raise cash by selling its prestigious Bloomingdale's department store  chain. None of the company's nine department store chains are in Southern  California.  </P> <P> Campeau's operating profit for the quarter ended Oct. 31 totaled $255 million,  off 4% from $265 million a year earlier. Results from Ralphs, which has been  remodeling many of its stores, contributed somewhat to that decline. The  Compton-based chain, as previously reported, posted an operating profit of $38  million, down from $41 million. Analysts say Ralphs has been sheltered from  Campeau's struggles, however, because it has a separate debt structure and its  own credit line.  </P> <P> In an effort to sound a hopeful note, Campeau noted in a news release that its  department stores traditionally make 50% of their yearlong profits from holiday  shopping in the fourth quarter. Company spokesmen were not available for  comment.  </P> <P> For the first nine months of the year, Campeau has lost $390 million on revenue  of $7.04 billion. That compares to a loss of $24 million on revenue of $5.4  billion a year earlier.  </P> <P> Operating profit for the nine months was $680 million, up 56% from $437  million. The nine- month gains in operating profit and revenue resulted from  the Federated acquisition.  </P></p>

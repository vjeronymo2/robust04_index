			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Westar Mining goes into bankruptcy WESTAR Mining, Canada's biggest coal exporter, has slid into bankruptcy after failing to overcome a range of financial and labour problems. A Vancouver judge has named a partner at auditors Arthur Andersen as bankruptcy trustee. Westar has total debts of about CDollars 400m (USDollars 334.3m). Its biggest creditor is Bank of Montreal. But Mr Justice Bruce Macdonald has allowed Westar's two mines in south-east British Columbia to remain temporarily under court protection while efforts continue to secure their future. Workers at the Greenhills mine, which produced 2.4m tonnes of coal last year, are negotiating with a prospective buyer of Westar's 80 per cent stake. The remaining 20 per cent is owned by Pohang Iron and Steel of South Korea. Judge Macdonald has extend-ed Greenhills' protection from creditors for at least another 60 days and has authorised the trustee to borrow whatever funds are needed to keep Greenhills in operation. The outlook is gloomier for the larger Balmer mine, which has been closed since early May by a labour dispute. Court protection for Balmer has been extended only to September 24. Balmer, which shipped 5.3m tonnes of coal last year, re-quires substantial new investment to extend its life. However, Westar has failed to finalise a financial restructuring. In addition, the union at Balmer, whose leadership has a reputation for being among the most intransigent in the North American mining industry, has rejected all efforts by management to introduce more flexible work practices. Westar's problems are part of a much wider restructuring forced on the high-cost Canadian coal mining industry by sagging Japanese demand for coking coal and sliding prices. Another large British Columbia mine, Quintette, emerged from court protection earlier this year after a financial restructuring which left its creditors as substantial minority shareholders.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Question-and-answer session with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat </F> and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by unidentified  officials attending the Crans Montana Forum meeting in  Bucharest; moderated by an unidentified official -- live;  'Arafat speaks in English and Arabic, Peres in English and  French, with simultaneous translation into Romanian]    [Text] [Moderator] The participants in the Crans Montana  forum are going to ask questions of the two guests, PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat and and Shim'on Peres, minister of foreign affairs  of the State of Israel. I see someone here on my right wanting  to ask a question.    [Unidentified official] I would like to ask both Chairman  'Arafat and Minister Peres a simple basic question, which  requires not a complex answer but a sincere one. To what extent  can we view the peace process as truly irreversible? In other  words, will the peace process last and become reality, despite  calls to replace the Palestinian leadership and the PLO or that  of the Israelis? Can a 50-year-old person still hope to live to  see the peace process succeed before he dies? Thank you for  your consideration.    ['Arafat] Peace in the Middle East is not an expression or a  newspaper article. There have been all these years of  confrontations, particularly with regard to Palestine, which is  the land of the three monotheistic religious, Judaism,  Christianity, and Islam. Well, Palestine has long experienced  war, throughout known history. I also ask myself the same  question, since we are now facing this prolongation of  negotiations and talks.    We keep negotiating and negotiating and have yet to achieve  a  basis on which to proceed with implementation of the agreement.  Nothing can be achieved on paper alone, but rather in the  field. Well, we do not know how long this process will take.  Maybe tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the coming week, or the  next month. There are no secrets. What we have agreed upon is  on paper, with our signatures on it. We hope. We cannot say  that it is within our power to give you the final decision. He  must decide. He must say. My people and I are under Israeli  occupation. They must decide whether they are going to withdraw  or not. [applause] They have to decide whether they want to  implement what has been agreed upon or not. I hope, from the  bottom of my heart, that this will come to pass and I know that  Mr. Peres has a very broad vision, but I also know that there  are extremists, I know they exist, and I am very sincere about  it all. Well, they must understand what this peace means.    Peace is a very precious goal for all of us, for our  children  and their children, and for our new generation and for their new  generation. Peace is not only a Palestinian need. It is an  Israeli need, a Russian need, an American need, and an  international need. However, it is mainly a need for the Middle  East, which is the most important strategic area in the whole  world. If we do not achieve peace -- but we hope to achieve it,  because the alternative is too horrible for words -- we will  have complete confusion in our region and new Balkanization.  This is not a joke. It is bloodshed, it could lead to further  bloodshed. Therefore, from here, I call on Prime Minister Rabin  and Mr. Peres, who have the upper hand, to look at the (?plight  of those who have less power) and withdraw. [applause]    [Peres] To answer your question, I must admit that 50 is a  pretty dangerous age. If you survive it, you have already  accomplished something. However, to answer your question  frankly, even if the Palestinians want to change something or  the Israelis want to change the world, well, the world is  irreversible and we cannot really change it. This is a new  world, and we must enter it, since the new world will not follow  us. What is the new world? The Cold War is finished,  therefore, there is no one left around to finance cold wars.  Likewise, communism collapsed. Many of the Middle East  conflicts were supported by the Cold War. If there is no cold  war, there are no longer conflicts in the Middle East. Second, I  do not believe it is really up to us. You know, I keep  wondering what led to the collapse of communism? After all, no  other party has emerged in the Soviet Union to bring this all  about. No, there was no new party or coup d'etat. It was not  the military who overthrew communism and no invasion took place,  either. What toppled communism, and will always topple  dictatorships, is television, knowledge, and the dissemination  of information, which nobody can really halt. The young men  from Moscow, Baghdad, Jerusalem, or Bucharest are increasingly  watching what is going on in the world. Then, they ask  themselves: Why are people in some parts of the world happy and  rich, while we get up every morning in poverty?    I believe that the change does not depend on the leaders or  the countries. The world will become more and more democratic  and peaceful, because there is a third reason for it all. I do  not believe that the extremists have a future. What are they  doing? They are killing, and killing, and killing. What then?  They have no other alternative. The alternative does not  belong to extremism, but to the mothers in Israel and Palestine  who do not want their children to be exposed to the same dangers.    Chairman 'Arafat, you said that I am an occupier. You must  admit that I am a pretty pleasant occupier. There are not many  occupiers like me. However, as a so-called occupier, I am  firmly taking my seat at the negotiating table alongside you and  I hope we will find a political solution, without force and  violence, between the Palestinian and ourselves. I told  Chairman 'Arafat about the Israeli saying that the better one's  neighbor feels, the better one feels also. Gentlemen, I would  like to reiterate that the future is irreversible and, in this  context, peace is irreversible, too. [applause]    [Chiriac] I have two questions for Mr. Peres and Mr.  'Arafat. First, did you make any progress in the peace talks  here in Bucharest? And second, do you think that Romania can  still play a role in the peace process in the Middle East.    [Moderator] Who is asking the question?    [Chiriac] Dan Chiriac, from the ADEVARUL daily newspaper.    [Moderator] There will be a news conference for journalists  later.    [Chiriac] Well, this was my question for both Chairman  'Arafat and Mr. Shim'on Peres.    ['Arafat] Not to forget that we have a very important  meeting this afternoon in which we will all participate; His  Excellency [President Ion Iliescu] wants to help give further  impetus to this peace process. Therefore, as I said several  times at the start of my speech at the Forum proceedings, thank  you, thank you Romania. [applause]    [Official] International investors are convinced that, if  there is peace, the Israeli-Palestinian team and the entire  Middle East will again become a growing market, a market for the  future. We know that this process can be long-term. Is it  possible to develop concrete initiatives between Israelis and  Palestinians, such as a mixed Israeli-Palestinian bank, or a  joint Israeli-Palestinian company for research projects and  water exploitation, or other similar initiatives that can  facilitate coexistence on concrete technical and financial  planes?    ['Arafat] At this point, our economy is an economy under  occupation, under Israeli occupation, and it is totally linked  to the Israeli economy. When they withdraw, we will raise this  question then. I do not want to go into detail now, but,  regardless of the situation, we are still under occupation. It  is no small thing that we have been suffering for 45 years.  When the Israelis withdraw and we manage to establish our  national authority, then you can come and see. If you listened  to my speech, I referred to several future projects and  emphasized that it is our right to have a Marshall plan for the  region, which has gone through so many wars, as there was a  Marshall plan for Europe. Why should we not also have a  Marshall plan in our region? We need it. This applies to the  peoples in this region, not only the Palestinians and Israelis,  but to all the other Arab states in the zone. They also have a  right to profit form a Marshall plan. I even departed from my  written text to the session in order to emphasize that we need  this plan.    [Peres] In my opinion, there should be economic and  scientific cooperation between us and the Palestinians. We  should take care not to replace a market economy with a national  flag economy. I believe that there is more money in the world  than ideas. We must develop research activity. The  Palestinians and Israelis should jointly concern ourselves with  this aspect.    [Announcer] I would like to remark on an interesting aspect  of this question-and-answer session, namely the languages used  by the two leaders, the Israeli and Palestinian ones: Shim'on  Peres answers both in English in French, while 'Arafat, aside  from Arabic, also just answered a question in English.    [Official] I have a question for Mr. Peres in his capacity  as professor at Cairo University. Does he think that the  developments in the region have conformed to projections in the  lectures he has written, or does he now have a new slant on  developments in the region?    [Peres] As professor at Cairo University, let me give you a  very concrete example. There is cooperation between Egypt and  Israel in the sphere of agriculture. Our Egyptian friends asked  us for technology in the sphere of irrigations, drainage, and  other fields. The project proved successful. As a matter of  fact, Egypt has become a competitor for Israel in this respect.  I doubt that the Egyptians feel that they are subjected to  domination from Israel in this respect. We are also cooperating  with Morocco and other countries. I believe that all of us have  two passports: a national passport, linked to history, and a  universal passport linked to science. Science is universal.  Science knows no frontiers. It must be made available to  everybody. One can achieve a lot through science. [applause]    [Official] I represent the German Bundestag. I have a  question for both Chairman 'Arafat and Minister Peres. You have  just referred to the future. However, before I take up that  point, I would like to thank the Romanian people for having  created favorable conditions -- at a pretty difficult time for  themselves -- for the peace process. The experience we have  gained here in Europe, at the end of World War II, makes me ask  you a realistic question about the time after the conclusion of  the peace process. Do you not believe that too much attention is  being paid to the conflict rather than to the assistance  required after the end of the conflict? Are you not worried  about the fact that the world, including Europe, will lose  interest in the region? As you know, the attention here is  focused on the European Union and on the processes currently  taking place in Europe. What is being done to ensure that,  after the end of the conflict, you will get assistance from the  European Union? What are your expectations from us?    ['Arafat] My viewpoint is the opposite of what you said  regarding the Middle East-Europe relationship. While U.S.  President Clinton characterized [words indistinct] from Greece,  up to the Scandinavian countries and Portugal. Regarding the  European participation in this aid program -- meaning the  European portion, worth millions of dollars -- we note that the  European share is the largest. By that, I mean it has the  largest percentage. Therefore, nobody can say that Europe is  not interested in the Middle East. Europe has an interest in the  region and in the aftermath of peace in the area. We are not  living somewhere in Hawaii, but in the Middle East. We have  shared history, land, and economy with Europe. We have also  shared wars, science, and culture. Everybody knows that the  Mediterranean Sea has been viewed as a lake between us and you  in Europe. Thanks to my bilateral contacts, I noticed that all  European countries of the European Union feel the need to help  us. They are particularly interested in the evolution of  negotiations between us and Israel and in future development  plans in the region. I said that in my speech to the conference  and I even made references to the private sector. We would like  the European private sector to support us and we want to  mutually support and encourage each other. Therefore, I suggest  you revise your viewpoint and your sources of information.  Thank you.    [Peres] Well, let me say something as an associate member of  the Common Market -- as you know, Israel is an associate member  and Palestine is also indirectly associated to the Common  Market. In the future, Palestinians will probably also want to  become members of the European Union. However, I want to tell  you something. Europe has become so productive and efficient  that all the Europeans can produce now is unemployment; the more  productive Europe becomes, the more unemployed can be found in  Europe. Therefore, we ask the Europeans: Why should you spend  so much money on unemployment? Why not export these unemployed  to help build societies, that is, send them to some social  markets? The cost is the same. Why reduce the size of your  companies, the number of jobs, and thereby create so many  problems? For instance, in the Middle East -- I am not  referring to geographic markets only, but to social ones, too --  you should try to help people in the Middle East increase their  living standard by setting up and building nuclear plants,  roads, and so forth. You can better recover your money that  way. This is what the Ford company did.    Lenin introduced discipline in this respect. I know that the  governments have budgets. We have a state president here who  can confirm that to you. Therefore, governments have budgets,  but they do not release the money, because all the money is used  at the national level. On the other hand, the companies have  money but no ideas and companies will never invest money in a  region marked by danger and question marks about it. What we  would like to suggest to the Europeans is that their governments  give guarantees to their own companies, so that the latter can  invest their money in new areas. Europe must choose between  freezing their own economies and expanding their ideas. I  believe that there are great possibilities now and I believe  that we agree with the Palestinians in this respect -- that  there should be a change in this sphere: Instead of selling  weapons to us, the Europeans should give us money to build our  homes; the Americans can build bridges, airports, and other  projects in the region. I believe this is the real proposal we  want to make. [applause]    [Announcer] This is the end of the question-and-answer  session.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM And Britain: Revived MLR employed sparingly THE reintroduction yesterday of minimum lending rate (MLR) at 12 per cent, signalling a 2-percentage-point rise in UK base rates, followed the general pattern since 1981 when the rate was in effect made redundant. Since then it has been used infrequently as an emergency measure to raise rates during sterling crises, dealers said. However, its most recent use - in October 1990 - was to signal a 1-percentage-point reduction in base rates to 14 per cent when sterling joined the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. The Bank of England stopped announcing MLR in 1981 when it introduced a new system for day-to-day market operations. MLR, always set by the Bank of England, was once known as the Bank Rate. It was renamed minimum lending rate to try to downgrade its significance. MLR averaged 10.8 per cent in the 1970s and peaked at 17 per cent on November 15 1979 when it was raised to protect the balance of payments and control inflation. UK base rates, in effect MLR's replacement, averaged 11.8 per cent in the 1980s. Although seemingly abandoning MLR, the Bank retained the right in appropriate circumstances to announce in advance the MLR which, for a short period ahead, it would apply in any lending to UK discount houses. Before its 1990 ERM outing, MLR was reintroduced for one day in January 1985  -also at 12 per cent but up from a level of 10 1/2 per cent - when the Bank of England was trying to prop up a pound moving close to parity with the US dollar, dealers said. At the time, the FT reported: 'The Bank has now returned to its more subtle practice of influencing borrowing costs through its routine money market operations.'</p>

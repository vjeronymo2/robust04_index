			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mirka Velinovska: "A Balkan Step Backwards"] </F>   [Text] As far as we know, the first reactions of  politicians from the European Union and the United States to the  Greek decision on introducing sanctions against our country were  that the politicians were totally caught off guard and  surprised. This indicated that all the European and world  politicians actively engaged in Balkan matters in the past two  to three years had not acquired greater knowledge in the  "matters." They had not dug deeply in decoding the specific  Balkan mental code.    To be honest, we have not done better ourselves, which  proves  that we are another world among the Balkan peoples: a civilized  people, a normal state, a decent society. That is probably why  this decision caught us by surprise, although we survive in the  middle of all possible Balkan obstructions, nationalisms,  chauvinisms, political narrowness, and nonsense. Logic made us  think that Greece could not decide to take the irrational action  of closing down its consulate or the Thessaloniki port. We had  in mind a European Greece. We missed the possibility that the  European Union, of which our southern neighbor is a part, does  not itself guarantee that all its members have achieved European  habits. Absolutely the contrary. The latest actions, first of  all the Thessaloniki meetings headed by the Greek priests, then  the changes in the U.S. names of streets and public buildings in  Drama -- as an expression of Greece's dissatisfaction with U.S.  policy toward Macedonia -- and the decision of the Greek  government of Papandreou, show that it is a typical Balkan state.    It was only a couple of weeks ago that we took into  consideration the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] position in the dispute with Greece in case  that country, that is its political leadership, would change its  policy of imposing conditions, blackmail, and denial.    Papandreou presented the resolution of his government as a  "message" to Macedonia, but also to "others", even to all those  "who participate in the formation of the stance of the  international community." The Greek prime minister thinks that  the recognition of our state by a greater part of European  countries and the United States was misunderstood in Macedonia,  which "got false impressions that it could ignore the Greek  positions, and thus create problems for stability in the region  at large." According to his evaluation our country "has not  taken a single moderate or cautious step" since the breakup of  Yugoslavia until today, while "the basic determination of Greece  is peace, stability, and security in the region at large."    As a matter of fact, we should look for the background and  the essence of the Greek action exactly in this formulation.  First of all, Papandreou expressed the Greek insult because of  the behavior of Greece's partners and allies in reference to its  proposals, initiatives, and stances for the solution of the  Bosnian conflict. They have been mainly ignored, and the  chairmanship of the European Union, while it is being held by  Greece, has been reduced to a permanent supervision over the  Balkan "juvenile." Papandreou has been insulted by the behavior  of the NATO allies who did not take into account the Greek  objections to applying force for solving the Bosnian conflict.    And now the right time for Greece has come: By turning  attention to the south, amidst the general mess, it is trying to  prove that Macedonia is a potential factor of crisis in the  Balkans, a destabilizing bullet. It is exactly here that Greece  wants to achieve a possible national score, at least as long as  it chairs the European Union. Thus it hopes to annul the  efforts of the world for a preventive stabilization of the  furthest south of the Balkans by recognizing Macedonia and  allotting it (at least in perspective) economic assistance.    In making a decision on this action, the Papandreou  government has, as a matter of fact, helped its friend Milosevic  in relieving him of some of the enormous pressures he has been  exposed to. It is not the first time in the past two years that  the Greek penalties for Macedonia have been synchronized with  official Belgrade, with the agreement of the interests of our  two neighbors. The last one was very much welcomed in Serbia.  It was commented as a "Greek reply to the behavior of the White  House which is attaching a growing importance to Skopje by  installing itself in the Balkans, at the expense of Greece."    If we judge by commentaries in the Greek media, or at least  by the way they had been interpreted by their colleagues in  Belgrade, it seems that Greece is concerned because the  importance of its position in Europe, that is in the region, has  been diminished. Instead of starting a new policy, as suggested  by some of its domestic political elements, for taking the place  that belongs to it -- something which Papandreou insists on very  much -- by creating problems for the international community  Greece becomes even more distant and places itself on the  margins. However, the worst of all is that the first reactions  of the EU partners bring the latest decision of the Papandreou  government related to Macedonia in close connection with the  NATO ultimatum, that is its resoluteness finally to become  active in Bosnia, as well as with the visit of Papulias to  Belgrade.    As far as our country is concerned, the Greek decision on  closing the borders has certainly been received with surprise  and concern, while Athens rejoiced (a typical Balkan  characteristic). The concern comes from the fact that with the  closure of Thessaloniki's port our economy will suffer  additional damage. Due to the respect for the sanctions against  Serbia and Montenegro, a large part of our economy was  reoriented to this port, and now hard times are ahead for us.  And this time, not only due to the lack of gasoline.    However, did Macedonia have an easy time at all during the  past three years? It constructed its vitality on the basis of  difficulties, and I don't see any reason why it should not be  that way this time, too. As a matter of fact, one must take  into account that the material damages experienced by Macedonia  due to such a Greek decision will not be greater than the  political ones that Greece will be faced with.    The greatest achievement of Macedonia's official attitude so  far has been not to succumb to emotions. For instance, to think  of some kinds of reciprocal measures or anything similar, which  would put us in an equal situation with Greece.    We now have a wonderful opportunity to promote our  reputation  as a European state and people that we mustn't gamble away. It  means we mustn't allow any Balkan-style reaction. We must  endure the blow and follow up Greece's behavior in the aspect of  length of time of the "sanctions" that were simply introduced by  the Papandreou government. We must be ready to experience a  probable obstruction in Macedonia's admission to the CSCE in  March, because Greece has already made such announcements, in  order to see how Greece is going to resist the pressures from  its partners and allies if it decides to take such an action.    Anyhow, if Athens "is not clear to its European and U.S.  friends" with its latest action, if its decision is evaluated as  a "serious incident," it will be a clear sign that it has taken  a key step backward, into the world of Balkan emotions and  irrationalities which can lead to a lot of things -- to its  damage, in the first place.    Let us recall where Greece was and what it was two years ago  compared to Macedonia, which was considered to be a Balkan  country, unidentified, full of conflicts, and far away from  Europe. Where is it leading to now?</p>

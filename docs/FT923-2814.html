			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Union leader invited to social affairs talks MRS Gillian Shephard, the UK employment secretary, has invited Mr Norman Willis, president of the European Trades Union Congress (Etuc), and Mr Carlos Ferrer, president of Unice, the European employers' body, to the European Community Social Affairs Council meeting at Chepstow in October. Mr Willis, who is also general secretary of the British TUC, is seldom invited to meet ministers as head of the TUC, and will certainly attend the informal meeting. Mrs Shephard is expected to lead a discussion on employment and unemployment. Mr Willis, as Etuc president, was also last night meeting Mr John Major, the UK prime minister and president of the EC Council of Ministers, to call for an emergency meeting of EC finance and employment ministers to plan how to combat unemployment within the EC. At the only formal Social Affairs Council meeting during the British presidency, in December, a final agreement is expected on the controversial working time directive. The directive was watered down earlier this year to meet objections from the UK government but was then blocked by a technical dispute between the French and Germans. TUC officials believe that the French manufactured the dispute to avoid agreeing the watered-down directive prior to the French referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, which would have provided more ammunition to anti-Maastricht views on the left. In December the French are expected to agree the directive. Mr Emilio Gabaglio, Etuc general secretary, yesterday called for a Yes vote in France, Reuter reports from Brussels. 'We believe in what Maastricht is trying to achieve and we call on workers all over Europe to support it,' he told a news conference. The treaty was flawed, but better than nothing as a basis for securing a better working life, he said. A No vote would be dangerous encouragement for the extreme nationalist movements which are on the rise in Europe, and would send the wrong message to east European countries wanting to join the Community. He said he was disappointed that Britain had so far called only one meeting of social affairs ministers during its six-month term. He called this part of a strategy in London to hamper adoption of EC-wide social legislation. Britain has opted out of provisions on social legislation in Maastricht but Mr Gabaglio said he still hoped Britain would act impartially in its chairing of EC meetings.</p>

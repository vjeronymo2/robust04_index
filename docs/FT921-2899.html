			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: 'A fair deal for average taxpayer' MR John Smith said that Labour's draft Budget would 'provide a fair deal for the average taxpayer' and help Britain achieve recovery from recession. Compared with what had been announced and leaked in advance, the shadow chancellor's proposals contained few surprises. To a considerable extent, he has taken over last week's Conservative proposals to help business and added some of his own, such as a one-year increase in capital allowances to 40 per cent from 25 per cent and increased government spending on training and providing job experience. On personal taxation and benefits, Labour's Budget maps out a very different philosophy from that of Mr Norman Lamont. The average taxpayer stands to be better off under Labour, but not dramatically so. At the higher income levels, particularly in families with only one, highly-paid earner, election of a Labour government would result in a significant reduction in disposable income. Mr Smith's first Budget would redistribute income from the high to the low-paid while Mr Lamont's Budget was designed to pass modest tax cuts to all. If he becomes chancellor, Mr Smith will: scrap the lower 20 per cent tax band for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income announced by Mr Lamont last week; increase the personal allowance before which income tax is paid by 10 per cent, compared with the government indexing this by 4.5 per cent. abolish the 2 per cent employee's contribution to National Insurance on earnings under Pounds 54 a week. These moves would take 740,000 people out of income tax and benefit every employee earning up to Pounds 22,000 a year. On benefits, Labour's child-benefit plans would provide an extra Pounds 127 a year for a family with two children. Its proposal to raise pensions by Pounds 5 for a single person and Pounds 8 for a married couple contrasts with last week's government announcement of extra help for pensioners on income support of Pounds 2 a week for a single person and Pounds 3 for couples from October. Mr Smith said a single person on average earnings would have over Pounds 100 a year more in disposable income; an average two-earner family with two children would gain Pounds 311. These gains would be financed by increased levies on people earning more than Pounds 22,000 a year. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), Labour's plans would cost families earning Pounds 52,000 a year an average of Pounds 5,500 a year. Under Mr Lamont's budget, most taxpayers would be about Pounds 2.64 a week better off, with higher earners, at present paying the 40 per cent top tax rate, gaining Pounds 160 a year. Mr Smith's first Budget would fulfil Labour's long standing promise to scrap the upper earnings limit on employee National Insurance contributions. Employees would pay 9 per cent on every pound earned above Pounds 21,060 a year, against nothing at present. Also, a 50 per cent higher tax rate would apply to taxable income of Pounds 36,375 and over, so that a single person would pay 59 per cent in tax and national insurance on every pound earned over Pounds 40,000 a year. The shadow chancellor also announced tougher tax treatment on certain benefits in kind, including a plan to scrap the 2 per cent incentive paid to people to opt out of the state earnings related pension scheme (Serps). Labour would also keep the 0.5 per cent stamp duty on share transactions for at least another year. To reassure financial markets, Mr Smith pledged to take sterling into the narrow band of the European exchange rate mechanism at its DM2.95 parity 'in due course'. Mr Smith also said that Labour would keep some parts of last week's government Budget. These included the proposals to ease the burden of the uniform business rate, the special assistance for the car industry and the help for small businesses, including the removal of most small businesses from inheritance tax. He also said Labour would not alter Mr Lamont's proposals on excise duties. Labour said its tax plans would raise extra revenue of Pounds 1.89bn in 1992-93 and Pounds 3.5bn in 1993-94, which it would use to increase investment. This would include a Pounds 1.1bn 'recovery programme' for the economy, incorporating the more generous treatment of capital allowances as well as Pounds 600m spending on skills and the unemployed. Labour's published plans contain no estimate for the cost of the proposed capital allowance changes, though these could be expected to hit government revenues from 1993-94. Last night Labour officials estimated the likely cost at Pounds 600m against a recent IFS study which estimated that 40 per cent capital allowances for one year could cost Pounds 2bn. Labour's Budget has other gaps too, with no estimate of the impact on growth or inflation. Labour adopted the Pounds 28bn public sector borrowing requirement set by the government for 1992-93, but did not indicate its future borrowing needs. It was silent on privatisation. Last week's government Budget envisages privatisation proceeds of Pounds 8bn in 1992-93 and Pounds 5.5bn in 1993-94 and 1994-95.</p>

As reported to us at the Sanitary and Epidemiological  Station  of the Russian Federation Ministry of Health, last week WHO  reports were received about an outbreak of a new cholera-like  disease in India. At the same time, two clinical patients  appeared at a Rostov Hospital, whose symptoms resembled cholera,  but the old testing methods did not confirm this diagnosis. As  it was learned, the victims had returned several days earlier  from a tour of India....    The disease occurs in serious clinical forms. Thus far there  are no means of controlling or detecting it. At present, the  leading Russian scientists are working on the virus.</p>

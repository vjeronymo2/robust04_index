			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOUR DE FRANCE CYCLISTS ARE GIVEN DAY OFF BEFORE TODAY'S SIXTH STAGE  </P> <P> After five races in four days in three countries, the remaining 195 cyclists in  the Tour de France enjoyed an off day Wednesday as they were transported from  Wasquehal in northern France to Dinard in the west.  </P> <P> Acacio da Silva of Portugal had the leader's yellow jersey as the riders  prepared for the sixth stage, an individual time trial of 45 miles from Dinard  to Rennes in Brittany.  </P> <P> Mechanical problems with air transport delayed some of the teams from leaving  Lille Airport, but by late Wednesday afternoon, all the teams were ready for  the second part of the tour.  </P> <P> After flat courses south, the riders encounter the Pyrenees mountains and then  head east before their next day off on July 17. After that, they have a long  haul to Paris where the remaining riders will finish on July 23 with another  time trial from Versailles to downtown Paris.  </P> <P> Da Silva has a 14-second margin over Soren Lilholt of Denmark, with Thierry  Marie of France third, almost two minutes back.  </P> <P> American Greg LeMond, the 1986 champion, was 14th, 3:28 behind, after a fine  weekend that included a fourth in the prologue.  </P> <P> LeMond is realistic about his chances this year after a hunting accident, an  emergency appendectomy and knee and shin problems since he won the famous  cycling race three years ago.  </P> <P> "If I finish in the first 20, I'll be very happy," he said. "In the top ten, as  happy as in 1986. If I end up on the podium, I would consider it as my greatest  victory."  </P></p>

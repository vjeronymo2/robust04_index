			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'LYNCH MOB' IS AFTER WRIGHT, LAWYER SAYS;  </P> <P> ETHICS PANEL ASKED TO DROP KEY CHARGES AS HOUSE SPEAKER'S TELEVISED HEARING  OPENS  </P> <P> Jim Wright's defense opened before a national television audience today with  his lawyer urging the House Ethics Committee to "stand in the way of the lynch  mob" seeking the House Speaker's resignation.  </P> <P> "According to the press, Jim Wright's through. He's got to resign his  speakership. Maybe even his seat in Congress," said Stephen Susman, attorney  for the Texas Democrat.  </P> <P> "Why worry about due process for a dead man?" he asked rhetorically. "Why  should this committee stand in the way of a lynch mob or a conviction based  upon guilt by association?"  </P> <P> Because "if a member of Congress cannot get a fair trial . . . no American  can," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trial-Like Setting  </P> <P> The arguments were made in a trial-like setting, with Susman and his team at a  "defense" table and the Ethics Committee investigators poised behind an  identical table across the room. A central lectern allowed the lawyers to speak  while standing before the committee, which sat behind a raised, wood-paneled  dais.  </P> <P> Wright's wife, Betty, arrived during Susman's arguments and took a seat in the  front row of the audience. One of the Speaker's daughters also attended, but  Wright did not.  </P> <P> Susman was asking the Ethics Committee today to dismiss key charges against  Wright based on different interpretations of the House rules. Supporters hope  for a narrow legal victory that the Speaker could parlay into political  salvation.  </P> <P> However, Richard Phelan, the outside counsel who investigated Wright for the  committee, argued that the panel should not look narrowly at the legal  arguments. The House code of conduct was designed to be comprehensive, he said.  </P> <P> "This case and this discussion is not about loopholes in tax codes," Phelan  said. "It's not about carefully crafting legislation to permit persons to evade  or to circumvent or to look askance."  </P> <P> Wright's lawyers contend that he is being judged by a new, harsher standard  that goes far beyond the letter of House rules. In advance of today's hearing,  they gave themselves no better than an even chance of winning dismissal of at  least some of the 69 counts against him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Support Eroding  </P> <P> But with Wright's political support eroding under the weight of serious ethics  charges, even the Speaker's supporters emphasize the importance of persuading  the Ethics Committee to drop at least one of the two main charges.  </P> <P> In the month since the panel formally made its charges against Wright, his  support has eroded. Members of his own party have begun holding meetings to  discuss his case and its possible harmful effect on their own political  situations.  </P> <P> The stakes in today's arguments were heightened by the Ethics Committee's  decision to allow television coverage of the hearing. Rarely does the panel  allow such open coverage, but Wright said he welcomed the chance to have his  side of the story presented.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS OK PLAN FOR CHILDREN'S COURT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has adopted a plan to build a  $52.3-million Children's Court and agreed to set aside $3.5 million to purchase  a site in Monterey Park for the new facility.  </P> <P> A 25-court children's facility will be built on the 4.17-acre site to  accommodate a program in which judges decide whether children should be placed  in foster care, as well as deciding on counseling and therapy.  </P> <P> "This court will deal exclusively with cases involving abused, abandoned and  neglected children -- youngsters who have been removed from their homes because  of the situations in those environments," said Supervisor Ed Edelman.  </P> <P> The project cost is $7.2 million higher than estimates, which officials blamed  on inflation and increases in architectural and engineering requirements.  </P></p>

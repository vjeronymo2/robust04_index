			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Changes to legal aid urged RADICAL changes to legal aid are needed to control the continuing rise in the cost of the scheme to the taxpayer, Mr John Pitts, chairman of the Legal Aid Board, said yesterday. The net cost of legal aid rose 35.4 per cent to Pounds 760m last year according to the board's annual report. The increase arose largely from a substantial rise in the demand for legal-aid services, an increase in the number of bills paid and an increase in the average cost of cases. Mr Pitts said the increases were partly created by the recession, which had increased demand for legal help. The costs of cases are controlled through assessment by the courts and determination by the board. 'Neither process has proved capable of keeping average costs in line with inflation, nor does it appear that with the present arrangements either process is capable of achieving this,' Mr Pitts said. The board's estimate of expenditure in 1992-93 was Pounds 890m, and the provision was Pounds 682m. There was no possibility of expenditure being contained within that figure and the board would have to apply for a supplementary provision, Mr Pitts continued. The situation might have been worse if the board had not met all its performance targets. The average cost of processing applications and bills had fallen by more than 18 per cent in real terms in the past three years. while the quality of the service had improved substantially. That had been achieved through good management, Mr Pitts said. He attacked the decline in productivity of legal-aid solicitors. Over the past five years, the amount of payments to solicitors out of the legal-aid fund had doubled while the number of firms doing legal-aid work had declined, he said. The report also expressed concern about suspected fraud by solicitors. Six solicitors face charges of defrauding the legal-aid fund and a further 29 cases are being investigated by the police. In total, 60 cases of suspected fraud are under investigation. Legal Aid Board, Annual Report 1991-92. HMSO. Pounds 17.</p>

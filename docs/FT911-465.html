			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Hard times ahead - The antique clock market A SUFFOLK dealer had a pleasant surprise the other week. He sold an antique clock, his first transaction in eight months. During that period he had been forced to give up his shop and he now deals from home. It is a familiar story as the recession has further reduced business in a sector of the art market which is traditionally quiet. Private buyers are scared of buying antique clocks at auction and almost as nervous shopping from a dealer. They are worried about how much of the clock is genuine and how much restoration; they are concerned about the interior mechanics and the costs of putting faults right; they wonder whether they want a ticking, striking, object in their homes. All this makes things hard for those in the antique clock trade, who can offer some of the finest antiques of their kind at extremely modest prices when compared with other objects of furniture. One problem is that there are few rich international collectors for English clocks. The Japanese have shown no interest and the state of the US economy has reduced American buying. There are a few keen native buyers, but since longcase clocks in particular are space consuming objects, an auction house or dealer is lucky to see even a committed clock customer three times in a lifetime - as he, or she, purchases his longcase, his bracket, and his carriage clock. At every specialist auction - Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips all hold at least four each year - fine Georgian longcase clocks are on offer at Pounds 2,000 or even less, with bracket clocks of the same period fetching roughly the same. Carriage clocks are usually under Pounds 1,000. To restore a decorative longcase to pristine condition should not cost more than Pounds 700, or you can buy a perfect, guaranteed, specimen from a knowledgable dealer at up to twice the auction house price. A grandfather clock is an extra large longcase which earned the soubriquet in the late 19th century in tune with a popular song of the day. As it happens late Victorian longcases did reach monumental sizes and are one of the most over-looked (in a collecting sense) - and cheapest - sectors of the market, mainly because they are ill-suited to modern homes. Not all clocks are cheap but most, perhaps especially the finest, are bargains. The English clockmakers of the late 17th century, in particular Thomas Tompion, pioneered the longcase clock after the invention of the pendulum, and a very fine specimen of his work can fetches more than Pounds 200,000. Indeed, a rare blond wood Tompion set an auction clock record of Pounds 880,000 at Christie's in 1989, only to be beaten a few weeks ago by an art deco 'Egyptian' clock made by Cartier in the 1920s, which sold for Dollars 1.5m. Christie's is offering a Tompion ebony bracket at its July 3 auction, with an estimate of Pounds 100,000. A year ago it would have been valued at twice this sum, but the clock market has shared in the general antique depression and in order to attract potential bidders Christie's has gone for an enticingly low guide price. Recent auctions have been encouraging. The trade is well stocked, but private buyers are becoming aware of the bargains on offer and although estimates have generally been fixed 25 per cent down on a year ago, take up has been good. If anything, there has been a swing away from longcase towards the smaller bracket clocks. It is a good idea to make a bid on an unsold lot after the sale: often the vendor will let it go cheaply. The problem has been to persuade sellers to risk their clocks on an uncertain market. For them the alternative is to go to the specialist dealers. Charles Lee, of R. A. Lee, reports more enquiries from owners wanting the assurance of a private sale to avoid the vagaries of the saleroom. He is currently nursing a rather nice Joseph Knibb of the 1660s which carries a price tag of around Pounds 150,000. Joseph Knibb, George Graham and David Delander make up the second rank of English clock makers, but their prices are a fathom below those of Tompion and rarely break the Pounds 100,000 barrier. Tompion is a name known and revered by the very rich who collect the finest antiques by the acknowledged masters. Although he was prolific, with his workshop producing at least 500 numbered clocks, he is a safe investment. The hunt is on among dealers and auction houses to promote equally prestigious names. The best on offer at Sotheby's on May 30 is a George II walnut longcase of around 1752 by Samuel Barkley and Thomas Colley, which carries an estimate up to Pounds 45,000. Clocks of this period usually go cheaply, but these two makers were pupils of Graham who in turn learned his skills from Tompion, so Sotheby's is suggesting a continuing tradition of excellence. Sotheby's also has a longcase by one of the later Vulliamy generations, dated 1820 and estimated at up to Pounds 30,000. For its part, Christie's, apart from the Tompion, has a carriage clock by James Fergusson Cole which is billed as the earliest English carriage clock, dated to 1823, estimated at up to Pounds 70,000. Regarded as the equal, or better, of anything produced by the celebrated Swiss innovator, Breguet, it is an enthusiast's clock but should find a buyer. However the auction houses are keeping back their best Tompions until the autumn, when they expect the economic clouds to have been dispersed. Sotheby's will then be offering six clocks from the celebrated collection of Lord Hereford. The dealers cannot enjoy such delays and although their prices will be higher than those prevailing in the saleroom you will have a guaranteed clock in fine working order. Anthony Woodburn of Tunbridge Wells has access to clocks as good as any passing through the auctions. At next month's Olympia Antiques Fair, you will find Strike One of Islington, which specialises in lantern and chinoisserie lacquered longcase clocks, and Gerard Campbell, who deals mainly in early 19th century Viennese regulator clocks. The Clock Clinic, which restores clocks, is also taking space at Olympia. At the even grander Grosvenor House Fair, R. A. Lee will be showing furniture as well as clocks. It is a sad postscript to the clock market that while the best 18th century and Regency English furniture thrives during a recession, clocks of the period are regarded as different and difficult. In the past, the best furniture dealers embraced clocks. A little knowledge and the advice of an expert can open up the mysterious world of clocks and owners can enjoy a useful decorative, and appreciating, domestic friend.</p>

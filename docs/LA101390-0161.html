			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SOFT TRACK FOR ROTHMANS IS PERFECT FOR FRENCH GLORY  </P> <P> The rain falling in Toronto Friday didn't make Andre Fabre angry. Nor will  Fabre be upset if it's raining two weeks from today in New York.  </P> <P> Fabre trains French Glory, a 4-year-old French colt who thrives on soft turf.  The horse is a 5-2 favorite in Sunday's Rothmans International at Woodbine, the  suburban Toronto track, and he's likely to be an even shorter price if the  course comes up yielding, which it probably will.  </P> <P> French Glory has come to North America on a two-race mission, the main event  being the $2-million Breeders' Cup Turf at Belmont Park on Oct. 27.  </P> <P> Although French Glory ran fourth in his last race, he was only 2 1/4 lengths  behind Saumarez, who went on to win the Arc de Triomphe. Saumarez and French  Glory are expected to meet again in the Breeders' Cup.  </P> <P> With Sunday's running, the Rothmans joins the list of $1-million races. Second  choice in the 1 1/2-mile stake is Roseate Tern, the 4-year-old English filly  who also has the Breeders' Cup on her itinerary. If the course is too soggy,  however, Roseate Tern might be scratched Sunday.  </P> <P> Hodges Bay, the American horse who won last year's Rothmans, is part of  Sunday's 10-horse field.  </P> <P> At Bay Meadows Sunday, 10 regional qualifiers are running in the $250,000 Final  Fourteen. The 1 1/8-mile race has drawn second-rate horses, with Tex's Zing,  the Illinois representative, listed as the 3-1 favorite. The Final Fourteen  doesn't have 14 horses because some of the qualifiers have opted for bigger  things. BILL CHRISTINE  </P></p>

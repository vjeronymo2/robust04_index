			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Siemens sells pacemaker unit Siemens, the Munich-based electronics and electricals group, is selling its US-based cardiac pacemaker manufacturing business for 'slightly over' Dollars 500m. The buyer is St Jude Medical, a manufacturer of artificial heart valves and blood pumps based in St Paul, Minnesota. The pacemaker business generated Dollars 350m in turnover for Siemens last year. Siemens said the sale was driven by strategic considerations, in view of changes in the market for products implanted during heart surgery, including artificial blood vessels, valves, heart muscle pumps and artificial hearts. Physicians and hospitals had previously bought individual products from different companies, but there was now a trend towards 'single-sourcing', Siemens said. This trend was encouraging the development of companies providing the full spectrum of products. Siemens supplies a range of products to cardiologists, but its activities in the field of cardiac systems for implantation are limited to pacemakers. It said yesterday it had decided to sell the business - the second biggest manufacturer of pacemakers in the world - rather than seek to expand across the full range of implantation products. Siemens is the world's largest manufacturer of medical systems, with total sales of DM7.9bn (Dollars 5.03bn) in this area last year. It said the pacemaker business was profitable, and that sales had risen consistently in recent years. A total of 1,300 employees will move to St Jude as a result of the sale. The sale will take effect in the fourth quarter of Siemens' current financial year, which ends on September 30.</p>

Nicola, an eclectic  restaurant in Los Angeles. Tabbouleh, the classic Middle Eastern bulgur wheat  and parsley salad, is an ideal picnic dish. You can turn it into a main dish  salad by adding cubes of cooked chicken, turkey or even shrimp. That makes the  salad a complete meal, containing grain, vegetable and meat.  </P> <P> L.A.

Add lemon juice, oil and season to taste with salt. Mix well. Garnish with lime  wedges. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: I've enjoyed the recipe for lemon velvet for years, but it seems  we've started the '90s out by losing it.  </P> <P>  -- MRS. C.N.  </P> <P> DEAR MRS. C.N.: We too lost our recipe but found an iced version (a lovely  chilled dessert for summer entertaining) in "The Best of Shaker Cooking" by Amy  Bess Miller and Persis Fuller (MacMillan, $19.95).  </P> <P> ICED LEMON VELVET  </P> <P> Juice and grated zest of 6 lemons  </P> <P> 1/2 cup boiling water  </P> <P> 4 cups sugar  </P> <P> 1 quart milk  </P> <P> 1 quart whipping cream, whipped  </P> <P> Place lemon juice and zest in large mixing bowl.

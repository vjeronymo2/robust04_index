			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MR. GREEN JEANS;  </P> <P> STUCK WITH PERPLEXING ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS? CALL ECOLOGICAL DESIGNER JIM BELL  FOR HELP  </P> <P> It was almost 15 years ago while he was building custom houses that Jim Bell  began to be converted.  </P> <P> "I think all my life I've tried to see below the surface of things," he says.  "The houses I was building looked nice, but they were energy hogs and they used  too much water. I was becoming more aware of where the raw materials were  coming from and what kind of ecological assaults were taking place. Even a  material as simple as plywood was unhealthy, because of the glues.  </P> <P> "I just got tired of building things that were stupid."  </P> <P> So Bell -- who had played varsity basketball at Cal State Long Beach, received  a degree in environmental design from San Diego State and become a journeyman  carpenter -- changed his life.  </P> <P> "I wanted to make a living in a way I could feel morally good about and a way  that would potentially make the world better," he says.  </P> <P> Bell, 47, today is a self-described "ecological designer" with an environmental  focus that emphasizes problem-solving.  </P> <P> He looks at house plans and asks questions like: Why is all the shower water  going into the sewage system? Where can the rain runoff be collected and  stored? How can solar heating be used? Where's the recycling system for table  scraps? How can the landscape system produce edible food?  </P> <P> These are uncommon considerations for builders or buyers in today's housing  market. But Bell maintains it's only a matter of time before priorities start  shifting.  </P> <P> "Most of the things we are doing are destroying the ecology, and at some point  we have to pay the piper," he says. "It's better for the economy to do things  ecologically right than to do things wrong and try to clean up afterward. We  have a lot of ways to solve environmental problems right now and I want all  developers to be considering them and using them."  </P> <P> His concern is not limited to houses. "What I really want to do is redesign  cities," he says, in his calm, no-nonsense manner. "We need to move away from  ecologically damaging systems to sustainable systems in all aspects of our  environment."  </P> <P> He argues that this is possible, particularly in California, which he sees as a  global leader in trying new ideas: "If just one California city would make a  change over to ecologically sustainable systems, it would have a major impact."  </P> <P> Bell's mission is to nudge that process along. "He's been ahead of his time for  years," says longtime acquaintance Dave Burnight, director of San Diego State's  campus ministry house. "Jim isn't flashy or charismatic. He doesn't look like  any kind of prophet, but he gets things done. We contracted with him for  consultant work for a new center because we want it to be a demonstration in  itself of what we believe in: energy efficiency, solar usage and a place that  invites community."  </P> <P> Bell is not only a consultant. With a background of environmental research, he  has become a builder, planner, publisher, teacher and speaker, and, working  with private groups and public agencies, has designed everything from solar  systems to edible landscapes.  </P> <P> His projects are big and small. He won a Water Conservation Award from the City  of San Diego for a 21-unit apartment project using flow-restricters on shower  heads and faucets and one-gallon flush toilets, as well as drought-resistant  landscaping. He is now working on a large-scale experimental system that  recycles water for irrigation and nutrients for fertilizer in Tijuana.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Back-Yard Solar Oven  </P> <P> For friends Mike and Pat McCoy of Imperial Beach, he built a back-yard solar  oven. "Jim does a lot of practical things like that for his friends," Pat McCoy  says. "He's been in the vanguard of planning solutions to some of these  problems we are just starting to worry about. He made us see a long time ago  that you can't keep throwing pollutants into the air and let landfills  overflow."  </P> <P> In 1978, Bell founded the Ecological Life Systems Institute, a nonprofit group  that he runs on a $10,000 budget from a converted garage office at his home  near Balboa Park. He pays himself "as little as possible" and relies heavily on  volunteers.  </P> <P> "You have to take Jim seriously," says Mary Clark, biology professor at San  Diego State University, where Bell is guest lecturer in a Global Future course.  </P> <P> "He has a lot of sound ideas and documentation about how San Diego could live  within its own environmental income in a sustainable way. Some of the things  might not work 100% but would certainly be a grand improvement on what we are  now doing, so they are worth hearing and demonstrating. And he has done all  this virtually on his own, without any big grants."  </P> <P> Bell, a towering redhead who has maintained the trimness of his time in  collegiate athletics, seems to be in a dozen places at once. He spends several  days a week at the Ocean Beach Peoples' Food Cooperative, specializing in  organically grown produce.  </P> <P> The cooperative, of which he is board president, is an example of a trend whose  time has come, he says, noting the recent public frenzy over pesticides: "It  doesn't require any great leap of intellectual power to realize many of these  ideas are common sense."  </P> <P> He senses there are networks of entrepreneurs poised on the periphery of  today's market, ready to introduce biodegradable plastics, nontoxic paints and  glues, whole lines of organically grown produce and dozens of other nontoxic  items.  </P> <P> "I get all kinds of different catalogues with new products," he says. "It's  just a matter of getting the free-enterprise system to work with us. I think  people have been ready to listen for a long time."  </P> <P> San Diego businessman Rick Cabados sought an environmental-minded consultant to  design a mountain retreat and discovered Bell by word of mouth: "We wanted an  ecologically planned community, an ashram, something that would be a model, and  I just sort of sent the message out around town that I needed a consultant. All  kinds of different people mentioned Jim Bell, and he has worked with us from  the start. I knew what I wanted, but just needed the guidance and resource  information and Jim was very helpful."  </P> <P> Cabados' stucco-and-stone complex will have 6-inch walls, dual-glazed glass and  solar heating. "We drilled our own well and have a generating system using  propane, so it is clean," he says. "Jim sat down with the contractors and  worked it all out -- he has done construction, so he could help with that end  too. He is totally dedicated. He may be making a living at it now but this is  out of love."  </P> <P> Bell, who has lived in everything from a tent to a glorified camper (his  current house is a conventional frame model), doesn't think he is making any  sacrifices.  </P> <P> "I get up every morning and do something I like to do," he says. "I want to  live life from a real perspective. Some people would say I am unselfish, but I  think I am selfish. I get tremendous public support."  </P> <P> Another friend notes of him "that he is not a gloom-and-doom prophet," a  personal assessment with which Bell agrees. He accentuates the positive. "My  message," he says, "is that we have an infinity of opportunities, so many ways  to solve these problems."  </P> <P> He tries to spread his message by giving about 60 lectures a year, showing  audiences how urban regions can be designed to provide for human wants and  needs in ecologically sustainable ways. His audiences this month alone range  from the Bonita Organic Garden Club to the group Beyond War.  </P> <P> Over the weekend, he brought his slide show to Los Angeles to the Cooperative  Resources and Services Project, whose members also are involved in designing  co-housing and shared housing projects. He was invited, said project director  Lois Arkin, because he's "one of only a handful of people in the country  incorporating practical ecological design into all aspects of the built  environment."  </P> <P> Bell is undaunted by the scope of his undertaking. "It is all very practical,"  he says. "The unique thing I do is focus on solutions to ecological problems. I  show how an urban region can be redesigned to do everything it does now:  provide employment; provide transportation (and) recreation opportunities;  ensure plenty of energy, water and a secure food supply; but to accomplish all  those things in ways that work with the natural system of our planet.  </P> <P> "Everything I talk about is based on known technology," he adds. "I show people  that the problem is not a lack of technology but a lack of consciousness -- a  matter of not knowing what we have available."  </P> <P> An obvious priority is for more efficient energy use. He shows audience slides  of available technologies -- Japanese vans getting 80 miles per gallon, a  Canadian housing project where foot-thick insulation reduces heating bills to a  minimum, a refrigerator with the motor and compressor on top instead of  underneath, cutting its energy use by almost 80%.  </P> <P> A typical packet of material from his Ecological Life Systems includes:  articles on biodegradable products now available; an extensive reading list on  organic gardening; a proposal for the San Diego region's future water supply;  and a draft of his plan for a Peace Ecology University where technologies would  be demonstrated, nontoxic products would be sold and environmental groups  nationwide could coordinate their efforts.  </P> <P> He doesn't think that is overly ambitious, and, despite his one-man office, he  doesn't feel lonely. "I'm on the board of directors of five different  organizations, all working one way or another toward the same thing. We are  just building for the future.  </P> <P> "My dream is that someone like me will be hired by Los Angeles or San Diego to  put together a design team, remodeling and development plan for the whole urban  region, to take us into the 21st Century."  </P></p>

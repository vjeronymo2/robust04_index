			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Tory Euro-rebel attacks Major Mr Michael Carttiss, one of the Euro-rebels who lost the Tory whip, launched an attack on Mr John Major in the Commons last night. Responding to recent appeals by the prime minister for unity in support of the manifesto on which the Tories won the 1992 election, Mr Carttiss made clear that he had no intention of begging to be allowed to return to the fold. Mr Carttiss said he had sought to honour the manifesto while Mr Major had failed to fulfil pledges to curb the sums paid by Britain to the European Union.</p>

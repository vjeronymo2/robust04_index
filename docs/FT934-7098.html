			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Government spending curbs hit drug sales Drug sales in Europe have stagnated in the wake of reforms aimed at curbing spending on pharmaceuticals in Germany, Italy and the UK. Sales in pharmacies in the seven biggest European markets, which together form the world's biggest drugs market, were static at constant exchange rates during the first nine months of this year, according to IMS International, the market research group. In dollar terms they fell from Dollars 38.4bn (Pounds 25.7bn) in the first three quarters of 1992 to Dollars 34bn in the same period this year. Further reforms to limit pharmaceuticals spending, recently announced in Spain and Portugal, will add to the pressure on sales. France is also expected to reveal a new drug pricing scheme. Pharmaceuticals companies are also struggling with sluggish growth in the US, the world's biggest single market. This grew only 4 per cent from Dollars 31.9bn to Dollars 33.2bn. Sales have been held back by the growing power of bulk buyers of health services who can negotiate ever-greater discounts. The Japanese market, the world's second largest single market, rose 13 per cent in yen-terms from Dollars 11.3bn to Dollars 14.6bn. However, a 7 per cent price cut is expected to be introduced next year by the ministry of health and welfare. The slowdown in Europe was mostly the result of a collapse in sales in Germany, Europe's largest market. These dropped from Dollars 10.9bn to Dollars 9.3bn, a fall of 10 per cent at constant exchange rates. German pharmaceuticals groups, often highly dependent on domestic sales, suffered by more than the 10 per cent headline figure, however, because of changes in doctors' prescribing habits, away from expensive patented products to cheap non-patented ones. During the first four months, sales at the seven largest research-intensive drug manufacturers fell 16.5 per cent, while sales at the four largest generic companies increased 36 per cent, according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. As a result, most drugs companies operating in Germany have announced restructuring programmes. The Italian market also declined, from Dollars 8.4bn to Dollars 6.2bn, a drop of 3 per cent excluding currencies.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             WORLD PHARMACY DRUG PURCHASES JANUARY-SEPTEMBER                       1993 IN US DOLLARS (MILLION)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               US     Japan*   Germany    France   Italy                            Dollars   Dollars  Dollars   Dollars  Dollars  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular              5,408     2,239    2,288     2,255    1,370 Alimentary, Metabolism      5,281     2,787    1,623     1,531      954 Anti-infectives             5,501       744      994     1,003      600 Central Nervous System      3,419     1,215    1,010       678      399 Respiratory                 3,088     1,976      578     1,032      639 Musculo-Skeletal            1,683     1,423      526       405      365 Blood, Organs               1,369     1,094      363       537      437 Others                      7,420     3,161    1,963     1,517    1,527 Total                      33,169    14,639    9,345     8,958    6,291 % Increase*                     4        13      -10         6       -3  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Spain       UK    Netherlands   Belgium                              Dollars   Dollars    Dollars     Dollars  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular                 597       640       218          228 Alimentary, Metabolism         510       714       268          181 Anti-infectives                326       517       145          174 Central Nervous System         309       560       168          111 Respiratory                    408       265        79          141 Musculo-Skeletal               168       277        55           67 Blood, Organs                  168        61        46           45 Others                         868       745       218          194 Total                        3,354     3,779     1,197        1,141 % Increase*                     12        11        12            5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IMS International  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Non-hospital market only *Increase excluding currencies  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: BIG EAST INVITES MIAMI TO JOIN UP  </P> <P> The University of Miami on Monday received an invitation to become the 10th  member of the Big East Conference, and the school's board of trustees will  decide Wednesday whether to accept the offer.  </P> <P> Big East officials have been courting the independent school for several  months, and had reportedly been awaiting a signal that Miami would accept an  invitation before extending one.  </P> <P> But Miami Athletic Director Sam Jankovich and President Edward Foote declined  to predict how the 55-member board would vote.  </P> <P> If the invitation is accepted, the role of Miami's football program in the Big  East would be decided later. Boston College, Pittsburgh and Syracuse are the  only Big East schools that play major college football, and all are  independents in that sport.  </P> <P> The other schools in the league are Georgetown, Connecticut, Providence, St.  John's, Seton Hall and Villanova.  </P></p>

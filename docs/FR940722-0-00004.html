			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 615.5201(j)(6)_Definition of ``Permanent Capital''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter encouraged the FCA to provide guidelines in the regulations by which the financial assistance provided by the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (FCSIC) would be counted as permanent capital. In addition, the commenter asserted that the nature of the security, and not the holder of the security, should be the determinant in counting capital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA does not believe it necessary or useful to set forth in the regulations guidelines to be followed by the FCA in determining how it would count assistance provided by the FCSIC. Since the FCA does not know what form FCSIC assistance may take, it is impossible to determine at this time whether the assistance would qualify as permanent capital. Moreover, the FCA disagrees with the comment that the FCSIC should be treated the same as any other security holder in determining whether FCSIC assistance is permanent capital. The role of the FCSIC as a provider of financial assistance to System institutions is statutory and unique.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 615.5210(d)_Counting of Treasury-Paid Interest as Permanent Capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter stated a belief that the preamble description of proposed &sect;615.5210(d) was inconsistent with the text of the proposed regulation, in that the preamble indicated that only assessments passed on directly to associations would be added back to the association's capital (and would not be added back to the bank's capital).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of calculating the permanent capital ratio, it was not the FCA's intention to differentiate between assessments directly passed on to the associations and assessments passed on ``indirectly (through loan pricing or otherwise)'' as provided by the statute. Congress apparently contemplated that there would be three possible ways of paying the cost of assessments:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The FCB would not directly or indirectly pass on the cost, even though the ultimate effect would be felt by the associations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The FCB would assess associations directly for an amount based on proportionate average accruing retail loan volumes of the associations for the preceding year; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The bank would indirectly assess associations by adjusting the interest rate on the direct loan or some other method based on proportionate average accruing retail loan volumes of each association for the preceding year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The difference between method 1 and method 3 is that the ultimate effect of method 1 on an association is in proportion to the amount of its investment in the bank or its direct loan, whereas method 3's ``cost'' is based on average accruing retail loan volumes. Changes have been made in the final regulations to clarify that, when an FCB directly assesses an association (method 2), or when it indirectly assesses an association by specifically identifying the assessment in other charges made by the FCB to the association (method 3), the amount of the assessment is added back to the capital of the association (and not to the capital of the bank).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this connection, it is the FCA's view that, while the regulations do not require an FCB to enter into an agreement with its direct lender associations that would specify whether and how assessments would be passed through, there are important advantages in having a written understanding. This would clearly document the understandings and expectations of all parties and would provide more certainty to all parties for business planning and capital building purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter asked how the amount of assessments passed indirectly to an association is to be reported in the Call Reports of the institution. The instructions to the Call Reports specify how this is to be done.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)_Basis for Allotment of Allocated Investment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter recommended that the references to ``a percentage allotment'' of the allocated investment be changed to a ``percentage or other allotment.'' Such a change would, for example, enable an FCB to count the allocated investment up to a specific percentage of the association's direct loan from the bank. Alternatively, the bank may wish to count a specified dollar amount of the investment. The FCA believes that an allotment based on a specific dollar amount would be appropriate but does not believe that the allotment should be tied to floating factors such as the direct loan amount. The permanent capital ratio is used as one of the key determinants of a Farm Credit institution's financial health and stability. Allowing permanent capital to move frequently based on floating measures, such as loan volume outstanding, diminishes the permanent capital ratio's usefulness as a financial measure. If the allotment is left to float, it could change daily, beyond the control of management. This may not be appropriate during stressful periods in some institutions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Accordingly, the final regulation has been revised to permit only an allocation based on a dollar amount and/or a percentage of the allocated investment. The amount of allocated investment could be determined based on a dollar amount, and any earnings that may be distributed could be allotted on a percentage basis. The FCA believes that this permits adequate flexibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> If, for example, an institution's permanent capital ratio were under the minimum required, the capital ratio should not be lowered based on an automatic adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

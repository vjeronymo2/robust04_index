After the meeting, Sun Yafu, deputy secretary-general of  ARATS, said: During the discussion, both parties expressed their  opinions about the crucial points of the three topics which need  to be resolved. Both sides further exchanged their opinions and  deepened their understanding. But the two sides have not yet  reached a consensus on some issues that need to be resolved.    According to a suggestion raised by Xu Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu],  deputy secretary-general of SEF, both sides have decided through  consultation to hold another comprehensive discussion on the  morning of 30 March to give it another try.    It was learned that discussion of the three topics --  including cracking down on criminal activities committed at sea,  as well as other topics concerning economic, scientific, and  technological matters which were scheduled to be discussed by  ARATS and SEF on 28 March -- were not conducted due to the  absence of Shi Qiping [Shih Chi-ping], another deputy  secretary-general of SEF.</p>

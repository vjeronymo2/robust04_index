			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Sales fall cuts Acal to Pounds 2.8m DECREASED SALES in the UK, France and Italy caused Acal, the USM-quoted electronics and industrial control equipment wholesaler, to turn in sharply reduced pre-tax profits, from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 2.78m, for the year to March 31. Total sales were down at Pounds 58.5m (Pounds 59.7m) and operating profits declined to Pounds 3.49m (Pounds 5.06m). New business acquisitions contributed Pounds 3.2m to sales. The purchase of the Waycom electronics components business had a negative impact on profit in the last quarter, but should contribute to profits next year following reorganisation. Earnings per share came out at 14p (20.5p) and a final dividend of 3.9p is recommended, making an increased total of 5.85p (5.4p) for the year.</p>

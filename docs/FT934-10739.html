			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / California fires continue path of destruction WILDFIRES continued to rage out of control in Malibu and other parts of southern California yesterday, after a night of spectacular destruction. Walls of flames roared out of the Santa Monica mountains and down canyons toward the Pacific ocean, consuming at least 350 buildings overnight. In Malibu, a city of 15,000 that winds along 27 miles of beachfront and includes some of the most expensive homes in the region, hillside mansions burst into flames, palm trees became giant torches and cars exploded from the heat. The Malibu fire was the biggest of four new blazes that broke out on Tuesday, only 13 days after 13 huge firestorms swept through the region, destroying an estimated 780 homes and other buildings and charring 180,000 acres from Los Angeles to the Mexican border. In addition to the Malibu fire, blazes were reported to the east and south in Riverside County, San Bernardino County and San Diego County. Driven by 50mph Santa Ana winds, the fires raced through the coastal hills and canyons of Malibu on Tuesday night, thwarting the efforts of more than 3,000 firefighters and hundreds of volunteers who attacked the flames from the ground and air. Authorities estimated that damages would run into hundreds of millions of dollars. Among the victims of yesterday's Malibu blaze were several Hollywood celebrities, including Sean Penn and Bruce Willis, whose homes were destroyed. Some 2,500 people were forced to evacuate the area, with many more leaving voluntarily. An evacuation was ordered for the exclusive 'Malibu Colony', home to many celebrities, including Larry Hagman, Johnny Carson, Barbra Streisand, Steven Spielberg, Dustin Hoffman and Sylvester Stallone. 'The fire is making progress. I can't say that we are,' Mr Brian Gordan, Los Angeles Fire Chief, said yesterday morning. Some 56,000 acres have already been consumed, he estimated. New flare-ups threatened Pepperdine University yesterday morning and parts of the Pacific Coast Highway, which winds along the coast, were on fire, preventing firetrucks from reaching areas in danger. At least 10 people were injured, including British screenwriter and director Duncan Gibbins, who received severe burns over most of his body when his home above Malibu was engulfed in flames as he was trying to rescue his cat. Water-dropping helicopters were ordered to fight the Malibu blaze for the first time at night. Officials said yesterday morning that the situation remained extremely volatile.</p>

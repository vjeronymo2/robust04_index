			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 18 Feb (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AHRAM asserts  that the security forces' recent preemptive strikes against the  terrorist groups are an indication of a new, successful security  policy that aims to keep the initiative in the hands of the  police and deny the terrorists the chance of lying low until it  is time to perpetrate a new crime.    In its editorial today, the paper says that the new security  policy is based on the availability of accurate and specific  data about the terrorist organizations, their operational  methods, hideouts, and modes of communication with each other in  Egypt and with their financiers and instigators abroad.    The paper adds: The facts prove beyond a shadow of doubt  that these unbalanced young men, devoid of any true religious  faith, have consciously or unconsciously become agents of  foreign anti-Egypt schemes to undermine the country's successful  economic reform program.    The paper concludes: Now that the picture is perfectly clear  and the identities of the murderers known, there is no  alternative to an all-out confrontation using the law's sharp  scalpel to excise this malignant tumor from the homeland's body.</p>

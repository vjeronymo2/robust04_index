			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Books: Travellers' tales for anxious aspirants - Chloe Chard on tourism and its limitations THE BEATEN TRACK by James Buzard Clarendon Press, Oxford Pounds 35,357 pages TOURISM, as James Buzard points out, has long been the object of supercilious sneers: an article of 1865 suggested that the new package tours organized by Thomas Cook offered 'a kind of Continental experience which is to that obtained in the regular way precisely what a 'dicky' (a false shirt front) is to a shirt.' Since the beginnings of touristic travel early in the 19th century, Buzard argues in this well-documented book (sub-titled European Tourism, Literature, and the Ways to Culture, 1800-1918), there has been a tradition of 'anti-tourism' which has established a sharp distinction between 'those who feel enthusiasm' and those of limited sensibilities. Anti-tourists have attempted to define their own experiences of foreign countries as 'authentic and unique,' partly by seeking out places removed sharply from the more mundane aspects of modern life. Travellers aspiring beyond the banalities of the 'beaten track' have, nonetheless, often been troubled by an uneasy awareness that they are themselves trapped within the limitations of tourism. The final chapters, on Henry James and EM Forster, place particular emphasis on this discouraging realisation. Forster's writings, Buzard observes, show that those who profess spiritual affinities with foreign culture can be every bit as baneful in their effect on foreigners as more humble tourists. In Forster's short story The Eternal Moment, for example, an English female novelist returns to the alpine town of Vorta, which has become a popular resort as a result of a novel she wrote about it 20 years earlier. On her first visit, a handsome, athletic young porter made amorous advances to her  -an episode she remembers with some excitement. He now re-appears as the fat, prosperous concierge of the Grand Hotel des Alpes; she realises that she herself, in bringing tourism to Vorta, is responsible for 'his greasy stoutness, his big black kiss-curl, his waxed moustache.' Even in narratives of disillusionment such as this, it could be argued that it is possible to discern traces of a more uncompromisingly romantic approach to travel. Tourism enters into conflict not only with anti-tourist fastidiousness but also with an urge to cast aside constraint, to act out transgressive desires in foreign places, and to place one's self-identity at risk. When outlining the 'romantic' attitude towards travel, Buzard cites Samuel Rogers' resolutely-staid definition of a journey abroad as a safe and 'innocent' outlet for potentially disruptive desires. A 'Byronic model' of the lone wanderer escaping home and family also is mentioned briefly. Byronism, however, is associated less with wild, destabilising promptings than with a smugly self-confirmatory masculine pose - linked to the fantasy of Italy as a 'woman-country . . . yielding itself to appropriation by male imaginations from the North.' Reference back to the life and works of Byron himself, Buzard demonstrates, became an expected part of the standard ritualised itinerary of Europe: the poet's reputation as 'the scandalous embodiment of an anti-British Continentalism' was modified swiftly as his writings were quoted sententiously by guide books and his travels invoked piously by local guides and servants. ' Many sections of The Beaten Track are full of insight and crisp definition; the book includes, for example, a brisk survey of the role of the guide book in the early-20th century novel; and an elegant account of the 'family abroad plot' in which ambitious but impressionable mothers and daughters pursue social advantage and trivial diversion in Italy. If the reader feels, nonetheless, a bit dispirited by Buzard's emphasis on anxious aspiration, I recommend strongly the more cheerful view of tourism offered by Evelyn Waugh's Labels. Waugh, happily, envisages 'the middle-aged widow of comfortable means' attracted by travel brochures in which 'that rosy sequence of association, desert moon, pyramids, palms . . . all delicately point the way to sheik, rape, and harem.'</p>

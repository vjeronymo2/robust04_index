			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Fragile upturn looms over Clarke meeting: Why big decisions on the Budget will be postponed until next month BROAD issues of strategy rather than detail are expected to be at the centre of today's internal Treasury discussions on the Budget at Dorneywood, in Buckinghamshire. With just over six weeks to go before Britain's first unified Budget on November 30, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is decamping from London with his ministerial team and top officials. They will gather against a background of less favourable economic data than when they held a similar meeting at the end of July. Although yesterday's news of a 13,600 drop in seasonally-adjusted unemployment in September suggests that the economy is continuing to grow, the recovery has come to look more patchy and fragile. A sharp drop in exports in July, the fall in manufacturing output over the summer and the upwards creep of inflationary pressures in the high street and at the factory gate in recent months have upset earlier theories that inflation is dead - or that Britain was enjoying a 'near perfect' recovery based on rising investment and sales abroad. Although Professor Alan Budd, the government's chief economic adviser, will tell today's meeting that the economy is on track to grow by perhaps 1.8 per cent rather than the 1.25 per cent real-growth forecast for this year in the March Budget, he will warn that the weak economic performance of many continental European economies poses a threat to recovery. Mr Clarke has often said that he will leave the final decisions on the Budget until next month, when he will have the most up-to-date information on the development of the economy. The recent unclear signals will reinforce that inclination. The chancellor will be joined by his four Treasury ministers - including Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, and Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary. His two special advisers, Mrs Tessa Keswick and Mr David Roughly, will be there to remind him of the political ramifications of any proposed moves. The small group of top Treasury officials will be headed by Sir Terence Burns, the permanent secretary. It will also include Mr Andrew Turnbull, second permanent secretary in charge of public spending, and possibly Sir Nigel Wicks, the second permanent secretary in charge of finance and the Treasury's 'foreign minister'. Mr Robert Culpin, the senior official in charge of fiscal policy, will be present with a list of possible revenue raising measures for the Budget. Possible further curtailment of mortgage interest relief is one of the options under consideration. The inclusion of Sir Anthony Battishill, the chairman of the board of the Inland Revenue, in the list of officials attending the Dorneywood talks, is a sign that they are likely to focus on taxation rather than government spending. The EDX cabinet committee, charged with keeping government spending within its Pounds 254bn 'control total' for 1994-95, held a meeting yesterday but has not completed its negotiations. With more EDX meetings due next week, the Dorneywood gathering may not wish to delve too deeply into public expenditure issues. On the other hand, there are always tax changes, including moves to close loopholes or smooth administration, that the Inland Revenue wishes to have included in the Budget. This stage of the pre-Budget deliberations is a good time for considering and trimming the Inland Revenue's wish list, before the politically-charged tax decisions are finally decided by the chancellor next month. The chancellor has hinted repeatedly that he believes taxes will have to rise to make a significant dent in the public sector borrowing requirement, which the Treasury estimates at about Pounds 50bn for 1993-94. He has made no secret of his preference for indirect rather than direct taxes and his belief that the tax system should encourage business activity, investment and savings. But Mr Clarke will be leaving until November his all-important judgment on how much, if anything at all, the government should take out of the economy to narrow the deficit. That judgment, made in the light of the next month's economic developments, will determine the shape and content of his first Budget.</p>

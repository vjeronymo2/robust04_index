			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Nigeria may need debt relief to secure democracy MR ERNEST Shonekan, chairman of Nigeria's transitional council, faces an unenviable task. Six months is not long for the council, which will run the country under military supervision until an elected government is installed in August, to re-impose fiscal and monetary discipline and devise a credible medium-term economic strategy. But unless radical changes occur, and soon, Nigeria's new civilian government risks sinking in a mire of inflation, economic stagnation and civilian unrest. Nigeria's return to democracy could hardly have come at a more difficult time. Over the past year, the scale of recent economic mismanagement has emerged. Domestic credit expansion doubled in the first nine months of 1992, compared to the previous year; annual inflation has risen to 45 per cent; the budget deficit has more than doubled since 1989 to over 12 per cent of GDP; and the exchange rate has collapsed, falling from 18 naira to the dollar a year ago to over 30 naira in last week's cancelled foreign exchange auction. The transitional council has wasted little time. It has announced a three-year plan to reduce the fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP to 3.3 per cent in 1995 and cut inflation to 5 per cent, hoping this will allow it to negotiate an extended structural adjustment facility with the IMF and reschedule Nigeria's external debts. Yet Mr Shonekan must also persuade the civilian government to persist with IMF-style structural adjustment. Nigeria's own Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP), instituted in 1986, may have halted the decline in the country's fledgling manufacturing base. However there is little evidence to suggest it has stopped the fall in living standards that has persisted throughout President Babangida's seven-year military rule. The combination of falling oil prices and exchange rate depreciation has reduced average real income per head from Dollars 1,000 in 1980 to a mere Dollars 290 in 1991, making Nigeria one of sub-Saharan Africa's poorest countries, as well as its most populous. Structural adjustment has been impeded by the debilitating drain on resources from Nigeria's external debt which has grown since the SAP began, as the upper chart shows. Nigeria's external debt stood at Dollars 27.6bn last year, about 100 per cent of Nigeria's GDP. Over 60 per cent of this debt is now owed to members of the Paris Club of government creditors, with the UK still the largest single creditor. World Bank officials describe this debt burden as unsustainably high. Without rescheduling, interest payments would average Dollars 5bn a year in 1993-96, consuming 36 per cent of Nigeria's total export revenue compared to an average 19 per cent for all developing countries last year and 30 per cent for severely indebted countries. Yet the Paris Club continues to treat Nigeria as a middle-income country, even though it is officially classified as a heavily indebted low-income country and qualifies for concessional debt relief. Debt rescheduling on middle-income country terms merely reduces the interest burden today by raising it in the future while leaving the debt stock little changed. A sustainable solution requires outright debt reduction, either using the enhanced Toronto terms or the more generous Trinidad terms which were proposed in 1991 but have never been applied by the Paris Club. The Trinidad terms imply a a one-off reduction of two-thirds of eligible debt and an extended repayment period. But the cost of rescheduling Nigeria's debts on concessional terms exceeds that for the rest of sub-Saharan Africa combined. The coming months are critical for Nigeria. The UK has said it will consider a unilateral application of the Trinidad terms if Nigeria can reach an IMF agreement. But without substantial debt relief, preferably linked to public sector reform to root out corruption, Nigeria has little chance of sustaining an IMF programme. The Shonekan government offers only a brief window of opportunity for western creditors to do a conditional deal with a non-elected civilian authority for the new elected administration to inherit. It is a chance which may not recur.</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SABAN SEEKS OLDER TV AUDIENCE;  </P> <P> PROGRAMS: THE FOUNDER OF SABAN ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH PRODUCES CHILDREN'S SHOWS,  TAKES THE LEAP TO PRIME TIME.  </P> <P> Haim Saban can hardly sit still when he talks. The founder, chairman and chief  executive of Burbank-based Saban Entertainment twitches nervously in his chair,  cracks a joke, then jumps up and scurries across the room without explanation.  </P> <P> But all this energy doesn't go unused. The 45-year-old Israeli native works  16-hour days, seven days a week, trying to build his company into a diversified  entertainment concern.  </P> <P> Since he founded Saban Entertainment in 1980, Saban has primarily produced  musical scores for children's programming, as well as producing children's TV  shows. His programs include "Kidd Video," an MTV-like show that ran for two  years on NBC, "ALF Tales," an animated fairy-tale adventure series currently on  NBC, and "Camp Candy," an animated NBC series featuring the voice of actor John  Candy.  </P> <P> But Saban has bigger plans and is setting his sights on prime time. His company  is producing six miniseries and TV movies, including "Phantom of the Opera," a  miniseries starring Burt Lancaster and Charles Dance that will appear on NBC in  the spring. The company is also producing its first late-night show, a  comedy/variety series called "Offshore TV," hosted by the Hudson Brothers,  which it plans to sell in first-run syndication.  </P> <P> "What happens in this city is people specialize in areas," Saban said. "We  don't want to be put in any niche. We're in kids, we're in first-run  syndication, we're in prime time, we're in late night, and we intend to stay  that way."  </P> <P> Some industry veterans say the jump from daytime to prime time won't be easy.  "You're dealing with a completely different type of audience," said Larry  Friedericks, executive vice president of Fries International, a subsidiary of  the television production company Fries Entertainment. "Having a cute little  dog arfing is different than having dramatic actresses and actors," he said.  </P> <P> But prime-time shows can be far more lucrative than daytime children's shows,  and Saban said he wants to be as diversified as possible. "Being in all those  businesses allows us to hedge our bets," he said.  </P> <P> Since Saban moved to the United States in 1980, after a career as a record  producer in France, his company has grown steadily, and in the past couple of  years he's hired executives to help manage and maintain that growth. In August,  he brought on Tom Palmieri, who quit his executive post at MTM Enterprises  ("The Bob Newhart Show," "St. Elsewhere," "Hill Street Blues"). Palmieri is now  Saban's president. In 1988 Saban also hired Stan Golden from Horizon  International TV to head Saban's international distribution arm.  </P> <P> Palmieri said he moved to Saban because the company "reminded me of the way MTM  was when I joined them nine years ago -- in the early stages, with a high  energy level and a lot of things going on."  </P> <P> In all, Saban produces or co-produces about 16 children's shows currently  running on network, cable TV or in syndication. Palmieri said the company has  grown fivefold since 1986 and will log "well in excess of $50 million" in  revenues in 1989, although he declined to break down those figures. Since  February, Palmieri said, Saban has funded more than $35 million in program  production, and "everything is done out of our own working capital. We are  completely debt free."  </P> <P> At the moment, one of Saban's most lucrative assets is its 1,050-title library  of prime-time and children's programming, which includes Saban's own  productions and rights it acquired to other programming by foreign and domestic  companies. The library includes series such as "Unsolved Mysteries," the  docudrama based on real-life crimes, as well as various animated children's  series, such as foreign-made versions of "Pinocchio" and "Peter Pan."  </P> <P> The company distributes the titles in foreign markets such as Britain, Germany,  France, Switzerland and Australia. Many of these countries have a strong demand  for American-made entertainment because of the deregulation of television and  the growth of satellite and cable.  </P> <P> To keep the momentum, Saban recently teamed with Edgar Scherick, a veteran film  and TV producer who was the head of programming at ABC-TV during the 1960s.  Saban/Scherick Productions, a division of Saban Entertainment, will focus on  miniseries and made-for-TV movies. Scherick was a producer of feature films  such as "Sleuth" and "The Heartbreak Kid," and, more recently, TV movies and  miniseries such as "Little Gloria . . . Happy at Last," and "The Kennedys of  Massachusetts."  </P> <P> Saban/Scherick's first efforts are the "Phantom of the Opera" miniseries, and  "The Secret Life of Ian Fleming," a movie that will appear on the TNT cable  network early this year.  </P> <P> Industry veterans say the partnership with Scherick will help give Saban  credibility when dealing with the networks. "It's a smart play," said TV  producer Leonard ("Rags to Riches") Hill. But he warned that luring Scherick  was only "a first tentative step" for Saban, and that the company will need to  establish a stable of successful producers in order to become a major  competitive force. "The only prime-time, creative, credible entity within Saban  is Edgar Scherick," Hill said.  </P> <P> Saban got into show business when he started managing bands in Israel at the  age of 22. He was a well-known music promoter by age 25. But when the 1973 Yom  Kippur War broke out, Saban lost nearly all his money.  </P> <P> Starting over in France with his partner, composer Shuki Levy, Saban soon  became a successful record producer. Saban Record's first release, by a  9-year-old Israeli boy, Noam Kaniel, went platinum with sales of 2 million  copies. Within seven years, the company had 15 gold and platinum records.  Meanwhile, Saban Records began creating sound tracks for French TV shows and  for the European versions of American shows such as "Dallas" and "Hart to  Hart."  </P> <P> In 1980, Saban decided to move to the United States, and after spending  $150,000 to build a recording studio here, he began targeting the market for TV  sound tracks. By 1983 his company had formed an association with Burbank-based  DIC Enterprises, a leading producer of animated children's programs. Saban  produced original sound tracks to DIC shows such as "Inspector Gadget." In  1985, Saban launched into program production by co-producing with DIC "Kidd  Video," a show for children that mixed animation with live action in an  MTV-like format.  </P> <P> Phyllis Tucker Vinson, vice president of children's programming for NBC,  recalled meeting Saban in the early 1980s and being impressed with his new  ideas. "We had been looking for a way to update Saturday morning music," said  Vinson. Saban "offered to do some demos for us. He came up quickly with a theme  we liked. It was more contemporary and hip, and we thought kids were listening  to hip music on radio and then tuning into TV and hearing babyish sounds."  </P> <P> Today, Saban continues to run the business end of things, while his original  partner, Levy -- who is married to actress Deborah Shelton of "Dallas" fame --  continues to write music.  </P> <P> Saban said he hopes to expand the company through acquisitions. He is also  "dabbling" with a new record label and has signed his first artist, actor and  musician Gary ("The Buddy Holly Story") Busey.  </P></p>

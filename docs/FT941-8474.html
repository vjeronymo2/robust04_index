			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: St Michael sees his future in the cards - Marks and Spencer's plan to extend the activities of its financial services arm If credit card issuers had not asked so much in fees that Marks and Spencer was not inclined to accept them in their stores, then St Michael might not be on the brink of becoming the patron saint of pensions as well as of clothes and food. Over the past 10 years, the UK's most profitable retailer has developed from issuing its own charge card, through making personal loans and unit trusts, to announcing earlier this month that next year it will enter the pensions and life assurance market. Mr Keith Oates, now joint managing director, has been at the forefront of devising M&amp;S's strategy for financial services throughout that time: he was the first employee of M&amp;S Financial Services, the growth of which is reflected in its contribution last year of Pounds 24m to the group's pre-tax profits of Pounds 712.5m. For him, a critical experience in developing the strategy came on a visit to Sears, Roebuck, the US retailing giant. Mr Oates recalls that although Sears, Roebuck had concluded - as M&amp;S was to do - that the way forward was for a retailer to have its own card and develop its own financial services, its operations did not communicate with each other. 'There was no flow between them, they couldn't see how the whole thing could be integrated,' he comments. Sears, Roebuck has since been disentangling itself from the sector: the US group took several steps last year to scale down its involvement in financial services. It was apparent early on, however, that M&amp;S Financial Services was not going to make the mistake of not communicating. What started as an operation to issue a charge card, in order to save the percentages of purchases passed on to credit card issuers, quickly became a grander design as the organisation saw the possibilities in the data it could accumulate about its customers from their use of the card. 'We looked at it two ways,' Mr Oates says. 'We could save these very large costs, and if you allowed the other cards in, you hadn't got the database, it was their database.' Commercially, Mr Oates's enthusiasm for this information is impressive: from the point of view of a personal customer, however, it is slightly chilling to imagine the dossier on purchases and spending habits being built up in M&amp;S's systems. Once the M&amp;S charge card had reached a reasonable level in the late 1980s, a move into personal loans was seen as 'the logical extension', first for larger M&amp;S purchases as the store moved into furniture, and then more generally. M&amp;S's high credit rating put it in a 'strong position' to lend to customers at competitive rates. A unit trust management company followed in 1988, but despite the heady climate of the housing market during the 1980s, M&amp;S decided against moving into mortgages and estate agency. It is a decision the company is pleased now that it took. 'We've gone as far as we want to in straight borrowing,' is Mr Oates's view. 'Mortgages would be quite unsuitable for M&amp;S, they would bloat the balance sheet. We could sell the debt, but then we would lose most of the profit.' Nor are the concerns entirely financial: he is keenly aware of the wider disadvantages of entering an area which could end in M&amp;S having to repossess property from some of its customers. But entering the life and pensions market, where complex products require long-term commitment both from the organisation and the investor, carries its own risks of disadvantage. The sector, as many practitioners will testify, is going through a period of uncertainty and change. There is a danger that a poor per-formance could have an adverse impact on the brand image of the M&amp;S retailing business. It already sounds odd, for example, despite the explanation that M&amp;S's two unit trusts were designed to give a spread of risk-averse investment for the 'building society type of customer making a first move into equities', to hear Mr Oates say of their average-ish performance that 'it was never our aim to be number one'. Even so, some of the advantages that M&amp;S will have are clear. Its financial advisers will be salaried and receive no commission or incentive to sell, in a move intended to intensify the confidence it is likely to inspire anyway as a read-across from its high street presence. In an industry where many consumers are, perhaps, increasingly inclined to distrust advice, that could be a powerful attraction. Similarly, its stated intention of focusing on better surrender values and devising innovative products, suggests that it could be well-placed to give some existing providers a run for their customers' money. The Equitable Life Assurance Society will be involved in product development and training plans, and will also provide consultancy and systems support. M&amp;S has not yet decided the critical question of who should do its fund management, nor what the objectives should be. But there is still the question of scale. The company plans to offer the new life and pensions products in about six stores from early next year, rising to only 50 by the end of 1995. Mr Oates is clearly unhappy with the description of M&amp;S Financial Services as a 'niche' player in the market. But he is not interested in competing directly with the banks. 'We are first and foremost a retailer. Our financial services arm ought to be allowed to expand as it thinks fit without disturbing the plan for the whole group,' he says. The limits of that expansion could be determined by the success of the new venture.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     BREAKDOWN OF RESULTS (POUNDS M)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      1993       1992     1991    1990     1989    1988  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-tax profit:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail              712.5     602.3    597.5    590.9    517.6   497.5 Fin Act              24.0      21.2     18.0     13.3     11.4     4.2 Total               736.5    *588.9    615.5    604.2    529.0   501.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Turnover:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail            5,840.9  *5,729.3  5,683.3  5,527.5  5,057.0  4,531.7 Fin Act             109.9      98.2     91.5     80.6     64.5     45.9 Total             5,950.8  *5,827.5  5,774.8  5,608.1  5,121.5  4,577.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Restated  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

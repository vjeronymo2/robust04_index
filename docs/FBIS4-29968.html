			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia appreciates the U.S. concern over the  formation of the East Asia Economic Caucus, EAEC, but assures  the United States that the proposed forum will not weaken or  undermine APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation). Defense  Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said it was rather  disheartening to learn that the United States had formally  informed Japan that it was opposed to the ASEAN proposal of the  EAEC.    He said it was rather surprising since the concept ideally  promotes market-driven open regionalism and supports regional  economic cooperation. He said this when opening the two-day  fifth U.S.-Malaysia colloquium jointly organized by ISIS  [Institute of Strategic and International Studies] Malaysia and  the Asia Foundation in Washington. Datuk Sri Najib, in his  opening remarks, said that he was aware of the domestic public  opinion in the U.S. and even Congressional opposition to such an  initiative, especially when it does not include the U.S.    U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs  Winston Lord, who was present at the gathering, said that the  U.S. had given its initial response on the EAEC proposal to its  ASEAN friends as well as Japan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The proceedings of the 10th session of the council  of Arab justice ministers began in Cairo last night. Over two  days the participants will study a number of drafts for unified  Arab legislation and a draft agreement on preventing and  countering the manifestations of terrorism and extremism.    Algerian Justice Minister Mohamed Teguia, who is  representing  Algeria at these proceedings, said in his address that he hoped  the round would produce results which would help to establish  the foundations of joint Arab endeavors.    The Algerian justice minister stressed that the inclusion of  a draft Arab agreement to prevent the manifestations of  terrorism was an important and timely step in response to one of  the most serious threats to have affected a number of Arab  countries since they regained their national sovereignty.    He said that terrorism was born of extremism, and that  extremism was the most dangerous plague these states had  experienced in their modern history. He explained that progress  could only be achieved if the preconditions of security were  provided in our societies and justice prevailed in them.    Mohamed Teguia ended his address by emphasizing that Algeria  was fine despite the campaigns of intimidation, and that under  the new leadership it had found the road towards the solution of  its problems by opening up national dialogue on the one hand and  consolidating security on the other.</p>

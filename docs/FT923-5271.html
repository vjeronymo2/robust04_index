			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Housing subsidence One might have thought that the market would be impervious to shocks from the housebuilders by now. But yesterday's 42 per cent fall in interim profits from Persimmon clearly caught investors on the hop. The company's own shares dived 25p to 148p on the news, while Barratt Developments (down 16 per cent to 41p) and Wimpey (down 11 per cent to 85p) were the biggest casualties elsewhere. Six months ago it would have been unthinkable for a quality regional player like Persimmon to insert a health warning about the final dividend. While there seems no need to contemplate a cut at this stage, the statement underlines the uncertainties which the housing market faces for the rest of the year. The real message contained in yesterday's numbers is the risk of chasing volume in current market conditions; Persimmon clearly geared up for a buoyant first quarter which never happened, and has only managed to sell fractionally more houses than in the first half of 1991 at the expense of higher overheads. Stocks and work in progress are up almost a fifth, reflecting a 32 per cent increase in the number of development sites. Persimmon, however, has a relatively cheap land bank and comfortable balance sheet, and managed to maintain its average selling price in the period: one can only speculate on the plight of competitors dashing for cash to keep the bankers happy, rather than growing volume as a stated objective of medium term strategy. Persimmon will hardly lose its premium rating as a result of yesterday's disappointment; the question, once again, is whether the whole sector is correctly priced.</p>

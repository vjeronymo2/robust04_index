			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): North defeated on Virginia battlefield - Democrat Robb fends off challenge from former marine colonel A lonely ray of sunshine shone in Virginia for the battered Democrats in yesterday's US congressional elections when Senator Chuck Robb held off the challenge of Mr Oliver North, the controversial former marine colonel. Mr North, loathed even by many in his own Republican party for his role in the Iran-Contra affair, was the candidate to whom the Democrats would most have hated to lose. The Virginia victory, which sees Mr Robb re-elected, was scant consolation, however. A string of losses in other states shook the Senate majority the Democrats have held for the last eight years. Although Mr North was found guilty of lying to Congress over his role in arranging the exchange of weapons for the release of US hostages held in Lebanon, while siphoning off money to arm the Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas in defiance of a law passed by Congress, his conviction was voided on a technicality. He inspires almost fanatical loyalty among his core supporters, especially those who classify themselves as belonging to the Christian right wing. But he remains a distasteful figure to many Republicans, and especially to loyalists of former President Ronald Reagan. Mrs Nancy Reagan denounced him for his role in the Iran-Contra conspiracy, and for what he said about Mr Reagan's role in it. Virginia's other senator, Mr John Warner, although a Republican, said he did not wish to serve in the Senate alongside a man who had lied to Congress. But Mr Robb himself was so widely disliked by the voters, and campaigned so weakly until the last few days, that he came close to handing the election to a man who most politicians six months ago thought to be unelectable. Once one of the Democrats' brightest stars and widely expected to be a future presidential candidate, Mr Robb has struggled to live down stories about his private life that have damaged the reputation he built up as one of Virginia's most effective governors. He may owe his winning margin to the two independent candidates who entered the race. One, former Governor Douglas Wilder, withdrew and campaigned for Mr Robb, helping him to reap around 88 per cent of the votes cast by black Virginians. Mr Marshall Coleman, an independent Republican backed by Senator Warner, fought on, drawing votes away from the main candidates. But he won fewer votes than opinion polls had projected.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PURDUE MANHANDLES NO. 25 INDIANA, 72-49  </P> <P> Indiana Coach Bob Knight watched some good defensive basketball Monday night,  but most of it was played by Purdue.  </P> <P> "We didn't play badly defensively," said Knight after the ninth-ranked  Boilermakers beat the No. 25 Hoosiers, 72-49, at West Lafayette, Ind., to  maintain sole possession of the Big Ten Conference lead.  </P> <P> "But, if we played decent defensively, they played extremely well. Their  defense dominated our offense the vast majority of the time," said Knight,  whose team shoot only 39%.  </P> <P> Said Purdue Coach Gene Keady: "It's not very often you get to play a big rival  and play that well on defense. I thought that was the best defense we've played  this year."  </P> <P> It was Purdue's biggest margin of victory over its archrival since a 120-76  victory in 1969. The outcome might have been more one-sided if the  Boilermakers, who were led by Stephen Scheffler's 18 points, had not cleared  their bench with five minutes to play.  </P> <P> Purdue (19-4, 11-2 in the conference) opened a one-game lead over Michigan  State as it swept the Hoosiers (16-7, 6-7) for the first time since 1985.  </P> <P> No. 6 Connecticut 75, Providence 72 -- The legend of Nadav Henefeld, already  sizable in Connecticut, grew again when the former Israeli soldier made a  three-point shot at the buzzer in overtime to lead the Huskies in a Big  Conference game at Storrs, Conn.  </P> <P> Henefeld, a 6-foot-7, 21-year-old freshman, had four steals and a team-leading  nine rebounds, but shot poorly most of the game, finishing with 10 points.  </P> <P> But with two seconds left on the 45-second clock, Tate George found Henefeld at  the top of the key for an open jump shot that bounced off the rim, touched the  backboard and dropped through.  </P> <P> The victory moved the Huskies (23-4, 10-3) ahead of Georgetown (9-3) for first  place in the conference. The Friars dropped to 14-9 and 7-7.  </P> <P> Wisconsin 82, Marquette 65 -- At Madison, Wis., Danny Jones scored 19 points  and the Badgers got 10 points as a result of five technical fouls called on the  Warriors in the 96th meeting of the intrastate rivals.  </P> <P> Wisconsin (13-14) opened the second half with a 17-6 run after leading, 32-29,  at halftime. Tim Locum added 17 points as Wisconsin beat Marquette (12-11) for  the fifth consecutive time.  </P> <P> Marquette Coach Kevin O'Neill was ejected after picking up his second technical  with 15 seconds left. He paused to shake hands of players and coaches on the  Wisconsin bench as he left the court.  </P> <P> Utah State 89, Fresno State 83 -- Darrel White scored a career-high 25 points  and Kendall Youngblood added 20 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Aggies in a  Big West Conference game at Logan, Utah.  </P> <P> Utah State (14-11, 8-6) jumped to a 13-8 lead with 15:16 left in the half and  never trailed. Fresno State is 9-14 and 4-10.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY CALLS OFF PLANS TO TRY HONECKER, 3 OTHERS  </P> <P> East Germany today dropped plans to try disgraced former Communist leader Erich  Honecker and three other ousted officials for high treason, saying there is no  legal basis for the charges.  </P> <P> However, the chief prosecutor's office said the ailing Honecker and two of the  officials remain under investigation on suspicion of massive corruption and  abuse of power.  </P> <P> Honecker, 77, and the three other top Communist officials were members of the  ruling hard-line Politburo toppled in last fall's peaceful revolt.  </P> <P> Prosecutors had said earlier that Honecker, former state security chief Erich  Mielke, former economics czar Guenther Mittag and ex-propaganda chief Joachim  Herrmann would be indicted and put on trial this month.  </P></p>

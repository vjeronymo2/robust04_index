			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Stalemate in French prison row THE French government yesterday offered to freeze the temporary suspension of 40 prison officers announced on Monday as a conciliatory gesture towards resolving their industrial dispute, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. However, its efforts were blocked when two of the biggest officers' unions, the UFAP and Force Ouvriere, refused to attend a morning negotiating meeting. Despite the government's efforts, staff at most of France's 182 jails stayed out on strike over their demands for improved security after the murder of two officers. There were ugly scenes as riot police tried to restore order, sometimes clashing with picketing officers as well as inmates. The French airline pilots' unions have called out their members on a 24-hour strike today in protest at proposed changes to their working arrangements. The pilots' union criticised the European Commission by claiming that it was tabling changes which would involve more flying hours and shorter rest periods.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Stock Exchange steps up insider dealing rules The Stock Exchange is pressing ahead with proposals to halt trading in individual companies' shares if there is evidence that price-sensitive information has leaked. According to senior Stock Exchange officials the new rules may be tougher than originally planned, and are likely to involve the immediate suspension of trading in a company's shares following anomalous transactions in those shares, rather than a phased path to a trading halt as originally planned. Following a two month consultation period the proposals - the aim of which is to minimise the effects of insider trading on investors' confidence in the market - are expected to be turned into formal policies in the coming few weeks. Under the original proposal, the process of halting trading in a company's shares would have been staggered in two phases. The first phase, known as making a security 'indicative', would have involved a temporary removal of the obligation on market makers to deal at prices quoted on the Seaq electronic trading screens. When the shares had been given this indicative status the exchange would have contacted the relevant company and asked it to put out a statement - if it was in takeover talks or was in possession of other forms of undisclosed price sensitive information. Pending the publication of such a statement the exchange would have called a complete halt to trading in the shares. Participants in the stock market have told the exchange that they are concerned that the volatility of trading would be increased sharply during the period when the shares were indicative, leading to a heightened risk that unwary investors would deal at a price that they would later deem to be too high or too low, depending on the contents of any corporate announcement. As a result the exchange is likely to call a halt to trading in a company's shares the moment that the Integrated Monitoring and Surveillance System (IMAS) detects an unusually strong surge in trading volumes, or movement in the share price, without making the shares indicative first. On Tuesday, however, the exchange ran a partial pilot test of the original proposals. It made shares in the banknote paper-maker Portals indicative at 12.41pm, 50 minutes after IMAS detected a strong surge in dealing volumes. At 12.10pm, the exchange asked Portals' stockbroker, Warburg Securities, whether the company was involved in any transaction which could explain the share surge. If so, it wanted Portals to put out a statement. At just after 1.00pm Portals put out a statement that it was in talks with De La Rue, the banknote printer, about increasing commercial links between the two companies.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: EU's electronic mountain - Negotiations on the best fate for discarded equipment in Europe are growing more urgent Europe's electronics and electrical industries are about to meet environmentalists and European Commission officials to renew efforts to find a solution to the growing mountain of end-of-life products that the two industries produce. Electronic waste comprises everything from old computers, photocopiers and stereos to telephones, cables and light bulbs. The range of products and diversity of interests - more than 60 representatives will meet in Rome - have hampered negotiations, and the group's aim to deliver a document detailing practical solutions and regulatory proposals by next July looks increasingly ambitious. For Brussels, this latest meeting of the Rome project group on 'electronic waste', one of the 'priority waste streams' identified by the Commission as requiring specific action, has a particular urgency if it is to head off unilateral action by EU member states frustrated by the lack of progress so far. German manufacturers fear that the German ministry of environment may not wait and will push through laws next year that would compel them to take back a broad range of electronic waste and meet specific recycling targets. Manufacturers could charge to recycle equipment already on the market, but would have to take back their future products free of charge. 'The model proposed by the ministry entails huge problems,' says Bernhard Diegner, project group representative for ZVEI, a German electronics manufacturers association, which claims that such a policy could add between 5 per cent and 15 per cent to the price of electronics goods sold in Germany. The annual cost of a Europe-wide end-of-life scheme for consumer electronics could be around Ecu2.25bn (Pounds 1.77bn), according to the European Association of Consumer Electronics Manufacturers. ZVEI wants take-back schemes to be generally voluntary, with manufacturers obliged to take back only bulky own-brand products. Environmentalists counter that voluntary schemes do not work and cite battery recycling programmes, where collection rates remain low - between 15 and 40 per cent - even when collection is free. A take-back bill for electrical and electronics goods was presented in the last Italian parliament in 1993 and could soon be presented again. Denmark, France and Austria are among the European countries currently considering specific legislation for electronic waste. Manufacturers now fear a patchwork of conflicting, national schemes that will add substantially to their costs and distort competition by sucking in cheaper imports from EU or non-EU countries with less stringent rules. Their worst nightmare is a repeat of Germany's Duales System Deutschland compulsory packaging recycling scheme, which produced more used paper and plastic than German recyclers could handle. The manufacturers say that electronic waste in quantitative terms is less of a problem than in other sectors, In France, for example, it amounts to 1.3m tonnes each year, against 20m tonnes of household rubbish and 150m tonnes of commercial and industrial waste. However, much electronic waste is difficult to recycle, the quantity is growing - new products now entering the market in France amount to 2.1m tonnes a year, for instance - and environmental credentials have become important selling points for manufacturers. 'The market is very conscious of the ecological image and contents of products,' says Bruno Mapelli, environmental director for IBM's southern European operations. According to a recent survey by the German environmental organisation Bund (Bund fur Umwelt and Naturschutz Deutschland), most PC manufacturers now use recycled plastics, have banned CFCs and solvent-based paints, use snap-together construction (for easier dismantling), mark new plastic parts for recycling and reuse old components for repairs. Four have free take-back schemes operational in Germany: Vobis, Apple, Actebis and Acer. While manufacturers stress how environmentally-friendly current models are, they are less enthusiastic about taking back products now reaching the ends of their lives, since they were never designed to be recycled. To disassemble an old computer can take one and three-quarter hours, says Helmut Finchk, head of Hewlett-Packard's three-year-old recycling programme in Germany. To cover its costs, HP Germany charges DM10 (Pounds 4) for each returned unit; for monitors, where the lead and other metals in the cathode ray tube causes particular recycling problems, the charge is DM25. The products must be predominantly HP ones and the customer pays for transport. HP's European subsidiaries currently send unwanted equipment to a specialist recycling centre, Hardware Recycling Europe, in Grenoble, France. Less than 5 per cent of the 100 tonnes that arrive each month goes for land-fill; four years ago, the figure was more than 30 per cent, but HP can now separate and recycle nearly all materials. Disc drives are reused as spares, circuit boards are refined to recover precious metals, plastic is stripped from copper cables, old microprocessors and memory chips end up in electronic toys, high-grade plastics are recycled, low-grade mixed plastics are burnt in a nearby cement kiln for their energy content. The recovered copper, precious metals and components are sold to help pay for the costly treatments of batteries, cathode ray tubes and mixed plastic. 'Today we break even, but it all depends on the volumes handled and we still do not know whether a large-scale scheme would be economically viable,' says Denise Furet, environmental project manager for Hardware Recycling Europe. The costs of transporting end-of-life products to Grenoble from other countries have prompted HP to set up similar recycling plants in the UK and, soon, Germany, but ultimately the company would like to contract out recycling, as it is not seen as a core activity. Several manufacturers in Europe are acting in advance of take-back laws. At the beginning of this year, for example, Deutsche Telekom formed a consortium with equipment manufacturers Siemens and Alcatel SEL to recycle a planned 12,000 tonnes of telephones, facsimile machines and other equipment this year. In Italy, IBM sent 4,500 tonnes of end-of-life equipment for recycling in 1993, with a recycling ratio of more than 90 per cent. Digital Equipment operates a similar scheme in the Netherlands. However, left to market forces, it seems unlikely that electronic waste recycling can be extended throughout Europe. Specialist recyclers are rare in many countries and spot prices for recycled materials are volatile. White goods and consumer electronics contain little valuable material. For other products, the time and effort required to dismantle, separate and identify the different materials can make recycling uneconomic. DST Logistica, the recycling subsidiary for IBM in Italy, has tested specialised X-ray and infra-red equipment to sort recovered plastics into more than 30 recyclable classes, but not all recyclers can justify such investments. Ferruccio Mori, chairman of DST Logistica, identifies a more general problem: 'It costs L50-L60 (a few pence) a kilo to dump in Italy. If land-fill were to rise to L1,000 a kilo the economics (of recycling) would change,' he says. Maria Almeida-Teixeira, the Commission's co-ordinator for the electronic waste group, set up nearly a year ago, admits that progress has been slow, but believes that with two further meetings next year there is still time to achieve a broad consensus. However, 'it is too early to say what will come out.'  --------------------------------------------------            RECYCLING COMPUTER EQUIPMENT  --------------------------------------------------            Material breakdown by weight  -------------------------------------------------- Metal casings                         58.0 percent Cathode ray tubes                      4.2 percent Cables                                 2.0 percent Recoverable components                 1.7 percent Precious metals                        3.2 percent Resale                                 3.2 percent Internal reuse                         2.2 percent Batteries                              0.7 percent Plastic casings                       24.8 percent  -------------------------------------------------- Source: Hewlett-Packard  --------------------------------------------------</p>

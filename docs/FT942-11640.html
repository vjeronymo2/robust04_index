			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Australia plans ADollars 6.5bn jobs package The Australian government yesterday proposed spending ADollars 6.5bn over the next four years in an effort to address the nation's chronic unemployment problem and reach an unemployment rate of about 5 per cent by the end of the decade. Among the extensive measures, set out in a White Paper on Employment and Growth and presented to parliament by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, is a ADollars 4.6bn 'job compact' for the long-term unemployed. This will offer either subsidised employment, primarily in the private sector, or work experience and training to all long-term unemployed people of 18-plus. However, if they do not participate, they will risk losing unemployment benefit. Under the scheme, employers will be offered subsidies, ranging from ADollars 100 to ADollars 230 a week, for periods of 13 to 26 weeks, to encourage them to take on unemployed people. There will be a bonus of ADollars 500 for employers who continue to employ the person for 12 months - that is, after the subsidies have stopped. In addition, as part of the 'job compact', ADollars 1.46bn will be spent on creating 'new work opportunities', primarily in remote areas. The white paper also envisages a 'youth training initiative', giving 15-17 year-olds work experience or training while paying them a youth training allowance; a restructuring of the much-criticised Commonwealth Employment Service, opening case management of the unemployed to competition from the private sector; and some significant reforms of the social security system to encourage unemployed people to take part-time work. At present, many people - especially women - complain that there is a disincentive to do this, because they lose more in benefits than they gain in income. Unemployment has become a serious bugbear for Mr Keating's Labor government. While the economy has been performing very well in recent months - with last year's growth rate reaching 4 per cent - unemployment remains stuck at more than 10 per cent. Some 350,000 people are reckoned to be 'long-term' unemployed - that is, without a job for more than a year. Several studies have suggested that even if growth rates remain at about 3.5 per cent for the rest of the decade unemployment would only fall to about 7 per cent by 2000, with around 200,000 long-term unemployed. For a government which is closely tied to the union movement, yet bent on encouraging the industrial sector to become internationally competitive and more efficient, these stubborn numbers have become a serious embarrassment. Mr Keating said yesterday the white paper represented a 'statement about the two imperatives of a decent society - compassion and strength'. The possibility that high levels of unemployment could persist despite strong growth if the government did not intervene was, he said, 'not only profoundly unfair, it is profoundly inefficient'. The package brought mixed reactions. The coalition opposition attacked it as a 'Labor spending spree', that would add pressure to interest rates. 'It is clear that the burden of taxation is going to rise,' commented Mr Alexander Downer, the shadow treasurer. The stockmarket also weakened, with dealers saying that budget worries were beginning to loom. The government's finance package for 1994/5 is due next week, and there is now considerable interest in how the government will finance the jobs measures - somewhat costlier than expected - and still meet its deficit reduction targets.</p>

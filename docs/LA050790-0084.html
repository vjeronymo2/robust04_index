			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> VICTORY MOVES TITANS BACK IN FIRST  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton went to its usual power source for one home run and to an  unexpected source for two more Sunday in a 15-4 victory over UC Santa Barbara  that moved the Titans back into first place in the Big West Conference.  </P> <P> Phil Nevin had a team-leading 14th home run among his three hits and six RBIs  for Fullerton (29-20, 11-4 in conference), which regained a half-game lead over  Fresno State. Cal State Long Beach defeated Fresno, 9-7, Sunday.  </P> <P> Matt Hattabaugh added two home runs and four runs batted in for Fullerton,  which took two of the three games in the weekend series. For Hattabaugh, they  were only his second and third home runs of the season.  </P> <P> "I was just trying to make contact," he said. "I haven't been hitting that good  this year, but now I'm starting to hit like I can."  </P> <P> Hattabaugh, a junior catcher from Cerritos College, hit a solo home run to lead  off the second inning and give Fullerton a 3-1 lead. Nevin added a two-run  homer in the same inning and the Titans led, 5-1.  </P> <P> Fullerton continued to build its lead with a run in the third, two in the  fourth, three in the seventh and four in the eighth. Hattabaugh had a two-run  home run and Nevin a two-run triple in the eighth.  </P> <P> Frank Charles had two hits and two RBIs, and Dave Ayala and Steve Sisco each  had two hits for Fullerton.  </P> <P> The Titans' offense made things a little easier for pitchers Sam Colarusso and  Chris Robinson, who tried to make things difficult.  </P> <P> Colarusso (6-3) allowed eight hits and five walks but only two runs as Santa  Barbara left nine runners on base in his seven innings.  </P> <P> He walked three in the first but was helped when Hattabaugh threw out Jerrold  Rountree trying to steal. Rountree, who is 51 of 71 on stolen-base attempts  this season, was one for three in the series.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara scored in the second and had the bases loaded when Colarusso got  a double play to end the inning.  </P> <P> Colarusso retired Santa Barbara in order only once, in the sixth. He allowed  two hits and a run in the seventh.  </P> <P> Chris Robinson allowed two runs on four hits and two walks in the final two  innings.  </P> <P> In another Big West Conference game:  </P> <P> UC Irvine 8, San Jose State 4 -- Mike Goodcase and Fred Combs each had two hits  and two RBIs, Billy Bardens had two hits and an RBI, and Al Rodriguez had two  hits for host Irvine (31-24, 7-11).  </P> <P> Chris Huber (7-2) pitched 6 1/3 innings for the victory, and Joe Sewell worked  the final 2 2/3 innings for his third save. David Tellers, a former Western  High School and Rancho Santiago standout, allowed six runs and eight hits in  five innings to take the loss. He is 11-4 for San Jose State (41-15, 8-10).  </P> <P> In nonconference tennis:  </P> <P> UCLA 6, UC Irvine 3 -- UC Irvine's Trevor Kronemann, the Big West Conference  singles champion, defeated Pacific 10 singles champion Jason Netter, 6-4, 6-1.  UCLA (25-3) won three singles and all three doubles matches. Irvine is 18-12.  </P></p>

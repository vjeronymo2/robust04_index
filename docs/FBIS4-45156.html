			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Juridical Sciences Vladimir Trofimov </F> under "Arms" rubric: "Chemical Weapons--The Past Without a  Future?: The International Concept Is Not Yet Capable of  Answering This Question"]    [Text] At the initiative of the Committee for International  Affairs, hearings were held in the State Duma on the problem of  the possible participation of Russia in international agreements  on the disposal of chemical weapons. They were certainly  particularly remarkable in that they put into question several  quite prevalent stereotypes in our society with respect to the  elimination of chemical weapons.    Thus, it can frequently be heard that the adoption in 1993  of  the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,  Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons [CWC] and  on their disposal may be viewed as a rather major victory of  Russian diplomacy. As you know, this convention was personally  signed by Andrey Kozyrev in January 1993 but has not yet been  ratified by Russia.    The appearances of experts involuntarily gave rise to the  idea that by definition complete and comprehensive chemical  disarmament, although desirable, is simply an unattainable  dream. Indeed, any work in the field of chemistry may lead to  the development of highly toxic substances and there is no way  to prohibit this in advance. In principle, the production of  toxic chemical agents is similar to the manufacture of many  quite peaceful chemicals. This means that there will always be a  production base that can be reoriented to military needs. By  mixing some completely harmless substances whose production also  cannot be prohibited, a powerful toxic agent arises. This  principle, as you know, is the basis of binary weapons.    All of this was reflected in the convention of 1993--it does  not directly prohibit binary weapons and removes the laboratory  production of toxic agents from international control. In other  words, despite its name, the convention does not include a  comprehensive prohibition of the production of toxic agents. Of  course this defect in the convention stems from the very nature  of chemical weapons.    But this agreement also has other special features that are  more difficult to explain through objective reasons. Under the  convention, for example, the inspection trips of other countries  are paid for by the state in whose territory the corresponding  inspections are carried out. Considering that Russia has the  largest stocks of chemical weapons in the world, it is not  difficult to assume that we may simply be subjected to an  invasion of inspectors. And is all of this supposed to be at our  own expense?    The convention will go into effect when it has been ratified  by 65 states. Why not 90 and why not 130? After all, the  elimination of chemical weapons would make sense if most of the  countries of the world were participating in the convention,  primarily those 25 that according to American assessments  already have these weapons or are potentially capable of  producing them. But, as you know, a quarter of these 25  countries did not even sign the convention and no one knows how  many will ratify it. Some Arab states are waivering, referring  to the fact that Israel does not want to take part in the  Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation Treaty. Italy has some doubts.  It is worth noting that many of these 25 countries are located  along the borders of Russia.    So how many states really intend to participate in the  treaty? Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of  the Russian Federation are proposing: "Let Russia be among the  first to ratify the convention and then its example will induce  other countries to join it." But are such calculations justified?    The convention provides that its participants must introduce  sanctions against states not participating in it by restricting  their trade in various chemical materials. It is thereby  supposed that by establishing a kind of chemical COCOM they can  be induced to join the convention. This means that Russia  together with the United States will introduce sanctions against  some of their neighbors. And if Russia refuses to participate in  the convention, then it cannot be ruled out that it itself will  fall victim to such sanctions. Was it worth it to agree to  include in the convention such double-edged conditions for  Russia?    A new international organization is being established to  verify the execution of the convention. Russia will duly pay  about 6 percent of its considerable budget but the convention  does not give any guarantees that the possessor of the largest  potential of toxic agents will be included in its governing  bodies. Why were our diplomats unable to achieve this?    The convention provides that all participants must eliminate  their toxic agents within 10 years after it goes into effect. In  the event that a threat to national interests can be proven,  which itself is not a simple matter, this period can be extended  by another 5 years. Hearings have shown that the United States  will meet this deadline but if Russia is able to do so it will  only be through a drastic increase in material expenditures. As  a result of such haste, moreover, there will be a great increase  in the risk of accidents with the most severe consequences,  because the corresponding technologies are still far from being  well developed. Why were deadlines accepted that are  problematical for us but correspond with the planned time for  the disposal of American toxic agents?    Repesentatives of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs  assert that if Russia refuses to participate in the convention,  then no one will. But if Russia's role in this question is so  great, why are they trying to convince us that all of the  shortcomings enumerated above are the result of a compromise  without which there would be no convention? Does this mean that  in the course of the negotiations Russia was able to make  conditions that other participants in the talks would have to  consider? In general, all things considered, this is how it was  until the end of the 1990's [as published]. In any event, until  this time the Americans thought that there would be no  convention and were particularly active in carrying out a  program for the creation of binary weapons. And was it here that  Russia changed its position?    In general, there were many such "whys" in the hearings. It  was also possible to find out one quite incredible thing. It  turns out that neither at the moment of our signing the  convention nor to this date has Russia had a confirmed national  program for the disposal of its own stocks of toxic agents. This  means that disposal technologies have not been selected, the  sites for such disposal have not been determined, deadlines are  unclear, and there is no coordination with the regions. It is  also worth mentioning that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of  the Russian Federation solicited consent "at the top" for the  signing of the convention, not considering the substantial  reservations of very important ministries.    Under these conditions, how can we take on international  obligations? And in principle are we capable of meeting them?  Judging by the opinion of specialists, this is more than  problematical.    Is it possible that all of the plans are already prepared  and  that they must merely be confirmed? Nothing of the sort. There  is not even a single plan in the state program (or concept) but  two, although they are similar to each other. It is still  necessary to reach agreement with the regions and as a result  conditions may be made (most likely fair conditions) that make  it necessary to choose only particular technologies and to carry  out a series of complex studies, which in principle may change  the entire approach to the problem. All of this will take time.  The necessary legislation is lacking. The main thing is that  there is no funding and a great deal of it is required.    It is interesting to compare the position of Russia with the  approach of the United States to this convention. There they  adopted the corresponding national program many years ago, when  it became clear that the kinds of toxic agents that the  Americans had were obsolete and the time of their guaranteed  storage was passing. They appropriated money and determined the  technologies and disposal sites. At the same time, the United  States also initiated the elaboration of the mentioned  convention. Its objectives were defined quite openly and clearly  in the U.S. Congress: Since we are disposing of our chemical  weapons, it is necessary to induce the USSR and other countries  to do the same (the U.S. Embassy was kind enough to provide the  corresponding materials on this to the Duma). As they say,  commentary is superfluous here.    What is it all about and where did such a strange policy of  Russia come from? Why were our diplomats so conciliatory in the  negotiations? Was it only because world public opinion condemns  chemical weapons? The hearings, of course, did not provide an  answer to this question. Nevertheless, one can try to offer the  following partial explanation. The fact is that participation in  the convention is the basis for demands for the necessary  financing from the government and Federal Assembly and it is  also a unique weapon to break down the resistance of the  regions. The convention will induce acceptance of the state  program without any particular objections, it may eliminate the  need to perform an overly detailed national ecological study,  and will facilitate the adoption of the necessary laws.    It is probable that the supporters of Russian participation  in the convention truly calculated everything correctly. The  existence of international obligations will doubtless be a major  stimulus. Moreover the convention may become a means for the  receipt of endless above-plan financing. Indeed, the United  States, with stocks of 30 million tonnes of toxic agents  [corrected to 30,000 tonnes in 10 June NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA],  initially planned to spend about $2 billion for their disposal.  Subsequently this figure increased to $5 billion and it is now  almost $10 billion. And if the technology of incineration is  rejected, then expenditures will amount to $15 billion. We have  40 million tonnes [corrected to 40,000 tonnes in 10 June  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] of toxic agents. For their disposal, they  are also asking for a little over $2 billion. Is this figure  realistic? It is hard to say. The largest share of the  expenditures will go to construction and a significant share  will be for operation of the facilities. The prices in Russia  for construction, complex equipment, and the payment of  qualified specialists are now approaching world prices and in  some cases they have already exceeded them. This means that our  expenditures for the disposal of toxic agents will also be close  to those of the Americans and may also rise to $15 billion.    It seems that a similar situation developed with respect to  the START-1 treaty. As far as the author knows, the money  allocated for its realization has already been spent and the  treaty is far from being completed. But the corresponding  departments are not concerned, knowing that as much as they ask  for will be given for the treaty. Of course this is only a  conjecture but it may be that it is precisely for this reason  that all of our draft concepts and programs for the disposal of  chemical weapons are oriented to the 1993 convention rather than  the question of ratification being oriented to the existence of  money and the technical means and to public opinion.    What should be done now? The Committee for International  Affairs first of all recommended that in the resolution of  questions involving the disposal of toxic agents one should  proceed not so much from the requirements of the 1993 convention  as from our real and physical possiblities and also that  consideration be given to precisely Russian public opinion,  especially in the regions. This certainly suggests that because  of the lack of adequate financial and physical resources Russia  will take the course of disposing of its toxic substances at a  slower pace than was foreseen by the 1993 convention, especially  since no substantial foreign assistance is expected. Of course  to do so it will be necessary to overcome a certain amount of  pressure from countries of the West.    It is also important to consider the fact that the risk of  ecological disasters, which judging by everything cannot be  ruled out anyway (there are simply no absolutely safe  technologies at this time, even in the West) will increase  enormously because of the utilization of undeveloped methods in  the hasty disposal of chemical weapons. By the way, this  circumstance caused some deputies to doubt: Are there not some  people in the West who, in "giving" us their technologies, are  actually getting an opportunity to work them out on the Russians?    Only a small part of the Russian toxic agents need to be  destroyed rather quickly--about 6,000 tonnes of quite old  munitions--and this requires the allocation of funds in any  case. The remaining stocks of toxic agents can be stored for a  long time yet, spending only about $5 million a year for this.    Independent experts stated at the hearings that careful  checks of many cases showed that the "chemical diseases" of  local inhabitants are actually the result of the action of  sometimes unnoticeable but absolutely uncontrolled civilian  production rather than leaks from military facilities. In the  course of a year in the country as a whole, the military  registers just one or two cases of acute contamination and this,  as a rule, does not happen at facilities for the storage of  toxic agents.    Another matter is the declassification of the sites where  toxic agents were disposed of during all the years of Soviet  authority. Here it is indeed probable that people are living in  dangerous places without even suspecting this. The participants  in the hearings gave a direct recommendation to carry out such  declassification. One should also consider the fact that the  quantity of toxic agents destroyed in the USSR is not so great  in relative terms. The well-known Vil Mirzayanov speaks of  400,000 tonnes but it appears that he has exaggerated this  figure by a factor of four, although he probably did not intend  to do so. Apparently this data should also be declassified to  avoid inflaming passions.    By the way, the position of Mirzayanov in the hearings is  worthy of mention in more detail. He understands very well the  shortcomings of the convention, which were addressed above, and  states frankly that it "does not correspond to the national  interests of the Russian Federation" (I quote from the verbatim  account--V.T.), because it does not prohibit the West from  continuing the development of the latest types of toxic agents.    It is useful also to pay atention to the military aspect of  the possession of chemical weapons. Of course they are inhumane  and will effect primarily the civilian population. At the same  time, however, they are a significant deterrent factor,  especially in their latest modifications, and it is also by no  means wise to ignore this circumstance. It is clear that less  than a dozen saboteurs armed with the latest binary toxic agent  are capable of delivering such a retaliatory strike against any  state (against military facilities, of course) and that this  will certainly take away even the desire to think about carrying  out "peacemaking" actions such as those in Somalia on the  territory of Russia. Under conditions of the total collapse of  our army, the disappearance of a unified air defense system for  the country, and the unconsidered elimination of nuclear  weapons, one probably ought to think once again whether or not  it is right to renounce such an effective and relatively  inexpensive weapon, especially unilaterally.    By the way, it is also worth mentioning that there are  chemical compounds that do not kill people but are capable of  paralyzing them temporarily. There are substances that disable  engines and destroy tires. In connection with the events in the  Balkans, the United States issued the public reminder that it  has such possibilities. It is also well known that although the  United States is demanding that we destroy all of our military  production, they themselves do not want to do this. There are  several reasons for this. The American production systems are  more "flexible" and can easily be reorganized for the execution  of peaceful tasks. By the way, the reverse transformation is not  complicated. It will doubtless be interesting to the readers to  learn that if necessary the United States is capable of  beginning the industrial production of combat toxic agents,  including binary, within two (two!) months, performing several  necessary stages in their outfitting. This would also be useful  information to the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs of the Russian Federation, who at the hearings fiercely  sought to convince those present that the 1993 convention  prohibits binary toxic agents precisely because their industrial  production can be begun only after a number of intermediate  experimental stages, which are not permitted by the convention.    According to a notice from the U.S. Embassy sent to the Duma  in connection with the hearings, the United States is ceasing  only those activities that are prohibited by the convention of  1993. And which ones are not prohibited? The Americans also  reported that a number of countries are continuing to produce  not only chemical weapons but are even working on  bacteriological weapons. It seems that it is worthwhile to give  thought to this information. After all, we are being told that  it is a matter of the prohibition of weapons that have become  outdated. Are they really outdated?    In conclusion, it is also interesting to note that not a  single one of the many agreements in the area of chemical  disarmament that Russia has signed recently with other countries  provides for a ratification procedure. And in one of them, for  example, the Russian side directly promised to become a  participant in the convention of 1993. So are they trying to  present the Duma with a fait accompli and deprive it of the  opportunity to choose? This is not ruled out, for it is not  permitted to make stipulations in the treaty.    For the time being, the deputies of the Duma are  recommending  to the president and government at least to maintain the  personnel and scientific base involved with chemical weapons,  without which within several years it will not be possible to  dispose of toxic agents safely with any technologies. And it is  precisely then that something irreparable may happen.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BLUE JAY NEWCOMER GOZZO DOWNS ORIOLES FOR THIRD STRAIGHT WIN, 9-2  </P> <P> Since 1984, the Toronto Blue Jays have been the team to beat in the American  League East. Each time they have been beaten.  </P> <P> This season, a 6-foot-3 rookie right-hander may be just the person to enable  the Blue Jays to win a division title, at last.  </P> <P> Mauro Gozzo, 23, hampered by tendinitis in his right shoulder for two years,  won his third game in a row Friday night when the Blue Jays beat the Orioles,  9-2, at Baltimore.  </P> <P> In his third major league start, Gozzo gave up eight hits and both Oriole runs  in seven innings. He has pitched 20 innings for the Blue Jays and has given up  only three earned runs.  </P> <P> George Bell and two more Toronto newcomers, Lee Mazzilli and Mookie Wilson, hit  home runs off 29-year-old Baltimore rookie Dave Johnson (2-2). The loss cut the  Orioles' lead to a half-game over Milwaukee and 1 1/2 over the Blue Jays.  </P> <P> Gozzo, whose father is an immigrant from Sicily, was a prep star in Berlin,  Conn. He turned down college football scholarships to sign, as a 13th-round  draft pick, with the New York Mets in 1984. Three years later, the Mets traded  catcher Ed Hearn and Gozzo to Kansas City for David Cone, probably the Mets'  best pitcher.  </P> <P> With Gozzo's tendinitis problem, the Royals didn't protect him in the  off-season, and the Blue Jays snapped him up.  </P> <P> Gozzo realized his potential in a hurry this season. He began at Knoxville,  Tenn., in Double-A and posted a 7-0 record. He was moved up to Syracuse, N.Y.,  in Triple-A. When he was 5-1 there, the Blue Jays beckoned.  </P> <P> Wilson's home run was his first of the season, and Mazzilli's was his third.  Both players came to Toronto from the New York Mets.  </P> <P> "There are certainly enough of us new guys," Gozzo said. "I'm just glad to  finally get a chance to contribute. Maz has helped a lot, and Mookie has been a  spark. Remember, we had some good players to begin with."  </P> <P> Bell, mired in a slump most of the season, hit his 13th home run, a double and  two singles, and drove in three runs.  </P> <P> Detroit 7, New York 3 -- New Yankee Manager Bucky Dent may be wondering what he  let himself in for.  </P> <P> In his debut, the Yankees were in Detroit to face the weakest team in the  American League.  </P> <P> The Tigers had six runs and four home runs in four innings and breezed to  victory behind Jeff Robinson (3-2).  </P> <P> After just five Tigers had batted, Dent's team was down, 3-0.  </P> <P> Chet Lemon and Kenny Williams hit two-run homers off Chuck Cary, while Gary  Ward and Rick Shu hit solo shots. Dave Bergman connected off Eric Plunk in the  sixth, giving the Tigers five in the game.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 5, Boston 2 -- Billy Spiers' two-run single capped a four-run first  inning at Milwaukee that enabled the streaking Brewers to win their eighth in a  row and close within a half-game of the East-leading Orioles.  </P> <P> B. J. Surhoff was 3 for 3 as the Brewers handed the fading Red Sox their sixth  loss in a row.  </P> <P> Although he gave up 10 hits in five innings, Tom Filer improved to 4-1. Bill  Krueger, released by the Dodgers in spring training, pitched four perfect  innings of relief, striking out six.  </P> <P> Kansas City 3, Seattle 1 -- Before anyone gives the title in the West to either  the Angels or Oakland, watch out for the Royals.  </P> <P> And before the rookie award is handed out, watch out for Tom Gordon.  </P> <P> Gordon is just about the hottest pitcher in the majors. The converted reliever  held the Mariners to two hits in eight innings and struck out 10 at Seattle,  improving his record to 15-4. He has won four starts in a row.  </P> <P> Jim Eisenreich and Frank White hit home runs as the Royals moved within 4 1/2  games of first place.  </P> <P> For the first time since their 1985 championship season, the Royals are 15  games above .500.  </P> <P> Minnesota 4, Oakland 3 -- The Twins spoiled Dave Stewart's bid for his 17th  victory early at Oakland.  </P> <P> Gary Gaetti hit a two-run home run in a four-run first inning that gave Roy  Smith (9-4) all the cushion he needed. Stewart, put in an early hole by  shortstop Walt Weiss' error on leadoff batter Wally Backman, settled down  thereafter but fell to 17-8.  </P> <P> Jeff Reardon pitched the ninth, giving up the final Oakland run, to earn his  23rd save.  </P> <P> Smith, who yielded two runs (only one earned) in eight innings, won his fifth  game in a row and gave the Twins a 5-2 record against Oakland.  </P> <P> Texas 6, Chicago 5 -- Steve Buechele and Ruben Sierra emerged from deep slumps  at Chicago to lead the Rangers.  </P> <P> Buechele was 7 for 48 when he hit a three-run home run in the sixth inning.  Five of his last 12 hits have been homers.  </P> <P> Sierra was 7 for 59 going into the game and had two singles. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

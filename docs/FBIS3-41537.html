Gu Yongbo, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau  of Environment Protection, said that now Shanghai has about 400  enterprises and institutions engaged in the research,  development, design and production of environment protection  facilities with more than 7,000 senior engineers and professors.    The scientific development and production of the equipment  involve nearly all spheres that can be subjected to pollution  control.    By the end of 1992, Shanghai had developed more than 300  products for pollution control and the total output value of the  products was about 500 million yuan.    Some of the products were exported to developed countries  include Japan and the United States.    Meanwhile, to provide technological data for the government  to enhance pollution control and promote the development of the  environment protection industry, the Shanghai Society of  Environment Sciences has fulfilled a number of scientific  consultancy programs such as ``the water diverting project on  the upper reaches of the Huangpu river,'' ``plan for  comprehensive control of air pollution in Shanghai,'' and  ``forecast on Shanghai's environment in the year 2000.''</p>

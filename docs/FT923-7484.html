			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Banking on a market for loans: The spread to Britain of the growing US trade in the debt of companies in financial difficulties Few companies can be certain who holds their bonds or shares. Trade in these securities is so frequent that companies have difficulties keeping track of their owners. But a company could traditionally be certain of the identity of one source of its funds - its banks. If a bank or banking syndicate provided a loan, these banks would hold the loan to maturity - that was axiomatic. But not any more, as UK-based advertising group WPP recently found. WPP has been attempting to reach agreement with its shareholders and lenders on a refinancing plan to tide it over the recession in the advertising industry. Agreement was finally reached on August 6. However, in the preceding weeks, Mr Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive, found that one of his biggest bank lenders, Bank of New York, had sold its Dollars 80m (Pounds 41.8m) share of a WPP loan to 12 financial institutions  -at a price of 65 cents in the dollar. Within days, one of the 12 buyers passed on the loan at a price of 68 cents for a quick profit. The bank loan appeared to be trading like a securitised financial asset. Three other banks, including the Austrian bank Credit Anstalt, also sold their participation in the WPP loan. In all, around Dollars 160m was traded, or 15 per cent of WPP's gross debt. WPP is one of a handful of UK-based companies whose loans have been traded in this way. Others are Brent Walker, the financially stretched leisure group, Polly Peck, the collapsed international trading company, and the late Mr Robert Maxwell's companies. However, in the US a substantial market in 'value impaired' corporate loans  -or loans to companies in financial difficulties - has developed. Brokers estimate that such loans with a face value of between Dollars 100m and Dollars 200m are traded every week. The market in the US has developed over the past two years, as the 1980s boom in bank financing of takeovers and buy-outs has been followed by a glut of companies facing difficulties in servicing their debt. The development of the market has been a natural successor to the market in loans to less-developed countries, which is now well-established. Like any market, this one depends on a diversity of views about the value of the assets. If a bank has made a loan to a company which subsequently gets into difficulties, the bank is forced by regulators to make a provision to cover possible losses on the loan. However, another financial institution - usually a specially created fund rather than a bank - may take the view that the underlying value of the loan is more than that implied by the provision. So this institution may bid more for the loan than the value attributed to it in the bank's accounts. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, is one of a handful of brokers - others are Bear Stearns, Oppenheimer, Jefferies and BDS Securities - which dominate the US market. A parallel market is developing in the UK and Goldman has one executive in London working on such deals. But there have been obstacles to a similar corporate loan market in the UK. Bankers say that widespread doubts about the reliability of UK company accounts hinder trade since potential buyers of UK loans cannot easily evaluate the risk attached to the loan. The big UK clearing banks are also nervous about appearing to give a higher priority to the management of their balance sheets than to maintaining long-standing relationships with clients. 'The thought of doing such a deal has crossed my mind,' said Mr Roger Byatt, a senior executive of National Westminster Bank. 'But it would be contrary to what we are seeking to do here (build relationships).' However, Mr Richard Carden, of Barclays, said: 'It would not surprise me if a market developed.' The Bank of England said it had no strong objection to trading in the loans. An attempt to create a UK market is being made by a specialist broker, set up last year, called Klesch &amp; Co. It is owned by Mr Gary Klesch, the financier embroiled in a long lawsuit against British &amp; Commonwealth. Klesch &amp; Co broadcasts the price of more than 60 corporate loans via Telerate, the electronic financial information service. Many of these companies are not in receivership and the stock market attributes a value to their shares - which is curious, because if their bank loans are genuinely worth less than 100p in the pound, equity in these companies should be valueless. As a result, some companies are unhappy at suggestions that their bank debt has traded at less than par. One is Eurotunnel, builder of the Channel tunnel, which recently said it had no knowledge of any substantial trades in its debt at a discount. Mr Klesch, whose firm has been quoting a price of 75p in the pound for Eurotunnel, says Eurotunnel would not necessarily be aware of the trading and insists his firm has done 'Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m' of Eurotunnel loan sales. Selling a loan is not simple. Complex contracts need to be drawn up and there is a gap of at least a month between agreement on a deal and its completion. During that time, the buyer or the seller may back out. This lack of 'immediacy' is reflected in a wide spread between the buying and selling price, the 'turn' which goes to the broker. A broker will make at least 1 per cent on the deal and possibly up to 4 per cent - so gross profits on deals can run to millions of pounds. There is a separate complication to such sales of corporate loans. WPP's original borrowing agreements contain a clause that loans can only be re-assigned with the permission of the company. The clause also says that such agreement will not be 'unreasonably withheld'. Mr Sorrell felt it was reasonable to withhold permission for the reassignment of bank loans while he was negotiating the refinancing package. He faced enough difficulties persuading his existing creditors to back the deal without the added complexity of having to persuade a new set of financial institutions. Although Bank of New York and the others were unable to reassign the loans, they were able to pass on their 'sub-participations' in the loans. This is not the contradiction it appears. What it means is Bank of New York was able to pass on its economic interest in the loan by drawing up a complex contract. The risk and reward of holding the WPP loan was passed on to the 12 buyers. Companies may not like the idea of their bank debt being passed around like shares - but there is probably little they can do to stop it.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CORPORATE LOAN VALUE KLESCH &amp; CO  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPANY                    DEBT                               VALUE*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Brent Walker               General financing agreement            25 Canary Wharf               Secured facility                       35  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Goodman Int.

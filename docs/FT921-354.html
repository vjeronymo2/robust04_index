			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / People: KB's new trust man KLEINWORT BENSON, which has been slower than some rivals to exploit its stable of investment trusts, has appointed Simon White, aged 29, as managing director of Kleinwort Benson Investment Trust Management. White, who manages the Jos and Brunner investment trusts, will take over the day-to-day running of Kleinwort's investment trust operation which covers 8 trusts with Pounds 800m of assets. He will continue to manage the two trusts but in addition will be responsible for other areas such as new product development and market research. Joining Kleinwort as a management trainee after Oxford, White was closely involved with the launch of the merchant bank's first new investment trust in 30 years and establishing a number of savings and Pep facilities. He replaces 46-year-old Ben Siddons, a KB veteran, who becomes the first full-time executive chairman of KBITM. Colin Black, the current non-executive chairman, steps down but remains on the board of KBITM and chairman of Kleinwort Benson Investment Management. Black, aged 62, is taking over as chairman of Kleinwort Benson (Channel Islands) following the retirement of David Benson.</p>

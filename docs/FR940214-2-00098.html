The Contracts are available for retirement plans which qualify for federal tax advantages under the Internal Revenue Code and for those plans which do not qualify for advantageous treatment. The Contracts require a minimum initial premium payment of $1,200. Additional premium payments must be in amounts of at least $100. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. If the owner of a Contract dies prior to the annuity date and the Contract is in force, Lincoln Benefit will, upon receipt of due proof of death, pay a death benefit. At a minimum, the death benefit is equal to the greater of: (a) All purchase payments less prior withdrawals, accumulated at 4% per year prior to the Contract anniversary next following the Contract owner's 75th birthday, and at 0% per year thereafter (the ``Floor Value''); or (b) the Contract value less applicable premium tax. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  If the Contract value on the seventh Contract anniversary is greater than the Floor Value, the Floor Value will be increased to the level of the Contract value. If this increase occurs, Floor Value for the eighth Contract year and for subsequent years will then be calculated using the increased value. The Contract owner may select the form of annuity from four annuity options described in the registration statement for the Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The death benefit upon which the Order was based provided for interest accumulations at 4% per year prior to the Contract owner's attained age 80. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. One transfer among subaccounts is permitted monthly without charge. For each transfer among subaccounts in excess of once monthly, a transfer fee of $25 is assessed. The transfer fee is deducted from Contract values which remain in the subaccount or subaccounts from which the transfer is made. Applicants represent that the transfer fee is designed to be at cost with no margin included for profit. Lincoln Benefit is currently waiving this fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Applicants impose an annual Contract maintenance charge of $25 per Contract year. Applicants guarantee that this charge will not increase and state that the charge reimburses Lincoln Benefit for expenses incurred in maintaining the Contracts. This charge will be deducted on each Contract anniversary prior to the annuity date, but is not imposed during the annuity period. If a Contract is surrendered, the charge is assessed as of the surrender date without proration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Lincoln Benefit deducts an administrative expense charge equal to an annual effective rate of .15% of the net asset value of the subaccount. The application states that this charge will compensate Lincoln Benefit for administering the Contracts and the Account. This charge is assessed during both the accumulation and the annuity periods. Applicants state that the Contract maintenance charge and the administrative expense charge are designed, in the aggregate, to be at cost with no margin included for profit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. A contingent deferred sales charge (the ``Sales Charge'') of up to 7% of the amount withdrawn is imposed on certain surrenders or withdrawals of Contract value. No Sales Charge is applied on annuitization or on the payment of a death benefit unless the settlement option chosen is payment over a period certain of less than five years. The Sales Charge is deducted from the Contract value remaining after withdrawal so that the reduction in Contract value as a result of a withdrawal will be greater than the withdrawal amount requested. Amounts obtained from imposition of the Sales Charge will be used to pay sales commissions and other promotional or distribution expenses associated with the marketing of the Contracts. To the extent that the Sales Charge does not cover all sales commissions and other promotional or distribution expenses, Applicants state that Lincoln Benefit may use any of its corporate assets, including potential profit from the mortality and expense risk charge, to make up the shortfall. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

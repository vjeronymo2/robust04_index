			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- The Construction Ministry  on Wednesday [30 March] issued a new manual to guide its field  offices in dealing with bid-rigging practices by contractors for  public works projects, officials said. The ministry also  decided to establish committees in various localities across the  nation to assess the fairness of bidding practices, the  officials said.    The manual instructs local field offices to immediately  report possible incidences of big rigging to the committees  without waiting to confirm the truth or falsehood of the  information.    If the committees decide to launch an inquiry, all bidders  will be questioned separately. Even if no evidence of bid  rigging is turned up, the bidders will each have to sign a  written oath.    The manual says that when bidding takes place, all bidders  should submit their estimated construction costs in written form  to the committees before the winner is decided. If evidence of  possible bid rigging is uncovered in the process, the awarding  of the contract in question to the lowest bidder should be  delayed or canceled, it says.    The new policies are scheduled to be applied to construction  orders issued from April.</p>

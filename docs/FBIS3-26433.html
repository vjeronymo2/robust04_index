A regional work conference on reforms of the economic  structure was held in Lhasa 20 January. Yang Chuantang,  Standing Committee member of the regional party committee and  executive vice chairman of the regional government, put forward  a five-point requirement for comprehensive fulfillment of this  year's reforms in Tibet.    Pudoje, vice chairman of the regional people's congress  Standing Committee, and Jiang Cuo [3068 2238], executive vice  chairman of the regional government, were present at the  conference.    Reviewing reforms of the economic structure in Tibet over  the  past 15 years, Yang Chuantang said in his speech: Like other  parts of the country, Tibet initiated reforms of the economic  structure in farming and pastoral areas, whereby the region has  promoted and expedited economic restructuring as a whole. In  recent years, we have actively reformed the planning system,  striving to expand the fundamental role of markets in resource  allocation; in reforming enterprises, we have readjusted the  structure, delegated authority to enterprises and allowed them  to retain profits, changed profit delivery to tax payment,  introduced the contract system, and changed the operating  mechanisms of enterprises; we have made relatively rapid  progress in reforming the financial and taxation system; and we  have scored initial successes in reforming government  institutions, focusing on the transformation of functions. In  addition, we have conducted a host of fruitful explorations in  banking system reform, circulation system reform, ownership  structure reform, and social security system reform. A review  of Tibet's basic experiences in the 15-year reform shows that  seizing opportunities for reform means seizing opportunities for  development; and without making and expediting reforms, it is  impossible to achieve and expedite development.    Comrade Yang Chuantang put forward the following five-point  requirement for comprehensive fulfillment of reforms in 1994:  First of all, it is necessary to make reform the top priority  of the region and promote sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the regional economy. Leading cadres at all  levels should keep a cool head, recognizing and facing squarely  our backwardness and areas where we lag behind, and  strengthening the intensity and accelerating the pace of reform.  In the face of this historic opportunity, we must strive to  push the regional economy to a new height and constantly build  up our overall strength so as to keep up with the pace of  national development. Second, it is necessary to effectively  strengthen leadership over reform. As we will face more arduous  tasks and higher demands of reform, party committees and  governments at all levels should devote more energies to  expediting reforms and carrying out their historic  responsibility. To this end, party committees and governments  at all levels should familiarize themselves with the guiding  principles, basic ideas, specific content, and operational  procedures of all reform measures in Tibet; and should work out  well-conceived plans and make meticulous efforts to carry them  out in an innovative way in the light of the realities of each  locality or department. It is necessary to pay close attention  to overall coordination of various reform measures, and to guard  against contradictory policy measures and selfish departmental  interests to the neglect of the overall situation. It is  necessary to conduct investigations and study for solving new  problems and circumstances in good time. It is also necessary  to improve the legal system and raise its level of  standardization. Third, it is necessary to emancipate our  minds, strive to make innovations, and quicken the pace of  establishing a new system. Leading cadres at all levels should  make a sober estimate of the situation, emancipate the mind, be  bold in practice, do a good job in carrying out pilot projects,  strictly adhere to the criteria of the forces of production,  concentrate efforts on innovative reform, and mobilize the  masses in blazing a trail of building new systems with special  characteristics. Fourth, it is necessary to improve the  economic restructuring departments and go all out to closely  coordinate all departments concerned in jointly completing the  tasks of reform. Party committees and governments at all  levels, as well as all departments, should provide manpower,  materials, and financial resources for improving the economic  restructuring departments, rationalizing relations with the  departments and actively supporting their operation. Fifth, it  is necessary to step up study and enhance quality to keep up  with the demands of the new situation. In conclusion, the vice  chairman urged leading cadres at all levels to study and master  the basic law governing market economic operations by stepping  up study, persisting in thinking over issues, earnestly  conducting investigations and study, and constantly improving  quality. He said: Party committees, governments, and economic  restructuring departments at all levels, as well as all relevant  departments, should create the essential conditions and conduct  practical, diversified forms of training for improving the  quality of cadres in Tibet.    Xiao Huaiyuan, director of the regional economic research  center, outlined six major tasks of economic restructuring in  Tibet this year: First, continuing to implement the  "Regulations for Changing the Operating Mechanisms of Industrial  Enterprises Owned by the Whole People" and "Procedures for  Implementing the Regulations for Changing the Operating  Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People  in Tibet Autonomous Region," and reinforcing work related to  changing the operating mechanisms of enterprises; second,  continuing to stabilize and perfect the party's basic policies  in farming and pastoral areas and deepening reforms in these  areas; third, accelerating the establishment of markets, focused  on the nurturing of capital goods markets; fourth, ensuring a  good job in reforming the fiscal and taxation, investment, and  foreign trade systems, and expediting the establishment of  macroeconomic control and regulatory mechanisms compatible with  a market economy; fifth, deepening reform of the social security  system and setting up social security organizations; and sixth,  actively and yet prudently promoting urban housing reform. He  pointed out: This year, reforms will be carried out in Tibet at  a deeper level, in broader areas, and with an intensity and  difficulty never seen before. Economic restructuring  departments at all levels should diligently study various reform  programs launched in the region and pay close attention to  carrying them out.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("RESPUBLICA ARMENIA" daily-"PRAVDA"),  04/21/94 -- An interview with the RMK [Republic of Mountainous  Karabakh] Minister of Foreign Affairs Arkadiy Gukasyan was  printed in "PRAVDA"s issue from April 19:    -- [PRAVDA] How does Karabakh, with its population of only  150,000 people, stand against the 7-million Azerbaijan?    -- [Gukasyan] Did you watch the movie "300 Spartans"? You  will understand if you saw it. There are several factors, which  explain the Karabakh phenomenon. First, is that we know what  are we struggling for. We have no space to retreat, we haven't  got another land. Every citizen of Karabakh understands he will  have no home and no family tomorrow, if he be pusillanimous.  And we are withstanding Azeris, who are forcefully brought to  the front from Baku, Sumgait, Kirovabad. Personally, they do  not need Karabakh at all, and thus they are looking for a  convenient moment to desert. Therefore, you shouldn't ascribe  our success to the support of Armenia.    -- [PRAVDA] Where do you get the weaponry from?    -- [Gukasyan] We are very thankful to Azerbaijan for a  "regular supply" of weaponry. 80 percent of arms we use are  trophies. We buy the rest. I won't specify where and who from  do we buy it though.    -- [PRAVDA] Arkadiy, the officials in Moscow accept you,  though the RMK is not officially recognized by Russia...    -- [Gukasyan] Let me avoid this question. If I tell you why  they accept me, they will stop doing so.    -- [PRAVDA] Direct Azeri-Karabakh negotiations have started  in Moscow last autumn. What happened to this?    -- [Gukasyan] Yes, I have had dialogues with the Deputy  Chairman of the Azeri Supreme Council A. Dzhalilov.  Unfortunately, direct negotiations stopped, after Aliyev was  officially elected as the President of Azerbaijan.    -- [PRAVDA] You just returned from the CSCE negotiations in  Prague. Did you acknowledge any progress?    -- [Gukasyan] To say frankly, there was only insignificant  success. We negotiated the measures of mutual trust before a  cease fire.    -- [PRAVDA] What about the cease fire itself? It was  stipulated by the negotiations between the four sides, carried  out in February in Russian Defense Ministry. Even the concrete  date of March 1 has been mentioned...    -- [Gukasyan] The agreements were not implemented. First of  all, because Azerbaijan wouldn't accept the Russian project on  stationing peace-keeping forces into a disengagement zone.    -- [PRAVDA] Suppose, Azerbaijan accepts this plan. Are you  ready to leave the occupied territories outside Mountainous  Karabakh in this case?    -- [Gukasyan] We have no claims for Azeri lands. But we  won't leave the occupied positions until irreversibility of the  peace process is proved. We must make sure we won't be blocked  again and the communications will open. Our principles are: no  cease fire without placement of independent observers; no  withdrawal of troops without stationing the peace-keeping forces.    -- [PRAVDA] Is the Republic of Mountainous Karabakh a  democratic country?    -- [Gukasyan] We have all attributes of power. We have a  Supreme Council, which was elected by people, we are preparing a  project of the constitution. But as long as the war continues,  all control is concentrated in the State Department of Defense,  similarly as it was in USSR during the World War II... We even  have collective and state farms in Karabakh. We believe, these  forms are optimal now.    -- [PRAVDA] What's your currency?    -- [Gukasyan] We are open to all currencies: rubles, drams,  dollars... We even don't mind against Azeri manats.    -- [PRAVDA] Do you still have non-Armenian population in  Karabakh?    -- [Gukasyan] Yes, we have Russians, Ukrainians, Greeks,  Jews  -- some 7-8 thousands altogether. We should though consider the  fact that many Russians departed, when part of Karabakh was  controlled by Azerbaijan.    -- [PRAVDA] What do you think about the national-liberation  movement of Abkhaz people?    -- [Gukasyan] You may consider this as a joke or seriously,  but I had an original thought once: why not create a CUS -- a  Commonwealth of Unrecognized States. Indeed, we have a common  goal on the large scale: to live so that countries, which are  willing to contain us by force, are unable to dictate their will  to us. Surely, we sympathize for Abkhazia, Dniestr, Crimea, and  we have corresponding contacts. We may commence a mutual  offensive on the diplomatic front, if needed.    -- [PRAVDA] Do you see the future of Karabakh within  Armenia?    -- [Gukasyan] I percept Karabakh as an independent country.  But I do not exclude the possibility that Karabakh may become a  part of Armenia.</p>

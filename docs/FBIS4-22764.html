			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Stepanov: "Over the Air Waves -- the </F> `Deputy's Daybreak': Freedom of Speech Does Not Have Long to  Live"]    [Text] The State Duma has taken decisive action to carry  out a program for the radical brainwashing of the citizens. For  this purpose a decree is being prepared, to create a special  Duma television company, and a law that requires the state SMI  [mass media] to publish the "acts" enacted by that house is  already practically finished.    The need for the law is obvious: the Duma enacted a decree  on  amnesty, but it proved to be unable legally to implement it,  that is, to promulgate it. This time Speaker Rybkin proved to be  in luck. The execution of his desire depended not upon an honest  procurator, but upon the lady who manages a newspaper that does  not belong to the Duma. In general, the little problem was  worked out and the little matter was settled. (On the eve of the  amnesty, true, V. Isakov, a farsighted strategist in the  opposition, attempted to push through a piece of paper to the  effect that the Duma was authorizing itself to promulgate its  own decisions in state newspapers.) In one way or another, the  Duma is preparing a federal law to assure the prompt  promulgation of its statements. But, pending the approval of  that law by the Security Council and the president, there  remains the danger that one of the editors in chief might refuse  to publish the Duma's opinions in his newspaper.    As for television, the situation is even more interesting.  On  the one hand, the state does not have any money for  broadcasting, and, on the other hand, it is proposed that the  Duma television and radio company will be given air time every  day (that's right, every day!) up to 45 minutes of prime time.  Obviously at the expense of the state television and radio  companies. Why should the taxpayer have to spend money? Well,  because the journalists, in the deputies' opinion, just as they  did during the Khasbulatov days, came to an understanding, are  expressing "incorrect" opinions, and are asking questions not of  those who have accumulated a greater number of them. Obviously,  no consideration is being taken of the fact that the Duma  deputies, even without decrees, appear regularly on television.  The citizens can have absolutely no desire to see their deputies  and faction leaders on the screen (although they are paying for  this!), but the election is almost upon us and, under the sauce  of Duma news, political associations can carry out their  campaigns at no cost to themselves. Can anyone refuse that?    The question of who will manage the Duma's television  service  would seem to be unessential if the person who was accepted  promptly into the Duma's press center in the position of the  head of the television and radio sector had not been Yuriy  Marechenkov, who had been the manager of Khasbulatov's press  service and whose television creation "Parliamentary Hour" is  still alive in the memory of television viewers.    This is, however, only one side of the problem. The other  side -- how the Duma can make itself safe against criticism --  also has not failed to attract attention. A Duma decree on how  the mass media are supposed to illumine its activities has  already been enacted. Soon there will be a federal law, entitled  "Procedure for Illumining the Activities of State Agencies of  Authority in the State Mass Media," and a new wording of the law  entitled "Television and Radio Broadcasting" (the law will be  reviewed in the Duma in late April).    The only thing that is completely unclear for the time being  is how the Duma plans to conceal these charms behind such a big  smoke screen.</p>

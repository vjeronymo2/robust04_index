			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / BCCI fraud guilty plea A Washington court yesterday accepted a guilty plea in response to fraud charges filed against the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), paving the way for the liquidators of the collapsed bank to forfeit Dollars 550m of US assets as part of a previously agreed settlement, Alan Friedman writes from New York. Acceptance of the plea will terminate all US criminal charges against the bank, although some individuals remain subject to prosecution. BCCI creditors had sought to block the settlement on the grounds that it would leave little money for their claims.</p>

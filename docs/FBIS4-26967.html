			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao Zhiguang (5135 0037 0342): "Who Is Obstructing the </F> Routine Cross-Strait Talks?"]    [Text] Not long ago, a high-ranking figure in the Taiwan  authorities criticized the mainland for stressing in the routine  cross-strait talks that "the mainland is the central authority  whereas Taiwan is the local authority; the mainland has  sovereignty whereas Taiwan does not have sovereign status"; and  "adopting this kind of attitude to stifle Taiwan." He also said  that the parties had failed to reach an agreement in the routine  talks because "whenever the talks are approaching the end, the  mainland always advocates taking mainland laws and regulations  as the basis for handling things." As this figure has distorted  the concrete situation in the routine cross-strait talks,  confounded right and wrong, and put the blame on others, we must  refute what he said to clarify matters for the public.  <H5>  I. The Taiwan Authorities Exploit the Routine Cross-Strait </H5> Talks To Set Out Political Demands    The first formal meeting between high-ranking figures across  the straits in their unofficial capacities for over 40 years,  materialized through the Wang-Koo [Wang Daohan, chairman of the  mainland's Association for Relations Across the Straits (ARATS),  and Koo Chen-fu, president of Taiwan's Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF]) Talks, which built a system for future  contacts and talks between the two associations and set various  items on the agenda in the routine and economic talks.  Moreover, with the efforts made by the two associations and the  parties concerned across the straits, both parties stated their  consensus in the words that "both sides of the strait uphold the  one-China principle," thus evading the politically sensitive  question of "the meaning of one China" and, at the same time,  defining the nature of cross-strait affairs as China's special  affairs which are different from interstate affairs. Meanwhile,  working according to the spirit of "mutual respect, seeking  truth from facts, consultation on the basis of equality, and  seeking common ground while reserving differences," the two  associations reached two agreements, namely: The "Agreement on  Using and Verifying Cross-Strait Notarized Documents" and the  "Agreement on Inquiry Into Cross-Strait Registered Letters and  Compensation Matters." If both parties could still uphold the  abovementioned principle and practice, contact and talks between  the ARATS and the SEF after the Wang-Koo Talks should have taken  on a new aspect conducive to promoting cross-strait economic and  trade cooperation and multisided exchanges and contact.    However, soon after the Wang-Koo Talks ended, the Taiwan  authorities concerned violated the unofficial, economic, and  routine orientation of the talks and willfully put off  discussion of the economic and scientific and technological  agenda listed in the Joint Agreement from the Wang-Koo Talks.  Meanwhile, in the routine talks, they raised political  questions such as those concerning "judicial jurisdiction" to  orient the so-called "splitting, divide-and-rule, and  reciprocal" cross-strait relations, thus seriously obstructing  the several rounds of talks called since last August and  bringing the routine talks, in which the two associations had  achieved initial success, to a dead end. For example, in the  Taipei Talks held last December, the authorities concerned in  Taiwan engaged in double-dealing. On the one hand, they shouted  for "laying aside the controversy over sovereignty and  jurisdiction" and, on the other hand, they asked for the  realization of the so-called political demands, such as "not  repatriating people of our side" and "having 24 nautical miles  of jurisdiction," in routine agreements concerning the  "repatriation of cross-strait hijackers" and the "handling of  fishing disputes" under the guise of "divorcing legal issues  from political issues." After failing to realize the political  demands they imposed on the routine talks, the authorities  concerned in Taiwan declared once again that "both sides of the  strait are still in a state of discord and divide-and-rule" and  that the "mainland does not respect Taiwan's judicial  jurisdiction" to mislead the public and deceive Taiwan  compatriots.    Last February, leaders of the ARATS and the SEF met in  Beijing and reached the following consensus: "In the routine  talks, our two associations should evade political questions in  a down-to-earth manner." On this basis, they also discussed  their specific differences of opinion on three agenda items,  including one on the "repatriation of personnel who violate  relevant regulations and enter the other's territory," and made  joint efforts to sum up the consensus discussed and the train of  thought for solving problems.    However, in the fourth routine talks, the Taiwan authorities  concerned openly repudiated the consensus reached between the  leaders of the two associations and raised questions of  divergence again which had been settled. They even broke  certain promises made in the Taipei Talks and kept arguing about  sensitive issues. Consequently, the agreements which should have  been reached fell through again. This not only damaged the  solemnity of authorizing the talks by leaders of the two  associations but also undermined sincerity in the talks between  the two associations, thus making an extremely bad impression  among compatriots across the strait.    Following the occurrence of the "Qiandao Hu Incident," the  Taiwan authorities concerned unilaterally laid aside talks held  between the two associations and once again broke the agreements  reached between the two associations, which was strongly  criticized by the media in Taiwan. At that time, a high-ranking  figure who had just wantonly railed against the mainland and  made separatist remarks, was still saying that "the CPC's  sovereignty does not cover Taiwan," thus continuing to obstruct  the progress of the two associations' routine talks and  high-level talks.    II. ARATS Consistently Suggests That the Two  Associations' Talks Should Avoid Politically Sensitive Issues    The mainland authorities concerned and ARATS have been  consistently striving to uphold the consensus and basis of the  two associations' talks. Following the close of the Xiamen  Talks, the ARATS immediately sent a letter to the SEF and  pointed out that "both parties should continue to observe the  consensus that both sides of the strait uphold the one-China  policy; keep upholding the unofficial, economic, routine, and  functional nature agreed on by the Wang-Koo Talks; and avoid  political issues so that the two associations' talks can proceed  smoothly." When leaders of the two associations were exchanging  views on issues of divergence in the routine talks, Tang Shubei  further elaborated the ARATS' stand on the routine talks and its  views on settling differences: First, no party should impose  its political demands on the other side through routine  agreements and the mainland is against the idea of working  through agreements to regularize the state of a temporary cross-  strait split to reflect the so-called "split and  divide-and-rule." Second, in order to help us settle concrete  issues in cross-strait exchanges and contacts, the two  associations should not be involved in cross-strait political  differences and should not bring politically sensitive issues  into the two associations' routine talks. As for the fact that  clauses about the content of judicial jurisdiction and legal  jurisdiction are not written in the agreements between the two  unofficial groups, it neither implies any changes in the current  stand by the Taiwan authorities nor any changes in the  mainland's consistent stand. Third, the ARATS is not empowered  to indicate its stand on "judicial jurisdiction" and other  issues of a political nature when holding talks with the SEF.  Hence, the differences between the parties in the talks neither  concern the question of "respecting or not respecting" Taiwan's  "judicial jurisdiction" nor the question of how to consider  Taiwan's "judicial jurisdiction." If the Taiwan side explicitly  authorizes the SEF to discuss the question of "judicial  jurisdiction," the ARATS is willing to pass on the news to  relevant departments so that they can authorize the ARATS to  hold special talks in this respect under the prerequisite of the  one-China policy. At that time, the mainland side will also  raise political questions about which it is concerned. The  ARATS' abovementioned position is one which entirely  differentiates political issues from routine matters and which  fully shows respect for the current state of cross-strait  relations and for the other side's practical and effective stand  in solving problems. The cliche of the so-called "stifling"  Taiwan is simply groundless talk which confounds right and wrong.    During the talks, the ARATS always insisted on taking the  method and thinking of solving routine problems to try to reach  an agreement. The ARATS suggested that hijackers should all be  repatriated and handled by the side to which hijacked civil  airliners belong; however, it also gave full consideration to  the essential coercive measures applied to hijackers by relevant  departments in Taiwan and agreed to repatriating hijackers after  dealing with special situations. Moreover, the ARATS also  agreed to let the Taiwan side handle the cases wherein Taiwanese  people hijack mainland civil airliners to Taiwan. As far as the  repatriation of illegal emigrants is concerned, the ARATS, while  taking the limitations of Taiwan's current policies into  consideration, took the initiative in rearranging the  examination and verification site and the repatriation route.  In handling fishing disputes, the ARATS suggested that  cross-strait arbitration organs should arbitrate disputes  through consultation and implement the result while ensuring its  enforcement. As for the question of what form should be taken,  each side should deal with its own case and the practice of any  side should never be considered as the standard for the other  party. While making certain suggestions on the key questions of  the abovementioned three agreements, the ARATS never "called for  taking mainland laws and regulations as the handling basis." On  the contrary, the practice of the Taiwan concerned authorities  precisely "makes it impossible to solve even very simple routine  problems." For example, in handling fishing disputes, if we  settle disputes between fishing boats first, the problem will be  much simpler; but the Taiwan side insisted on putting the  disputes between public service ships and fishing boats, as well  as the role of public service ships in fishing disputes, on the  agenda, thus trying to engender the political controversy of  "the jurisdiction of waters."    According to the "Jinmen Agreement" and the consensus  reached  between the two associations on the issue of repatriating  hijackers, it is entirely possible for the Taiwan side to,  technically speaking, enforce repatriation but the Taiwan  authorities use these as counters to strive to achieve certain  political goals. In this connection, the common people in  Taiwan have a very clear understanding. Soon after this  high-ranking Taiwan figure made his remarks, a Taiwanese  compatriot wrote an article in LIEN HO PAO on 7 June and pointed  out: "As far as the legal aspect is concerned, if our side take  a more pragmatic stand, we can actually hold that the hijacking  cases occur and end in the CPC's civil airliners" and we "can  avoid the question of judicial jurisdiction in terms of legal  principle." "After going through a preliminary investigation of  the facts, hijackers must be repatriated immediately." If the  Taiwan authorities do not give up their political attempts and  take a pragmatic stand, it will be difficult for the routine  cross-strait talks to achieve any concrete results.    III. The Taiwan Authorities Should Take Practical  Actions To Help the Two Associations Discuss Development    As cross-strait relations are developing, the Taiwan  authorities concerned fantasize about using the two  associations' talks to control or obstruct cross-strait  exchanges, contacts, and development but such a practice has  aroused Taiwan compatriots' strong discontent. Likewise, the  Taiwan authorities are using their "mainland policy" as a means  of "foreign policy" and relying on the two associations' talks  to create "two political entities" and "two Chinas" but their  conspiracy is being attacked by men of insight, including those  inside the Taiwan authorities.    They criticize the Taiwan authorities' routine talks policy  as a "policy of putting off or rejecting the policy of  cross-strait communication" and as "trying every possible means  to strive to build a new Cold War system."    They made an appeal to the high-ranking figure from the  Taiwan authorities," saying that, as he "is trying so hard to  promote pragmatic diplomacy, we wish he would also set up the  mainland policy." They also called on the two associations to  hold high- level meetings and communicate with each other to  solve problems. Recently, the increasingly fierce conflicts  between Taiwan's SEF and the "Mainland Affairs Council [MAC]" in  the idea and strategy of cross-strait consultation, as well as  the differences between the "Economic Ministry" and the "MAC" in  cross-strait economic and trade policies, reveal the fact that  the Taiwan authorities' existing "mainland policy" is unpopular  and incompatible with present needs.    We advise the Taiwan leaders to give up their unrealistic  illusions and change their rigid and conservative state of mind  so that the two associations' talks can return to the spirit of  the Wang-Koo Talks and to the consensus reached at the talks  held between the leaders of the two associations. After taking  routine methods to reach the three agreements, we should open  talks on economic and scientific and technological matters as  soon as possible and fully implement the Wang-Koo Agreement. In  particular, as Chairman Wang Daohan, Mr Koo Cheng-fu, and  scholars and the media on both sides of the strait have jointly  proposed holding the second Wang-Koo Talks as early as this  year, we should take concrete actions to bring about the second  Wang-Koo Talks and to give an impetus to the progressive  development of cross-strait relations.</p>

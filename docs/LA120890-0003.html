			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> 3 HOUSE PLANS OKD AT OXNARD SHORES  </P> <P> The Oxnard Planning Commission approved plans Thursday for three houses to be  built in an oceanfront subdivision that has not been built on for 18 years  because of a dispute over beach erosion that pitted property owners against  environmentalists.  </P> <P> The longstanding dispute over the Oxnard Shores was settled in 1988, resolving  10 lawsuits designed to force city and state officials to allow development on  the shoreline.  </P> <P> In the past five months, the city has granted nine other building permits for  Oxnard Shores.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the commission voted 5 to 1, with one commissioner abstaining, to  give one coastal development permit each to Lycon Properties Inc. of Sherman  Oaks, Roy Milbrandt of Ventura and Douglas W. Burdge of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Lycon plans to build a two-story, 4,831-square-foot house on pilings on Marine  Way and Amalfi Way. Milbrandt plans to build a two-story, 6,200-square-foot  house on Mandalay Beach Road near Breakwater Way. Burdge plans to build a  three-story, 4,895-square-foot house on the corner of Mandalay Beach Road and  Reef Way.  </P> <P> Commissioner Selma Dressler, who has voiced concern about other projects at  Oxnard Shores, abstained from the vote, saying the structures will form a "wall  of homes" to block the view of the ocean. She said beach erosion will also make  it unsafe to live in a house built on pilings.  </P> <P> Commissioner Stella Spray agreed. "Any home built on sand will not stand," she  said.  </P> <P> The commission's decision can be appealed to the City Council and to the State  Coastal Commission.  </P> <P> Under the settlement, lot owners gave up more than 1,400 feet of property along  the beach for two public parks and agreed to grant public beach access. In  return, they were allowed the right to exceed current density restrictions.  HUGO MARTIN  </P></p>

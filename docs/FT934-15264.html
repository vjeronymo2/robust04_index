			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / S Korea averts financial panic SOUTH KOREA yesterday smoothly completed the introduction of a ban on anonymous financial accounts and avoided a panic on money markets. The government had stipulated that yesterday was the deadline for all accounts to be registered under the real name of their owners. The ban on false-name accounts is meant to reduce the large underground economy, estimated to be equal to 20 per cent of GNP. About 95 per cent of the won300,000bn (Pounds 241bn) in financial accounts had been identified as of yesterday. There had been widespread fears that the deadline would provoke a massive withdrawal of hidden assets from banks and the stock market in a desperate attempt to beat the tax collector, causing a liquidity drain and a financial crisis in its wake. But the government on Monday suggested that accounts listed under borrowed names would not have to be converted to the owner's real name until 1996, when a new tax system is introduced. Analysts believe that most of the untaxed assets are hidden under borrowed name accounts. It is common practice for large depositors to use the names of family, relatives and friends to hide their assets and reduce their tax bill. The concession will enable the nominee holders to withdraw money from the accounts over the next three years without officials discovering who actually owns the funds in the account. The stock market reacted soberly to the deadline. The general index rose by 2.5 points to 724, almost precisely the same level before the real-name system was announced two months ago and caused a brief panic on the exchange. The bourse has recovered since then because the government promised that it would not impose capital gains taxes for the next five years to persuade investors to keep their money in the market.</p>

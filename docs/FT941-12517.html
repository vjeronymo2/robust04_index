			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sainsbury slumps on statement A shock trading statement from J. Sainsbury sent the shares tumbling to their biggest ever one-day fall as turnover hit a record 24m. In a sector getting used to depressing news, the Sainsbury announcement of lower margins, slack sales and property write-downs still came as a huge blow and flew in the face of what the market had been widely anticipating. 'It's an unmitigated disaster,' said Mr Frank Davidson at James Capel. 'These figures show Sainsbury is performing worse than the competition and raises the question: is it worth its premium rating?' The answer from investors seemed to be 'no'as the shares came under immediate pressure, tumbling 30 as the market opened and finally closing at 393p, a drop of 48 on the day. And with Sainsbury giving what amounted to a profits warning, analysts slashed their forecasts, by around 15 per cent to about Pounds 700m. The announcement shook food retail analysts, many of whom had only recently begun to relax their negative stance on the sector. Yesterday, Sainsbury's more recent supporters were hard to find. But one, who preferred to remain anonymous, argued that the announcement showed margin pressure was easing. However, the market focused on the perception of dramatically lower earnings growth and slower dividend gains. In turn, many switched their attention to Sainsbury's competitors. Capel's calculates that on 1995 forecast, Sainsbury yields 3.5 per cent, Tesco 4.7 per cent and Argyll 5.8 per cent. Tesco shares rallied to close just a half-penny off at 222 1/2 p in turnover of 18m. Argyll fell 14 to 258p.</p>

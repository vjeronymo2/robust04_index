			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Sailor faces a lashing from whip IT IS PERHAPS appropriate that Mr Rupert Allason lists 'sailing close to the wind' as his only Who's Who recreation. The Conservative MP for Torbay appears to have been doing just that by being absent from yesterday's Commons votes. Mr Allason may find himself in hot water both with the government whips and his constituency association as a result of his failure to appear. One Tory loyalist said scathingly that the 'honourable member for Bermuda North' had been summoned to see Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, on his return. The remark reflected the widespread assumption that Mr Allason was away in Bermuda. The MP for Torbay since June 1987 now faces the threat of having the Conservative whip withdrawn - which would isolate him from party activities at Westminster and bar him from standing as an official Tory candidate at the next general election. In a statement released last night Mr Allason said: 'The dilemma I faced was whether to keep the promise I made last year, not to assist in the passage of the Maastricht treaty, or whether to back an administration that has declared its intention to ignore the will of the Commons. 'It is quite clear from last night's vote the Maastricht Bill has been put into limbo and the social chapter issue given the last rites. To insist on pursuing ratification of the treaty is, in my judgment, absolute folly and that is how I believe history will judge the issue.' Squadron-leader Johnny Johnson, chairman of Mr Allason's constituency association, said his MP's absence was 'curious, disappointing and as far as I am concerned anger-making'. He had tried to call Mr Allason in London before being passed information implying that he was 'in his Bermuda home'. He said Mr Allason was neither popular nor unpopular with the association. It was 'unlikely at this time' that moves might be taken to deselect him 'for political reasons'. Mr Allason held Torbay at the last general election with a majority of 5,787 over the Liberal Democrats. No Maastricht enthusiast, Mr Allason frequently decided against voting in accordance with whips' instructions during the tortuous committee stage. He is arguably better known to the public at large as the spy-writer Nigel West.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Italian unions stage four-hour strike against unemployment ITALY'S three main trade union federations yesterday staged a staggered, four-hour general strike, calling on the government to act urgently against rising unemployment. The strike came as the lira fell for the second time this week below the level of 1,000 to the D-Mark, before recovering to L998. The currency's weakness reflected market anxieties over the deadlock in efforts by Italian politicians to agree on a way to find a stronger government. The strike, which mainly affected public sector services and the civil service, was accompanied by a series of demonstrations in the main cities. Scuffles broke out in Turin and Naples, but the violence was less than during the last such strike in November. This was the 11th general strike in 12 years but yesterday rain reduced the number of protesters on the streets. The protest against unemployment, now reaching nearly 11 per cent of the labour force, was overshadowed by the government crisis and the plight of the lira. But union leaders insisted yesterday that the workers were likely to be those most prejudiced by the government's faltering and the currency's decline. The ruling Christian Democrats, dominant partners in the four-party coalition headed by Mr Giuliano Amato, have come out strongly against the idea of 'an institutional solution' to the political crisis. This hinged on suggestions by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro that a non-partisan figure, such as the leader of either the senate or the chamber of deputies, assume the leadership of an interim government after the referendums due on April 18, with the specific task of supervising electoral reform. The Christian Democrats have been put onto the defensive, both by the defection this week of the reformist Mr Mario Segni, and by the news that Palermo magistrates were investigating the veteran Christian Democrat politician Mr Giulio Andreotti, for alleged links with the mafia. The party fears an 'institutional' government would annul its traditional influence. The Christian Democrats are also hostile to the other main proposition - accepting into the government representatives of the former communists, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The latter, for its part, is saying it will only join the government if it contains people wholly untainted by corruption scandals.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE  </P> <P> Belmont Park's New Night Life Raises Philanthropist's Memory  </P> <P> Hello.  </P> <P>  May I speak to John D. Spreckels, please? Yes, of course I know he died in  1926 at age 73.  </P> <P> Still, I think he deserves to know what's become of those 17 seaside acres in  Mission Beach where he built such a nifty amusement park.  </P> <P> After all, his family willed the site to the city in the late 1930s to be kept  for the general good.  </P> <P> John, you old sugar-newspaper-land-railroad baron, is that you?  </P> <P> I was out at the new Belmont Park on Saturday. The place was hopping late into  the night. That hasn't happened in nearly a generation.  </P> <P> The city may have bumbled into something fun.  </P> <P> A place where teens and young adults can buy a slice of pizza or a chocolate  cookie, maybe dance at the Club Red Onion, maybe ride the renovated roller  coaster.  </P> <P> Is it the highest and best use for the site? Who knows? That's yesterday's  question. It's here now, let's enjoy it.  </P> <P> It's not Disneyland, John. There is a certain gaminess.  </P> <P> A college student from Clairemont named Jim Wegeforth told me, "It's a hangout  place, man. The malls don't want us."  </P> <P> The crowd is eclectic: fully integrated, football lettermen, upscale teen-agers  from Tijuana, arm-in-arm couples, sailors in mid-boot camp, guys on unicycles.  </P> <P> Also, the beach can be weird, John. A fellow came roller-skating through  wearing only a lavender G-string.  </P> <P> A radio station was having a dog contest. A golden retriever won the best  costume category. I asked if he always dresses like this.  </P> <P> "Only for formal occasions," a guy named Wayne Borin told me. His nephew, Tommy  Taylor, who is 9 and lives in Oceanside, owns the dog.  </P> <P> Owner and dog drifted away. Nobody noticed a dog wearing a pink tutu.  </P> <P> It's that kind of crowd these days (and nights) at Belmont Park.  </P> <P> You might like it, John. Then again, you've been gone a long time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Blowing in the Wind  </P> <P> There's meaning here somewhere.  </P> <P> * North County bumper sticker: Isn't it time to pull over and check the air in  your head?  </P> <P> * San Diego attorney David Mulliken will represent San Diego City Councilman  Bruce Henderson in his 11th-hour fight against the billion-dollar sewer plan.  Pro bono.  </P> <P> Mulliken last year forced the council to reverse its denial of a proposed  hazardous-waste incinerator for La Jolla and won a $1.25-million judgment from  the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Picketing, Politicking, Pontificating  </P> <P> In the trenches.  </P> <P> * A Boston judge has delayed for two months a decision on a lawsuit to keep an  aquarium from sending the male dolphin Rainbow to the Naval Ocean Systems  Center in San Diego.  </P> <P> Dolphin lovers picketed the courthouse.  </P> <P> One pro-Rainbow sign: "Hell No, He Won't Go."  </P> <P> * The recall movement against Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt heated up over the  weekend.  </P> <P> Petition passers combed neighborhoods. They claim to have more than a third of  the signatures needed to force an election.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the anti-recall effort, "Together for Linda Bernhardt," sent out  mailers urging people not to sign the petitions, saying the recall is a  pro-growth backlash and that an election would cost taxpayers $100,000.  </P> <P> Aurie Kryzuda, Bernhardt's chief of staff, has taken an unpaid leave of absence  to work with the anti-recall group. Petition deadline is Oct. 10.  </P> <P> * Roger Hedgecock's parting off-camera shot to three questioners (me included)  after a feisty interview on television: "Admit it, you guys miss me."  </P></p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / International Company News: Swarttouw resigns post at Fokker FRANS SWARTTOUW, a prominent member of the supervisory board of Fokker, the Dutch aircraft builder, has resigned his post in a further sign of the controversy aroused by the proposed sale of a 51 per cent stake in the company to Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany. Mr Swarttouw (above), a former Fokker management board chairman and the man associated with the successful launch of a new generation of aircraft in the 1980s, had threatened to resign last month but retracted the warning after his views were leaked to the press. His resignation from the eight-member board underlines Dutch fears that Fokker would be downgraded to an assembly operation if it were taken over by Dasa, which is owned by the Daimler-Benz industrial group. The Dutch government, with 32 per cent of Fokker's shares, wants guarantees that Fokker would continue to be fully involved in designing and marketing new aircraft. Talks between Fokker and Dasa were launched in March but have taken longer than expected because of Dutch efforts to build in safeguards about Fokker's future role. The two sides hope to reach an agreement that would win Dutch government approval by the end of this month. Yesterday, employees at Fokker's aircraft-assembly plant in Amsterdam downed tools briefly to seek explanations from management about a report claiming that the new German majority shareholder would gain virtually full management control and that it might move part of production abroad. Mr James Bryan, head of Airbus in the US, has resigned two days after the European consortium clinched a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.6bn) United Airlines order. Mr Bryan said he was leaving to pursue other interests.</p>

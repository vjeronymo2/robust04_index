			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN LEAVES PURE GREED RIDING HIGH IN THE SADDLE  </P> <P> As President Reagan rides off into the California sunset, he can be proud that  in many respects the Republic is in better shape than when he took office eight  years ago. There is one thing on his record, however, that should cause him  personal pain and regret. That is the enshrinement, with his amiable  toleration, of greed and sleaze as operating norms in the American business and  financial communities.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, given his lack of relevant background or personal interest,  Reagan's greatest successes came in foreign affairs. Critics can argue that  Reagan was the lucky beneficiary of a Soviet economic crisis that finally drove  the Kremlin to adopt a more accommodating, less threatening posture toward the  West.  </P> <P> Even if that is true, the deal-from-strength President deserves credit for  having the wisdom and flexibility to take advantage of the historic  opportunity, when it came, to put U.S.-Soviet relations on a new, more  constructive path.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the President never appreciated the contradiction between his  determination to make America more militarily secure and his insensitivity to  the moral decay that is corroding the foundations of the U.S. economic system.  </P> <P> Reagan's personal honesty has not been seriously questioned. But he proved  remarkably relaxed about the transgressions of some subordinates -- and many,  many businessmen.  </P> <P> The President came into office with an abiding faith in the workings of free  markets and a conviction that the best thing government could do was get out of  the way and let business do its thing.  </P> <P> No doubt federal regulation had gone too far in some areas; a certain  correction was called for in the interest of consumers and a more competitive  economy. But regulation of banks and other financial institutions came about in  the first place because of the irresponsible, anti-public behavior of the  wheelers and dealers of yesteryear. The same is true of antitrust laws.  </P> <P> Common sense tells you that, to the degree that federal regulation was removed,  there was a need for self-restraint in corporate board rooms. That restraint  has not been forthcoming. Pure greed, unattached to any visible social benefit,  is increasingly the name of the game.  </P> <P> One obvious example is the fraud in defense contracting. But a more glaring  example is the savings-and-loan industry, which responded to a loosening of  regulatory laws and controls by going on a reckless binge of speculative  lending and outright corruption. Federal officials say that of the hundreds of  S&amp;L insolvencies, 75% involved fraud or criminal conduct. The American  taxpayer is going to be stuck with the bill -- up to $70 billion or more -- for  this particular exercise in deregulation.  </P> <P> Then there are leveraged buyouts, or LBOs. Mergers, including hostile  takeovers, can result in stronger, more productive companies. But in most of  today's takeovers the main idea is not to improve the acquired firms but to  loot them. American capitalism is threatened with major harm as a result.  </P> <P> Typically the raiding group puts up little money of its own. The takeover is  financed by great amounts of borrowing, including the issuance of junk bonds.  To cope with repayment, the acquired corporations often raid employee pension  funds, slash the work force, cut investment in research and new product  development, and sell off whole divisions or subsidiaries -- frequently to  foreign buyers.  </P> <P> Greed-driven LBOs hurt the American economy in all sorts of ways. But the most  debilitating effect is the obsession with short-term profits at the expense of  long-term competitiveness -- not only in companies that have been acquired but  in firms that fear they will be.  </P> <P> The best business brains in Europe and Japan are dedicated to doing whatever it  takes to conquer world markets -- including ours. Too many American managers  spend their time scheming to get rich, then richer still, through financial  manipulations that do nothing to enhance U.S. economic strength and a great  deal to damage it.  </P> <P> If that situation continues, U.S. living standards will erode and America will  soon be unable to afford the military strength that Reagan rightly considers  essential to peace and security.  </P> <P> A lot of factors, including warped tax codes and a value-deficient system of  business education, are involved.  </P> <P> But Reagan, with his gift for communicating with the American people, could  have made a difference. He could have used the power of the presidency as a  "bully pulpit" to sound the alarm -- to make sleazy business behavior socially  unacceptable and to energize the watchdog agencies of the federal government.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the President didn't do that. He just looked the other way and,  by doing so, became an accomplice.  </P> <P> George Bush's economic team is making some encouraging noises that suggest a  desire to deal with the destructive emphasis of American business on short-term  profits. Whether the new President will also confront the moral degeneration in  the business community remains to be seen.  </P></p>

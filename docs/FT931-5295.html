			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Price fall angers platinum producers THERE WAS good news and bad news for producers of platinum group metals this week. After Allied-Signal of the US announced on Tuesday that it had developed a new palladium-only catalyst for cleaning car exhaust fumes the price of that metal rose by more than 5 per cent. The trouble was that the announcement raised the spectre of platinum's displacement from its biggest single market, and its price fell by 1.75 per cent. For the South African producers that account for more than half the world's production of the two metals the palladium price rise would net an extra Dollars 6m in a full year, while the platinum fall would cost them nearly Dollars 16m. So they were far from pleased. And any relief they might have felt when Allied-Signal backtracked on Wednesday, saying the new catalyst would not replace platinum or rhodium based systems, was overcome by fury at what they saw as another example of market manipulation. 'Is this fair play?' was the heading of a statement issued on Thursday by Mr Michael McMahon, chairman of Impala Platinum, the second largest producer of the metals. He complained of a series of incidents over the past few years that had hit his company's earnings and in which he detected 'a common thread'. Initially, he said, there was overstatement of a position, 'causing severe downward pressure on the PGM markets'. And these were quickly followed by 'a retraction, withdrawal, or considerable watering down of the original message'. That view was backed by Rustenburg Platinum, also of South Africa, the biggest producer, which warned that continuing depressed prices might force it to close down loss-making shafts. While the London palladium price held on to most of its gains - yesterday's fixing was Dollars 104.75 a troy ounce, up Dollars 4.60 on the week - platinum made good most of its fall with a Dollars 3.55 rise yesterday to Dollars 344.30 an ounce, down 70 cents on balance. But that was still Dollars 25 down from three weeks ago, following an earlier fall that was blamed by Mr Todd Bruce of Rustplats on claims 'for which there was no factual support' that Japanese car makers were selling from their own stocks of the metals. At the London Metal Exchange it was one-way traffic again, with all base metals contracts finishing lower on the week. The sharpest decline was in copper, the cash price for which closed yesterday at Pounds 1,474.50 a tonne, down Pounds 40 on the week. The writing was on the wall on Monday when the three months copper price was pushed through a support area around Dollars 2,150 a tonne to a fresh 3 1/2  month low. The main problem for the copper market is the disappearance of the bullish factors that had been propping it up in January and February - initially sustained Chinese buying and then floods in Arizona and strikes in Mexico - while hopes of recovery in the US are being countered by concern about European and Japanese car production prospects. The mood of the market has been further undermined this week by an ominous increase in arrivals from Russia, the source of the floods of aluminium and nickel that have knocked the stuffing out of those markets. This 'could prove the last straw for copper,' commented GNI, the London trading house, in its daily market review yesterday. The long shadow of the former Soviet Union also extended over the tin market this week as merchants reported that the Commonwealth of Independent States was also offering supplies of that metal, and at discount prices. The gloom was lifted somewhat by yesterday's announcement of a modest downturn in LME warehouse stocks of tin and the cash price closed at Dollars 5,670 a tonne, down Dollars 100 on the week but Dollars 25 above Wednesday's low. At the London Futures and Options Exchange traders were keeping an eye on the International Cocoa Agreement negotiations in Geneva, though few held out more than the faintest hope of a positive conclusion. In the event the past fortnight's round of talks, regarded as a last ditch attempt to clear the way for a pact with price-stabilisation clauses, was effectively abandoned on Thursday with producer and consumer delegates still far apart on the price range to be defended by a stock withholding scheme and who should pay to finance the scheme. It was decided, however, to adjourn, rather than to conclude, the meeting as signs were discerned that some producing countries might be willing to make big concessions on these questions. That optimistic view did not seem to have filtered through to the London market, however, where the May delivery position closed yesterday at Pounds 708 a tonne, down Pounds 41 on the week. In the oil market the bullish implications of last month's agreement by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production have been failing to dispel fears of continuing excess supply, but prices managed to break out of the recent narrow trading ranges this week as good refiner buying of crude was seen in Europe and signs emerged of Indian demand. The May delivery price at London's International Petroleum Exchange was trading at Dollars 19.48 a barrel late yesterday up 54 cents on the week.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium      +850    to    1,671,725 Copper       +1,700    to      334,775 Lead         unchgd    at      234,150 Nickel         +408    to       85,494 Zinc         +5,275    to      570,625 Tin            -185    to       18,465  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

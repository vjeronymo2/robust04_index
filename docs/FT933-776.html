			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Poor outlook for steel use raises pressure on industry STEEL use and output are expected to fall further in western Europe this year, increasing pressure on the industry. However, they may stabilise or even increase in eastern Europe, apart from Russia, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. The latest figures from the Geneva-based ECE show that average world steel consumption, production, capacity utilisation and prices of all types of steel product sank last year. Europe and Japan were worst affected, but even in the US and Latin America, where output rose in 1992, prices were weak, and the financial position of the industry deteriorated worldwide. In the European Community, steel consumption fell by 2 per cent last year and crude steel production by 4 per cent, while capacity utilisation dropped to 68 per cent. Consumption is expected to drop by a further 7 per cent in 1993, with a fall in production of over 2 per cent. In the US, consumption rose last year by 7.7 per cent, crude steel production by 4.2 per cent and capacity utilisation reached 81 per cent. The situation is expected to improve again in 1993. The ECE, which groups nations of western and eastern Europe, the US and Canada, says 1993 may see a slow recovery or stabilisation of economic activity in much of eastern Europe. This year could thus prove a turning point for the steel industry, which produced 11 per cent less crude steel in 1992 than in 1991. In Russia, where crude steel output fell by 13 per cent in 1992, the outlook for steel demand and production is more gloomy. A further fall in total industrial production of 10 per cent to 15 per cent is predicted this year.</p>

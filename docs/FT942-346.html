			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Giddings &amp; Lewis sees shortfall Giddings &amp; Lewis, the US machine-tool manufacturer, expects 1994 earnings per share to be some 20 per cent below Wall Street forecasts. It blamed the shortfall partly on competitive industry pricing, resulting from Europe's soft machine tool market. The company said it expected second-quarter earnings per share to be flat or slightly above the 20 cents earned in the first quarter, while for the full year earnings were likely to be 20 per cent below the Dollars 1.35 to Dollars 1.45 being forecast by analysts. The company had earnings per share of 34 cents in the second quarter of last year and Dollars 1.31 in 1993 as a whole. Mr Joseph Coppola, chairman, said several contracts booked in prior periods had proved more costly than anticipated. In addition, competitive pressures meant 1994 gross margins, which the company had anticipated to be around 24-25 per cent, should instead be in the 22-23 per cent range - even though the group expected continued growth in quarterly bookings compared with last year. The soft market for machine tools in Europe had meant lower bookings there and also affected worldwide pricing: competitors suffering sharp order declines overseas were bidding aggressively for contracts in the US, creating more intense pricing pressure.</p>

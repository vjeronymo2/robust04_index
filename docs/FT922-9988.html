			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Arts: The Boy's Own Story The Liverpool FC manager Bill Shankly put football into perspective: 'Some people think football is a matter of life and death. I can assure them it is much more serious.' That truth underpins The Boy's Own Story by Peter Flannery at the Chelsea Centre Theatre. It makes an extraordinary one-man goal-mouth show acted by Guy Masterson; at the end of the 90 minutes, the lad done great. Flannery's play tells of John McKenna, 'the best keeper never to play for England', who now plays for Sunday-league Stratton; at 32, he is washed up and fit for nothing but more of the game he now hates. His past includes a deprived foster-childhood and a successful first division career. The play follows the Tom Stoppard tactic of watching from the margins. As Rosencrantz is to Hamlet, so is the goalkeeper to football: conspicuous by absence. Football is a zero sum game, but especially for goalkeepers. '0-0 is the worst result for the other players. They've failed, you've succeeded.' But who remembers - Gordon Banks' spectacular save from Pele in the Mexico 1970 world semi excepted - a great save? The Boy's Own Story knows that all goalkeeping amounts to is the pleasure of denying others. Guy Masterson's fine, energetic performance combines all-stage dynamism with emotional control and clever parody. He hurls himself round the set and flings himself into impressions of football commentators. He manages to imply much more than he says, to insinuate intelligence. Richard Digby and Tony Yates direct, and could benefit from more sound effects to match the clever lighting. Beneath the deliberate cliches of Flannery's play lurks this disturbing banality: football, game of two halves to the cognoscenti and game of two syllables to the condescenti, is never just a game. Until the result, normal life stops; players are then licensed to be sick as parrots or over the moon: 'All that is expected of us is that we never lose.' The Boy's Own Story knows that these pressures affect the non-sporting life more than one might care to think. Chelsea Centre Theatre until May 23. 071 352 1967</p>

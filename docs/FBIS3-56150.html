"The meeting of the Russian and American presidents began in  an atmosphere of genuine partnership," TRUD writes, commenting  on the Moscow talks. An atmosphere of confidence was  established right from the beginning of the official visit, the  newspaper points out further, quoting Bill Clinton as saying  that it is necessary for the two countries to cooperate for the  sake of Russia's future, the future of the whole world. The  essence of the cooperation is in the creation of a new security  structure in Europe, as well as the advance of democratic values  and a free economic system, the U.S. President said.    Commenting on the results of Clinton's consultative meeting  with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on intercontinental  ballistic missiles, the newspaper writes that "the meeting set  the beginning of a new stage in the Ukrainian-American relations  and opened up the door to new forms of cooperation in the sphere  of economy, politics and security. Ukraine's support for the  `partnership for peace' initiative gives a chance to it to start  more concrete cooperation with the NATO countries in the  military sphere and integrate more deeply in the European  structures."    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes about various aspects of  international security and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,  that were discussed at the meeting. According to Vyachselav  Kostiov, press secretary of the Russian president, the sides  expressed the opinion that nothing is possible in the world  without Russia and the United States. It follows from that  statement that "Russia has retained the status of a great power,  and not only a nuclear power, and the west, in the person of  Clinton, recognised it without hesitation."    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA writes on the same subject that "the  consolidation of Russia's greatness should be the main objective  of the economic and socio-political reform, now under way in  Russia". This objective is easier to attain by acting jointly  with other countries, and close Russian-American cooperation,  built on the principles of partnership, equality and mutual  benefit, would play an important role in it. So far as European  security is concerned, which was also discussed during the  talks, previously the problem consisted in bringing down the  level of military rivalry and preventing a nuclear catastrophe,  while now the point at issue is joint, coordinated efforts,  aimed at maintaining world stability, the newspaper writes.    Commenting on the meeting of the Russian and U.S.  presidents,  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI quotes the words of Viktor Glukhikh, chairman  of the State Committee for the Defence Industries of the Russian  Federation, who said that "the trend of passing over from open  technological rivalry to technological partnership has become  clear." He said that 108 joint project on a wide range of  scientific and technological problems are now being implemented.    Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov described  the  results of the talks as the opening up of a new stage in  Russian-American partnership, while "humanitarian assistance  will be replaced by a package of measures, aimed at the revival  of the Russian economy," IZVESTIYA writes.    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA and PRAVDA writes briefly about the most  important moments of the first and second rounds of the  Russian-American summit talks.    So far as the second important topic is concerned --meetings  of the two chambers of the new Russian parliament -- the  newspapers focus their attention on the election of Vladimir  Shumeyko to the post of chairman of the Federation Council.  According to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, the 98 votes that he got  "reflect with mathematical accuracy the official position of the  senators: 65 of them are heads of local administration of  subjects of the Russian Federation, 11 are staff members of the  president's administration, 15 are staff members of the  administration of the government and another 15 are regional  officials of a lower level." Only two people who voted for  Shumeyko do not belong to this administrative team, the  newspaper points out. According to the author of the article,  if the new chairman really wants the Federation Council to be an  efficient body, he should offer posts of deputy chairmen to  representatives of the opposition. "Actually, he is facing the  dilemma: either obedient deputy chairman along with the obedient  Federation Council, or vice versa," the newspaper points out.    According to IZVESTIYA, the election of Shumeyko to the new  post means that the president and the prime minister got whom  they wanted on the post of chairman of the Federation Council,  and the senators, who depend on the executie authorities, got  the chairman whom the president and the prime minister wanted.  Commenting on that fact, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI writes that members  of the Federation Council can hardly be suspected of "too warm  feelings for Shumeyko." They voted for him, because,  irrespective of all his defects, he is "the president's man" and  can help maintain cooperation with the Moscow power structures.    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA described the lower chamber of the new  parliament, the State Duma, as a rather ornamental institution,  deprived of any real power, while IZVESTIYA points to its  "chaotic" character, judging by the first days of its work.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an article by Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev, which deals with Russia's military  doctrine, its foreign and domestic policy. "The course of the  country's foreign policy and security is set by the president of  the Russian Federation. This fact, recorded in the new  democratic constitution, reliably protects it from the influence  of national-extremism. Basically, the course remained unchanged:  it is aimed at the development of partner-like, good neighbourly  relations with the rest of the world and continues to be open  and predictable," Kozyrev wrote. "The military doctrine of the  Russian Federation, approved by the Russian president early in  November, is also a guarantee of stability and consistent  character of the country's domestic and foreign policy.  Together with the conceptual framework for foreign policy, it  will be included in the conceptual framework for security, which  is being drafted now," he pointed out.</p>

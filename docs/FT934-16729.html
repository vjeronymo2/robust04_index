			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Evidence of Bundesbank role inconclusive Sir, Your article on Hans Tietmeyer ('Changeover at the Bundesbank', October 1) is accompanied by a chronology of the Bundesbank which records several public disputes between government and bank. Since the Bundesbank usually won, it might give the impression that central bank independence is part of the story of the long period of west German economic success. However this evidence would not be conclusive even if the bank had been right on every issue. In an environment where decisions are taken by the bank, politicians can take the opportunity to criticise policy without having to be responsible for changing it. That does not mean that they would change it if they could. This behaviour also occurs in the US where Congress, although it has no power over the Federal Reserve, often debates monetary policy. After a dispute in 1972, however, as you say, finance minister Karl Schiller resigned. He clearly wished to challenge the Bundesbank's policy, but what were the motives of the bank? More than one scholar of German policy has recorded the opinion that the Bundesbank deliberately picked a fight with Schiller because it found him uncongenial. Indeed, the bank adopted Schiller's policy once he had resigned. This kind of distortion both of economic policy and of the democratic process should not be counted a benefit of central bank independence. It should make us reject the idea forthwith.

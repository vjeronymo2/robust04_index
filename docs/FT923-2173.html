			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (4): A changing world - Foreign policy is in flux PAKISTAN, created to form a home for the Moslems of British India, has spent the following 45 years focused on preserving the integrity of its borders. Preoccupation with India to the east and Afghanistan to the north-west has been the driving force behind foreign policy. It has contributed to the sway held by the military in Pakistani politics. But it has also led Pakistan to bolster its security by seeking friends further afield. However, the collapse of the Soviet Union has opened up uncertainties for Pakistan as for many other countries. The struggle in Afghanistan helped Islamabad to forge close cooperation with the US to counter the Soviet presence. Washington is now much less interested in Afghanistan. It had also perceived Ms Benazir Bhutto, who cultivated close ties with the US, as a friend. Since her dismissal as prime minister in 1990, the US has been suspicious of Pakistan's tendencies towards Islamisation and has cut off new military and economic aid because of Pakistan's nuclear programme. Even more ominously for Islamabad, the US has recently been improving its relations with India, Pakistan's arch enemy. The reduced polarisation of world politics has also reduced the importance of bodies such as the Non-Aligned Movement, in which Pakistan has played a prominent role. But it has made no difference to its long friendship with China, with which it shares a mountainous border. As a sign of the continuing closeness, Pakistan's state airline is considering opening a new direct route to Shenzhen, the southern Chinese special economic zone. As a nation originally defined by Islam, Pakistan has developed quite close political and economic relationships in the Middle East - it has a western border with Iran. However, it has had to pursue a careful line in Middle East conflicts and also has to be conscious of tensions with its own Shiite minority. During the Gulf crisis, the interim government between those of Ms Bhutto and Mr Nawaz Sharif condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and swiftly sent troops to Saudi Arabia. As it embarks on a drive to modernise and open its economy, Pakistan is seeking a new identity and new friends. Mr Sharif, the prime minister, has seized upon the Soviet break-up as providing Pakistan with the opportunity for a new foreign policy thrust. He is aggressively seeking to boost trade and political relations with the new central Asian republics, with which it shares proximity though no borders. The new vision is of Pakistan providing the transport links and entrepots for the developing nations of central Asia, which have plenty of raw materials but poorly-developed industry and infrastructure. Mr Sharif has already visited several of the five republics, and also played host: the Uzbek president was his guest at Pakistan's Independence Day celebrations last month. It is an ambitious move, which might bring benefits to Pakistan. However, the new republics have plenty of competing suitors. A recent visitor to Uzbekistan found it full of Turkish businessmen. Some observers feel that the republics will prefer to throw in their lot with more European, secular states rather than one which is tending towards Islamisation. Meanwhile, China is also busy developing economic relations with the emerging republics, opening up its Xinjiang region along the lines of its southern coastal areas. And the republics still have important practical ties with Moscow. Moreover, Pakistan's success in forging central Asian links will largely depend on peace in Afghanistan, through which new roads north must pass. Pakistan viewed with dismay the violence in Kabul during August, in which at least 2,000 people died. Many in the government blamed the violence on the mujahedin leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, whom Pakistan had principally backed in the 13-year civil war. Some in Pakistan, however, sympathised with Mr Hekmatyar's wish to expel from the Afghan capital the Uzbek militia force, led by Gen Rashid Dostum, which has been supporting the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani. They felt that the government had not stood by its commitments to Mr Hekmatyar. Pakistan had helped to broker the April Peshawar accord between rival guerrilla groups and since violence erupted has been seeking to patch a new agreement between them. Though the Soviet threat has gone, Pakistan has several interests in a peaceful resolution in Afghanistan. It has been playing host to the guerrilla groups as well as to millions of Afghan refugees. It wants to stop rampant smuggling, including arms and drugs, over the border. It wants to establish the still unresolved line of the border. It wants above all to avoid a break-up of Afghanistan which could foment ethnic instability within Pakistan. And it wants a growth of trade. Pakistan's most obsessive foreign policy problem, however, remains India, with whom it is in a permanent state of near-war, with the risk of nuclear arms being deployed if hostilities broke out. As recently as 1990, movement of troops on both sides prompted the US to send an emissary urging restraint. Mr Shahid Javed Burki, a Pakistani who heads the World Bank's China desk, commented in a recent book*: 'India and Pakistan continued to coexist in an unstable environment in South Asia, with their leaders not beyond risking war for short-term political gains.' The biggest cause of dispute is Kashmir, the predominantly Moslem area claimed by both countries but mostly controlled by India, which has 400,000 troops deployed there to keep insurrection under control. It says Kashmir is a domestic Indian problem. Indian and Pakistani troops daily watch each other nervously across the 'line of control' which runs through Kashmir and there is frequent shooting. The most positive sign for some time came in August, when senior officials met in New Delhi and agreed that India and Pakistan should hold further talks on Kashmir - though there was no sign of either softening its entrenched position. Kashmiris appear unenthusiastic about being part of either India or Pakistan, and want a UN-sponsored plebiscite. Earlier this year, Kashmiri militants attempted to march across the line of control from the Pakistani side, but were turned back by Pakistani troops. Mr Amanullah Khan, leader of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front, comments bitterly: 'The only thing India and Pakistan agree on is opposition to the independence of the state of Kashmir.' * Pakistan: The Continuing Search for Nationhood, Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado.</p>

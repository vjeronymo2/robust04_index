			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] As you heard earlier in the bulletin, ceremonies  were held this morning, in the presence of President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, in Tehran's Hoseyniyeh-ye Ershad [prayer  center in northern Tehran] to mark the 15th anniversary of the  martyrdom of the eminent Professor Ayatollah Motahhari and in  commemoration of all teachers. Let me draw your attention to a  detailed report about the president's remarks in this ceremony.    President Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed that the issue of a  dynamic theology [ejtehad-e zendeh] and a correspondence  [entebaq] between Islam and the demands of the day, an issue  which was first raised by martyr Motahhari, is one of the most  fundamental bases and most important jurisprudential criteria  required in today's society.    According to our correspondent, the president explained: The  danger of ossification still threatens the Islamic revolution.  Thinkers and knowledgeable people have the duty to clarify  further for today's humanity the question of the balance  [tavazon] between rationality and the divine Shari'ah as the  basis of the reasoning underlying our revolution's progress.  This task requires courageous and strong thinkers who can  present pure Islam without fear.    The president added: Fatwas [religious edicts] and strong  jurisprudential [feqhi] principles based on the requirements of  the day are the object of concern of Islamic law-making. The  fact that the Islamic revolution has remained upright and strong  in the face of the most powerful enemies and is continuing its  eternal life is due to the firmness of its ideological pillars  and the correctness of its foundations and, consequently, to the  correspondence of its principles to the requirements of the time.    He said: The Islamic government has now given a good form to  our society and it has proven, by denying the idea of the  incompatability between the principles of Islamic jurisprudence  and the circumstances of the time and the advances made by  today's civilization, that it is one of the most successful  revolutions of the world.    In his remarks about the issue of the corresspondence  between  Islam and the requirements of the day, Mr. Rafsanjani stressed  the importance of distinguishing these requirements on the basis  of Islamic expertise and by qualified and knowledgeable people.

NATO is  eager to have member states on the border with Russia, to  strengthen the market potential of former Warsaw Pact states.  Russia, in its turn, is doing everything to prevent NATO  intrusion into East Europe because, in its viewpoint, this  military union represents a threat to Russia's geopolitical  interests.    Meanwhile, there are few officials in Russia who take into  consideration the viewpoint of East European states. Some of  them view NATO as a guarantor of their national security  (Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary). Those states which are  closer to Russia made attempts to create something akin to a  third Europe. The existence of the Republic of Poland is an  historic example of such a political structure in Europe. In  the 18th century, this type of state did not meet the  expectations of its population because it could not withstand  the expansion of East and West, and was divided by them  according to their spheres of influence. Lack of economic  initiative, political anarchy, and Poland's eagerness to become  rich at the expense of Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine were the  reasons for the collapse of the Republic.    The establishment a Central European market stretching from  the Baltic to the Black Sea is, simply put, highly unlikely due  to the fact that both Russia and Germany will oppose this idea.  Furthermore, the existence of this structure will mean the  division of Europe into three military-economic blocks and the  breaking up of the existing market relations. In my mind, the  NATO proposal on the participation of East European states in  the European integration process seems more likely. Following  such a course, these states could secure access to Western  capital and technology.    In Belarus, the last variant of the development of events in  Europe is not supported at all. The opposition, represented  primarily by the Belarusian Popular Front, is striving to  implement its idea of setting up a Baltic-Black Sea Association,  a kind of politically neutral buffer zone between NATO and  Russia. This military-political draft project has an historic  background. The Belarusian nomenclature, as represented by the  Kebich government, is striving to establish a close union with  Russia based on a joint monetary system. In fact, in Belarus,  we are witnessing a struggle being launched in the financial  sector. Currently, two monetary units -- the dollar and ruble  -- are reigning supreme in the Belarusian market. Dollars  symbolize Western trends, while rubles -- the Russian  tendencies. Our Belarusian "hares" [nickname for Belarusian  currency notes] are struggling for independence under conditions  that are extremely unfavorable for the existence of capital and  is gradually losing the game because the capital is located  somewhere else, not in Belarus.    The latest events in the Supreme Soviet have shown that even  though Vyacheslav Kebich defeated the opposition, he could not  beat the dollar. Belarus is likely to introduce its own  national currency and enter the world market with its normal  criteria of business relations. I regret that this idea is not  supported by a political force, which could explain why Belarus  is not going to use its neutral position for the division of  Europe. The neutrality was imposed on the Republic by its  specific geopolitical location. A similar notion of neutrality  was used by Austria when it found itself between two Europes  (the socialist and the capitalist one). Finland has also used a  similar tactic. It is clear that the leaders of these countries  understood quite well that the principle of regional security  has not lost its significance in the 20th century. NATO cannot  be dissolved because it guards the interests of democratic  states. It is evident that these states require protection  because the totalitarian regime of the former USSR has not yet  passed away. This totalitarian system is manifested in the  aggressive Islamic fundamentalism and Asian communism (North  Korea). It is also manifested in local nationalist tendencies  (Germany, Russia). Therefore, totalitarianism is both a state  of mind and a military-political strategy. Russia could find a  partner in NATO for waging harsh fights against Eastern  totalitarianism, especially in Tajikistan. However, the Russian  military is against this union. The egoism of a neighboring  superpower will force Belarus to either give up or find its own  path to a civilized world.    The acting Supreme Soviet is unable to resolve this issue  because its majority adopts only those decisions which protect  their interests. The Supreme Soviet opposition faction is too  weak. Nevertheless, the political and economic processes  continue to develop. In my opinion, the dollar will win the  battle.    For Moscow officials and the Belarusian Supreme Soviet  majority, it is a usual thing that local provincial interests  are being settled in Moscow. Therefore, V. Kebich and S.  Shushkevich are continually visiting Moscow. Meanwhile, Moscow  is uttering threats against disobedient Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and  Uzbekistan because they cannot stem the flow of Russians from  their territories.</p>

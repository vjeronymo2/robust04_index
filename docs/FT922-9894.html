			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Arts: Manchester International cello festival Manchester's most recent festival was ambitiously devoted to Expressionism in all its forms. Of somewhat narrower focus, the city's latest festival at the Royal Northern College of Music, took a good hard look at the cello, cello- and bow-making, and just about every aspect of cello performance. Concerts, master-classes, workshops and competitions were crammed into the four days of this the third (biennial) celebration, attended by conservatory students from home and abroad, and featuring the services of 20 distinguished artist-professors of nine nationalities. An intriguing, long programme on Sunday  - a gala in aid of the Jacqueline du Pre Memorial Fund (the festival as a whole is dedicated to the memory of the great paraplegic virtuoso Pierre Fournier)  - afforded the complete cello and piano music of Schumann, Mendelssohn and Brahms. The opening concert on Thursday night was less comprehensive, but managed to fit in no less than three concertos, an Elegy (Faure's Op. 24) and Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations. The BBC Philharmonic was conducted by Raymond Leppard, the sponsor was violin dealer Peter Biddulph, and there were seven soloists. Two of them  - Ralph Kirshbaum, founder-director of the festival and a professor at the RNCM  - and Gregor Horsch (first winner of the festival's Fournier Award)  - came together in the world premiere of the 46-year-old Dutch composer Tristan Keuris's double concerto, commissioned for the occasion by the BBC. This proved an enjoyable piece of writing, in the conventional three movements played without a break (lasting about 21 minutes), warmly or, as the composer indicated, autumnally romantic in feeling without any over-indulgence of the solo instruments' traditional capacities. Clearly Keuris is a thoroughly professional, fastidious composer whose notes would tell no matter how abstractly he might choose to deploy them. Though customarily athematic (as he informs us), his music on this occasion ventures into melody, and succeeds most strikingly with it in the tautly poised oboe part at the beginning of the lento movement. But these keenly eloquent duettists were able to invest numerous passages, however fleeting, in the outer movements (the first a constant doubling and halving of tempo, the third a scherzo) with glowing melodic impulse. The scoring is for a sizeable orchestra but with horns alone of the brass section and no bassoons, omissions meant to promote the soloists. Oddly enough it was the retention of a bassoon in the Vivaldi G minor concerto for two cellos and strings with which the concert began (Wolfgang Boettcher and Thomas Demenga) that gave the music its distinctive savour. The German, Boris Pergamenschikow, was a marvellously passionate soloist in the Schumann concerto: in the smallish hall his playing had the immediacy of speech itself. The Finn, Arto Noras, concluded the evening with a very classy account of the Tchaikovsky.</p>

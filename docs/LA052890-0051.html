			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 20 CHALLENGERS PAY $25,000 TO ENTER COMPETITION FOR '92 AMERICA'S CUP  </P> <P> A record 20 challengers from 15 nations -- including newcomers Japan, Germany  and the Soviet Union -- met the deadline for entering competition for the  America's Cup at San Diego in the spring of 1992.  </P> <P> Midnight Saturday was the deadline for submitting non-refundable challenge fees  of $25,000.  </P> <P> A 21st potential challenger, the Leningrad Yacht Club of the Soviet Union,  asked for a 14-day extension of payment, likely to be granted.  </P> <P> Another Soviet team, the Odessa Arcadia Yacht Racing Club, sent its money, as  did Deutscher America's Cup Verein -- originally representing West Germany, but  now requesting to be known under the unified designation of Germany.  </P> <P> Australian businessman Alan Bond, who won the Cup in 1983, filed an entry  through the Royal Perth Yacht Club, but his recent financial reversals left his  ultimate participation questionable.  </P> <P> The San Diego Yacht Club also will conduct trials to select an American  defender. Syndicates headed by Peter Isler, Larry Klein and Dennis Conner of  San Diego and Buddy Melges of Wisconsin have indicated they will compete. RICH  ROBERTS  </P></p>

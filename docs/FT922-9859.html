			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Opel to cut about 6,000 jobs OPEL, the German subsidiary of General Motors of the US, plans to cut the production workforce at its main plant by around a third over the next five years in order to combat high costs and remain competitive. GM said that it could now assemble some of its cars more cheaply in the UK than in Germany. Opel said it intended to reduce the 18,000-strong car production workforce in Russelsheim near Frankfurt by some 6,000 people. The cuts of 1,200 a year would be achieved without redundancies, Mr Louis Hughes, the chief executive, said. Opel, highly profitable in recent years, is the latest German producer to announce job cuts. Its main domestic rival, Volkswagen, has planned reductions of 12,500 people over the same period. Mercedes-Benz is considering reductions of 20,000 people in the next few years. BMW is shedding around 3,000 people in 1992. Opel said its mid-range Opel Vectra model cost DM750 (Pounds 260) more to produce in Russelsheim than in the UK, where it is also assembled at GM's Vauxhall assembly plant at Luton, Bedfordshire. (The car is sold as the Opel Vectra in continental Europe and as the Vauxhall Cavalier in the UK). Opel said that compared with a comparable model from Japan, the cost of the German-produced Opel Vectra was DM2,500 higher, though the Japanese figure included total production costs against assembly costs only for the German plants.</p>

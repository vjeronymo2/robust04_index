			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Iberia goes ahead with Dollars 500m injection for Argentine airline Iberia, Spain's national airline, said it would go ahead with a controversial Dollars 500m capital injection for the troubled Aerolneas Argentinas. However, Iberia, which operates and holds 30 per cent of Argentina's privatised flag-carrier, failed to convince the Argentine government, which still owns 33 per cent of the company, to contribute. Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, has said the government would not put any more money into Aerolneas after being forced to take back 28 per cent of the company in 1992 to prevent its collapse. Aerolneas lost Dollars 230m last year and revenues fell 14 per cent to Dollars 795.1m. Officials blame much of its problems on Iberia's poor management, and say its difficulties will not be overcome by injecting more money. Spanish and Argentine banks with close business relationships with Iberia hold 23 per cent of Aerolneas and have agreed to participate in the capital increase. However, one of these banks is the troubled Banesto with a 7.5 per cent stake. The capital-raising exercise will have to involve more local investors because Argentines must own a majority of Aerolneas for it to retain flag-carrier status. The airline says the employees' share ownership scheme, which holds 10 per cent of Aerolneas, and the pilots' union have offered to join in. Mr Juan Saez, Iberia executive vice-president, has warned that unless Aerolneas receives fresh capital it would soon face collapse. However, he said last week Iberia would be willing to sell its stake for Dollars 500m, which was roughly what it paid for its share in the company at its privatisation in 1990.</p>

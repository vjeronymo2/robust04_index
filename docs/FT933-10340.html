			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Repo rate is cut THERE were slightly greater expectations of cuts in German interest rates yesterday after the Bundesbank set a fixed rate repo at 6.80 per cent, only 5 basis points above the discount rate floor, writes James Blitz. The German decision to reduce the repo rate from 6.95 per cent to 6.80 per cent is part of its attempt to regain control of German money markets after the huge intervention in support of the French franc in recent days. That intervention may have pushed about DM60bn into the financial system, and the cost of call money consequently fell substantially to about 6.44 per cent yesterday. Dealers said the Bundesbank had to cut the repo rate because, with call money on offer in the interbank market at these very low levels, few banks would have been attracted to borrow funds from the central bank today at the old price. The repo rate reduction leaves a gap of only 5 basis points between the repo rate and the Bundesbank's interest rate floor, so there is little more room for manoeuvre here unless there is another interest rate cut. But dealers expect the Bundesbank to drain funds from the money market in today's weekly operation. Dealers anticipate that the Bundesbank will withdraw anything from DM20bn to DM30bn in this week's repo operation. The cut in the repo rate led Euromark futures dealers to get a little more bullish about rate cuts. The September contract was up 8 basis points on the day at 93.47. However, in spite of the unravelling of the exchange rate mechanism over the weekend, expectations of interest rate cuts in France and other European countries were slightly dashed. France has still not lowered its intervention rate and the September Pibor contract was down 15 basis points yesterday, closing at 93.94. Sterling interest rate futures were softer, partly in the wake of a good figure for M0 money supply, which was up by a greater amount than expected. The September contract was down 5 basis points to a close of 94.33. Three-month sterling cash was unchanged at 5 13/16 per cent yesterday. But rate cut speculation made the removal of a Pounds 1.2bn shortage difficult. The overnight rate was up at 13 per cent at one stage, with Pounds 675m of late assistance.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE OFFICIALS CONTINUE AERIAL SPRAYING AGAINST PESKY MEDFLY  </P> <P> It is very interesting that the decision to resume the Malathion spraying was  announced the day after a bill that had passed the Assembly didn't get the  two-thirds majority required to pass in the Senate (Part A, May 4).  </P> <P> This bill by Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) would have allowed citizens injured by  the spraying the right to sue the manufacturers and suppliers of malathion and  the government entities which authorized the spraying.  </P> <P> It is also interesting to note that our government is spraying a large urban  population with a toxic chemical repeatedly while the country that we want to  buy our fruit has outlawed aerial spraying of malathion because of permanent  irreversible optic nerve damage found among children in a sprayed area in that  country.  </P> <P> And the California taxpayer picks up the tab!  </P> <P> JUDD B.

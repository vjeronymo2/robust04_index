The answer is Janusz Bryczkowski, a businessman and founder of  the "Self-Defense" national front. Formerly a "green," later a  supporter of the extremist farmers' party, he now works with the  Communists in the patriotic association "Grunwald."    "I am on very good terms with Zhirinovskiy," Bryczkowski  stated. "I shall do everything to make him a friend of Poland.  I am sure that he is a future leader [vozhd] of Russia."    "Why is this leader of the brownshirts being allowed in  here?" the Poles ask anxiously. "After all, other countries  which he has not threatened as overtly as Poland have refused  him a visa or have promptly booted him out: Germany, Bulgaria,  France, Australia...." But a Russian citizen does not ned a  visa to enter Poland.    "If Zhirinovskiy has the correctly completed documents,  there  are no formal obstacles to his entry into Poland," Foreign  Minister Andrzej Olechowski noted.    Admittedly there is a secret list of people whose presence  in  Poland is considered undesirable. That list is based on  information from the Prosecutor's Office, the Foreign Ministry,  Interpol, the police, and the Border Guard Forces. Zhirinovskiy  is not on that list. However, even though the leader of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] has given an assurance  that he loves Poland and has even promised to return Lvov to the  Poles, he may be expelled from the country if he commits a  provocative act. For example, were he to make the kind of  attacks here that he made in Bulgaria against President Zhelyu  Zhelev, then under Polish law he would face the threat of  between six months and eight years in jail.    No serious Polish politician, from the president to the  ministers and deputies, intends sitting at the same table with  Zhirinovskiy. Closing the border to him means giving a clear  signal to his Russian followers that they are marching to  nowhere.    Aleksander Hall, leader of the Conservative Party, has said  that there should be no fuss created around this figure, that he  should not be given free publicity, and that his scandalous  comments should not be carried in the press.    "More stable countries which are better versed in the  subtleties of democracy have treated him as nothing more or less  than a scoundrel," the newspaper ZYCIE WARSZAWY says to its  readers and colleagues. "Let us not be original, let us ignore  him too."    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will arrive in Warsaw on Sunday, 30  January.    "All Poland will meet me!" the LDPR leader has stated.    Zhirinovskiy will visit the Grunwald battlefield [scene of  1410 battle in which Poles defeated Teutonic knights] and the  country estate of his host, Janusz Bryczkowski.    "I would be a complete idiot if I did not receive the future  president of Russia at my home and drink vodka with him," the  latter stated.</p>

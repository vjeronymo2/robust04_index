			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Kate Adie's army I HAVE kept a low profile this week, mainly from a desire to avoid the luminous and exhausting presence of my executive assistant, Miss Lee. Kate Adie she is not, for which I am grateful. How I sympathise with the Libyans. But the Kate Adie tendency - shrill imperiousity, horrible vivacity, an overweening elegance - is fast gaining ground among the 14m women in Britain who happen to be over 40, including Miss Lee. Yesterday was especially difficult for it was the first day of May, and we all know what Kate Adie acolytes do on May 1 if they live in Notting Hill and are equipped, by genes or medical science, with all that terrible energy: they don their Jaeger gardening clothes and make copious notes from the Reader's Digest Gardening Year - a planner's guide to what needs doing when during the full revolting cycle of the modern gardening calendar. You would be surprised at the amount of work called for in a Notting Hill garden in May. Everything needs attention: lawns, roses, dahlias, chrysanthemums, irises, alpines, water plants and algae, heathers, hedges, fruit, herbs, patios, slugs. Yesterday, Miss Lee launched her annual campaign against slugs, aphids and caterpillars. Also next door's cat. She mixed several vats of poison and took down her flame-thrower. Before exiting to the garden, she looked in on me. 'Michael,' said Miss Lee. 'Apart from having your hair cut and cleaning your shoes and starting, however timidly, to do something about the state of the dining room windows, what is your game-plan today? Are you writing any words, dazzling us with any pensees?' I explained that my main task of the day was packing my suitcase for my drive to Cesky Krumlov, and rounding up all the books I was at present half-way through. 'You would be surprised,' I said, 'how many books I am at present half-way through. They include Elegance, by Helen Bullock. It is about women over 40 - how, at that age, they are sleek, chic and at their peak. 'It is riveting,' I continued. 'I now feel I can hold my own whenever the conversation at a dinner party, as it were, turns to blepharoplasty, mammoplasty, abdominoplasty or liposuction. I have discovered yoga and earth dancing; the role of riboflavin; the importance of homestyle, workstyle, lifestyle and skill development; the truth of the dictum 'Every woman has clothes but not every woman has something to wear', and why taking a lover is cheaper than psychoanalysis and healthier than gin when it comes, quote unquote, to beating marital mid-life blues.' Miss Lee was furious. 'Who gave you that book?' she demanded. 'The Books editor,' I said. 'He had no right to do so. Anyway, I thought people at the FT were supposed to write about the reverse yield gap and bankers' follies. Why are you permitted to write rude pieces about the Olympics or flit off to Nasa so as to describe the search for extraterrestrial intelligence?' 'Miss Lee,' I said. 'Most of my colleagues do write about the reverse yield gap or bankers' follies. Subjects like that are known as the core. But the editorial affairs of the paper are governed by polymaths, renaissance men, who have determined that the FT's full cosmography should include the occasional piece on extraterrestrial intelligence or sport or food or travel. 'These subjects are known as the froth. That is the technical term. I am a specialist in froth. And under certain improbable circumstances the froth could be held to include riboflavin and liposuction.' Miss Lee smouldered. 'If you're so cute,' she said, 'perhaps you ought to read Chapter 14 of Elegance,' on which note she gathered up her equipment and swept out to her slugs. I glanced at Chapter 14. It is entitled Menstyle. It's just what you'd expect. It includes a list of the 10 things about men that drive women barmy: unreliability, absenteeism, lying, irresponsibility, helplessness, stuffiness, dullness, laziness, cruelty, deafness. I did a quick check - Test Your Manliness With Marks Out Of 10, that sort of thing. My average score per category was 9.85. Pretty virile, huh? 'Miss Lee,' I shouted. But my cries were drowned by the roar of the flame-thrower. Elegance, by Helen Bullock, is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton on May 7, Pounds 16.99.</p>

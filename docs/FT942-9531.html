			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: User-friendly 'Flute' Three boys turn the pages of an enchanted book. As a glow starts to emanate from inside, the overture comes to an end, the lights dim and the show begins: The Magic Flute as fairy-tale is at least as valid an interpretation as any other. For the audiences that Opera North services on its touring around the country, a production of this favourite Mozart opera that combines a clear telling of the story with pantomime fun is likely to go down well. The company's new staging by Annabel Arden (best known for her work with Theatre de Complicite) is a modest effort in every sense, simple in concept, basic in design, but it allows a naive enjoyment of the opera. A full house at the second performance on Thursday clearly loved it. Among its simple pleasures are a comic dragon with a fiery red tongue to menace Tamino in the opening scene and an array of strange, multi-coloured, rubbery creatures that appear when he plays his flute, as if he has strayed into a kindergarten extension of Jurassic Park. The adult aspects of the story tend to get short shrift, although it was an amusing idea to have Sarastro's throne growing out of the tree of knowledge. Rae Smith was the designer, working (one imagines) on a shoe-string. There is little sense of the production team agonising at length over the moral implications of this complicated tale. By using the translation of the musical numbers by Jeremy Sams the company has ensured simply that the story comes across clearly and humorously, in extremely user-friendly English. The spoken dialogue has been newly translated by Arden, not to mention heavily cut: a relief, as it is stiffly delivered. Opera North is lucky to have William Burden back after his successful La Boheme as a personable Tamino, free from assuming any false princely airs, singing the tenor's music as though it has no difficulties to it at all. His pint-sized Pamina, Linda Kitchen, was less fortunate; her voice does not always take kindly to the broad, sustained, lyrical style. William Dazeley works hard to be cute as Papageno, too hard for my taste, though the audience thought otherwise. Eileen Hulse was a lightweight Queen of the Night without much regal authority. John Rath as Sarastro had trouble staying in tune. All of them were hustled along by Andrew Parrott in the pit. He does not necessarily race ahead where the music is fast, but almost nothing sounded relaxed, able to give the drama space in which to encourage contemplation, enhance understanding. Scenes such as Tamino's arrival at the Temple of Wisdom felt perfunctory. Although this Magic Flute is a minor addition to the sum of Mozart productions, it should win over first-time visitors to the opera: the cheers at the end sounded genuine.

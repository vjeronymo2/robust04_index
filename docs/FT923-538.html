			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Construction pay falls by up to 15% PAY and conditions in Britain's shrinking construction industry have worsened considerably since the spring. Starting salaries for some architects have been cut by up to 15 per cent since May, according to a recent study, Andrew Taylor writes. A separate survey shows that some of the largest firms of architects, consulting engineers and chartered surveyors cut staff by up to 30 per cent in the year to the end of June. The two surveys for Building Magazine show that construction companies in southern England have been worst hit by falling wages and job losses. Businesses that are replacing staff are doing so at much reduced salaries according to a study by Montrose Construction Services, a recruitment firm. The second study charts a big fall in white-collar employment by professional firms such as architects and consulting engineers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos has  stressed that the Greek positions on the issue of Skopje [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] are known and  established. The spokesman made the above statement on the  occasion of Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos's  interview with LA REPUBBLICA.    During that interview, Pangalos referred to the mutual  right,  or mutual demand as he later corrected it, by Greece and Skopje  for the term "Macedonia." In the same interview, Pangalos said  that Greece will lift the embargo against Skopje if Skopje  removes the Sun of Veryina [from its symbols] and makes a  clarifying declaration regarding the disputed articles of its  constitution.    In an interview on FLASH Radio [Athens-based private radio  station] this morning, Pangalos said that he was referring to a  mutual demand and not to a mutual right to the term "Macedonia."    On this issue, the government spokesman said: I think that  to search for very specific expressions or interpretations of  expressions, does not help the execution of our foreign affairs.</p>

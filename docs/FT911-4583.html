			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: Revenue paves way for curbs - Pensions THE Inland Revenue yesterday prepared the ground for the introduction of investment restrictions on all small self-administered pension schemes. Such schemes, much favoured by owner-managers of private businesses as a way of reinvesting funds into their businesses, have so far escaped the investment restrictions which are to be applied to other types of fund. The Revenue has indicated several other restrictions it intends to introduce. Loans from a pension scheme to a business will be limited to 25 per cent of the value of the fund in the first two years, and 50 per cent after that. Also, there will be an effective ban on investment in residential property. The bill also contains a provision to amend UK pension regulations to take account of the Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange ruling in the European Court last May, which forces schemes to adopt a common pension age for men and women. Revenue rules had allowed full pension benefits to women who retired between the ages of 55 and 70. In future, this will be limited to both women and men retiring between the ages of 60 and 75. This will have little effect in practice, since few occupational pension schemes recognise a retirement age for women below the age of 60.</p>

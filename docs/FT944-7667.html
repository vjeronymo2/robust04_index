			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Bank plan to sell Tapie's mansion Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French businessman and politician, could face the loss of his luxurious Paris house in the next few weeks as part of his legal battle with Credit Lyonnais. The embattled state-controlled bank said yesterday it intended to sell 'as quickly as possible' the assets controlled by Mr Tapie secured against its loans to him and his network of companies if it wins the latest of a series of court battles against him today. First to go is likely to be the Hotel de Cavoye, Mr Tapie's mansion in the fashionable seventh arrondissement, which some experts have valued at FFr100m-FFr160m (Pounds 12m-Pounds 19m). This may be followed rapidly by attempted sales of his shares, and the yacht Phocea in Marseilles. Also up for sale would be his collection of antique furniture and paintings, many of which he attempted to remove to secure hiding places earlier this year. The ability of Credit Lyonnais to sell the assets will depend on a judgment today in the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris, resulting from an appeal heard last month in which Mr Tapie argued that the bank must stick to the original terms of an agreement reached in March to repay his debts over five years. The bank says he failed to keep his side of the agreement, which included providing two independent expert valuations of his assets against which the repayments were to be secured. One estimate has put the total worth at FFr300m, against loans to him of about FFr1.2bn. Credit Lyonnais is under considerable pressure to act after widespread criticism of its losses, which reached FFr4.5bn in the first half of this year. Its loans to Mr Tapie were one of the principal issues raised by customers who took advantage of an open evening to voice their concerns. Mr Tapie is separately suing Credit Lyonnais over a claim that the bank is partly responsible for the management of the companies he controlled, and over a series of advertisements which included an unflattering cartoon of him. A court is also due to decide next month whether his companies are bankrupt and must be wound up.</p>

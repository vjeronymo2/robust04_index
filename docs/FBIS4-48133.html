			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpts] The past five days have seen some of the  fiercest fighting around the Rwandan capital, Kigali, as the RPF  [Rwandan Patriotic Front] forces press their military  initiatives on the city. Thousands of Kigali residents have  been trying to make their way out of the capital to safety. The  small UN force has been unable to broker a cease-fire between  the two sides and have found it difficult to carry out their  humanitarian work. There have been increasing calls for the  Security Council to rethink its policy on Rwanda and commit more  peacekeepers. Today, the UN commissioner for human rights, Jose  Ayala Lasso, arrived in Kigali and then set off for the RPF  headquarters in Buyumba, 65 km away, to meet the RPF leader Paul  Kagame. Our correspondent, Mark Doyle, accompanied him. He is  now back in Kigali, and on the line, Robin White asked him how  easy it was to get to Buyumba:    [Begin recording] [Doyle] It is only easy to travel up and  down if you are with the United Nations, essentially. The  rebels control most of the road from a point about 5 miles north  of Kigali. In between that point and Kigali itself I was told  that there are some government forces. Yes, you can go up and  down if you are with the United Nations. The United Nations'  neutrality is still basically respected, and along the way I can  see that most of the countryside was fairly empty. In fact,  most of the population are in displaced persons camps. [passage  omitted]    [White] Paul Kagame, what are his military intentions? Did  you ask him if he is trying to take Kigali now?    [Doyle] Yes, if you ask him now, if you say: How long will  it  take? he obviously doesn't tell you, but he always seems, he is  a rather urbane man, and he always seems very calm and even  perhaps serene, he, sort of, says that we are going to take  Kigali and then we are going to pursue our other military  objectives. Obviously, he doesn't say exactly what they are,  but clearly one of the main ones is to stop the massacres of  civilians.    [White] What did the United Nations want from him?    [Doyle] The United Nations have asked if he would accept an  increased force. Later on today, the UN Security Council in New  York is intending to vote on whether to increase the force. In  fact, Mister General Kagame said he accepted the idea of the  force to give humanitarian aid, but he thought it should only be  2,500 and he insisted it shouldn't be an intervention force, it  shouldn't, in any way get in the way of his military activities,  in other words.

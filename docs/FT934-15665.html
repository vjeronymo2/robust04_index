			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / South Korea calls secret dealers to account SOUTH KOREA is today bracing itself for the final deadline in a decree issued two months ago by President Kim Young-sam banning the tax dodge of using false names for financial transactions. The deadline on converting such accounts into the real name of their owners expires tomorrow, and any remaining could be confiscated. Some analysts expect the financial sector to be thrown into chaos by a massive last-minute withdrawal of funds from bank and stock accounts by large depositors - the so-called 'big hands' who dominate the money markets  -in an effort to hide their money from the tax collector. This could trigger a banking crisis and cause temporary defaults at some financial institutions, while sending the stock market into a dive. But officials discount such fears. 'There is no way they can withdraw their money without disclosing their true identity,' said Mr Lee Kyung-shik, deputy prime minister for economic affairs. He was referring to the requirement for all account holders to provide identification proving ownership of the assets when engaging in financial transactions. About 70 per cent of the Won300,000bn (Pounds 245bn) in financial accounts has been identified since the decree was issued, according to Mr Yong Soo-gil, a senior government adviser who planned the reform. The large unverified portion has led to speculation that hidden financial assets may amount to between Won30,000bn and Won75,000bn, or 10-25 per cent of all financial accounts. The government estimates that only Won3,200bn is being held under false-name accounts. But analysts argue that the problem is far larger because some account holders have borrowed the names of other people to hide their assets, which complicates the identification process. In an attempt to encourage hesitant account holders to report their assets, the government recently announced that owners of anonymous accounts could buy low-interest 10-year government bonds to avoid tax investigations and gift and inheritance taxes. But there has been little response so far. The government described the bond offer as one way to soak up money from the underground economy, which is estimated to equal 20 per cent of gross national product, and use it to revive economic growth. Mr Kim's administration has been criticised for pursuing the real-name system at the expense of the economy. The central bank last week predicted that economic growth could slow to 4 per cent this year, the lowest rate since 1980, as a result of the real-name system. The attack on the underground economy is disrupting growth because the hidden funds helped finance corporate investment and supported consumer spending. Small and medium businesses, for example, have depended on funding from the unofficial kerb market, which is largely financed by money held under false names. The crackdown has caused that market to collapse and threatened the survival of small businesses unable to acquire bank loans because they lack collateral. The government has provided Won1,000bn in emergency loans to the sector and claims it has averted a rise in bankruptcies. Mr Lee and other officials express confidence that the economy will recover next year as the nation adjusts to the new system. The stock market index fell by 8 per cent on the introduction of the real-name system, but has since recovered to its previous level. Some analysts even predict that share prices could rise sharply as false-name holders switch their funds to the stock market. Meanwhile, the authorities are taking strict measures to prevent the flight of capital abroad, including searching departing passengers at airports for large amounts of cash or bank drafts. Officials are also examining property deals to prevent the secret funds finding a new home in land speculation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Malawi's new President Bakili Muluzi and his United  Democratic Front, the UDF, have lost little time flexing their  muscles after ending the Malawi Congress Party, MCP's, 30 years  in power in last week's elections. Directors of state-owned  corporations have been sacked, most are seen as political  appointees sympathetic to ex-President Banda, but it looks like  there is going to be a delay before the election result can be  finalized. From Blantyre Rachel Rawlings reports:    There is a question mark over all five seats in Nsanje  District, which was said to have been owned by Dr. Banda's  Malawi Congress Party. The results in three will stand because  there has been no special complaint received by the electoral  commission, but the other two, which include that of MCP Vice  President Gwanda Chakwamba have been declared void. A number of  people including the powerful local chief Tengani, said to be a  close associate of Mr. Chakwamba, are being taken to court over  the matter.    Meanwhile, former President Banda has been given until the  end of the month to move out of Sanjika palace here in Blantyre.  It it rumored he will move into another house in Blantyre which  was also used as an official presidential residence, but is in  fact Dr. Banda's personal property. It is just one of a number  of large houses he owned personally, which the government paid  him to use as official residences. Civil servants here are  awaiting confirmation of their new bosses as President Muluzi  makes his ministerial appointments. A large framed picture of  Dr. Banda still hangs in the entrance to the building which  houses the office of the president and Cabinet. It was a  requirement to have his portrait in public places. Some shop  owners have taken the pictures down, but others still remain.</p>

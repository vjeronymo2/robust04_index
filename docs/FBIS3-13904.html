			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salih Qallab in Amman and unattributed report </F> from London: "Baghdad Planning Military Operation To Open Road  to Turkey"]    [Text] Amid conflicting reports and mounting speculation  about the nature of the action Baghdad is likely to take in  implementation of the threats made by senior Iraqi officials  promising unspecified action in retaliation for the renewal of  the economic sanctions against Iraq, diplomatic sources have  revealed that it will be a semi-military step in the direction  of the north and not the south.    The sources say that the Iraqis have for some time been  considering taking a "dramatic" step to open the land road  between the Iraqi border and the Turkish border, a major part of  which is controlled by Kurdish gunmen. That road is of  considerable strategic and economic importance to Iraq.    The sources revealed that the Iraqi Government had some time  ago raised this matter with the Turkish Government and that  Ankara was very enthusiastic about it on the following grounds:    1. Opening that road would lead to Turkish economic recovery  and would mean that Turkey would be the only or almost the only  state with access to the Iraqi markets. It is known that Turkey  and some other states neighboring Iraq are paid for their  exports to Iraqi markets in crude or refined oil for local  consumption.    2. Joint Iraqi-Turkish control of that road and border areas  in general would ease some of the military burdens resulting  from the presence of elements of the Kurdish Workers Party of  Turkey in that area.    The same sources speak of increasing Iraqi military activity  in recent days on the northern front and in the direction of the  road. They do not rule out a sudden and swift Iraqi military  action to open the road as quickly as possible and present the  Western alliance and the whole world with a fait accompli.    It is generally believed in this connection that Baghdad is  convinced that the atmosphere at the UN Security Council  following the positions taken by France, Russia, and China would  preclude military action against Iraq, particularly if the  action the latter threatened to take was only confined to  reopening the land road with Turkey.    More than one concerned party believes it to be unlikely  that  Iraq would go beyond this limited "tactical" step, and they also  believe that Baghdad is not about to take any military action in  the direction of the south on the border with Kuwait and that  the most it might do there is send a few hundred Iraqi peasants  back to the land taken from them under the amended border  demarcation and let them stay there as a form of open sit-in.    An Arab diplomat working in Baghdad, however, believes the  Iraqi people and the Iraqi Government no longer have any will to  fight and that President Saddam Husayn's mention of the  possibility of "retaliation" if the embargo continued was  misunderstood, did not imply any military threat, and was only a  call on the Iraqis to be patient and to rely on the time factor.</p>

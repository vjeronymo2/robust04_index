			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TYRO IN LAND OF THE TITANS;  </P> <P> MOVIES: BLUE-COLLAR FILM MAKER'S "ROGER &amp; ME," A SAGA OF GM LAYOFFS, HAS  CAPTURED HOLLYWOOD'S INTEREST.  </P> <P> Consider the case of Michael Moore, a rumpled 235-pound Flint, Mich., native  whose first directorial effort, "Roger &amp; Me," has catapulted him into the  limelight.  </P> <P> Three years in the making, this darkly humorous documentary about General  Motors layoffs in his hometown has emerged as the unlikely toast of the film  festivals -- setting attendance records at Telluride, voted "most popular" in  Toronto, eliciting a seven-minute standing ovation at the New York Film  Festival.  </P> <P> Five major studios have courted him. Agents are banging down his door. After  announcing a $2.5-million to $3-million distribution deal with Warner Bros. on  Monday, he flew out to work out the details. And, not so incidentally, to  ensure that he "goes Hollywood" on his terms.  </P> <P> Reality soon intervenes. It took years of personal fund-raising for Moore to  come up with the $260,000 that the film cost to make. He got $50,000 from  Tuesday-night Bingo games, $27,000 from the sale of his home, $5,000 from a  couple of yard sales, plus every dime he had, and he still had to borrow  $100,000. He arrived at the Registry Hotel in Universal City this week with  about $60 in his wallet. He was $60 short of the $150 the hotel required for  people without credit cards and he had to call the studio for help.  </P> <P> "The Warner driver passed me a (business) card and asked if he could cater my  next film," the 35-year-old director recalls. "I didn't tell him that my idea  of catering is driving through McDonald's as fast as I can, picking up a sack  of MacNuggets."  </P> <P> Moore's sardonic wit (which has led to comparisons with Garrison Keillor and  Andy Rooney) is central to the success of "Roger &amp; Me," which is scheduled  to open Dec. 22 in New York, Los Angeles and Toronto. Over footage of an ailing  Flint, the writer-producer-director describes deadpan-style his futile quest to  bring General Motors CEO Roger Smith to Flint for one day to observe the human  toll of his actions.  </P> <P> Following a "trail of three-martini lunches," we watch the defiantly  working-class Moore lumber into the venerable halls of the Grosse Pointe Yacht  Club, the Waldorf-Astoria, and GM corporate headquarters in Detroit. He turns  up large doses of Theater of the Absurd on the way: Ronald Reagan treating a  dozen unemployed workers to pizza, suggesting they move to Texas to find work;  a $100 million-plus Auto World designed to promote tourism to the beleaguered  town; society couples paying $100 apiece for a night in the newly constructed  jail -- with free fingerprinting and Breathalyzer test thrown in.  </P> <P> "He's a guy with an interesting way of looking at things, which I find very  refreshing," says Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, the  first major studio to fly the film maker out. "For someone right out of the  box, he shows tremendous promise."  </P> <P> "My film is much closer to 'Pee-wee's Great Adventure' than to 'Hotel  Terminus,' " says Moore. "It was made, after all, by someone who can't stand to  watch 'Nova,' a guy who'd rather see 'Lethal Weapon' than 'Wings of Desire.' "  </P> <P> Describing himself as "populist" rather than "left wing," Moore is a man on a  mission.  </P> <P> "Flint is a microcosm of what's going on in the country," he says. "Coming to  your town soon . . . and I don't mean the movie. 'Roger &amp; Me' is a small  attempt to get America to pay attention to the face behind the corporations, to  pull back the curtain -- just as they did in 'The Wizard of Oz.' "  </P> <P> General Motors claims Moore is giving the auto maker a bum rap.  </P> <P> "Mr. Moore showed up unannounced with his cameras rolling '60 Minutes'-style,"  says Jim Crellin, director of corporate media relations for the company. "If  he'd called or written asking for a formal interview, it would have ruined his  film. From what I've read, 'Roger &amp; Me' is less a documentary than a social  commentary, one individual's perspective. Mr. Moore certainly didn't stick to  the facts. If you go to Flint, you won't find a ghost town."  </P> <P> Moore has strong personal ties to Flint and to the company. His father toiled  on GM'S A.C. Spark Plug assembly line for 33 years. Uncle Laverne was one of  the original "sitdowners" whose 1937 strike led to the recognition of the  United Auto Workers.  </P> <P> Young Michael was political, too, memorizing Kennedy's inaugural address by the  age of 6 and waging a successful campaign for the school board during his  senior year of high school. In 1976, he founded the Flint Voice, which became  the Michigan Voice, an alternative newspaper that often monitored the auto  industry.  </P> <P> The idea for "Roger &amp; Me" surfaced in 1986, shortly after Moore was fired  as editor of Mother Jones, a progressive San Francisco-based monthly. Moore  clashed with the publisher over both cultural and political subjects and four  months after arriving there, he says, "they offered me a U-Haul home." (Moore  says sarcastically that he should have thanked Mother Jones in the film's  credits; he poured the $58,000 he got from his settlement with the magazine  into his movie.)  </P> <P> In Flint, GM's announcement of plant shutdowns put Moore's depression in  perspective. That night he came up with the narrative thread for his film and,  shortly thereafter, he called on the director of "The Atomic Cafe" -- a film  that took a sardonic view of the nuclear age -- to give him a one-week crash  course in film making.  </P> <P> It was Warner's "passion" for the film, says Moore, that made the difference.  While others wanted to lure him into three-picture deals, Warner executives  viewed the film as the star. "They promised to show it in Hayes, Kan.," Moore  says. "Just the attitude I was looking for. I want the film to reach not only  the art-house crowd but the working-class people who don't normally go to  movies . . . the people for whom this one was made."  </P> <P> Moore says he also likes Warner's clout as a buffer against potential GM  retaliation.  </P> <P> "The power structure is real uptight about this film and a smaller outfit might  not be able to take the heat," he says. "If this film becomes a hot potato, I  need my titan to go against their titan. The bigger the better to protect me  and this film."  </P> <P> Though General Motors denies any suggestion that it might interfere with the  release of the film, one member of the Warner contingent isn't so sure.  </P> <P> "If General Motors bitched, that would be the best thing that could happen to  us," says Joe Hyams, senior vice president of special projects for the studio.  "If you look at the movie, though, they're dumb enough to do just that. Smith's  advisers, I'm sure, told him to ignore this . . . but they're probably the same  people who told him not to worry about the Japanese."  </P> <P> So far, Moore says things are going well in his relationship with Warner. The  studio agreed to donate $25,000 to rent or buy housing for the four families  shown being evicted in the film and to oversee the distribution of 20,000 free  tickets (to be paid for out of Moore's advance) to unemployed auto workers  nationwide. The studio also guaranteed a minimum of $3 million in advertising  and prints to assure the director the movie won't be buried.  </P> <P> Moore will match the Warner contribution and channel 30% to 40% of his share of  the profits into a nonprofit foundation supporting other socially oriented  films.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] We open this newscast with the announcement of  the devaluation of the CFA franc by 50 percent. The decision to  devalue the CFA francs was reached at 2010 GMT, a devaluation of  50 percent which means that henceforth 1 French franc is equal  to 100 CFA francs with effect from 12 January which is less than  two hours from now. It should be noted that the  anti-devaluation front members, that is, those against  devaluation, fell with their arms in hand because they had  fought hard to gain the maximum out of the backup measures.  This front, represented by President Abdou Diouf, fought hard  for nearly 48 hours to get the maximum concessions.    From the beginning people were talking of 75, then 100  percent of devaluation. But we arrived at 50 percent. Here is  Cameroonian Finance Minister Antoine Ntsimi, who read the  official communique of heads of state and delegations of the  franc zone.    [Begin Ntsimi recording] By this measure, which should  contribute significantly to the competitiveness of member  states' economies and create conditions for the rapid  restoration of major domestic and external balances, the West  African Monetary Union [UMOA] and the Bank of Central African  States [BEAC] authorities aim at improving the living conditions  of our people; establishing a suitable climate for a sustained  and lasting growth; resolving the unemployment problem which is  currently hitting the most active force of our population;  reviving exports and returning of capital placed in foreign  banks; and the encouraging domestic savings. The implementation  of this new strategy of adjustment of our economies will benefit  from the financial support of the Bretton Woods institutions and  all countries that are our partners in development, especially  France. [end recording]    On his part, France also undertook to support members of the  franc zone by a series of backup measures such as the  cancellation of public debts for the poorest countries and  alleviating the debts for others. France will also help set up  a special fund for development for African countries. French  Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin made this pledge on behalf  of the French Government:    [Begin Roussin recording] Therefore, France will support  efforts aimed at any adjustment embarked upon. The French  Government will propose to its parliament immediate unilateral  measures to alleviate the debt of each country of the zone. For  the poorest countries, all the debt through development aid  still outstanding to France will be cancelled. The decision to  write off arrears owed to the French Development Fund will  enable the fund to resume its assistance in each of the franc  zone countries. France will contribute significantly to the  opening [words indistinct] funding of its partners, members of  the franc zone, within the context of a program which will be  concluded with the International Monetary Fund.

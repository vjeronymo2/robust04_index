			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAUSTIC CLOUD FORCES MORE THAN 200 TO EVACUATE HOMES IN CHINO  </P> <P> More than 200 Chino residents were evacuated from their homes and seven people  were briefly hospitalized for lung and eye irritation Saturday, after a caustic  cloud rose from an industrial complex where unidentified chemicals were being  mixed.  </P> <P> Those hospitalized, including five police officers, were treated and released.  </P> <P> Police said the white-colored cloud escaped as employees of General Chemical  Corp., 5568 Schaefer Ave., were combining a batch of chemicals. The employees  fled the building, then notified police and fire officials, said Sgt. Ron Zerr  of the Chino Police Department.  </P> <P> Because of unpredictable wind patterns, police evacuated all homes within a  quarter-mile radius of the plant. Zerr said residents of the upper-middle-class  San Bernardino County neighborhood about 35 miles east of Los Angeles remained  calm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Under Control'  </P> <P> "The situation was under control," he said. "There was no panic."  </P> <P> Residents were allowed back into their homes at 3:15 a.m., after environmental  health officials determined that the cloud was not poisonous.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Chino police could not say exactly what is manufactured at General  Chemical, although they did say that the plant mostly deals in acids and  solvents, not toxic compounds.  </P> <P> A man who answered the telephone at General Chemical refused to say anything  about the company, which was incorporated in 1973.  </P></p>

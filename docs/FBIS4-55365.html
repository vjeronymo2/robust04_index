			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prague, May 12 (CTK) -- The Assembly for the  Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) said today "it  must call on Vaclav Havel to immediately resign over the  international shame which he has caused by the choice of his  friends and collaboators for important posts" at the  Presidential Office (KPR).    In its statement given to CTK by a member of the  extreme-right SPR-RSC leadership, Josef Krejsa, the party said  that in connection with the report by the Supreme Inspection  Office (NKU) on the KPR's financial management it would also  "have to lodge with the NKU a complaint of (KPR head) Josef  Dobrovsky."    "The strange management of state property, probably  involving  bribes and unjustified payments, are the best proofs of the  character of not only Havel's collaborators, but of himself as  well," the statement says.    According to the NKU report, the KPR made last year  unsubstantiated payments amounting to 769,753 crowns (about  $25,500) from its budget. [passage omitted]</p>

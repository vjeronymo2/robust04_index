			<p>BFN     [Text] Britain protested strongly today over the detention  of up to 50 aid workers, including some Britons, in a  strife-torn region of Angola.    A Foreign Office spokesman said the relief workers had been  detained at Huambo, in the country's central highlands, since  Wednesday [15 June] by UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] rebels.    He was unable to say how many British charity workers were  being refused permission to leave the UNITA stronghold but said  there was no evidence that any had been harmed.    "We have registered our strong concern and protest to the  UNITA delegation in Lusaka," he added. "We view any restriction  on non-governmental organisation's freedom of movement very  seriously and would want UNITA's assurance that it would be  guaranteed."    Angola's state-run daily newspaper, JORNAL DE ANGOLA, said  UNITA had been holding 56 aid workers but "in unclear  circumstances."    But UNITA spokesman Jorges Valentim, quoted by Reuter in the  Zambian capital, Lusaka, denied any involvement and said  continued bombardments in the Huambo area had left people  stranded.    He said Aranda da Silva, head of the United nations  humanitarian unit in Angola, had travelled to Huambo with eight  other aid workers on Wednesday without telling UNITA leaders.    Valentim said they had run into "complications" which led to  the eight aid workers being left behind along with others who  had been due to be picked up at Huambo.    The Foreign Office said the workers were employed on  humanitarian relief missions in the area and the Government was  hoping for a swift response from UNITA.    Reuter quoted aid director Philippe Borel, in Angola, as  saying: "The situation is extremely, extremely tense, confusing  and difficult."</p>

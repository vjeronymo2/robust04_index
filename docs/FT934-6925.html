			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Australia press inquiry hint Opposition parties yesterday hinted they might set up a Senate inquiry into foreign ownership of Australia's press in light of the controversy over dealings between the Keating government and media baron Mr Conrad Black. Ms Cheryl Kernot, leader of the minority Australian Democrats party, said the 'whole process' of determining foreign ownership rules in the media should be examined. Mr Richard Alston, the opposition's communications spokesman, said an inquiry was being 'seriously' considered. The concerns centre on a decision by the Keating cabinet to allow Mr Black to raise his holding in newspaper publisher John Fairfax from 15 to 25 per cent. The issue resurfaced after disclosures that Premier Paul Keating demanded 'more balanced' reporting in Fairfax-owned newspapers as a condition to considering any increase in Mr Black's then stake.</p>

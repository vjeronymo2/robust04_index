			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESSES EVACUATED AFTER AMMONIA LEAK  </P> <P> An ammonia leak at a La Habra grocery warehouse Sunday night sent a cloud of  noxious fumes drifting about half a mile over the area, prompting the  evacuation of a supermarket and some nearby businesses.  </P> <P> The leak was reported at 7:33 p.m. in an Alpha Beta warehouse at 1111 S. Harbor  Blvd. A Lucky supermarket, two restaurants and a gas station, all situated  across the street and downwind of the leak and all in Fullerton, were  evacuated.  </P> <P> In addition, the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Imperial Highway was  closed. Authorities for a time were considering further evacuations as easterly  winds carried the ammonia cloud toward Brea.  </P> <P> The emergency ended when the cloud dissipated and the ammonia finally stopped  leaking about 9:25 p.m., La Habra Police Capt. John Rees said. The leak was  traced to a refrigeration unit in the warehouse, but its cause was not  immediately known.  </P> <P> Although no injuries were reported, some of the estimated 100 shoppers  evacuated from the Lucky supermarket reported suffering headaches and burning  throats. The store, normally open 24 hours, was ordered evacuated about 8:20  p.m. by Fullerton police.  </P> <P> "You could smell it inside the store," Lucky stock clerk Pat Taylor said. "It  was getting worse and worse."  </P> <P> Also evacuated were Black Angus and El Torito restaurants and a Chevron  station. About 8:30 p.m., a frantic attendant at the station said: "I see an  emergency. They said we have to close down."  </P> <P> Even businesses not ordered evacuated were affected by the leak. "It was  horrible," Alicia Campos, assistant manager of the El Pollo Loco restaurant at  the south end of the Lucky shopping center, said of the odor.  </P> <P> Fire officials, she said, told her the restaurant could remain open "as long as  we stay indoors." But the point was moot, she said; firefighters had closed off  the streets, and there were no customers in the restaurant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1st Reported as Smoke  </P> <P> The leak, first reported as smoke, was reported coming from the Alpha Beta  building. La Habra Patrolman Michael Mitchell, one of the first on the scene,  said he knew right away that it was not smoke.  </P> <P> "You could smell" the ammonia "as soon as you came around the corner," Mitchell  said. "The longer you breathe it, the worse it is. Once you smell it, you  remember it for life."  </P> <P> Ammonia is a colorless, pungent gas that is toxic if inhaled and that, in small  quantities, causes eye and respiratory irritation. It can be fatal in large  concentrations.  </P> <P> La Habra authorities quickly called for assistance from fire and police  departments in Fullerton and Brea, since the wind was carrying the ammonia  cloud toward those cities. They also summoned the Anaheim Fire Department,  which dispatched its Hazardous Materials Unit to the scene, an action covered  under a contract with the city of La Habra that was renegotiated just last  Wednesday.  </P> <P> According to La Habra firefighter Andrew Munoz, fire officials concentrated on  dissipating the ammonia fumes with water while the hazardous materials  investigators worked to stop the leak. To stop it, they first shut down all  power to the building, then sent an Alpha Beta repairman inside to ascertain  its source.  </P> <P> The leak finally stopped of its own accord, however, when the source of ammonia  simply ran out, Rees said.  </P> <P> As the fire crews worked, police manned the roadblocks that had been set up  about half a mile in each direction from the Harbor-Imperial intersection.  </P> <P> David Burke ontributed to this story.  </P></p>

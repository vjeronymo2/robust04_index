			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Lucas Victory: A Canadian judge has ruled in favor of George Lucas in a lawsuit  over the film "Return of the Jedi," saying the filmmaker and creator of the  "Star Wars" trilogy did not infringe upon the copyright of a script by a  Canadian writer. The ruling, made Friday, comes after five years of litigation  over the origin of the Ewok characters that appeared in "The Return of the  Jedi," the third film in the trilogy. Canadian Federal Court Judge W. Andrew  MacKay ruled against plaintiff Dean Preston, who charged that Lucas had  appropriated the fuzzy animal-like characters from his script "Space Pets,"  which he submitted to 20th Century Fox in 1978.

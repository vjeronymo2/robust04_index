			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bundesbank hopes spur equity gains INTEREST rate optimism, focused on tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank policy council, drove the UK stock market ahead by nearly 36 points on the FT-SE 100 scale yesterday as investors hastened to buy stock in a securities sector suddenly devoid of sellers. The FT-SE 100 Index closed at 2,879.4, up a net 35.2, and the September futures contract on the index came within a few points of the 2,900 area, regarded as the higher end of the current trading range. New peaks on Wall Street also encouraged UK equities in their recovery from the weakness of the past fortnight. Equity strategists took the view that the Bundesbank will tomorrow make some move in the direction of lower rates. German inflation data, announced yesterday, were thought unlikely to block a rate cut, although there was some doubt over which of its key rates the German central bank would choose to change. On the domestic front, a report from the Confederation of British Industry warned that export difficulties might limit growth but the UK Treasury stressed the signs of economic recovery. The likelihood that the UK government will suffer badly at tomorrow's by-election in Christchurch, Dorset, appeared to have been well discounted in the stock market. The corporate scene featured the announcement of plans by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, to demerge its Royal Doulton fine china division and to sell, by public offering in New York, a majority interest in Camco, the oilfield equipment and services division. With Reuters, the global news and information group, planning a Pounds 350m share buyback, investors were examining other blue chip companies which might make similar moves to unlock shareholder value. The Footsie is now within 3 per cent of its all-time high of 2,957.3, reached on March 8, but strategists sounded unconvinced yesterday that this week's sharp rise in share prices is more than a technical recovery from a period of weakness. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, the broader-ranging market measure, was also in good form yesterday, gaining 23.5 at 3,238.7, within 3 points of its all-time peak. Trading volume rose sharply, boosted by heavy turnover in Pearson shares, as well as by strong demand for many Wall Street-orientated stocks, including oils and pharmaceuticals. Seaq volume jumped to 662.6m shares from the 483.6m of the previous session. Monday's Seaq turnover reflected retail business of only Pounds 900.2m, the first time that genuine customer business has fallen below Pounds 1bn on any full trading session for many months. Traders stressed that stock positions were tight yesterday and that share prices were forced higher by a general unwillingness to sell. The sudden reversal of market fortunes caught marketmakers in many leading sectors unawares. Shares in the banking and pharmaceutical sectors could hardly be bought yesterday at prices some 3 per cent above levels at which they had been languishing barely 36 hours earlier. Upward pressures on the blue chip internationals increased in late trading when Wall Street moved to a fresh peak early in its new trading session, adding nearly 9 Dow points in UK trading hours.</p>

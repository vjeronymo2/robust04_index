			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / US warplanes fire at Iraqi radar IRAQ said it remained committed to a ceasefire ordered by President Saddam Hussein earlier this week in spite of yesterday's incident in which US warplanes fired on an Iraqi radar and missile site. In Baghdad the foreign ministry said it was 'committed to the ceasefire' declared on Tuesday as a goodwill gesture towards the newly installed US President Bill Clinton, while in New York Mr Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's UN envoy, simply called the attack 'unfortunate'. 'From Iraq's point of view there is no change on the status of the ceasefire. It still stands,' Mr Hamdoon said. Yesterday's incident was apparently triggered when an Iraqi radar near Mosul, in northern Iraq, 'illuminated' a French Mirage jet on reconnaissance over the northern no-fly zone. A US F-4G Wild Weasel escorting the French aircraft then fired a radar-seeking missile at the Iraqi installation and an F-16 Fighting Falcon dropped cluster bombs. Iraq denied that an Iraqi missile battery had locked onto an Allied warplane. Some US officials and diplomats in Washington were surprised by the incident, which seemed to run counter to a feeling in the west and at the UN that Iraq was being more co-operative, and that the military escalation of the last week could be reversed. However after the incident the new US president made it clear he would continue US policy of taking a tough line with Baghdad. 'We are going to adhere to our policy. We're going to stay with our policy. It is an American policy,' Mr Clinton said. Mr Warren Christopher, the new secretary of state, said the administration was determined to ensure Iraq obeyed UN agreements that ended the 1991 Gulf war. General Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, underlined the point when he said there had been a 'seamless web' between the outgoing President George Bush and the new President Clinton, adding that any foreign leader who might think the new president was untested was 'very much mistaken.' US officials said the rules of engagement for coalition aircraft patrolling the two air exclusion zones over northern and southern Iraq remained unchanged under the new US administration: aircraft may fire only in the event of threatening Iraqi action, which includes 'illumination' by air defence radar. 'When their radar illuminates our pilots, we are going to protect our pilots,' Mr Christopher said. A planeload of UN arms inspectors landed in Baghdad yesterday and the UN said it did not believe the US attack would affect plans to send five more planeloads and their equipment today and tomorrow. Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN inspection operation said about 70 weapons inspectors would arrive in Iraq on a semi-permanent basis over a period of three days. Mr Paul Brough, head of the 25 member chemical weapons destruction team, said the immediate project was to complete the destruction of chemical weapons and agents consolidated at the Muthana plant south-west of Baghdad.</p>

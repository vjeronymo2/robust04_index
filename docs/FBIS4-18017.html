			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Fazil Aleskeroglu: "Unity of Outlook and </F> Positions Needed"]    [Text] The meeting between Minister of Foreign Affairs  Hasan Hasanov with the new U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan, Mr.  Richard Dale Kozlaric, lasted more than two hours.  Unfortunately, to journalists' questions the ambassador gave  only one reply--that all aspects of Azerbaijani-American  relations have been discussed meticulously and in detail and a  mutual understanding has been reached that...in order to achieve  complete clarity, many additional meetings will be needed, which  will indeed be held. He added that he would refrain from  answering other questions until he presents his credentials to  the head of the republic.    So it was the minister who ended up answering many  questions.  First and foremost, he appraised highly the fact of appointment  of Mr. Kozlarich as the U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan. The head  of the foreign policy department emphasized that this  appointment is a very positive fact and undoubtedly will  facilitate rapprochement between our countries.    "I have known Mr. Kozlarich since 1992. I have a good  impression of him. The ambassador has had a very long and  serious diplomatic career. At the time he was dealing with all  issues associated with the republics of the former Union. The  positive impression I developed then was reaffirmed during our  current meeting. The main point is that he is a man with a long  service in diplomacy, well informed on the subject of Armenian  aggression. All of this is evidence that the U.S. State  Department, by appointing him the ambassador to Azerbaijan,  counts on positive changes in the resolution of many issues.  They sent here a person who is a man of goodwill, is sincere,  and has a good grasp of the situation. Much will also depend on  us, however. Because as a rule an ambassador interacts with  everyone: the population, the government, and journalists.    Our republic, which is engaged in a war against Armenian  aggressors, desperately needs unity; unity of outlook and  position of both the government and the opposition. This is the  only way we can get out of the crisis situation in which we  currently find ourselves.    The minister also was asked how he feels about the proposal  of some U.S. senators and congressmen to invite Ter-Petrosyan,  as the most democratic of the presidents of the countries of the  former Union, to America. Hasan Hasanov characterized this  proposal as primarily another action of the Armenian lobby, and  emphasized that it is seriously erroneous.    In the minister's opinion, the head of a republic that  conducts an aggressive, bloody war that violates all human  rights on the occupied territory, conducts regular ethnic  cleansing, and violates all international norms and universal  moral norms, cannot be considered a democrat. Especially  considering that he also is de facto commander-in-chief of the  Armenian armed forces.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Signalmen's union discusses options Leaders of the RMT transport union were discussing their next move in the railway signal dispute last night. The 21-strong executive was deciding whether to escalate the conflict by extending the 24-hour weekly stoppages to two days a week. It was also looking at Railtrack's latest pay proposal that would give most signalmen self-financing pay increases of between 13 per cent and 26 per cent. There seems little likelihood, however, that tomorrow's 24-hour strike can be avoided.</p>

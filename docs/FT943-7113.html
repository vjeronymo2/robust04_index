			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Accountancy Column: Role of auditing submerged by small print - Roger Davis argues that the profession needs to take more heed of clients' demands than standards It is time that the auditing profession stopped hiding behind technicalities and faced up to the need to make its service more relevant to its clients. British industry has a huge stake in the auditing profession. Company audits cost some Pounds 2bn annually. Audited accounts affect all major business decisions. Auditing firms train many of the brightest graduates for an industrial career. The auditor is a valuable independent source of advice to management. It is therefore a great mistake that industry's interests are largely being ignored in the long-running debate on the role of auditing. My firm's recent surveys show that what company directors increasingly want from their auditors are: the courage to constructively to challenge them about their stewardship, innovative ideas, and, above all, a commercial outlook. What the profession is doing instead is immersing itself in developing a plethora of arcane accounting and auditing rules with which industry is, frankly, getting fed up. The first UK accounting standard had nine pages, the latest has 137. Dependence on a litany of technical jargon from somewhere the other side of the ozone layer will seriously depreciate the asset prized most by company directors: the auditors' independence of mind to tell the board, from their wide professional experience, what they really think. We have a disconnection of major proportions. And if the more strident academics have their way, the audit would become a highly regulated activity. The auditor-director relationship would become adversarial. Far from enhancing the value of audit to directors, shareholders and anyone else, compliance with the rules would become the end in itself. It would be demoralising to the outlook of young people joining the profession. What we need to do is encourage expansion of the auditor's mind, and not of the rule book. I am ashamed to say that the academics do not need much encouragement. Auditing firms themselves have been asking for more rules. It is partly a self-induced weakness to avoid having to make difficult judgments in a competitive climate. But others must also take their share of the blame. Time was when the auditor's words 'my judgment' were invariably respected. Now all too often the response is 'Show me the rule which says we can't do it,' not only from company directors but from lawyers and from financial institutions peddling artificial accounting schemes. Auditors' fears about litigation are now taking a real grip on this mentality. It is safer to be able to say in court that you complied with all the rules. I did not join my profession to become the involuntary equivalent of a Lloyd's Name, or even worse to underwrite risks the commercial insurance market will not touch. But by signing an audit report today, that is increasingly the position I am in: risking being unjustly sued. The debate is far from academic. A creeping legalistic mentality in the profession will be debilitating to industry and the economy. Commercial decisions are increasingly taken with an eye over the shoulder towards how they will look in the accounts. But a 100-page accounting or auditing standard will not define a good financial judgment any more than it will an elephant. There will be greater encouragement to short-termism because of the loss of flexibility to account for the longer term substance of decisions. It will be debilitating to the auditor's mind-set: tidying figures into the right boxes diverts the auditor's focus from the underlying commercial performance. Not least, it will weaken the commercial outlook of graduates the profession trains for industry, many of whom, unlike other countries, join the profession with non-accounting degrees. Colleagues in other countries who have gone further down the same path have cautioned me against following them. In the United States, there are now 117 accounting standards and hundreds of other official pronouncements. There are, for example, references to lease accounting in 99 accounting regulations. In most of continental Europe, the legal form of accounts, often driven by the tax regime, is a dominant factor, as it is for Japan. But all still have business scandals. The detailed standards do not appear to have stopped them. No one can argue against greater comparability of accounts - which is one purpose of the standards. But there is no absolute in comparability. The only question is how far do we go? International comparability has to be the goal, but the chances of this diminish as each country goes on expanding its own accounting lexicon. The British created accountancy as a real profession in which experienced professional judgment counted for more than theory. It led much of the world. It is time for my profession to wake up and realise we now face the greatest challenge in our history to retain our relevance to the business community. The inescapable choice is either to continue on the slide to a legalistic profession or for the profession to do something about it. I am encouraging all my partners to carry out a simple test in boardrooms. At every board meeting or audit committee we attend to present the results of the audit, we should say to the directors: 'On a points scale of 0 to 10, this is what we think about the quality of your profits and the quality of the balance sheet. 'This is how much of your profits have come from making widgets and that is how much has come from ephemeral activity and from financial schemes. And, as the final test of quality, we have compared the profits with the cash flow and that is how much is in the bank.' Equally, on the subject of internal controls, I suggest that we tell directors the five most important things they need to put right. The idea is simple, and because of this it works. Every director joins in the discussion. The directors are beginning to throw back similar questions to us. 'On a points scale of 0-10 how do our accounts overall compare with best practice?' is a recent quote I heard. The answer we gave of 8 1/2 was not acceptable. 'I don't deal in halves, and there is a big difference between 8 and 9 in my view,' the director said, thus putting pressure on the auditor to come off the fence. It is this kind of simple question and answer test which reflects the mood of the great majority of boardrooms around the country. It accords with the business-like way in which directors run their meetings. A major problem remains: that a lot of unproductive time still needs to be spent on accounting minutiae. Because the rule book is already so long, the auditor has painstakingly to explain interpretations of the standards, and to discuss other potential hostages to fortune which may be referred to the regulator by those with axes to grind. Auditors need to convey in everyday language to non-accountants in the boardroom what they really think as a result of thousands of hours of audit effort. The benefit of all this effort can easily be lost in the five minutes they have to make their impact - which is about the length of time it takes to read the first couple of pages of the latest accounting or auditing standard. In summary, the profession needs to reposition itself away from its narrow compliance mentality towards being a genuinely independent, professional adviser, challenging boards in the everyday commercial language of business. We should be in the crow's nest warning of icebergs, not below decks busily defining what an iceberg looks like. The author is head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand</p>

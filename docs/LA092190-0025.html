The bodies were uncovered in a Kirtland  barn after a cult member notified authorities. A Lake County judge is to  sentence Lundgren today. Lundgren had broken away from the Reorganized Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and took with him a following that  believed he was a prophet chosen by God to lead the church.  </P></p>

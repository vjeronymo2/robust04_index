			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Not-so-fresh faces solve no problems Familiar, predictable, but none the less repellent. This is the quick reaction to John Major's capitulation, after recent political setbacks, to knee-jerk Conservative demands for a reshuffle and a new chancellor. There was a time when Norman Lamont's resignation might have made some sense. This was after the massive blow to confidence inflicted by the UK's enforced departure from the exchange rate mechanism last September. Even so, it would have done so only as part of a much wider scrutiny into the full chain of events leading up to Black Wednesday. Both replacing the chancellor and cabinet reshuffles are cliche reactions of the weaker type of politician. After the reshuffle, all the problems remain the same, the officials analysing them remain the same, and the intellectual machinery for tackling them - if you want to call it that - remains the same. There is just an interval for the fresh faces to learn their briefs and for trivial Whitehall gossip. Indeed, as far as the Treasury is concerned, the advent of a new chancellor is more likely to delay than to hasten any needed policy reappraisal, as when Selwyn Lloyd was sacked in similar circumstances in 1962. The Tory party has a long history of useless blood-letting at No 11. There are some new twists this time round, all of them distasteful. John Major has been much more obviously pushed than Harold Macmillan used to be in both his actions and his timing by a hysterical campaign in the Tory tabloids, mutterings by backbenchers and by 'Tory managers', which I take to be code for the party chairman, Sir Norman Fowler. Another novel feature is the way in which Kenneth Clarke has shoved and bullied his way into Number 11. At one time I was impressed by his willingness to stand up to professional pressure groups instead of pretending, as most Tory ministers do, that he really agreed with them. Later I began to ask why Clarke had so much time to act as a self-appointed economic spokesman when the Home Office, of which he was supposed to be in charge, was full of enough problems to strain the most titanic politician. This was not offset by Clarke's vociferous support for the Maastricht treaty combined with the boast that he had not read it. To trumpet one's ignorance is one of the more stupid English characteristics against which Prince Albert fought a brave campaign, cut short by early death. But most distasteful of all was his semi-public campaign of denigration of Lamont and of self-promotion in order to become chancellor himself. If ever the Tory party had really been run by gentlemen, he would have been lucky to remain in the cabinet at all, let alone become chancellor. Obviously Lamont was not a heroic figure, but history is likely to record him as one of the better chancellors. His lasting achievements will be in structural reform. An example was his gradual whittling down of mortgage tax relief, which Margaret Thatcher had refused to touch. Another was his move to unify tax and spending decisions in a single Budget. He was also alert for seemingly modest but ultimately very important supply side measures. An example was his embrace of Dennis Snower's scheme to enable the unemployed to offer their dole as a wage subsidy instead. The watering-down of the scheme was mainly due to stick-in-the-muds at the employment department. Above all, both inside and outside the ERM, he was determined to give priority to securing and maintaining low inflation. This is not because he was a fanatic, but because he was highly sceptical of many of the claims made for the government's ability to promote economic growth, and realised that it was all too easy to sacrifice price stability without helping output and jobs in the longer run. Lamont also knew that public sector borrowing of Pounds 50bn would sooner or later run into trouble, and his delayed-action tax increases, designed to take effect with economic recovery, struck the right balance. He leaves behind an economy with a faster growth rate than that of any other of the main G7 countries and an underlying rate of inflation lower than in most. He had everything to gain and nothing to lose from entrenching low inflation, and Clarke will have his work cut out to prove that his own motivations are the same. His obvious view of No 11 as mainly a stepping stone to the premiership will not help his street credibility. Meanwhile Lamont can now expect a wave of sympathy from many in his own party and outside, including those who were most vociferous in demanding his head. But like most things in politics and life this sympathy will be too late.</p>

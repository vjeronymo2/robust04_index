			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Riady family returns to its ancestral lands - Growth is taking the Lippo group back to China ONE of the most striking phenomena of Asian business in the past decade has been the appearance on Hong Kong's corporate scene of expatriate Chinese businessmen from the rest of south-east Asia. Hong Kong has become the staging point for these 'overseas Chinese' who want to spread their asset bases wider than their adopted countries. This includes investment in China, land of their ancestors. There is no better example of this than the Lippo group of Indonesia. Controlled by the Riady family through a series of private trusts, it spans banking in Indonesia; banking, travel and property development in Hong Kong; large-scale infrastructure and hotel development in China; and banking, property and diversified investment in the US. In Indonesia, it controls seven listed companies, while in Hong Kong it controls six listed companies through its flagship Lippo Limited. The group has no holding company - a plan to consolidate group assets has been postponed indefinitely - but contains many private subsidiaries linked to its listed companies. Lippo executives in Jakarta say the group is capitalised at USDollars 2.5bn  -split equally between Indonesia and the rest. Group banking assets total USDollars 3.2bn, divided between Indonesia with 70 per cent and other countries with 30 per cent. Non-banking assets total USDollars 1.5bn. But the lack of a formal corporate structure concerns some brokers, who want to know more about the flows within the group. 'I can't guarantee that, by buying into a traded Lippo company, I will share in the group's success,' says one Jakarta-based analyst. 'The family may be keeping the most lucrative investments in private hands.' As with many Chinese companies, Lippo is dominated by one family. In Indonesia, they are known by their surname Riady; in Hong Kong and Fujian, their home province in China, they are known as the Li family. Mr Mochtar Riady, the family's scion, is in overall control and concentrates on the family's considerable Indonesian investments. His sons - James, 36, and Stephen, 32 - run operations in the US and Hong Kong respectively. Networking, a key characteristic of Chinese business practice, has rewarded the family. Mr Mochtar Riady, his wife and two sons, where invited by Mr Bill Clinton, US president, to attend his inauguration in January. The connection with the Clintons goes back to the early 1980s when the Riadys bought into Worthen Bank of Little Rock, Arkansas. They sold it in 1985. Their Asian contacts are less high-profile but still powerful. In Hong Kong, the Riadys are allied to Mr Li Ka-Shing, one of the colony's richest men, and China Resources, a leading Beijing company there. Mr Li owns 10 per cent of Lippo Limited and China Resources 5 per cent. The Singapore-Malaysian Hong Leong group is an important partner, as is C. Itoh, the big Japanese trading house. Both own stakes in Lippo International, a private investment company, which also owns 8.2 per cent of Lippo Limited. Lippo International's best deal to date was the purchase in 1990 of Lippo Sun Plaza in Kowloon for HKDollars 900m (USDollars 116m) and its sale, a year later, for HKDollars 2bn. The family's connections in Indonesia are also impressive. Mr Mochtar Riady is a former executive of Bank Central Asia (BCA), Indonesia's largest private bank and a subsidiary of the Salim Group led by Mr Liem Sioe Liong, reputedly the country's richest man. Bankers say Mr Riady was largely responsible for the growth of BCA in the 1970s and the early 1980s; Mr Liong was involved in the initial financing of some Lippo group activities. In Indonesia and Hong Kong, Lippo has grown rapidly. When Lippo Bank in Indonesia was listed in 1988, it had 28 branches. Today it has about 200. Total assets rose to Rp3,818bn (Dollars 1,84bn) last year, from Rp2.684nn in 1990. But the rate of growth has made some analysts wary. They estimate branch managers' average experience at only four years and say the bank may be poorly positioned to cope with sector-wide problems of non-performing loans. The group is also a large property developer in Indonesia. It is lead-financing two large property developments in Jakarta - Lippo City and Lippo Village - with a planned investment of USDollars 1.5bn over the next five years. In Hong Kong, the first big acquisition for the family was the purchase in November 1984 of Hong Kong Chinese Bank (HKCB) from Overseas Trust Bank for HKDollars 337m. Worthen Bank was the vehicle for the transaction, with the Riadys, Mr Jack Stephens, a wealthy US financier, and Mr Liong putting up the cash. From that beginning, the family's assets in Hong Kong have grown to exceed USDollars 1bn. HKCB was refloated on the colony's stock exchange last year, raising more than HKDollars 700m for the Riadys; the family controls the bank through a 60 per cent stake held by Lippo Limited. Lippo also controls EIE and Asia Securities, both property investment companies, Morning Star, a travel agency, Hong Kong Building and Loan Agency, a company providing home finance, and Lippo Asia, a merchant bank. Despite the property and travel assets, the quality of which is variable, the group's focus is banking-related services, with a strong orientation towards China. Mr Stephen Riady, the family member who heads Lippo in Hong Kong, goes as far as to describe the group as a provider of merchant banking services. This is especially the case with Lippo's development plans in Fujian province, on China's south coast. Mr Mochtar Riady's grandfather immigrated to Indonesia from Putian, a Fujian town. Lippo in Hong Kong is planning developments in Fujian, including a 2,400MW power station, hotels, commercial property, and port and airport construction. In most, it will act as arranger of finance and technical expertise, while taking between a 10 per cent to 20 per cent interest in the assets. 'The power station is a project we like very much,' says Mr Stephen Riady. 'Infrastructure is a good business to be in. There are not many people involved, so competition is limited, and the buyer is the government, not the public. Fujian Electric guarantees us a minimum take-up and guarantees us a minimum yield. We will take 20 to 30 per cent of the power station.' The port, at Meizhou Bay - one of five coastal ports the Chinese government has selected for development - will be upgraded to take a coal loader for the power station. If direct links with Taiwan come, as many expect, Lippo plans to upgrade it for containerisation. The group also has monopoly rights to develop Meizhou island, which houses a deity of significance to fishermen and Fujianese. Visitors from Taiwan to the island's shrine totalled about 500,000 last year. Lippo plans three hotels, a golf course, and residential and commercial developments on the island. Says Mr Riady: 'We do the master plan and find investors, that's our strength.'</p>

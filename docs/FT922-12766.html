			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Devenish to lease 115 pubs from Whitbread JA Devenish, the west country-based pub operator, yesterday announced that it is leasing 115 pubs from Whitbread. The pubs, which will be leased for eight years free of tied beer supplies, increase the Devenish estate by 25 per cent to more than 500 pubs. Mr John Clark, chief executive, said the pubs are located in two of the company's development areas, along the M5 corridor and on the south coast around Bournemouth, Southampton and Swanage. 'They provide us with a good opportunity to expand our business without initial capital outlay,' he said. Whitbread bought Devenish's beer brands for Pounds 9.75m during its successful campaign against a takeover bid from Boddington last year and supplies a range of beers to the company. As part of its requirement to free 2,250 pubs from exclusive beer supplies by November this year, Whitbread is planning a number of similar leasing deals with regional brewers and pub retailers.</p>

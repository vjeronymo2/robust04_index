			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 1 Feb (AFP) -- The EZLN [Zapatist  National Liberation Army] rebels announced today an "imminent"  dialogue with the Mexican Government.    The communique, which was issued from "the mountains of the  Mexican southeast," is addressed to the national and  international media and is signed by guerrilla subcommander  Marcos.    The document lists a number of local and foreign media that  the EZLN will accredit to cover the negotiations to solve the  armed conflict in Chiapas State that began on 1 January.    "The initiation of a dialogue for peace between the EZLN and  the federal government at a yet to be determined place and date  is imminent," states the document, which adds that the Indian  Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General Command (CCRI-CG)  [Comite Clandestino Revolucionario Indigena-Comandancia General]  has already reached "basic agreements" with Peace Commissioner  Manuel Camacho.    It added that "some details are yet to be settled and some  previous agreements are yet to be fulfilled, but the basic  points have already been defined."    The EZLN asserted that "there is an open-door policy" toward  the local and foreign media which, according to the rebels,  "carry out their task objectively without taking sides."    In this sense the communique stated that "all the written  press" shall be allowed, as far as the EZLN is concerned, "to  cover the dialogue for peace and reconciliation," but in the  case of televised media, the guerrillas "will veto the  participation of only the national private television stations  Televisa and Television Azteca."    According to the rebels' report, Televisa "does not need to  seek news because they invent it at their will and convenience,"  while the reporters of Television Azteca "have shown a lack of  professionalism by offering money to our fighters" to make  statements.    The communique added that several media "have flatly refused  to report with objectivity" and have "particularly attacked our  cause and that of the Chiapas Indian people."    The EZLN also publicized a "special invitation" to nine  newspapers and four television stations, both Mexican and  foreign, three Mexican magazines, five Mexican radio stations,  and five international news agencies -- including AFP --to cover  the government-guerrilla dialogue.    The report from the Zapatists stated that accreditation of  the press will be carried out through San Cristobal de Las Casas  Bishop Samuel Ruiz, the national commissioner for intermediation  (appointed by the EZLN).</p>

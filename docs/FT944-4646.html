			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: French bank finds few friends - A look at BCP's tough struggle to steer clear of bankruptcy For troubled French banks, it helps to be big. While Credit Lyonnais, the loss-making state-owned bank has received capital injections of more than FFr5bn (Dollars 925m) to rescue it from sustained and substantial losses, Banque Commercial Privee, a minnow in comparison, has faced a tougher struggle in its battle against bankruptcy. Since the declaration of a cessation of payments on Monday, the Paris-based bank, which has 1,200 clients, one branch, 50 staff, and which requires an estimated recapitalisation of FFr140m, has presented France's financial community with a test of its ability to revive the smaller players in the financial sector. 'It is the first French bank to close its doors since 1992, when Banque Majorel failed,' says one French official. He argues that several small banks have been weakened by the impact of recession in 1992 and 1993 and the resulting bankruptcies which have continued to rise, in spite of broader economic recovery this year. 'When you are small, you are more vulnerable. It is often harder to find a white knight.' Yesterday, the French banking community moved to reassure BCP's depositors who have had their accounts frozen since November 21. The Association of French Banks said it was invoking its so-called, 'solidarity mechanism' through which its 428 members provide funds to repay up to FFr400,000 per deposit. This is estimated to involve a cost of about FFr70m. But whether the bank itself can find relief, however, remains far from clear. The Commission Bancaire, the regulatory arm of the Bank of France, the country's central bank, has sought to bring pressure to bear on BCP's shareholders to come to its rescue. It has done so through the application of article 52-1 of the banking law, a provision which calls on shareholders to provide funds for insolvent financial institutions. This provision contrasts with article 52-2, under which the whole of the French banking system is called to the rescue of a troubled bank. This provision, last used in 1988 for the rescue of the Al-Saudi bank, is invoked when the image and stability of the French financial system is considered to be jeopardised. 'This is not the case with BCP,' says one French banker. 'It is not seen as a big risk to the financial community or a political issue, so the rescue is being sought through a recourse to shareholders.' For Mr Jean Varda, appointed as provisional administrator of the bank, it is a vital search. 'It is imperative that we find a shareholder of reference to restore liquidity and assure survival,' he says. The problem for BCP, however, is that its shareholders are unable or so far unwilling to jump into the breach. GAN, the loss-making state-owned insurer, is one of the biggest investors in UNI, a holding company which controls 86 per cent of the shares of BCP. However, it has said that it does not feel responsible for BCP and has increased the plight of the bank by ending its access to the interbanking market through UIC, GAN's banking division. Macif, the mutual insurance company which holds 14 per cent of BCP, has similarly indicated a reluctance to advance fresh capital, while UNI itself is thought to lack the funds necessary to shore up the balance sheet. The irony is that many in the banking community believe that the situation facing BCP is far from terminal. Although it has suffered losses over the past two years, and has been particularly exposed to the impact of recession because of its loans to the small business sector, the required recapitalisation is small compared with the bank's assets of about FFr1.7bn. 'It is not in such bad shape,' says one banking source. 'Liquidation could be avoided.' Whether it will be depends partly on a meeting tomorrow of the Paris Tribunal de Commerce, the capital's commercial court. The meeting will determine whether to wind up the bank or place it under judicial redressment, a procedure which grants court appointed administrators six months to seek a solution for the bank. For most observers, the latter is the more likely outcome. BCP's client list may attract potential buyers, while GAN's state shareholder may also exert pressure on the insurance group to provide the necessary funds. For the meantime, however, the bank and its depositors face a nail-biting wait.  ------------------------------------------------------------ FRENCH BANK FAILURES  ------------------------------------------------------------ Year  Bank                              Base     Recovered by                                                 creditors (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------ 1976  Banque Baud                      Evian             60.3 1978  Banque Lacaze                  Lourdes             76.0 1979  Banque Hispano Francaise      Biarritz             50.0 1979  Banque Roy                       Lille             44.9 1980  Banque Catalane              Perpignan            100.0 1980  Banque Gadic                     Paris             50.0 1980  Banque Phoceenne            Marseilles             60.0 1988  Banque Al-Saudi 1989  Banque de Participations         Paris             49.0        et de Placements 1989  United Banking Corp              Paris             28.5 1989  Lebanese Arab Bank               Paris              5.0 1990  Banque Industrielle de          Monaco             45.0        Monaco 1991  BCCI                             Paris          Ongoing 1992  Banque Majorel                   Rodez          Ongoing  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

The discipline of property rights theory and law developed very  rapidly in 1960's, forming various schools of thought in  property rights as the Western nations attached great importance  to it. Currently, although property rights theory has moved  toward maturity and is widely used, theoretical circles in the  West have yet to establish a unanimous, complete, and uniform  standard for an exact concept of property rights. China began  to practice the property rights concept in 1980's but our  economic circles were similarly not totally unanimous on the  concept and its understanding. In particular, the argument that  property rights amounts to ownership created misunderstanding in  property rights theory.    Although there is not unanimity on the concept of property  rights currently practiced in enterprise reform, the general  opinion is that property rights is a concept derived from  ownership. It is a legal form based on property ownership to  reflect the rights, interests, and duties of principal investors  regarding their property. Under normal circumstances, property  rights are related to operating assets and the amount of capital  injected by principal investors into enterprises. Once a  principal investor has injected capital into an enterprise, he  possesses the corresponding property rights of the enterprise by  law, and becomes a principal owner of the enterprise's property  rights.    Property rights must consist of two fundamental functions.  First, they must possess the power and function of profit  sharing, or the profit function for short, that is, the right to  share part of the profits realized through the application of  property in business operations. The economic significance of  property rights lies in profit-making. Of course, there are  different ways to represent and realize profits for different  types of property rights. For example, in property  organizations under the shareholding system, the profit  shareholders realize from their property rights is reflected in  dividends, and the profit of corporations is reflected in the  right to control the use of undivided profits (generally for  re-investment) for upgrading corporations' earning capacity,  thereby raising operating income, workers' wages, and other  benefits, as well as accelerating corporations' development.  Second, they must enjoy controlling power, that is, the  principal to property rights shall not, within legal limits, be  subjected to any interference in his right to control assets,  particularly profits.    The right to profit and right to control constitute complete  property rights arising from the production and exchange of  commodities. A principal is a principal of independent status  to property rights only when he possesses these two powers  simultaneously.    Property rights and ownership are not one concept. Property  ownership determines the ultimate ownership of things and shows  a principal's right to the monopoly of such things. It  possesses the characteristics of exclusiveness, origin, and  comprehensiveness. The exclusiveness of ownership indicates  that, by law, the ownership of things can only belong to one  principal. Of course, this principal can be a natural or legal  person.    In market economy, major features of property rights are:    1. A principal of property rights possesses the  characteristics of an economic entity, which generally has the  following three characteristics: First, it must own a definite  amount of assets for participating in social reproduction. The  ultimate legal ownership of assets does not necessarily belong  to the entity. Second, it must directly participate in  society's reproduction activities. Third, it should possess its  own independent economic interests, and its main goal of  participating in society's profit-making economic activities is  to produce the greatest possible benefit for itself.    2. The property rights movement is independent. The  independence of the property rights movement means that once  property rights are established, the principal may utilize the  rights within legal limits to seek the greatest possible  benefits for itself, and shall not be interfered with by other  principals at will. A principal may possess many property  rights, but a specially designated property right can belong to  only one principal.    3. The property rights system is divisible. In a developed  market economy, due to the development of a credit system,  property value is separated from the value generated by its  utilization. Different principals may exercise control over  different forms of property so as to separate the ownership of  unitary properties and allow them to be owned by different  principals.</p>

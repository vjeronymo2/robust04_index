			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / London is top centre for foreign share deals THE Bank of England has confirmed the London Stock Exchange as the biggest foreign equity market in the world. Reforms introduced in most continental European bourses - in the Netherlands, Germany, France and Switzerland - have not yet threatened its dominant position. The Bank's Quarterly Bulletin reports that London, third largest overall last year with equity turnover totalling Pounds 305bn (sales only), now accounts for more than two thirds of reported trading of equities outside their country of origin. 'Overall,' it says, 'London has been successful in attracting trading of foreign, particularly European, equities because of its historically open capital market and its low costs compared with other exchanges.' Accurate data on foreign equity trading in London became available only in February 1990. This followed the full introduction of Sequal, the London Stock Exchange's trade reporting and confirmation system for stocks quoted on Seaq International, the exchange's screen-based professional market for trading foreign equities. The data reveal that foreign equity trading (Pounds 150bn, sales only, in 1990) accounted for just under half of total turnover on the London Stock Exchange last year. This compares with foreign business of Pounds 4.3bn for Frankfurt and Pounds 2.5bn for Paris. Figures for the New York Stock Exchange, the next biggest foreign equity market, are not generally available, but in the first quarter of 1990 it was estimated that foreign equity turnover was only 25 per cent of that in London. Tokyo came third last year, a long way behind with Pounds 7.3bn. Japanese stocks took the largest share of London's foreign equity turnover in 1990, accounting for just over a quarter of the total. German shares were also heavily traded, accounting for about 23 per cent. Other European shares contributed most of the remainder. The Bank concludes that trading costs are low in London and that London's trading structure, with market makers taking positions between buyers and sellers, provides superior liquidity for large wholesale trades. 'In the current liberal capital environment,' the Bank says, 'trading will tend to move to where market conditions are favourable.'</p>

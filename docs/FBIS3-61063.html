			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Oleksandr Rol, chairman of </F> Ukraine's Officers Union, SOU, by Mariya Bazelyuk; place and  date not given: "The Defense of Ukraine Cannot be Guaranteed by  Other States" -- first paragraph published in boldface]    [Text] The Fifth Congress of the Ukraine's Officers Union  [SOU] held in Kiev on 18 December 1993 elected Major General  Oleksandr Rol as the SOU chairman. Rol was born in Kiev, where  he completed high school and received training at an aviation  club. He studied at the Chernihiv Aviation School and later  graduated from the Military Aviation Academy. He was a fighter  pilot, a bomber pilot, and also did staff work. For three  years, he was adviser to the commander of the Vietnamese Air  Force. Even though Rol's military service was almost entirely  outside Ukraine, he speaks very good idiomatic Ukrainian and  this points to his family's healthy roots.    [Bazelyuk] General, what is, in your opinion, the role of  SOU in the state building?    [Rol] The union's main task is to promote the building of  the armed forces and, thereby, to strengthen the Ukrainian  state, since the army is one of the institutions in charge of  its defense. The SOU is a public organization, which unites  both officers on active service and those in the reserves and in  retirement. The union has lived through difficult times owing  to the uncertain attitude toward it on the part of the Defense  Ministry. Of course, the leadership of the union did make  certain mistakes, for which I am also responsible, since I was  within the leadership. One of these mistakes was the excessive  preoccupation with political activity, because, after all, the  main task of the SOU is the building of the armed forces, and it  is hardly expedient to come out with criticisms of the commander  in chief in the form of various statements. This, of course,  gave rise to a negative reaction on the part of leading figures.    It goes without saying that the SOU does not need any  assistance from the armed forces. It even assists the army in  its difficult material situation and gives our servicemen moral  support. In what way? We find it our duty to indoctrinate the  army personnel in the spirit of Ukrainian patriotism and  glorious traditions of the Ukrainian Army. It is difficult to  overestimate the SOU's activity in this direction, since it has  close ties with other public organizations and participants in  the national liberation struggle who can have a significant  influence upon the training and indoctrination of the personnel.    Yet another aspect of our activity is the social protection  of servicemen and their families and the assistance to the  command in maintaining strict discipline in military units and  subunits.    Today, we must clearly determine and regulate ways for  reviving the SOU, and this is precisely the goal of its  leadership. On the eve of the last meeting held in 1993, the  SOU leadership had a meeting with Lieutenant General Kobzar,  chief of the Ministry of Defense's Main Administration for  Educational Work and Socio- Psychological Services. In the  course of conversation, we found out that our positions  regarding the tasks and place of the SOU in the building and  strengthening of the Ukrainian Armed Forces coincided. General  Kobzar asserted that the Ministry of Defense would support all  those organizations that will contribute to raising the combat  readiness of the Ukrainian Army and expressed a desire to  increase the SOU's role in indoctrinating officers and in  introducing the best traditions of the Ukrainian Army. He also  drew our attention to the need to establish new traditions. We  agreed that it is necessary to have amateur artistic groups, as  well as professional actors, perform in the military units more  often; meetings with interesting people must also be organized.    In short, we had a constructive conversation with General  Kobzar, and he promised to pass its contents on to the minister  of defense. I believe that, in the very near future, we will  meet [with the defense minister]. The Officers Union must work  in close contact with the Ministry of Defense and with all those  state structures, which are in charge of defending our state's  independence. Both the SOU and the Ministry of Defense are  doing the same work for the state.    [Bazelyuk] Did you take part in elaborating the Ukrainian  Military Doctrine? What is your opinion about it?    [Rol] It is centered on defense. The doctrine adopted by  the Supreme Council in October 1993 has become a state document,  which soldiers must adhere to rather than assess.    [Bazelyuk] However, it is written in the doctrine that  "Ukraine must become, in the future, a nonnuclear state if other  nuclear powers undertake similar actions." After it became a  state document, some people in the upper echelons of power  rushed to transfer nuclear weapons immediately to Russia. What  is your position with regard to our state's nuclear status?    [Rol] Starting from 1991, I made many statements for the  press and spoke from various rostrums. I said that Ukraine must  have atomic weapons as a means of deterrence. Our state must  possess nuclear weapons as long as at least one country, which  may become our adversary and lead to a military confrontation,  keeps its nuclear weapons. This is my opinion. No matter how  big our army is, there is nothing like nuclear potential as a  means for defending Ukraine.    The position of our political leadership has led to several  negative processes. Back on 24 August 1991, Ukraine, for some  reason, proclaimed to the whole world that it was going to  become a nonnuclear state. Another example. Why, people are  asking, does Ukraine need the Black Sea Fleet, if it declared  that it only needs the Fleet for local needs? This gave rise to  the problem of the Black Sea Fleet with all its consequences.  It is a pity that we gave away our tactical weapons so quickly;  they might defend Ukraine much better than the largest army. It  is impossible to guarantee national security without modern  weapons.    Ukraine must proceed from the fact that it is impossible to  ensure the defense of our state if we only rely upon guarantees  offered by other states. In questions of Ukraine's defense  capability and national security we may only rely upon our own  forces.    Why does the West help Russia in every way? Simply because  it has a powerful nuclear potential and is, in this respect, a  strong power.    [Bazelyuk] What are Ukraine's real possibilities for  maintaining its nuclear status?    [Rol] First and foremost, it is up to our president. We  might conduct a nationwide referendum on Ukraine's nuclear or  nonnuclear status. You know, I am very annoyed when some state  tells us didactically: "You must give up your nuclear weapons."  Who would dare make such claims upon China, Great Britain, or  France?    [Bazelyuk] How do you assess that the personnel of the 43d  Rocket Army has not, to this day, taken the oath of allegiance  to Ukraine?    [Rol] I will investigate this situation as chairman of the  SOU.    [Bazelyuk] You have been nominated as a candidate as  Ukraine's people's deputy. Do you agree to stand for this post  and why?    [Rol] I agree, because I have a clear picture of my work in  the Ukrainian Parliament.    [Bazelyuk] Thank you for the interview, from which I have  become convinced that, despite the enormous pressure exerted  upon Ukraine both from the West and from the East, Ukraine will  be able to create a reliable defensive shield with all those  types of weapons necessary for this.</p>

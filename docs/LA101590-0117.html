			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 5 LEADING INSURERS AT RISK OF INSOLVENCY, REPORT SAYS;  </P> <P> BUSINESS: A CONSUMER GROUP'S ANALYSIS OF THE TOP 20 COMPANIES WARNS THAT A  SEVERE CRISIS COULD CRIPPLE SOME FIRMS AND FORCE THE PUBLIC TO BAIL THEM OUT.  </P> <P> Five of the nation's top 20 property and casualty insurance companies are so  financially shaky that they could go broke in the event of a severe economic  downturn, the consumer group Public Citizen said today.  </P> <P> Public Citizen said Aetna, American International Group, the Hartford Insurance  Group, Liberty Mutual and United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty each triggered  four of six factors that, according to the group's analysis, would make them  vulnerable to insolvency.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for some of the firms took issue with the report and said their  companies are healthy.  </P> <P> The consumer group said none of the five companies are on the edge of  insolvency but "the underlying weakness in their financial condition is clearly  evident."  </P> <P> The 124-page report said a combination of low premium volume, high claims and  weak return on investment could mean potential financial trouble for the  companies. It said all of these factors occur during an insurance cycle  downturn.  </P> <P> "The failure of just one insurance giant would overwhelm the state funds  designed to protect policyholders," said Joan Claybrook, president of the  consumer group. "The result could be another taxpayer bailout on the model of  the savings and loan industry."  </P> <P> Public Citizen made its analysis in part by examining shrinking surpluses, the  ratio of surplus to losses and unusually wide premium swings over the years  1969 to 1988.  </P> <P> It also examined three short-term factors: the amount of risk the company  insures compared to the size of its cushion against unexpected losses, the  degree to which its investments could be converted into cash and the extent of  its investment in high-risk junk bonds.  </P> <P> Howard Smith, senior vice president and comptroller for AIG, said he was  "flabbergasted" that his institution would be considered vulnerable. "They  either used the wrong facts or they got the wrong numbers," he said.  </P> <P> Joyce Willis, a spokeswoman for the Hartford Insurance Group, said she  questioned the credibility of the assessment.  </P> <P> Other companies included in the survey were Allstate, Cigna-INA, Chubb, CNA,  Continental, Crum &amp; Forster, Farmers, Fireman's Fund, Kemper, Lincoln,  Nationwide, St. Paul, State Farm, Travelers and USAA.  </P></p>

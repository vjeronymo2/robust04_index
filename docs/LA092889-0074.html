			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 COUNCILMEN CLASH OVER CIVIC CENTER  </P> <P> In a debate this week over the building of a civic center in West Hollywood  Park, City Councilmen John Heilman and Steve Schulte swapped accusations but it  was unclear whether either won any converts.  </P> <P> After listening to what one member described as "the Heilman-Schulte fight," a  sharply divided West Hollywood Democratic Club, which sponsored the public  forum, decided Tuesday night against endorsing either of two initiatives on the  November ballot aimed at giving West Hollywood voters a say in whether the  center is built in the park.  </P> <P> "I would say the civic leaders of this city are split on the issue, and if I  had to guess, I'd say the election is going to be too close to call," said Gary  Kramer, the club's president, who moderated the debate.  </P> <P> Heilman and Mayor Abbe Land are the authors of an initiative that would allow  the civic center to be built in the park, while Schulte supports a competing  initiative, sponsored by the Save Our Parks Alliance, which would prohibit the  center's being built there.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Construction Delay  </P> <P> Amid uncertainty over the election, city officials, who had hoped to start  construction in January of a five-level parking garage in the park to help  serve the civic center, now say construction is not expected to begin before  next September.  </P> <P> The postponement, first disclosed by project manager John Given before the  Public Facilities Board two weeks ago, has fueled criticism from the project's  supporters that delays are costing the city hundreds of thousands of dollars.  </P> <P> Heilman sounded that theme Tuesday, blaming Schulte and others for the delays,  and saying that "with each passing month, it's costing us $100,000."  </P> <P> Schulte and Heilman, whose past differences have often served to enliven City  Council debate on a range of issues, exchanged barbs that sometimes bordered on  the personal during the debate.  </P> <P> Heilman accused Schulte of "hiding behind the park (issue)" in order "to foster  his own political ambitions," and blamed his council colleague for "stirring up  dissatisfaction over the civic center by spreading misinformation about it."  </P> <P> Schulte, on the other hand, accused Heilman of "playing loose with the  figures," insisting that the project's proposed $23-million first phase "will,  if it is built, end up costing more like $40 million." He charged that Heilman  and other supporters of the project would "turn the park into little more than  a well-manicured lawn."  </P> <P> Both men face reelection next April, and have hinted that they may not seek  another four-year term. But neither has discussed his plans publicly, fueling  speculation that each is waiting to see how the initiatives fare in November  before making a decision.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Divisive Issue  </P> <P> The November election promises to give voters the chance to weigh in on an  issue that has been politically divisive since the civic center was proposed  three years ago.  </P> <P> By law, the city cannot build anything that reduces the amount of recreational  space available in the eight-acre park. City officials have long acknowledged  that the park is poorly laid out, and say the construction of a city hall,  council chambers, new library, parking garage and other facilities would be  accompanied by a park redesign and the removal of an auditorium, library and  other structures there now.  </P> <P> By law, if both measures pass, the one with the most votes would prevail.  </P> <P> However, after the city attorney concluded that, as drafted, the park group's  initiative violates state law, Heilman and Councilwoman Helen Albert said that  they do not intend to be bound by the initiative, even if it wins.  </P> <P> In a 12-page legal opinion, City Atty. Michael Jenkins concluded that the  initiative prohibiting use of the park for the civic center illegally "binds  the hands" of present and future city officials to "exercise their inherent  right" under state law to govern public property.  </P> <P> Schulte, the only council member to oppose placement of the center in the park,  and Councilman Paul Koretz, who supports construction of the center there, have  both said they will respect the outcome of the vote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Wait and See'  </P> <P> If the initiative backed by Schulte prevails, it could mean that the decision  whether to challenge it in court or scrap the current civic center plans could  rest with Mayor Abbe Land.  </P> <P> She has not said what course she might take in such an event. "I think the  wait-and-see approach is still where I'm at right now," the mayor said, in an  interview this week.  </P> <P> With the election less than six weeks away, supporters of each initiative are  claiming important endorsements.  </P> <P> West Hollywood Individuals for a Stable Environment, whose members are drawn  from about a dozen neighborhood associations, has endorsed the initiative  supported by Schulte.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, on Monday, an ad hoc group that includes city Commissioners Rachelle  Smith and Brad Crowe, and City Treasurer Jonathan Ahearn, announced its support  of the pro-civic center initiative and pledged to undertake an extensive  get-out-the-vote campaign.  </P> <P> The Heilman-Land initiative also has been endorsed by the Coalition for  Economic Survival, the large renters' rights group that dominates many aspects  of West Hollywood politics.  </P> <P> Heilman, Land, and Councilwoman Albert are members of the Coalition's 21-member  steering committee, and Heilman and Land lobbied vigorously for the group's  endorsement.  </P> <P> However, Larry Gross, the coalition's executive director, said the endorsement  did not imply a stand "one way or the other" on the issue of whether a civic  center should be built in the park.  </P> <P> "Basically, we're supportive of the council having the ability to do work in  the park, to provide services in the park, and to ensure that the park is  better maintained and configured for better public use," Gross said. The  steering committee, he said, "isn't for or against the civic center at this  point."  </P> <P> Schulte dismissed the endorsement as "wishy-washy."  </P> <P> "It means the coalition is trying to save face for council members who support  the civic center in the park even though there's obviously a lot of  divisiveness in their own camp over the issue. From our standpoint, we've got  to be encouraged by that."  </P> <P> In an interview, Heilman said he was "perfectly pleased" with the coalition's  action. "The endorsement is what we wanted all along and they've given it to  us, and so we're very pleased with that," he said.  </P></p>

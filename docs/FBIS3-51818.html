			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kingstown, St. Vincent, 22 Jan, CANA -- The St.  Vincent Government has announced a February 21 general election.  Nomination day is February 4.    The announcement, Friday night, found opposition political  parties well into campaigning. It also found the ruling New  Democratic Party with an image problem, following the  resignation of minister in the prime minister's office, Burton  Williams. Williams said he had resigned last week, with  immediate effect, because Prime Minister James Mitchell treated  Vincentians with "utmost contempt and disrespect."    Political insiders said Williams was among three persons the  NDP wanted to sit out the next general election. Williams,  however, said he would try to hold on to the South Windward  constituency seat he has held since 1984. The NDP has not yet  said who would replace Williams as its candidate or whether  controversial former trade minister, Johnathan Peters, would  seek to retain his North Central Windward seat.    This month, Mitchell announced he was relieving Peters of  his  portfolio and placing him on leave until month-end. Peters has  been in the U.S. since early December. He is reported to be  sorting out problems with the U.S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service.    Fifteen seats are at stake in the election. Mitchell's party  won all in the last election here, in 1989. Mitchell's main  opponent is the St. Vincent Labour Party, headed by Stanley  John. The NDP will also be up against political scientist Dr.  Ralph Gonsalves' Movement for National Unity.    Opposition politicians have listed unemployment and  inadequate housing and health care delivery among the campaign  issues. A key issue is sure to be the state of the banana  industry, the main source of foreign exchange here. The industry  has been hit by falling revenue. The St. Vincent Banana Growers  Association, which virtually manages it, earned just over 60  million East Caribbean Dollars (one EC dollar = 37 U.S. cents)  in 1993, down from just over EC99 million dollars the previous  year.    There has been a sharp increase in the voters list. Late  December, 1993, the electoral office put the tally at 66,598, up  from 61,091 persons registered for the 1989 poll.</p>

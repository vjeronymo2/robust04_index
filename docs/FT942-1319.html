			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Canada insurer studies UK side Canada's financially-troubled Confederation Life Insurance is examining the future of its UK operations ahead of a proposed capital infusion from Winnipeg-based Great-West Life Assurance. Confederation said its options included the sale of its successful UK arm, which includes a bank as well as group and individual insurance businesses. The Stevenage-based UK operation had total assets of CDollars 1.8bn (USDollars 1.3bn) at the end of last year, and manages funds of some Pounds 5bn (Dollars 7.6bn). Pre-tax profits in 1993 were Pounds 27.9m compared with Pounds 14.2m in 1992. Premium income last year was Pounds 629m against Pounds 715m in 1992. The company is one of the leading providers of pooled pension products for medium- sized companies, while its team of 850 direct sales agents markets a range of unit-linked individual insurance contracts, including standard term and savings products. Last year's results included a CDollars 7.1m profit from Confederation Bank, whose growth has recently been spurred by an offshore deposit-taking operation in Jersey. The bank offers residential mortgage loans and deposit account facilities. Overall, the UK subsidiary, which began trading in 1906, has 1,600 employees and 58 regional branches. Confederation is a mutual company owned by its policyholders. It has suffered from the downturn in the North American property market, which resulted in loan losses of CDollars 147m last year.</p>

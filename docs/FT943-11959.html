			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (8): Palms and prosperity - The date export market Since time immemorial, the date palm has been the source of wealth and the symbol of prosperity in certain Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries. As is true with the olive oil it produces, Tunisia belongs to a small group of countries which accounts for virtually all the dates produced in the world. Though it ranks second to Iraq as a producer and recently as an exporter, Tunisia can claim that its deglet nour date (the fingers of light) is the finest palm date in the world. The value of exports has more than doubled to USDollars 55m over the past 10 years. North Africa's smallest country possesses an undeniable comparative advantage where dates are concerned but the challenge presented by higher quality control, better packaging and modern marketing techniques is one which confronts many sectors in the food processing industries. Unlike other produce, however, European Union quotas do not pose a problem. Production of dates in Tunisia has always rested in private hands - 20,000 hectares, spread among thousands of small holders in the oasis around the towns of Tozeur and Kebili which lie on the northern and southern slopes of the Shott El Jerid salt flatlands of southern Tunisia. Three million date palm trees also produce wood and palm leaves widely used for building, fencing and fuel. As old palms stop producing dates, new ones have been planted and annual production figures today stand at 100,000 tonnes of dates every year. Date palms have to be individually pollinated and the fruit hand-picked, skills which risk becoming sparse as young Tunisians from the oasis are increasingly tempted by easier jobs offered in local hotels or in towns along the coast. Many oases are half abandoned today, yet their well-being is essential not only to keep the population on the land but to attract foreign tourists, who are discovering the pleasures of travelling in the desert in winter time in ever greater numbers. In the mid-1980s, the rising price of dates on world markets resulted in fast-growing incomes in the oasis. But higher incomes were not matched by greater efforts to ensure quality (which in particular means avoiding worms), by improving irrigation and fertilising methods. As world prices fell in the late 1980s because of greater competition, Tunisian producers learnt the hard way that there is no such thing as a free ride. According to exporters in Tunis, they now have a greater appreciation of the absolute need to improve quality. Until Mr Habib Bourguiba, the former president, halted his experiment in collectivised farming in 1969, the Societe Tunisienne des Industries Laitieres held a monopoly in respect of the conditioning and exporting of dates. The conditioning monopoly was abolished in 1971 and the export monopoly ended soon afterwards. Many of those involved in conditioning are actively promoting sales in the European Union where virtually all Tunisian dates are sold. Packaging has been much improved in recent years to meet European countries' requirements and break the stranglehold of a few middlemen in Marseilles who were, as one Tunisian exporter put it, 'a necessary evil.' Transport costs, however, remain high. Some dates are shipped in lorries. There is a container service between Tunis and Antwerp, even between Tunis and Los Angeles, but not between Tunis and Marseilles. Dates delivered to Los Angeles are thus only one-third more expensive than those delivered to France. Bringing down transport costs is no easy matter but Tunisian exporters are trying to meet the challenge. Worldwide production of dates amounts to about 1.5m tonnes annually, one-third of which is traded internationally. Tunisia is the second largest exporter, with 20,000 tonnes a year. Until the beginning of this decade, the most important exporter was Iraq, whose 200,000 tonnes of exports of lesser-quality dates were traditionally shipped in bulk, mostly to Asian markets, especially India. In recent years both production and exports of Iraqi dates have plummeted, their place being taken by dates from Iran and Pakistan which between them export roughly 150,000 tonnes every year to Asian markets. Tunisia has increased its exports since 1984 by nearly 50 per cent. Unlike Iraq, its dates are sold in small, attractive package boxes and they all go to European markets - 8,000 tonnes to France, 4,000 to Italy, 2,000 to Spain and Belgium respectively, 1,500 to the UK and 1,000 to Germany. The dates are increasingly sent directly to different European markets and distributed through big importers of dried fruit and foodstuffs, such as Geest of the UK and Torres of Spain. Tunisia faces competition from two sources today: Algeria and, increasingly, Israel. Algeria exports 8,000 tonnes of dates a year and has over the past two or three years undercut Tunisian prices as its producers are desperate to earn foreign exchange. Such competition is viewed by some Tunisians as disloyal. Others point out that by forcing them to cut transport costs and improve packaging and presentation, their neighbours are in the long run doing them a service. Israel exports 2,000 tonnes of deglet nour every year and has the advantage over Tunisia that its dates ripen three weeks earlier and are sold in Europe at the beginning of October in the run-up to the Christmas period. The onus is therefore on the Tunisian producers to find ways in which they can improve their methods of stocking and production or get dates to mature earlier. However, Israeli dates have a disadvantage in that their skins are thicker than those of Tunisian dates. But to convince European buyers of the quality difference, Tunisian marketing and promotion efforts will have to be stepped up. The other important exporter is California, which sells 5,000 tonnes of dates abroad a year. Californian dates are of poorer quality than those from Tunisia but, needless to say, marketing techniques are far more sophisticated.</p>

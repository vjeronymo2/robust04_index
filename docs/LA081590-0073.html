			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUDDENLY THE CRISIS FOCUS SHIFTS TO HOT, SLEEPY AQABA;  </P> <P> BLOCKADE: THE REFUSAL TO IMPLEMENT A U.N. BAN ON TRADE WITH IRAQ PUTS JORDAN IN  CONFLICT WITH THE U.S.  </P> <P> The half-dozen employees of the Iraqi-Jordanian Land Transport Co., a private  freight forwarder, sat Tuesday beneath a poster depicting the crossed flags of  Iraq and Jordan as they emphatically fingered their worry beads.  </P> <P> For more than a week, they said, no ship with cargo for Iraq has docked at the  Red Sea port, and the workers wondered when, or if, any would.  </P> <P> "This is not usual," said Isa Habaiba, a wiry worker. "We do not know what to  think."  </P> <P> The hot, sleepy port of Aqaba, Jordan's only window on the sea, is suddenly a  center of international tension. The government of Jordan has refused to  implement a U.N. ban on trade with Jordan's next-door neighbor, Iraq, which the  Security Council imposed after Iraq's invasion of the tiny oil state of Kuwait  on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> The refusal to close off Aqaba to Iraqi trade puts Jordan in conflict with the  United States. Jordan's leader, King Hussein, is visiting Washington today in  hopes of playing an arbiter's role in the conflict between the United States  and Iraq.  </P> <P> Bush Administration officials have expressed disappointment that Jordan has not  applied the U.N. sanctions. By putting warships in the Red Sea, the  Administration has indicated that it may take the issue out of King Hussein's  hands and blockade Aqaba, located on a gulf that is an arm of the Red Sea.  </P> <P> Washington has announced that American ships will enforce the embargo in both  the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, even though the United Nations stopped short  of ordering a blockade.  </P> <P> This makes for a nervous Jordanian port. "I think our business will shrink,"  said Habaiba, who told visitors that his company deals only in general cargo  and not arms.  </P> <P> Awad Tell, the port director at Aqaba, told reporters that he has received no  orders from Amman, Jordan's capital, to stop Iraqi use of the port. Freight  shippers said that earlier in the week the Norwegian freighter Tanga unloaded a  cargo of wheat bound for Iraq.  </P> <P> "Everything here is normal," said Tell. "We have received no special  instructions."  </P> <P> Asked whether Iraqi cargo had arrived or is expected, he answered with a  brusque, "No comment."  </P> <P> In recent days, Jordan has emerged as one of Iraq's most vocal allies. King  Hussein attacked the sending of American troops to defend Saudi Arabia as a  step toward colonizing the Arab world. Government officials have evaded the  question of whether Jordan will help implement U.N. sanctions against Iraq.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the monarch's brother, Prince Hassan, said that if Jordan is forced  to limit shipping at Aqaba, the country would expect to receive money in  return. "When the position of the navies moves from imposing sanctions to a  blockade and that threatens everyone in the region . . . I think those affected  are due compensation," he said.  </P> <P> Despite King Hussein's reluctance to act, cargo arriving at Aqaba for overland  shipment to Iraq seems to have slowed. Abdul Khader Amro, a freight forwarder,  said that at least five ships with Iraq-bound cargoes, seeking to sail from the  Mediterranean into the Red Sea, are being delayed at the Suez Canal by Egypt,  which backs the embargo against Iraq. The cargoes, Amro said, include oil  equipment and wheat.  </P> <P> "My silos are empty," he said. "Egypt is taking orders from America."  </P> <P> Aqaba sits at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba and shares a crescent-moon bay with  the Israeli city of Eilat to the west. The towns, which are in sight of each  other, are not on speaking terms: Jordan does not recognize Israel.  </P> <P> The closeness to Israel is another cause for worry among workers at the port.  David Levy, Israel's foreign minister, has accused Jordan of permitting Aqaba  to help Iraq evade the embargo. Jordanians took this as a warning that Israel  itself might block the port.  </P> <P> Perhaps the last time that Aqaba was in the world's headlines was when T. E.  Lawrence, the fabled Lawrence of Arabia, organized an attack by Arab rebels on  a Turkish garrison at the port during World War I. The charge by a camel  brigade from the desert galvanized the Arab revolt that Britain subsequently  encouraged to tie down troops of the Ottoman Empire, which was allied with  Germany.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Aqaba baked in 95-degree heat, but port workers said they  considered it a cool day. Seven ships sat on the mirror-flat waters of the  port. Three had arrived during the day. One was from Sudan and carried cotton,  another from France carried sugar, and a third from Yugoslavia was filled with  general cargo.  </P> <P> Reporters were not permitted to visit the port, and police inspected the notes  of several journalists who held interviews at businesses just outside the main  gate.  </P> <P> The Jordanians were not the only ones on the Red Sea shore to express tension  Tuesday. Not far away, the Israelis were feeling some of it too.  </P> <P> "I hope nothing happens here," said Hila Meroz, gazing from Eilat across the  Jordanian frontier at the ships in Aqaba harbor Tuesday afternoon. "I hope  there won't be any war."  </P> <P> The blonde, swimsuit-clad schoolteacher had just emerged from the salty waters  of the gulf. A few hundred yards out in the water, an Israeli gunboat swung at  its mooring buoy, almost bow-to-bow with a smaller Jordanian patrol boat on the  seaward side.  </P> <P> "That's the first time we've seen that Jordanian boat pull away from its dock,"  said an Israeli soldier, sitting in a jeep assigned to guard the border.  </P> <P> The land border between these twin cities is marked by an Israeli bunker flying  the Star of David and mounting an array of electronic monitoring devices.  </P> <P> The seaside frontier is designated by several red and white buoys, with signs  in Hebrew warning sailors that they are about to enter Jordanian waters.  </P> <P> Behind both cities rise harsh, rust-colored mountains, without a shred of  foliage, baking in the heat.  </P> <P> In addition to being a favorite resort of Israelis in the summer and northern  Europeans in the winter, Eilat is also an important Israeli port. On Tuesday, a  ship was unloading cars from Japan.  </P> <P> But attention here is focused on the ships in Aqaba, at anchor and docked.  Israeli intelligence agents have been keeping a sharp eye on seaborne traffic  into Aqaba, which is King Hussein's favorite Jordanian resort, a place where he  often water skis with guests.  </P> <P> Williams reported from Aqaba and Tuohy from Eilat.  </P></p>

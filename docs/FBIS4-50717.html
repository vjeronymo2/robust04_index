			<p>BFN     [Text] Hohhot, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China's longest local  railway -- from Jining to Tongliao in northern China's Inner  Mongolia Autonomous Region -- has been completed after nearly  four years of construction.    The 943-kilometer long railway, which cost 1.8 billion yuan,  will greatly ease the middle and short-range passenger and  freight transport pressure in northern China, officials from the  Ministry of Railways said at a ceremony yesterday.    The railway will be an important route for passengers, coal  and timber from the western part of the region to the eastern  coast. Rich natural resources will be better utilized and  development of minority nationalities-inhabited areas will be  accelerated, officials said.    The railway will be a section of the second Eurasia railway,  to run from Jinzhou city in Liaoning Province to Rotterdam in  the Netherlands via Erenhot, Ulaanbataar and Moscow.    The new local railway is aimed to have an annual handling  capacity of seven million tons in the near future and 17 million  tons later. The track crosses four leagues (prefectures) and 13  counties or banners.    The railway will cut 537 km off the route from the four  leagues to Hohhot, capital of the autonomous region, compared  with the old route via Hebei Province or Beijing.</p>

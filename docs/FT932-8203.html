			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Uruguay sees regional trend for Americas - Stephen Fidler interviews the president A FREE trade zone made up of the entire American continent is too ambitious an objective, and governments in the western hemisphere should concentrate instead on developing their own regional groupings, according to President Luis Alberto Lacalle of Uruguay. 'We should approach this step-by-step. I think the integration movement mustn't go to the top at the beginning, from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. No, nonsense,' he said in an interview. Instead, the first stage should be groups of countries getting together, as Uruguay is doing with its partners in Mercosur - Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. 'Mercosur is made real by geography. It is like a tree whose trunk is the River Plate and whose roots are in the Atlantic Ocean. 'That's why Mercosur makes sense and why the accession of Bolivia is reasonable. We are a mass of countries bound together. It's the same for Mexico, Canada and the US,' he said. Making Mercosur work was 'very difficult, so the idea for this generation, and perhaps for another one, is to try to make these things work.' Mr Lacalle's remarks were in response to a question about the possibility of Argentina being able to join the North American Free Trade Agreement of Mexico, Canada and the US. Washington has said that three South American countries - Chile, Argentina and Venezuela - would be candidates for accession to Nafta. But Mr Lacalle pointed out: 'Nafta is not a reality yet  -and that's a big if.' He said an important part of Bolivia looked to the Atlantic so it made sense for the land-locked country to join Mercosur. However, Bolivia is prevented by the Mercosur treaty from joining because it is a member of another trade organisation, the Andean Pact. Mr Lacalle said: 'We are trying to provide the possibility. It needs the agreement of the four (member) countries.' The president conceded that, when the common external tariff comes into effect on January 1 1995, 'perhaps we won't have a perfect common market' and there would be 'some exceptions to the common external tariff'. However, for most goods, the common external tariff would be about 20 per cent and there would be no internal tariffs. He said he hoped Montevideo, the Uruguayan capital, would become the permanent home for Mercosur's administrative secretariat.</p>

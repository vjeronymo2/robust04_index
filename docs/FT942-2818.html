			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Sanctions and N Korea That western countries would move towards imposing sanctions upon North Korea was inevitable following its removal of fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor with the apparent intent to make nuclear bombs. Coupled with its refusal to permit adequate inspections and its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which carries out the inspections, this action deserved a response - otherwise the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty would be worthless. As drafted by the US, the sanctions would be mild, and preceded by a grace period to give Pyongyang another chance to comply. The avoidance of more provocative measures is sensible: the world must continue to avoid the temptation to overreact. Though NPT principles are important, it should be remembered that India and Pakistan have developed nuclear capabilities with impunity. It has to be taken into account that North Korea is a small, isolated country run by an aged maverick who wants more international respect and has very few cards to play. The decision to draft moderate sanctions is also useful in that it helps to fend off hotheads in the US who are calling for precipitate action against Kim Il-sung - including former senior officials who ought to know better. At the same time, the proposed measures have a better chance of achieving an international consensus than would more draconian punishment. However, it would be pointless to pretend that the action contemplated will have much actual effect upon North Koreans, who eke out a poor but largely self-reliant existence. International contacts are so few that their reduction will barely be noticed. The US has stopped short of proposing a cut-off of foreign transfers of money because this would probably not be acceptable to Japan. Given the absence of real impact, and the possible consequences of imposing sanctions at all - North Korea promises to wage a 'pitiless war' - diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis without sanctions must be persevered with until the last possible moment. Former President Jimmy Carter's current visit to Pyongyang may prove useful. But China seems to hold the real key - especially as it can veto sanctions if it believes that their time has not yet arrived. Beijing's efforts to re-engage Pyongyang over the past week, playing host to officials including its chief of staff, should be given time to work. China and Japan, which with South Korea have the most to lose immediately from failure to resolve the crisis, have traditionally held back from direct involvement in international disputes. The failure so far of US-led efforts to bring North Korea round puts an extra onus upon them to use their influence to do so, to which Beijing and Tokyo appear to be responding. An Asian diplomatic solution to an Asian problem - backed by the threat of broader international action if necessary - is the desirable outcome.</p>

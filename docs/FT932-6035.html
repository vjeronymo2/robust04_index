			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / OECD ready for rush to discuss growth A YEAR ago, hardly any top-level ministers showed up. This year, officials organising the two-day annual ministerial meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which starts tomorrow in Paris, are wondering how to handle the crush of finance, trade and foreign ministers planning to attend. The interest in this week's meeting reflects mounting international concern about weak global growth, rising unemployment and protectionism. The US delegation is expected to be headed by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, Mr Mickey Kantor, the special trade representative, Ms Laura Tyson, head of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, Mr Lawrence Summers, the Treasury undersecretary responsible for international affairs, and Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary. Following last Friday's disclosure of weak first quarter US economic growth, European observers fear that the US will renew pressure on its trading partners for more expansionary economic policies and trade enhancing measures, while making clear that Washington will not hesitate to retaliate against what it perceives to be unfair trading practices. It is an approach that has provoked alarm among America's allies on several occasions since President Bill Clinton moved into the White House. If repeated this week, it would set the scene for a difficult meeting. In the run up to this week's talks, the OECD secretariat has become increasingly gloomy about slow global growth. But it feels that as long as most countries are running large budget deficits there is little scope for any to adopt a more expansionary fiscal policy. A possible exception is Japan, but its ministers will say that they announced a large fiscal expansion programme earlier this year and should be left to implement it. On the other hand, European diplomats recognise the pressures that an uneven and seemingly jobless recovery are putting on the US administration. Unemployment will feature large in this week's talks. Ministers will be presented with the interim conclusions of a two-year study commissioned from the OECD last year into the industrialised world's jobless problem. It is stronger on analysis than prescription, offering no magic solutions while drawing some bleak conclusions. Europe's job creation record appears to be especially poor, with the net increase in jobs since the early 1970s having been produced entirely by the civil service. Europe also has a very high level of long-term unemployed, with about half the region's jobless without work for more than a year. These facts could trigger a vigorous debate about the barriers to employment in Europe and especially those which prevent young people taking low-paid jobs. While opponents of 'poverty wages' argue that these create and perpetuate social problems, the OECD itself is sympathetic to the idea of the young gaining work experience even if the pay is low. The problems of rising unemployment in the industrialised world will cast a shadow over discussion of the OECD's area's relations with non-member countries. The delegates will have to reconcile their professed belief in free trade with the fact that non-OECD countries have been gaining markets from the industrialised world. The OECD secretariat is also keen for ministers to consider the implications for member economies of technological change, especially in the related fields of communications and computers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, June 4 (XINHUA) -- East China's Shandong  Province had invested over 80 million U.S. dollars to set up 226  enterprises in foreign countries and regions by the end of last  year.    Scattered in nearly 50 countries and regions, these  enterprises have expanded exports and obtained a great deal of  overseas market information for the province.    At the beginning of the 1980s, some foreign trade companies  first opened overseas agencies. Entering the 1990s, the  province made a number of favorable policies to encourage the  industrial companies to set up overseas agencies.    By now, many large enterprises, in the fields of chemicals,  textiles, metallurgy, machinery, aquatic products and medicines,  began to set up overseas agencies. The production enterprises  make up 50 percent of the total overseas agencies.    These overseas agencies not only undertake trading,  investment, information service, labor export, but also pool  overseas capital to the province.    By establishing overseas branches and opening the  international market, some giant enterprises of the province  have become trans- national enterprise groups.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / MPs press governor on BCCI MR ROBIN Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, endured a fierce cross-examination by MPs yesterday over the manner in which the Bank handled supervision of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Mr Leigh-Pemberton faced repeated questioning by members of the Treasury and Civil Service select committee over why he or another senior official of the Bank had not resigned over the report by Lord Justice Bingham into the BCCI affair. He rejected criticism of the Bank's style of supervision as 'passive and timid', and said it needed to retain experienced officials such as Mr Brian Quinn, executive director of banking supervision, to help it improve regulation. Ms Diane Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said BCCI showed that 'the amateurish, gentlemanly supervision that the Bank is noted for has failed'. She asked him: 'Would not the gentlemanly thing to do be to resign?' An early day motion signed yesterday by 91 Labour MPs, one Ulster Unionist and one Liberal Democrat, said it would leave Mr Leigh-Pemberton with 'neither credibility nor honour' to remain in office after the mishandling of BCCI. Mr Leigh-Pemberton, Mr Quinn and Mr Eddie George, the Bank's deputy governor, were questioned for two hours about Lord Justice Bingham's report. The report will be debated in the House of Commons tomorrow. Mr Leigh-Pemberton said that although the report by Lord Justice Bingham, criticised various aspects of how BCCI was handled, he 'never makes the statement that the Bank was negligent. That is the point about it.' The governor admitted that the Bank should not have waited until the BCCI closure before tightening supervision. 'If you say to me we should have effected these changes earlier and of our own volition, I would have to say yes,' he told the committee. But he said he could not 'take absolute responsibility for every bank'. 'Banking is a tricky business: there will be mistakes, there will be bad commercial judgments and there will be fraud,' he said. Mr Leigh-Pemberton argued that the Bank's record in the past six years showed it was not timid. In 35 cases, it had required banks to take remedial action 'without fuss'; and there had been 17 cases of licences being revoked. He disputed Lord Bingham's conclusion that the Bank had too narrow a view of its powers to act against BCCI under the 1987 Banking Act, saying it had known the extent of its powers but had not thought there was enough evidence to apply them. Members of the committee criticised the Bank's failure in 1984 to force BCCI into accepting a corporate structure that would have been easier to supervise although it had debated a change for two years before approaching the bank. But Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he did not think he had 'the necessary leverage at this time to force on the bank an alternative structure'. The informal authority of 'the power of my eyebrows' would not have been enough, he said. He insisted that although the Bank had made mistakes, none had been so fundamental that avoiding it would have made the final outcome of the BCCI closure any different.</p>

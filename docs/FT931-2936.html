			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Brittan warns of US trade curbs in row over contracts THE EUROPEAN Community yesterday ruled out concessions in the escalating dispute with the US over government procurement practices and predicted that the Clinton administration would impose sanctions from Monday. Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic relations, said he was 'certain' the US would bar European companies from certain federal contracts, in spite of today's meeting in Washington between President Bill Clinton and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. The long-planned White House meeting between Mr Clinton and Mr Delors has taken on sharper focus because of trade tensions between the US and EC, but Sir Leon said only 'a big deal' be-tween the two leaders would de-flect sanctions. The prospects for such a deal were remote, he said. Senior EC officials said the Community had drawn up retaliatory measures, but would wait until after a meeting in Brussels between Sir Leon and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in Brussels in 10 days' time. The Brussels talks would give Mr Kantor a chance to explain US trade policy in the light of recent inflammatory rhetoric and an apparent preference for unilateral action, the EC official said. Mr Kantor surprised EC and his own officials on Friday by cancelling two days of talks in Brussels on the procurement dispute. The decision was apparently made after the EC refused to suspend article 29 of its new Utilities Directive which gives a 3 per cent price preference to European companies bidding for government contracts in telecommunications, energy and water. Sir Leon this week sought to defuse the row by offering to sponsor jointly with the US an independent report into the facts of the dispute. Asked yesterday if he would waive article 29 while such a study was under way, Sir Leon replied: 'No way.' The EC directive came into effect at the beginning of the year. In the first 10 weeks of the directive's life, 1,000 contracts have been notified that previously would not have been open for international tender, worth about Ecu15bn (Pounds 12.39bn), according to an EC official. The US has indicated that it intends to bar European companies from about Dollars 40m (Pounds 28m) of federal contracts. The sum is small in comparison to the vast government procurement market, but it has taken on added significance because of parallel disputes over aviation and steel subsidies, and the continuing impasse in the Gatt Uruguay Round trade talks. Sir Leon expressed some frustration at the 'muscle flexing' the US was doing at the expense of the EC, but insisted that he remained confident that 'on the big picture, the US still says it wants to reach an agreement'.

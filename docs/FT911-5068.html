			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Think tank calls for government homes bank THE establishment of a government-sponsored investment bank to raise finance for council, housing-association and private landlords is proposed in a report published today by the Institute for Public Policy Research. It also recommends that mortgage tax relief be phased out on new home loans. That would not affect existing home loans, it says. The report from the left-of-centre think tank proposes a two-tier private rented market. One would be an unregulated sector where landlords would be permitted to charge market rents but would receive no public subisidies. Tenants would be ineligible for housing benefit. In the other, regulated sector, landlords would not pay tax on rental income and would qualify for housing improvement grants. In return, rents would be fixed and tenants would be entitled to security of tenure, says Mr Stephen Merrett, the report's author and reader in housing studies at University College London. Mr Merrett said a Housing Investment Bank would raise funds wholesale from international money markets and would not require Treasury finance. Quality and Choice in Housing.

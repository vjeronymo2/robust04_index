			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO NASTY MARINES  </P> <P> I was relieved to hear that both the Navy and the Marines have banned sales of  "As Nasty as They Wanna Be."  </P> <P> I'm sure their reason for the ban was not censorship but rather to protect  their tender recruits from hearing the foul language and sexually explicit  material contained on this album.  </P> <P> After all, when a sailor comes into port, illicit sex is the furthest thing  from his mind.  </P> <P> And any drill instructor can tell you how easily a Marine is offended by foul  language.  </P> <P> KEN CHASE  </P> <P> Hawthorne  </P></p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Dana funding and capital proposals Dana Exploration, the principal activity of which is the exploration for precious and base metals in Ireland and overseas, announced proposals for a fund raising together with a capital reorganisation and a reduction of capital. The company is to raise Pounds 150,000 net by way of an open offer of 15,872,600 new ordinary shares at 1p each on the basis of two new shares for each share held. Any shares not taken up will be placed on the market on a 'best endeavours' basis by MMI Stockbrokers. To permit the offer to proceed, a capital restructuring is necessary and a new class of shares with a par value below that of the existing ordinary 10p shares is to be issued. This means a reduction of Dana's share capital by IPounds 714,267. Hardman Resources and Tolltrek Systems now own 58.77 per cent of Dana following an offer for Dana in August.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> FILM FEATURES NOVELIST'S HOUSE  </P> <P> Cobblestones will be put down today in front of novelist Anne Rice's house,  where a movie company is filming part of a movie based on Kate Chopin's novel  "The Awakening," starring Kelly McGillis.  </P> <P> The novel, set in the 1880s, is about a woman who rejects Victorian moral and  sexual standards, with tragic consequences. Along with playing its main  character, artist Edna Pontellier, McGillis also is the executive producer.  </P> <P> Rice's house turned out to be unexpectedly perfect for the Pontellier mansion  because her husband, Stan, paints and has a studio on the third floor.  </P> <P> "Our search for a third-floor atelier -- I guess that's French for studio? --  ended when we found that Stan already had one," location manager Mike Neale  said.  </P></p>

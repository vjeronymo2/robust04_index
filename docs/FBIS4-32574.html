			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(kou)": "The Civic Democratic Party Has Halted </F> the Decline in Support"]    [Text] Prague--The Civic Democratic Party [ODS] fortified  its dominant position in the opinion polls in June when it  received 31.4 percent of popular support. The ODS's three-month  decline has thus been halted (in March 32 percent would have  voted for it, 31 percent in April, and 29 percent in May). This  was apparent from the results of the opinion poll conducted by  the Center for Empirical Research (STEM) in June among 1,500  respondents. The Czech Social Democratic Party [CSSD] came  second, with 13.9 percent; the Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA]  came third, with 12.9 percent; and the Communist Party of  Bohemia and Moravia [KSCM] came fourth, with 6.8 percent.    The Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party  [KDU-CSL] (4 percent in May; 6.2 percent in June) and the  Association for the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia  [SPR-RSC] (4 percent in May; 5.2 percent in June) would also  cross the 5-percent threshold for election to parliament; the  governing coalition Christian Democratic Party [KDS], for  example, would not.    The three strongest parties of the governing coalition would  receive half the votes in total.    It is not obvious from the poll what percentage of the vote  the Party of the Democratic Left and the Left Bloc Party would  receive. STEM brackets these parties with the KSCM under the  name Left Bloc conglomerate [and gives them] 10.9 percent.    According to STEM, 63 percent of the electorate would take  part in the elections, 14 percent would not, and 23 percent  still do not know. The June party rankings concur with the  representative poll conducted by STEM in late May and early  June, which involved almost 12,000 respondents (the newly  constituted Democratic Union [DEU] would, according to it,  receive 0.6 percent).    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |How People Would Vote(in percent)                                          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Apr               |May               |Jun               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |ODS               |31                |29                |31                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |CSSD              |16                |14                |14                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |ODA               |13                |15                |13                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |KSCM              |7                 |7                 |7                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |KDU-CSL           |5                 |4                 |6                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SPR-RSC           |4                 |4                 |5                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Free Democrats    |3                 |3                 |3                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bohemian-Moravian |2                 |2                 |1                 |  |Center Party      |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Greens            |2                 |2                 |1                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |KDS               |1                 |1                 |1                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |DEU               |                  |0.5               |1                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Liberal Social Un-|1                 |1                 |0.5               |  |ion               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD'S LOST GENERATION OF WOMEN;  </P> <P> A WEALTH OF TALENT GOES UNCHALLENGED AND UNAPPRECIATED AS THE FILM INDUSTRY  GIVES TODAY'S ACTRESSES FEW MEATY ROLES  </P> <P> In "Pretty Woman," Julia Roberts plays a minty-fresh hooker who finds true love  with her wealthy john. In "Miami Blues," Jennifer Jason Leigh's hooker is a  perky, girl-next-door type who yearns for homespun married bliss with a  psychopathic trick. In "Last Exit to Brooklyn," Jason Leigh is a tough-tender  streetwalker who lures unsuspecting galoots to their doom.  </P> <P> What does it say about Hollywood that, of all the roles being offered actresses  right now, these three are probably the juiciest? Women are such an endangered  species in the movies that the vamp has become high concept.  </P> <P> There have probably never been as many gifted actresses in America as there are  right now, but their gifts have been allowed to flourish almost exclusively in  the theater or on television. On stage, performers like Mercedes Ruehl ("Other  People's Money") and Joan Allen ("Burn This") and Patti Lu Pone ("Evita") are  electrifying. On television, you watch Annette O'Toole in "The Kennedys of  Massachusetts" in a state of rapt admiration. When these same actresses show up  in films, it's likely to be in scrunched-up bit roles: Ruehl had a dismally  strait-laced cameo as a sympathetic shrink in "Crazy People"; Lu Pone was  shoehorned into "Driving Miss Daisy"; Allen was an extended blip on the screen  in such films as "Tucker" and "In Country." O'Toole was harrowing as a  distraught wife in "Love at Large" -- for all of her 10 (count 'em) minutes of  screen time.  </P> <P> Even the actresses well known -- honored -- for their past film work are likely  nowadays to be playing blurry back-ups to the male lead. In "Bird on a Wire,"  Goldie Hawn appears to have entered a boodie-shaking contest with Mel Gibson.  (Worse, she loses the contest.) Barbra Streisand and Bette Midler are the  female stars with the greatest clout, but Streisand is just now about to begin  filming her first film in three years, and Midler has turned into a weepy  self-parody. Even her silly, wiggly walks lack spring.  </P> <P> It's heartbreaking to scan the pool of great (or potentially great) actresses  out there: Not just the famous ones, like Jessica Lange and Debra Winger and  Michelle Pfeiffer, but the scores of the less renowned -- Maria Conchita  Alonso, Bridget Fonda, Joan Cusack, Joan Chen, Pamela Reed, Lena Olin, Natasha  Richardson, Anjelica Huston, Christine Lahti, Dianne Wiest, Laurie Metcalfe,  Ellen Barkin, Kathy Bates -- to mention only a handful. The embarrassment in  this embarrassment of riches is that these actresses, all primed for major  careers, are entombed in Hollywood's development-deal dungeons. An entire  generation of female performers is being squelched by an industry that finds no  percentage in accommodating their talents. And by repeatedly going buddy-buddy  or solo, an entire generation of male performers is being squelched, too.  </P> <P> Things were not always this bad. Until the past several decades, women were as  integral to the movies as men; female stars were as hallowed as their male  counterparts. Lillian Gish and Richard Barthelmess were equally revered. Greta  Garbo hogged as much of the glory as John Gilbert. The goddesses, like Joan  Crawford and Lana Turner, were, in their heyday, as big a box-office draw as  the gods, like Gable and Bogart. Their salaries were commensurate, too; money  is always a tip-off to what Hollywood thinks of you. The roles of Hollywood's  Golden Age goddesses may not have been any more complex or advanced than the  roles offered today's top stars (although many of them were), but at least  there were far more of them, and the characterizations, because they were  designed to fulfill people's fantasies, meant something special to audiences.  </P> <P> The old studio system was responsible for many travesties, but most of the  memorable movie goddesses, from Garbo and Dietrich through Gardner and Monroe,  were creations of that system. The studio's stable of writers and directors and  cinematographers and costume designers were allowed to work up intensely  creative partnerships with performers. The studio machinery was geared up for  the long run of an actor's career. Aging beauties were eased into more  "realistic" roles.  </P> <P> Today, an actress who has passed unrecognized into her 30s stands almost no  chance of making it, because in that age bracket the roles just aren't there  for her to be discovered. And even the actresses who do achieve success in  their 20s and 30s often find they've been put out to pasture later on. The  vital female stars of only a decade or so ago, like Jill Clayburgh and Ellen  Burstyn and Cicely Tyson, are, for all intents and purposes, in a state of  involuntary semi-retirement from the movies. Like their younger counterparts,  the ones without movie work, they reserve their occasional successes these days  for the stage or TV. It's as if their movie careers never happened.  </P> <P> The free-agency of the current, post-studio-system era has not been kind to the  creation of movie stars. Left to their own devices, many stars choose projects  that are almost comically wrong for them (like Jane Fonda's spinster gringa in  "Old Gringo," or Dustin Hoffman as Sean Connery's son in "Family Business").  But male stars at least have a surplus of decent roles to fight over, since  virtually all of the "important" movies, and most of the unimportant ones, are  written expressly for them. With women, what's left after Meryl Streep goes  shopping?  </P> <P> The movie business is increasingly being driven by the blockbuster mentality,  and blockbusters are almost always action epics in which women are relegated to  a status position somewhere between the hardware and the special effects. The  true partnership in these films is between man and machine. The production  costs are rising -- "Total Recall" and "Die Hard 2," for example, both  reportedly around $60 million. At a time when foreign markets are becoming  almost as lucrative as domestic ones, it makes commercial sense to stock these  films with American stars who have international appeal. And that invariably  means male action heroes. Don't count on seeing "Batwoman" any time soon  (particularly after the smashing success of "Supergirl").  </P> <P> For women in the movies, their heroism is reserved almost entirely for the  emotional arena, where the triumphs are less photogenic -- i.e. less saleable.  Occasionally you get something like Sigourney Weaver as an intergalactic Mother  Courage battling aliens, but most female action heroines are simply women  recast in standard male scenarios, like the lady cops of "Blue Steel" and  "Impulse."  </P> <P> The scant supply of meaningful roles for women isn't only a product of the  blockbuster mentality; it's equally linked to Hollywood's avoidance of what is  disparagingly referred to as "women's issues." The conflicts of contemporary  women don't fit neatly into the standard Hollywood story lines, and in today's  Hollywood, neatness counts. The disarray of modern relationships is confusing  and threatening -- that is to say, uncommercial -- to studio heads. And these  days, with the demise of most of the small independent companies, the studios  are practically the only game in town. Since the new conflicts are not readily  marketable, and the old conflicts, in a contemporary setting at least, are  moldy, the studio solution has been to can the conflicts altogether.  </P> <P> On television, where projects can move into production faster and where there  is less at stake commercially than in the movies, one is much more likely to  see honest depictions of women's emotional lives, even the messier aspects; one  is also much more likely to see, especially in the never-never-land of the  soaps, the kind of old-fashioned romantic scenarios that thrived in the '40s  and '50s. There's something for everyone, and if the TV shows are no good,  there's still the great old romantic movies on view on cable TV, a spectral  reminder of what once was.  </P> <P> It's no accident that virtually the only movies to offer full-scale roles for  women these days are the ones either set in the past, like "Enemies, a Love  Story" and "Dangerous Liaisons" and "Driving Miss Daisy," or else in some  dream-time present, like "The Fabulous Baker Boys," which draws on our romantic  notions about the past as filtered through the movies. The pastness of these  movies functions as a kind of shield from contemporary concerns, and yet,  because many of them feature a real avidity for sexual and emotional conflict,  they seem more alive, more in the present tense, than many of the contemporary  movies. ("Enemies," set in 1949, is a lot more vital than, say, the modern-day  "Stanley &amp; Iris" or "Stella," both of which might have emerged from the  '30s.)  </P> <P> The truly contemporary movies that attempt to show off "modern" conflicts often  end up schizzy and retrograde. "Baby Boom" proffered an impossible fantasy; it  said women could be CEOs and homemakers and land Mr. Right, all at the same  time. "Working Girl" featured a heroine, Melanie Griffith's Tess, who was both  ditz and whiz; she reaches the top because of her business smarts but also,  although the film doesn't point it up, because (unbeknown to her) she sleeps  with the right guy.  </P> <P> Of course, the weirdest hybrid fantasy around is the aforementioned "Pretty  Woman." If you bother to take this retooled "Pygmalion" seriously, you might  balk at the dubiousness of its dual protagonists: Julia Roberts' Vivian, the  happy hooker with a heart of gold, and Richard Gere's corporate raider with a  heart of gold. Cliches old and new, both crocks. The film is a smash hit, but  it's also provoked more vehemence from moviegoers I've heard from than any  other current film I can recall. It confirms a dirty little truth: retrograde  fantasies still hold sway.  </P> <P> Vivian could have been something else besides a prostitute and the film would  still have fulfilled its fairy tale aspirations. And yet, in the current movie  climate, it makes perfect sense that she is one. The film solves the problem of  how to create a modern romantic relationship by making it strictly cash and  carry (at first). The film is like a reversal of those gold-digger comedies  where Marilyn Monroe cajoled the Corporate Man into loving his millions -- in  order, of course, to lavish them on her. In "Pretty Woman," Vivian shames her  john into looking beyond his millions (while still reaping their benefits).  "Pretty Woman" functions as a warped Prince Charming fantasy for women while,  for upscale men, it offers the reassuring life lesson that women aren't just  after them for their money.  </P> <P> I don't mean to imply that actresses should only play "politically correct"  parts. As a matter of fact, most roles worth playing are politically incorrect.  Who would argue with Jane Fonda's performance in "Klute"? Or, for that matter,  with Julia Roberts' amazing work in "Pretty Woman," or Jennifer Jason Leigh's  in her two current films. But the sudden influx of these roles is, I think,  part of a long-term industry-wide retreat from feminist concerns. At the root  of these concerns is the old male bugaboo: Can women be trusted -- as business  associates, as sex partners, wives? As equals? The answer usually takes the  form these days of a brutal put-down. The implication of a film like "Pretty  Woman" is that Vivian is a hooker not because of degraded economic necessity  but because she chooses to be one -- because she deserves to be one.  </P> <P> In the immediate post-World War II era, women who had entered the work force  during the war found themselves cast out and replaced by returning veterans.  Hollywood responded to the problem by concocting fantasy goddesses -- the  pneumatic, walking, talking pin-ups who reached their apotheosis in Marilyn  Monroe. Their cheesecake glamour, totally without threat, was a kind of  antidote to the anxieties of the times.  </P> <P> In today's sexually confused society, Hollywood's response to feminism can't be  as blithely concocted as in those va-va-va-voom days. As a result, there are  very few, if any, "pure" sex sirens on screen today, certainly none who are  major stars (Madonna probably comes closest). Male stars, because their appeal  is more simplified and comprehensible, have even taken over the pin-up function  from women. The latest films of Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise and Eddie Murphy  practically dispense with female co-stars altogether. They're self-infatuated  swoon-a-thons.  </P> <P> The dynamism of many of Hollywood's legendary actresses, like Bette Davis and  Katharine Hepburn and Barbara Stanwyck, often carried a threat even when their  roles didn't. And it's often been the case in the past that men, more so than  women, responded to these stars. Men don't usually go for the ladylike types;  paradoxically, they seem to want more of a challenge from their female stars  than do the women in the audience.  </P> <P> But the only dynamic, threatening women in the movies right now are the  crazies. Their conflicts may develop from a realistic base, like Glenn Close's  spurned avenger in "Fatal Attraction" or Kathleen Turner's miserably unhappy  wife in "The War of the Roses," but invariably these characters spin off into a  self-immolating, horror-flick rage. Even a "role-model" heroine like Sigourney  Weaver's Dian Fossey in "Gorillas in the Mist" is made to seem inhumanly  obsessed with her mission. Her heroism comes across as lunacy.  </P> <P> Everybody recognizes that the movies reflect shifting attitudes in society, but  that doesn't mean that those attitudes automatically show up in the movies. At  least not right away. There's a built-in time lag in the way Hollywood  confronts social upheavals -- look at how long it took to get Vietnam on the  screen -- and never more so than in these dog days of the bottom line.  Hollywood's solution to the "woman problem" may yet result in a compensatory  avalanche of strong, complex, smart, funny female portrayals. In the meantime,  this waiting game is excruciating.  </P></p>

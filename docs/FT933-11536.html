			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Labour U-turn over high taxes and spending MR GORDON BROWN last night signalled a permanent break with Labour's high public spending and tax policies, pledging to replace them with an economic strategy designed to advance individual opportunity. In a blunt assessment directed as much at the party faithful as at the wider electorate, the shadow chancellor said that Labour would remain unelectable as long as it was seen as hostile to individual aspiration. His statement - completing the U-turn in economic policy which began after last year's general election defeat - said that Labour must abandon 'the attempt to freshen up old postures by ever more extravagant new spending or borrowing commitments'. It marked the beginning of a fresh attempt by the Labour leadership to push the party's economic policy further towards the political centre ground and, crucially, to broaden the party's appeal to the affluent working and middle classes. Mr Brown said that Labour's analysis of successive election defeats since 1979 had shown the electorate was unwilling to elect a party which was perceived as 'wanting to tax people for its own sake'. Past shopping lists of spending commitments designed to appeal to particular groups would be a replaced by a strategy designed to tie all tax and spending policies to objectives which 'increase the individual's prosperity and quality of life'. He said: 'Put simply, we do not look for increased opportunities to tax; we will not tax unless we increase opportunities for people.' Mr Brown sought to answer criticism that he has failed to exploit the Conservatives' economic 'failure' by dismissing the arguments of those in the Labour party who equated radicalism with adding billions to whatever happened to be the government's spending or borrowing total. Instead Labour had to broaden its appeal to become the party of opportunity, not only for its traditional supporters but also for 'millions of small businessmen and women and for the self-employed'. He said that the party should learn the lesson also of the approach adopted by Lady Thatcher when she led the Tory opposition in the late 1970s. Instead of offering detailed plans on spending or tax, she adopted the tactic of pressing a broad set of themes built around the principle of enhancing opportunity.</p>

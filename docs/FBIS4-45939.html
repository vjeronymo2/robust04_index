			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nuclear Option"] </F>   [Text] The Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao, has done well  to reiterate India's policy on nuclear proliferation and  emphasise that, while India is for a universal and comprehensive  disarmament, suggestions to restrict India's own nuclear options  are unacceptable and unrealistic in the current world and  regional context. Given the recent visit of the U.S. deputy  secretary of state, Mr Strove Talbott, to New Delhi and  Islamabad in pursuit of America's declared aim of "capping,  reducing and eventually eliminating" nuclear weapons and  ballistic missiles in South Asia, it was important for the Prime  Minister to tell an assembly of army commanders that India's  policy would not change. Since 1988, this policy has had a  specific framework in the form of the action plan by the year  2010 presented by Rajiv Gandhi to the United Nations session on  disarmament. Under it, the onus for ending the nuclear arms race  rests squarely on the shoulders of the big powers, and its  centrepiece is an international treaty to replace the NPT  [Nonproliferation Treaty], which will see the complete  elimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2010. Things have not  quite moved the way Rajiv Gandhi anticipated even after the end  of the cold war and the partial elimination of the fears of a  nuclear holocaust. Not only have the nuclear weapons states  remained silent on the subject of the universal elimination of  nuclear weapons, Britain, France and China have taken no  concrete steps to join the `big two' in reducing their nuclear  weapons.    On the other hand, countries like India have come under  pressure to take steps to reassure the world that they will not  make nuclear weapons, despite India's proven track record of  responsible behaviour in this area. For this very reason, Mr  Rao's observations are important. When the subject is nuclear  proliferation, there is in any case great need for precision,  especially because India's known position on the issue is one of  carefully cultivated ambiguity. In this context, Mr Atal Behari  Vajpayee may not be wrong in pointing out that India's stand on  nuclear issues is not related to Pakistan alone, but he is  perhaps reading too much into the Prime Minister's statement as  reported in the media. A closer reading of the official release  makes it clear that Mr Rao had in mind a wider context,  including areas other than Pakistan where such weapons could be  found. The Prime Minister cannot but be aware of the strong  feelings that the subject arouses in the country, especially  since India has chosen the responsible policy of merely  retaining, but not exercising, the nuclear option. Unlike other  countries which depend on alliances for their security, India is  a self-professedly non-aligned country which must ensure its own  in a world or a region which is not entirely peaceful.</p>

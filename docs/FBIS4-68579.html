			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Agapov, president of the Kredo-Bank, </F> candidate of economic sciences, and Oleg Lavrushin, president of  the Center for Banking Research, academician: "What Is a Bank in  Russia? Proposals for Reform of Our Banking System"]    [Text]  <H5>  Position </H5>   Calls for reform of Russia's banking system, including its  Central Bank, have begun to appear more and more frequently in  the press recently. In the opinion of some, the Russian banking  sector should be transformed based on American experience  (following the model of the Federal Reserve System of the United  States). Others think that the banking system of Russia should  be reformed according to the German model (following the  experience of the Bundesbank, with a developed network of branch  banks and strict control from the center). While agreeing in  principle with the need for banking reform, the Central Bank  thinks that it should not be conducted hastily, but gradually,  that it will take about two years to complete it, that to  mechanically apply readymade structures from other countries to  a Russian base is unfeasible, and that it would be more correct  to take advantage of the experience both of the Federal Reserve  System and Bundesbank and of the Central Bank of Russia.    Inclining more toward a position of a weighed approach which  takes into account both the patterns and the peculiarities in  the development of the banking business, national culture and  historical traditions, and the overall condition of the Russian  economy as an economy in transition, we, however, think that  when determining the direction for the development of its  banking system Russian society must first resolve a number  of principle issues for itself.    Do we have the right to reform the banking system or would  it  be more correct in this stage to speak about creating its  design? Does this system exist in Russia or does it still have  to be formed? In which stage of bank construction are we and are  we certain enough about how what has developed should be  transformed? Can we postpone the transformation of banking in  the country and limit ourselves solely to discussions and  declarations, allowing ourselves to become involved in heated  but particular discussions (this would not be the first time  this has happened in our life, it is happening at this very  moment as we are beginning to react to one idea or another that  has been foisted upon us) and philosophize at length without  proposing something specific in exchange? Finally, will we  continue for long to grasp individual ideas and parts without  resolving questions of its creation and management  comprehensively? When answering these questions a great deal  depends on how we evaluate what has already happened with our  banks. If we understand the task as being primarily to destroy  the old system--the monopolism of the former State Bank of the  USSR, the state monopoly in forming banks, then we can say that  we have carried it out to a considerable degree: The Gosbank  [State Bank] as a concept in the history of Russian banking has  receded into the past and modern business banks are being  generated not only on state but also on private initiative. If,  however, we set as our tasks not only to destroy but also to  construct something new and adequate to the market, then,  naturally, the answer will be negative. One can probably agree  that our banking system is for the time being some kind of  hybrid of the market and centralized systems. The Central Bank  is no longer the state bank, but it is not a bank that  corresponds to a market economy. Commercial banks are not  branches of a single giant but they are still far from being  banks that have their own set of banking services and have the  capital base and technology of operations enabling them to carry  out large-scale capital investments.    Which path shall we take from here? Let us try to formulate  several general approaches.    1. First of all we should agree that transformations in  the banking sector are not short-term acts, they are a  long-term, stage-by-stage program of actions based on increasing  both the activity of the Central Bank itself and the activity of  large commercial banks, banking associations, scientific  centers, and organizations.    2. During the process of reconstruction of the banking  system  we cannot reform just one element of it--just the Central Bank  or just the commercial banks. The formation of a new type  of banking system must be comprehensive in nature,  affect all elements of the banking sector, provide  for the necessary interaction among them, and provide for  effective functioning not only of the Central Bank but also of  the banking sector as a whole.    3. I would like to give warning about something else--we  must  not regard the transformations of the banking sector as a  panacea for solving all and especially larger (than purely  banking) national economic problems.    With all their economic and political power the banks  operate  in a sphere which is only a part of the reproduction of society.  Their activity is linked to the formation and distribution of  monetary resources and mobilization of savings for the needs of  economic development.    The monetary-credit policy of the banks therefore can  resolve a limited number of problems. Of course, it can  exert an influence on the acceleration (retardation), and  expansion (narrowing) of production, but mainly through  exchange, a system of special (monetary) instruments. The banks  influence the utilization of resources and have an impact on  liquidity, capitalization of incomes, consumer demand, and  capital investments, but one must not forget that they operate  on the basis of already created accumulations, their  "capital-creating" capabilities are limited, and they  are practically nonexistent under conditions of high inflation.  To exaggerate or underestimate the role of the monetary-credit  policy are two extremes, both of which can lead to new  disproportions.    4. Banking monetary instruments are capable of exerting an  influence on social development only in concert and  simultaneously with other instruments. Transformations in  the sphere of banking should therefore be regarded only as part  of systemic general economic transformations. Since the  banking system as a whole in a certain sense is derived from the  economic and political structure of the country and since  changes in the banking sector should take place only to the  proper degree and as a reflection under the conditions of the  transition period and in real branches of the national economy  and state and political structures.    Therefore one can assert that the transformation of the  banking system is merely an element of the overall economic  strategy, which is called upon to serve the process of other  reforms (in the area of diversification of property,  demobilization, the establishment of new markets, restructuring  of interregional and interrepublic relations, etc.).    5. The reforming of banks has independent significance and  should provide for democratization of the banking system,  strengthening of credit institutions, and the formation of a  banking market and banking infrastructure.    Transformations in the banking system should, in our view,  begin with a solution to certain conceptual problems.  Strange as it may be, they include discovering the essence  of the banking system itself. Let us recall that the  banking system is frequently interpreted as the totality of  particular banking and nonbanking institutions (so-called credit  institutions). With this approach there is no system,  because a system presupposes not only elements in relation to  one another as they interact but also elements that are  interconnected with the external environment. It includes,  consequently, not only the aforementioned credit institutions  but also something that is actually lacking in our life, namely  a banking infrastructure, a money market, and a legislative  base.    Unfortunately, a banking market in the real sense of  the word has not yet been formed in Russia. Accumulations,  on whose basis the banking sector could develop and which could  nourish the resource base of commercial banks, are clearly  inadequate. The average deposit of the population as of the  beginning of this year was little more than 1,400 rubles [R].  Bank deposits (including call deposits and short-term deposits  in the Sberbank, and also certificates of deposit) amounted to  R8,135 billion or 21.1 percent of the overall money supply. The  proportion of deposits in commercial banks was little more than  11 percent. Deposits from the population in the overall total of  liabilities of Russian commercial banks amounted to a miserly  sum--0.88 percent (as of 1 September 1993). The capital base of  enterprises has been bled dry by the severe inflation. Many  years will pass before real accumulations will reach a level  sufficient to consider the banks to be provided with resources  for granting credit.    The market presupposes vigorous trade. Although trade among  banks is developing, a number of commercial banks are operating  not so much with their own capital and capital in the accounts  of their clients along with interbank credit as on the basis of  regular infusions from the Central Bank. Centralized loans  account for more than 80 percent of the overall sum of credit  obtained by commercial banks from other banks.    Essentially, the old machine for distribution of  resources in the form of credit limits of the State Bank  have largely been replaced by a system of distribution of  credit of the Central Bank. One can say that the system of  market mechanisms, including the sale of credit at auctions, is  just taking its first steps.    The fundamental questions include also the very  understanding of a bank, its essence, functions, and role  in the economy. Let us note that it is not such a simple matter  to give a definition to a bank. Banks have been in existence for  several millennia and their modern activity is so diverse that  sometimes it is not easy to distinguish them from other  financial institutions. Yet an analysis of their essence makes  it incumbent on us to single out something special, specific; in  a word it makes it incumbent on us to single out that which  distinguishes the phenomenon under consideration from any other.    In modern science and practice the definition of a  "bank" is approached from two positions: legal and  economic. From the legal standpoint a "bank" is defined  from the position of what it does (which operations it performs)  and what it can do. Of course, this approach has a right to  exist, but it can only be of secondary significance. What seems  more rational to us is an analysis that includes in the essence  of a bank what it does and how this distinguishes it from other  institutions and therefore makes it a bank as such as distinct  from other financial institutions.    Unfortunately, our previous research on banks was not as  deep  as we would have liked. Let us recall that it was linked to the  understanding of the bank as part of the state apparatus, of a  particular superstructure. Hence--the more banks there were, the  greater the costs of administration and the more national income  that was eaten up. Such an understanding was justified to a  certain degree. Society and the banks lived with a different  kind of measurement, interbank competition did not exist and  could not under the conditions where the spheres of activity of  numerous credit institutions were divided up and essentially  there was mandatory "registration"--assigning each client to a  particular bank.    The market changes the position of the bank. It forces banks  to work not with resources obtained from above through  distribution but on the basis of its own capital and largely on  the basis of what it has managed to collect from its clients.  Under the conditions of the market the productive nature of  banking activity is manifested more clearly. The bank creates  its own specific product in the form of means of payment and  traditional and nontraditional services, without which it is  impossible to maintain or accelerate production and circulation.  The bank inevitably becomes part of the base of society and  creates a certain increase in gross product and national income.    The concept of a "bank" thus goes beyond the framework of  the  purely theoretical debate. Unless this concept is defined  correctly we cannot defend the interests of depositors or  correctly conduct tax policy regarding banks and we open up the  possibility for nonbank institutions to unjustifiably acquire  the status of a bank.    In our view, the productive character of banking  activity gives us every justification to depart from the  old representatives [as published] and inevitably leads us  to a definition of a "bank" as a basic element--as a  special enterprise. This is demonstrated by international  experience as well. In the modern legislation of a number of  developed countries (Germany, France, and others) the bank is  described precisely as an enterprise. There is also other  evidence of this which may be indirect but is nonetheless  important. It is no accident that according to generally  accepted ideas the bank is characterized as an independent  autonomously financed legal entity, and many normative documents  regarding the bank and the enterprise proceed from the same  principles and provisions (inclusion of expenditures in  production cost, taxation, etc.).    Let us assume that the concept "banks" in the Law "On Banks  and Banking Activity" can be defined as follows (two versions):    1. "A bank is an enterprise that engages in the emission of  means of payment on a credit basis, cash settlement services for  clients, and accumulation and distribution of monetary means on  the basis of repayment and interest payment."    2. "A bank is an enterprise that produces a specific product  in the form of emission of means of payment, organization of  settlements, accumulation of resources, and their distribution  based on principles of recoverability."    It is no accident that we began by speaking about one of the  banking laws. The fact is that it is precisely at this time, as  has been noted repeatedly in the Russian press, that at various  levels, including in the banking subcommittee of the State Duma,  there is discussion of a new redaction of two main banking laws.  The existing Laws "On the Central Bank of the Russian  Federation" and "On Banks and Banking Activity" unfortunately  contradict certain provisions of the new Constitution of the  Russian Federation, the Civil Code, and the Fundamentals of  Civil Legislation. Some of their articles are obsolete and  require development.    The Law "On Banks and Banking Activity" should not  merely define what a bank is, but correctly reflect the types of  banks. As we know, functioning in Russian practice are not  only commercial but also investment, innovation, savings,  mortgage, authorized, and municipal banks. Unfortunately,  existing legislation does not make it possible to strictly  determine the list of operations they have the right to perform  while considering the interests of the depositors. All these  banks strive to be universal commercial banks, which in  principle should not be the case from the standpoint of  protection of savings and deposits of the clients.    A number of Russian banks have ended up in the role of  "puppet" banks, held captive by the stockholders. Wanting to  gratify their stockholders and finding themselves dependent on  them, a number of Russian banks invest their own and attracted  funds in the economies of stockholding enterprises, helping  them, and they increase the risk of defaulting on credit  payments and essentially place themselves in a position of  potential bankruptcy. None of these cases are described in  existing legislation and they require concretization and  development.    This pertains also to such an apparently inoffensive concept  as "credit institution." It was no accident that it appeared in  the drafts of new banking legislation. The fact is that in the  banking market there is a group of financial institutions which  have been granted the status of bank although essentially that  is not what they are since they do not simultaneously perform  the three mandatory operations (deposit, credit, and  settlement), which provide justification for considering them  banks (according to international standards it is thought that  it is this sign of simultaneously performing the three  traditional banking services that provides grounds for including  one institution or another in the category of bank). The  term "credit institutions" introduced in the draft of new  banking legislation is improper since it does not separate  nonbanks from authentic banks, which mainly act as large credit  institutions. Moreover, although it is incorrect to call these  "special financial institutions," that is what they are called  in banking legislation of a number of Western countries.    For banking legislation it is of principal  importance not only to more completely designate the system  of banks and determine the boundaries of the activity of each  type but also to determine their social significance.  It is known that in the consciousness of modern Russian society  banks are perceived not only as a real economic force that  accumulates immense monetary wealth and is called upon to serve  the economic needs of the national economy and nourish the  economy with additional "energy" resources. In the awareness of  a fairly broad segment of people banks are associated with  speculators, shopkeepers, money lenders, and bribetakers who are  concerned only about their own advantage. The idea that "banks  are for the rich and not for the poor" with all the antagonism  instilled by decades will be present for a long time to come in  the awareness of simple people, essentially keeping both them  themselves from saving at least part of what they have in modern  life, ravished by inflation and political instability, and the  banks from prospering, for the latter can prosper only if the  people are wealthy and are motivated to save.    To be fair, we must not fail to note that certain banks  provide reasons for a negative assessment of their role in  society. Being commercial in essence and working according to  the principle of profitable management (that and no other),  through their activity the banks contribute to the acquisition  of profit by the clients and hence to their own profit. The  appetites of certain banks, however, turn out to be too hefty,  their "grasping" reflex becomes apparent, and it surpasses their  concern for the common good. Banking legislation creates no  barriers for restraint here. Taking into account the idea that  is developing in Russian society of banks as purely commercial  structures supposedly striving for their own exclusive advantage  and also keeping in mind the actual existence of certain banks  with these kinds of reflexes, it would be expedient, in our  view, to include the following important provision in the law:  "The bank as an enterprise, being a social institution and  representing generally accepted interests, is called upon to  provide for the economic and social development of society."  Of course we are far from thinking that all bankers will  become good boys and stop shifting all their risk to the  shoulders of the clients; this will not happen directly or  immediately, but it will be strictly established, if you will,  that there is a legal and moral norm which no bank generated by  the interests of society and called upon to contribute to the  satisfaction of these interests will have the right to forget.    This provision goes beyond being a declaration and should be  reinforced by concrete legislative measures. Thus it would be  expedient, in our view, legislatively to restrict the  proportion of interbank credit (except for centralized) in  the overall volume of attracted resources of commercial agents.  This will create incentives for expanding the clientele of  commercial banks, which is possible only on the basis of radical  improvement of the quality of the services granted and their  diversity.    It could be extremely useful to have a special code for  the banker, which would determine his behavior in the  capital market and constantly assert the idea that work for the  sake of the client's profit is the most advantageous and  profitable kind of commercial activity, and that "fleecing  people," conversely, is the most disadvantageous operation for  the banker.    Among the conceptual issues we discussed previously is the  understanding of the essence, functions, and role of the  Central Bank. Let us try to figure these out in  greater detail. According to our estimates (and also the  estimates of Western experts) the load on the Central Bank of  the Russian Federation as an institution for financing exceeds  its actual capabilities. In industrially developed countries the  proportion of assets of the Central Bank in the assets of the  banking system does not exceed 15 percent (and there is even a  tendency toward reduction), while in Russia this indicator is no  less than 50 percent. The burden on credit as a whole as a  source for making expenditures is at its limits. Centralized  credit, including the one-third granted to banks of Russia to  cover the federal budget deficit (not including a considerable  proportion of the government expenditures also covered by  credit), is ready to blow up the money supply and undermine the  already weak incentives for growth of production and increase of  the productivity of public labor.    It is in this connection that it is important to figure out  what they are and what functions and purposes they have. The  paradox of modern banking practice is that neither in theory nor  in existing banking legislation are these fundamental concepts  applied to the activity of the Central Bank of Russia, nor are  they clearly defined. The authors of the new draft Law "On the  Central Bank of the Russian Federation" proceed from the  previous idea of the Central Bank as the only emission center.  Such an interpretation is more typical of a strictly centralized  system and does not correspond to accepted universal practice of  issuing money that is being practiced currently in Russia  whereby a multitude of economic entities have the right to issue  stocks, bonds, bills, and other securities and means of payment.    In modern practice, in various kinds of publications and  also  in banking laws themselves, the concept of "functions of the  bank" is used fairly frequently. It subsequently turns out that  the function of the bank is equated with its operations, but  this is something altogether different. Banking legislation  still has to define what the function of the bank is and what  its operations and tasks are.    It seems to us that within the framework of the new  redaction  of the Law "On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation" its  content could be defined as follows: "The Central Bank of  the Russian Federation is the emission center for the Russian  Federation which is granted the exclusive right to put state  bank notes and metal coins into circulation."    The functions of the Bank of Russia should include:    1) regulation of monetary-credit relations;    2) oversight of the activity of commercial banks;    3) analytical-informational activity.    It is important both in practice and in  legislation more clearly to articulate the idea of the  special political responsibility of the Central Bank.  Unfortunately, we have confused two things here: The superfluous  political battle which the Central Bank waged of its own accord  or by coercion, and its responsibility for political stability  in society. While the former aspect of the bank's activity is  worthy of sympathy and discussion, the latter circumstance in  inevitable, because whether the Central Bank likes it or not,  one way or another its monetary instruments bear a political  load. Everyone knows that withholding the payment of wages to  workers and employees through the fault of the Bank of Russia  (for example, in the summer of 1992) caused severe social  conflicts. Poor protection of the monetary units from forgery  and theft in the form of false notes had a direct effect not  only on the incomes of the state but also on the deposits of the  banks which, as a result of these thefts, ended up on the verge  of bankruptcy. And the very instrument of the monetary and  credit policy and the fight against inflation are capable of  causing significant social consequences. In our view it would be  more correct in the Law "On the Central Bank of the Russian  Federation," having reflected this circumstance, to write that  "within the framework of the economic policy that is being  conducted the Central Bank of Russia is responsible for  political stability in society."    Within the framework of the regulatory function performed by  the Central Bank it is important to determine  unequivocally that it does not perform operations for serving  clients (neither through its territorial administrations  nor through the excessively bloated network of cash settlement  centers, a significant proportion of which need to be  transformed into purely commercial credit institutions).    A certain amount of regulation is also needed with the  oversight function of the Central Bank. It is known  that the stability of the banking system depends on how well  this is performed. It is precisely for purposes of increasing  the role of this kind of activity of the emission bank that it  is more expedient to separate it in the form of a social  state department under the jurisdiction of the Bank of  Russia.    Unfortunately, the analytical-informational function of the  Central Bank has almost not been designated in legislation and  is clearly in need of improvement in terms of content. The Bank  of Russia should provide analysis of the monetary-credit sector,  payment discipline, the dynamics of prices and savings,  prognostication of the development of monetary-credit relations  in the country, and on a regular basis publish information about  the condition of the money supply and the payment condition of  the state and branches of the national economy.    On the whole, we are inclined to think that the most  important thing in the reform of the Central Bank of Russia  should be not so much renovation of its management structures as  maintenance of its activity. Whether the Central Bank will  be constructed according to the American model (Federal Reserve  System) or the German model (Bundesbank) is, as they say, of  little importance. Both the German and the American models  deserve respect not because of their particularity, the  exclusive features of their construction, but because of their  content, their smooth operation, their analytical potential, a  particular monetary view, and their evaluation of the  development of production.    The formation of the National Banking Council of  Russia as an organ not under but over the Central Bank  should help in the matter of restructuring the banking system.  The National Banking Council should include representatives of  state power, the Bank of Russia, commercial banks, the national  economy, trade unions, and the scholarly community. The purpose  of this Council is to consolidate the interests of the Bank of  Russia, the national economy, the government, and the banking  community as a whole, to develop recommendations for the Central  Bank of Russia concerning strategic issues in the development of  the banking system and the most crucial current problems of  monetary-credit regulation and the development of a legislative  and normative base, and to work out a policy for interaction  between the Russian and the world banking systems in financing  state programs for the development of the country's economy  (including the private sector) and a number of other fundamental  decisions. This Council could also take on functions of  coordinating research problems of banking, international  relations, and programs for reconstruction of the Russian  banking system and inform the country's president and State Duma  in periodical reports on the condition of the monetary-credit  system.    Decisions of the Council as the national organ for the  Central Bank of Russia could be an essential aid in implementing  the general program for transforming the banking sector.    An important direction for the reform of the Central  Bank is to increase its role in the formation of the banking  infrastructure, providing for reliability, stability, and  viability of the banking system and protection of the interests  of the depositors. The banking infrastructure includes the  development of legal foundations and methodological and  scientific support, the development of bookkeeping and auditing,  the formation of structures providing ratings of banks and their  clients, training and retraining of personnel, etc.  Unfortunately, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation has  organized all these structures poorly and their condition gives  cause for serious alarm. As was already noted, Russia really has  no banking system because it lacks, among other things, this  most important element, without which the concept of a banking  system is given a literary, prosaic, but not strictly defined  scientific interpretation. In order to form a banking  infrastructure it is necessary:    --to step up the work for creating methodological support  for  the activity of banks (regulations, instructions, and  methodological and practical aids);    --to form on a joint-stock basis a Fund for the Development  of Basic Research and Modern Banking Technology;    --to develop a plan for priority research in the area of  banking;    --to form analytical consultation firms with a banking  profile as parts of the Central Bank of Russia and independent  founders;    --to prepare a program for extensive on-the-job training of  Russian economists in Western banks and banking scientific  centers;    --to form a permanent international work group of experts  working on problems of regulating banking in Russia;    --to draw up a state program for the development of training  and retraining of personnel with a financial-banking profile;    --to form a network of certified educational institutions  providing for continuous personnel training;    --on the scale of the country, to develop a system of  training and retraining teaching personnel for educational  institutions and replacing scientific cadres;    --to set up a system of information support, including a  rating system for evaluating the activity of banks and their  clients (on the basis of special agencies and joint-stock  companies and the creation of rating information), publication  of archive and contemporary statistical materials on the  condition of banking in the country, etc.    It is necessary to establish the responsibility of the  Central Bank of the Russian Federation for the creation of a  system for insuring deposits and other systems providing  for stability of the functioning of banks and the preservation  of confidence in them. It seems that insuring deposits and  investments (especially of the population) should be organized  on a centralized basis, creating for this purpose a "Specialized  State Centralized Fund for Insurance of Investments and  Deposits."    In order to complete the formation of the banking system of  Russia there will be a considerable amount of work for  improving banking legislation. In such cases everything is  usually reduced to amendments to the two existing Laws "On Banks  and Banking Activity" and "On the Central Bank of the Russian  Federation." Actually a new redaction of them is needed and it  is also necessary to update and augment information on a number  of important issues we have already discussed as well as other,  no less essential ones that have to do with licensing commercial  banks, relations between the Central Bank and the legislative  and executive branches, etc. But it is not just a matter of  these amendments and additions. The modern banking legislative  base is fairly limited, it does not encompass the entire banking  sector and therefore requires essential expansion. Russia still  has to adopt and implement a legislative program  which includes not only a new redaction of existing laws but  also a package of other laws, including: "On  Organization of Oversight of the Activity of Banks and Special  Financial Institutions," "On Bank Holding Companies," "On  Procedure for the Activity of Foreign and Joint Banks on the  Territory of the Russian Federation," "On Equal Opportunities  and Protection of the Interests of Depositors, Borrowers, and  Other Categories of Banks and Special Financial Institutions,"  "On Savings and Loan Institutions," "On Foundations of the  Structure of the Credit System of Russia and Credit Operations,"  "On Mortgage Banks," "On Bank Secrets," "On Securities and the  Stock Exchange in the Russian Federation," "On Financial  Companies," "On the System of Insurance in the Russian  Federation," etc.    A separate discussion should be devoted to the system of  Russian commercial banks, including normatives for regulating  their activity, expansion of the network, strengthening of the  capital base, and conditions and measures for gradually  including Russian banks in the world banking community. But that  is the subject for a separate discussion.</p>

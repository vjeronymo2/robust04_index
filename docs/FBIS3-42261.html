The conclusions of the Cypriot security services' investigation  on this matter have been recently conveyed to Jerusalem.    The Cypriot authorities have recently taken action to foil  the Iranian plans. Among other actions, they prohibited the  entry of several Iranian citizens to the island.    According to Jerusalem, Israel "monitors" the developments  and is in close contact with the Cypriot authorities. The  investigation conducted by the Cypriot security services showed  that Iranians have recently purchased houses in Cyprus. In  addition, lively traffic has been noticed between the two  countries. A probe revealed that a plan to make Cyprus a terror  base was behind these phenomena.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Japan should further  deregulate the economy to help cut its trade surplus, boost  consumer purchasing power and expand business opportunities, the  Bank of Japan (BOJ) said Thursday [2 June].    "Deregulation will contribute to a swift adjustment of  Japan's economy" as structural economic changes proceed  worldwide, the central bank in its annual review of monetary and  economic developments for the fiscal year through March.    It said easing curbs that cause economic inefficiencies will  help bring balance to what it called Japan's excessive savings  and insufficient investment. That would address the structural  element of Japan's large external surplus, it said.    Japan has amassed a large external surplus while domestic  "social infrastructure and housing stock are relatively poor by  international standards," the report notes.    As trade expands with the booming economies of East Asia,  the  report says, deregulation will help allocate resources more  efficiently, improving purchasing power through lower prices and  expanding business opportunities and new industries, it says.    The report notes the hollowing out of Japanese industry,  with  auto and electrical appliance production shifting to East Asia  as the yen surges and those countries augment their low-wage  advantages with increased technological capability.    Japanese manufacturers are thus under pressure to emphasize  "technology-intensive goods production," the BOJ says.    The high yen, lower overseas costs and deregulation are  forcing prices down in the nonmanufacturing sector, it says.  That will boost real household income eventually but force more  corporate restructuring, the report says.    Adjustments in the global industrial structure, as well as  domestic stock and balance-sheet adjustments, have prolonged and  deepened Japan's recession, the report says.    In judging Japan's economy, the report mirrors other recent  assessments by the BOJ and its governor, Yasushi Mieno.    "A greater number of economic indicators have recently  improved, and the economy appears to have stopped weakening," it  says. "The pace of recovery will likely be slow, however, in  light of balance- sheet adjustments and the drastic changes in  the industrial structure that are underway."    With their balance sheets battered by bad loans left from  the  collapse of the late 1980s speculative "bubble," financial  institutions have been less able to take risks, the report says.  That apparently contributed to low fiscal 1993 growth in bank  lending and money supply, it says.    But "the extent to which the balance sheet problem has  influenced economic growth is uncertain," the report adds.    The BOJ also says banks and other institutions "seem to have  become more willing to enhance long-term competitiveness by  making active writeoffs" of the bad loans they hold. But it  says more time will be needed to finish writing off the bad  loans.    Rises this year in long-term interest rates reflected a  market correction from earlier large falls and the rises were  sustained by hopes of economic improvement, it said.    The BOJ's own record-low discount rate and other easy money  policies have "given underlying strength to the economy" by  boosting housing investment and corporate profits and laid the  grounds for corporate and financial restructuring, the report  says.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF AT SHERWOOD CC;  </P> <P> STRANGE-O'MEARA TEAM WINS BY 6  </P> <P> You know you're having a good day on the golf course when you slash at a ball  from waist-level off the side of a mountain while wedged between two giant  boulders, and you still par the hole.  </P> <P> Such was the fortune of Curtis Strange and Mark O'Meara on Sunday as they  teamed to complete a wire-to-wire run with a 10-under-par 62, giving them a  six-stroke victory in the $1-million Ronald McDonald Children's Charities  Invitational in Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> And you also know you're not involved in medal-play golf when you do shoot a 62  but are beaten in the round by four strokes. Greg Norman and Jack Nicklaus  combined for a 58 on the tough, Sherwood Country Club course that Jack built.  They were playing a scramble format, a common game among amateurs in which both  players hit, then select the best ball for the second shot.  </P> <P> "I kept telling Mark that I wanted to win by 10 strokes," said Strange. "I  didn't mean it to sound cocky, but with this wild format, I honestly didn't  know what it was going to take and I didn't want either of us to relax."  </P> <P> Their only tough moment came on the 16th hole, when each hit tee shots into a  steep embankment above a stream. Strange bailed the team out with an awkward,  baseball-type swipe at the ball, sending it far down the fairway on the par-5  hole, which they parred.  </P> <P> Strange and O'Meara each earned $125,000 for the win.  </P> <P> Bernhard Langer and John Mahaffey tied with Tom Weiskopf and Lanny Wadkins for  second place. The Norman-Nicklaus team was another stroke back, tied with Ray  Floyd and Chip Beck.  </P> <P> Norman chipped in from 60 feet on the 18th hole for one of his team's nine  birdies. They also carded three eagles and a bogey in the round and Norman was  rewarded on the 18th hole with a roar from spectators and a leaping high-five  from Nicklaus.  </P> <P> The tournament raised nearly $1.5 million for charities, including the Ronald  McDonald House, a support program for children with cancer.  </P></p>

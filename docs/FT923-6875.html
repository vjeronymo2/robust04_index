			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Universities stand by A-level offers UNIVERSITIES yesterday promised to honour all their conditional offers of places for the next academic year, in spite of the better than expected A-level grades awarded earlier this week to school pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Given a record overall pass rate and a 2.1 per cent increase in the proportion of candidates gaining grades A to C - the results generally needed to gain admission to university - many institutions may have to make an unexpected increase in their intake. Prospects for school-leavers who narrowly fail to secure the grades in their conditional offer are accordingly bleak. 'Everyone who has been promised a place will get one,' said the Committee of Vice-Chancellors. 'It may be that some departments will have to admit extra students over and above what they had planned.' Prospective students trying to contact those universities which were until recently polytechnics were hit yesterday by a strike by Nalgo, the local government union, in support of a 10 per cent pay claim. Nalgo said 11,000 white-collar workers in former polytechnics and in colleges of higher education obeyed a one-day strike call. The strike follows the rejection by Nalgo members of their employers' 4.3 per cent pay offer. The union said two-day and three-day stoppages would follow later, but normal service would resume today. It added that the government's offer did little to improve the pay of almost 40 per cent of staff - those on low wages - and ignored the union's claim for improvements in service conditions. Mr Nigel Forman, further education minister, said the Nalgo action was 'deplorable'. He added: 'The employers have offered 4.3 per cent, well ahead of the current rate of inflation and the current average of settlements in the private sector.' His remarks are likely to stiffen the resolve of the new university directors not to increase their offer. Editorial Comment, Page 12</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / EU set for telecoms pact Following last minute lobbying by the German government, European telecommunications ministers are today hoping to reach agreement to allow competing telephone networks across the continent by the beginning of 1998. A spokesman for Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the German post minister who will chair the Brussels meeting, said he was 'very optimistic' agreement could be reached after Spain and Portugal dropped their reservations. The ministers agreed last year to liberalise basic voice telephony services in 1998, but it has been more difficult to reach agreement on the networks. The Commission, hoping to speed up the deregulation of infrastructures, takes the view that so-called alternative networks - energy and rail networks for example - should be liberalised as early as next year, but certain member states are wary of such a timetable. Germany has warned that it will press ahead with its own liberalisation unless 1998 is agreed as a suitable date on which to liberalise both the alternative, and the traditional monopoly networks.</p>

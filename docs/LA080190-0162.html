			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER EDITOR TO RETIRE  </P> <P> Eugene L. Roberts Jr., one of the most honored newspaper editors in America,  stunned his staff Tuesday by announcing that he will retire Sept. 1 as  executive editor and president of the Philadelphia Inquirer.  </P> <P> Roberts, 58, made his name as a champion of hard investigative reporting,  editorial independence and the idea that an aggressive, even antagonistic  product would win readers and eventually financial success. His transformation  of the beleaguered Inquirer in the 1970s and its ultimate victory over the  rival Bulletin seemed to prove his theory.  </P> <P> Roberts said he had anticipated early retirement as long as three years ago but  stayed because of "family responsibilities that made it seem the wrong time."  But many in the industry and at his newspaper believe that Roberts became  disenchanted with changes at Knight-Ridder Inc., the paper's owner. The  Miami-based company has recently emphasized strict profit targets and publicly  stressed that journalists should see themselves as serving customers and not  simply providing news and acting as watchdogs over government.  </P> <P> "The corporate mentality at Knight-Ridder has changed," said one Inquirer  reporter. "For the last few years, it has been us (the Inquirer) against them  (Knight-Ridder), and it looks like 'them' won."  </P> <P> Despite the comments of many staffers and outside observers, Knight-Ridder  executives praised Roberts in statements issued Tuesday.  </P> <P> "Gene Roberts has brought great honor to The Inquirer, to Knight-Ridder and to  the profession of newspaper editing in this country," Knight-Ridder Chairman  and Chief Executive James K. Batten said. "His is a unique record that will  long stand as an inspiration for others to follow."  </P> <P> Roberts will be replaced by Maxwell E. P. King, 46, a protege and longtime  editor who for the past three years has been running the paper's circulation  department. He will have the title of editor of the Inquirer and executive vice  president of Philadelphia Newspapers Inc.  </P> <P> King, who is the maternal grandson of legendary book editor Maxwell Perkins and  the brother of actor Perry King, was picked by the publisher and  Knight-Ridder's corporate staff, but Roberts said he was consulted at length  about potential successors. Inquirer Managing Editor Gene Foreman will become  executive editor, and Deputy Managing Editor James Naughton will become  managing editor.  </P> <P> Roberts said in an interview that he will now travel and perhaps eventually  take a teaching position. He will also serve as a consultant to Knight-Ridder.  </P> <P> In his 18 years in Philadelphia, Roberts' paper won a startling 17 Pulitzer  prizes, its circulation rose nearly 20% and it transformed itself from a paper  "flat on its back journalistically to one with few peers," said Craig Ammerman,  former editor of the rival Philadelphia Bulletin. The Inquirer eventually  surpassed the Bulletin, which closed in 1982, and inspired a movement within  the industry in which newspaper chains known for journalistic quality bought  struggling papers and tried to outdo the local competition.  </P> <P> None, however, was able to duplicate Roberts' achievement, including his own  company, which failed to repeat that success in Detroit.  </P> <P> In recent years, Roberts has had sharp clashes with Knight-Ridder management  over his budget, particularly since the rise of the company's current  president, P. Anthony Ridder. Before that, Roberts was stung that he was not  named publisher. Instead, the paper installed Robert Hall, a Knight-Ridder  official from Detroit. On Tuesday, Ridder praised Roberts for creating  "unquestionably one of the great newspapers in America."  </P> <P> Roberts started in journalism as a farm reporter for the Goldsboro (N.C.)  News-Argus. He also worked at the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot, the News and  Observer of Raleigh, N.C., and the Detroit Free Press before he joined the New  York Times. Roberts covered the civil rights movement in the 1960s and the  Vietnam War for the newspaper, later becoming its national editor.  </P> <P> The tributes to Roberts were swift in coming. Bill Kovach, curator at the  Nieman Foundation at Harvard and a former colleague at the New York Times, said  Roberts is "one of the last of that generation for whom the separation of  business and the editorial department was a complete and absolute principle. .  . . I really do believe it was a person like Gene Roberts that Jefferson and  Madison and (George) Mason had in mind when they crafted the First Amendment  for the press in a self-governing society."  </P> <P> "He has cast a hell of a shadow on journalism in his day," said Benjamin C.  Bradlee, executive editor of the Washington Post and now one of the last of his  generation's prominent editors. "It can't be that newspapers are better off  without him."  </P> <P> The news provoked tears among some of Roberts' staff and open anger among  others, plus a lengthy standing ovation in the Inquirer newsroom. Before that,  in a meeting with top editors, Roberts said he would never run another  newspaper. Then, fighting tears, he was unable to continue and walked out.  </P></p>

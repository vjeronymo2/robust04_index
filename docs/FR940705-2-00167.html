			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In constructing the NIH Guidelines, it was necessary to define boundary conditions for the different levels of physical and biological containment and for the classes of experiments to which they apply. These definitions do not take into account all existing and anticipated information on special procedures that will allow particular experiments to be conducted under different conditions than indicated here without affecting risk. Individual investigators and Institutional Biosafety Committees are urged to devise simple and more effective containment procedures and to submit recommended changes in the NIH Guidelines to permit the use of these procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section III. Experiments Covered by the NIH Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section describes five categories of experiments involving recombinant DNA: (i) Those that require RAC review and NIH and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see section III&hyph;A), (ii) those that require NIH/ORDA and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see section III&hyph;B); (iii) those that require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see section III&hyph;C), (iv) those that require Institutional Biosafety Committee notification simultaneous with initiation (see section III&hyph;D), and (v) those that are exempt from the NIH Guidelines (see section III&hyph;E). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If an experiment falls into either section III&hyph;A or section III&hyph;B and one of the other categories, the rules pertaining to section III&hyph;A or section III&hyph;B shall be followed. If an experiment falls into section III&hyph;E and into either sections III&hyph;C or III&hyph;D categories as well, the experiment is considered exempt from the NIH Guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any change in containment level, which is different from those specified in the NIH Guidelines, may not be initiated without the express approval of NIH/ORDA (see Minor Actions, section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2) and its subsections).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section III&hyph;A.

The containment conditions for such experiments will be recommended by the RAC and set by the NIH at the time of approval. Such experiments require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation. Specific experiments already approved are included in Appendix D which may be obtained from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III&hyph;A&hyph;1.

Certain experiments involving the deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects (see section V&hyph;U) shall be considered Major Actions (see section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1) and Appendix M&hyph;III), and shall require RAC review and NIH Director approval, if determined by NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members, as necessary, to: (i) Represent novel characteristics (e.g., target disease or vector), (ii) represent an uncertain degree of risk to human health or the environment, or (iii) contain information determined to require further public review. The requirement for RAC review shall not be considered to preempt any other required review or approval of experiments with one or more human subjects. Relevant Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board reviews and approvals of the proposal should be completed before submission to NIH. Certain experiments involving deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects may qualify for the Accelerated Review process (see section III&hyph;B&hyph;2). Certain categories of experiments involving the deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects and that are not covered by section V&hyph;U, may be considered exempt from RAC and/or NIH/ORDA review and/or NIH Director approval and only require registration with NIH/ORDA (see section III&hyph;C&hyph;7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section III&hyph;B.

Experiments in this category cannot be initiated without submission of relevant information on the proposed experiment to NIH/ORDA.

The RAC Chair will present a report of all NIH/ORDA approved human gene transfer protocols at the next regularly scheduled RAC meeting. If NIH/ORDA determines that an experiment does not qualify for the Accelerated Review process, the Principal Investigator must submit the proposal for full RAC review " 8 weeks prior to the next scheduled RAC meeting (See section III&hyph;A&hyph;2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

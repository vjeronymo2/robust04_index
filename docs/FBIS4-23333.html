			<p>BFN     [Text] National Party Deputy Secretary General Mulondwe  Muzungu says democracy cannot be sustained in Zambia if the  ruling MMD [Movement for Multiparty Democracy] continues to  dominate Parliament and the local government. Speaking in  Lusaka yesterday, Mr. Muzungu called for a stronger opposition  in the country, adding that the MMD hold in decision-making  bodies must be diluted so that democracy is upheld. He was  speaking at the National Party Secretariat when three members of  the Democratic National Party joined the National Party.</p>

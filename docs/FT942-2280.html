			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: The real reason behind rising yields - Capital &amp; Credit Bond markets have had a bad year. In the UK, government bond prices have fallen by more than 20 per cent, while yields have risen from below 6 1/2 per cent to more than 8 1/2 per cent. Why have yields risen so far? Fears of rising inflation and higher interest rates can only be part of the answer. Yields, it is becoming increasingly clear, are rising because of a global capital shortage. The demand on the world's supply of capital is beginning to grow just as the lenders of that capital have deserted the market place. Bond investors hate inflation and rising interest rates. When the Federal Reserve raised US interest rates on February 4, yields, especially on US and UK bonds, already on their way up, rose further still and the consensus had it that this was because expectations of inflation had increased. There was some justification for this view. The gap between the yield on a conventional gilt and that on an index-linked gilt, a useful measure of inflation expectations, had jumped to almost 4 per cent, while actual inflation was running at almost half that rate. However, a rise in inflation expectations can only be part of the explanation for the rise in bond yields. 'It is interesting,' says Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at S. G. Warburg, 'that since then most inflation forecasts have actually fallen.' Investors must also be compensated for risk and uncertainty. The Bank of England, in its latest inflation report, estimates that volatility in the gilt market doubled between January and May of this year. The Conservative party's protracted political woes, as well as currency risk and uncertainty about the strength of economic recovery are responsible for that. The British government's handling of economic policy has also been blamed. Certainly, the UK base rate cut on February 8, which, it was later revealed, Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, had argued against, was taken very badly by the gilt market. No doubt it was further unnerved by recent talk of tax cuts to boost the Conservatives' standing. Increased risk, however, is not enough to explain the rise in yields. This leaves one other explanation: yields have risen because the real yield, the yield over and above inflation and risk, has increased. Last year, funding the large European government budget deficits was easy. A scarcity of other worthwhile investments, with most of Europe still in recession, and relatively low financing costs - due to falling interest rates - meant that investors willing to buy government bonds were easy to find. Mr Sanjay Joshi, head of bond research at Daiwa Europe, estimates that last year Pounds 16bn of gilts were bought by overseas investors, mainly the Japanese, the Americans and hedge funds - large pools of speculative capital which are switched between financial markets to exploit short-term opportunities. Now all that has changed. The hedge funds, having pushed up bond prices to unsustainable heights, have taken their profits and moved on, to commodities, it seems. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has put up short-term interest rates, the US economy is growing strongly, and there is evidence that the European economic recovery is well under way. US investors, afraid that the dollar will soon begin to rise, and the Japanese, seeing the yen continue to strengthen, have dropped bonds denominated in European currencies and taken their money home. 'That colossal increase in government borrowing, which we ignored while there was all that leveraged money around to mop it up, is now coming back to haunt us with a vengeance.' says Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at S. G. Warburg. Mr Joshi estimates that the hedge funds alone have taken back about Dollars 40bn they had invested in bonds and equities. To say that the bottom has dropped out of the bond market is perhaps not an exaggeration. But it may even be worse than that. The government deficits have not gone away. On top of heavy bond sales by investors this year, there is still more new stock arriving on the market. The UK alone will probably have to issue about Pounds 40bn of gilts to finance its deficit this year. 'Just who is going to buy the bonds that are still to be auctioned?' asks Mr Joshi. Some commentators have even spoken of a funding crisis. This, however, may be missing the point. Real yields have certainly risen - to about 4 1/2 per cent in Germany and to more than 5 per cent in the UK, by some calculations. But this is not necessarily just because the supply of capital is drying up. This leaves one final explanation. World economic growth is picking up speed, most importantly in the US, and capital will be needed to fuel that growth. Bond yields have risen because of an impending global capital shortage. The bond market's bad year looks set to continue.</p>

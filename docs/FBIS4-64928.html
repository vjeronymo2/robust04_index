			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Radical Liberal Strategies"] </F>   [Text] The Radical Liberal seedling is about to sprout. In  the period leading up to the Folketing election, the Radical  Liberals are busy deciding who they will consider working with  after the election and who will feel the Radical sting. All  through the past decade, the Radical Liberals have grown used to  the circumstance that governments could not be formed without  them. The mere idea that there could be a government that would  not be dependent upon the Radical Liberal adaptability is reason  enough for Marianne Jelved to want to test her might.    Were the Liberals and Conservatives to receive a majority  that included the Progress Party, Jelved would be hard as nails.  Under no circumstances would her party support the  Liberal-Conservatives on those issues the Progress Party would  have no part of. It is not immediately evident why Jelved  suddenly has so much against her old coalition partners in the  Progress Party. No doubt she is recalling Niels Helveg  Petersen's well-considered words to the effect that he would  rather drop below the number needed for representation in  parliament than work with the Progress Party. After the 1989  budget agreement, the Radical Liberals and the Progress bunch  were slapping each other on the back. For the first time, the  Progress Party had voted for a budget, while the Radical  Liberals repeatedly declared that the important thing in  politics was what you got done, not who you did it with.    Just 10 days ago Jelved wrote an article in which she stated  that "The Radical Liberals have a clear policy that we strive to  implement whenever we can." But now that clear policy has been  turned over to expose a muddier underside. The Radical Liberals  can no longer turn their backs on whatever they feel like under  the respectable guise of cooperation or influence, as Jelved  formulated it this weekend. Before righteous indignation  obscures her vision, Jelved needs to remember how with a  single-seat majority, she and her party helped to ram through an  extensive tax reform. At that time, there was no fault to be  found in bloc politics even in its most blatant form. Why, then,  have moral fits when another majority in the Folketing gets the  same opportunity -- and uses it? Three years ago, the Radical  Liberals went to the polls depending upon the Liberals and  Conservatives' continuation in power. Now Jelved has said that  she will make life difficult for those very parties should they  come to power after the election.    But perhaps the Radical Liberals are merely preparing to  change sides again. Indeed, that must be it. The government has  a strategy meeting at Toruplund today and tomorrow. The Radical  Liberals cannot "decently" -- if that term is recognized by the  party -- say such a thing publicly at this point. So why not  froth at the mouth over the old coalition partners, the better  to camouflage your future plans.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oil battle blazes There was more late drama in the Enterprise Oil/Lasmo takeover battle, with both camps claiming confidence of success. Significantly, Lasmo shares came under heavy selling pressure, closing 8 1/2 off at 134 1/2 p on big turnover of 9.5m, with US investors selling the stock aggressively. Enterprise shares moved up 7 to 389p. But contrary to the view that the slide in Lasmo indicated that the bid would fail, some dealers said US holders were taking the view that an Enterprise victory was likely. US investors, unwilling to accept the new Enterprise paper, preferred to sell their shares for cash in the market. Sector specialists said the bid, the outcome of which is expected minutes after the market closes today, was still on a knife-edge last night. One view was that Enterprise had made a tactical blunder in buying half of the 16 per cent held by Philips &amp; Drew Fund Management. Analysts said that, since PDFM was expected to accept the bid in any event, Enterprise would have done better to have bid elsewhere for the 10 per cent stake it sought.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arne B. Thorbjornsen: "Great Faith in Peace in </F> Guatemala"]    [Text] The tone was optimistic, and trust in peace was  strong when the two sides in the Guatemala conflict met in Oslo  yesterday.    "I am expecting progress, and I am also expecting that the  negotiations on the two topics that are up for discussion will  be completed," UN peace mediator Jean Arnault said before the  representatives of the government and the guerrillas in  Guatemala began their negotiations behind closed doors in Oslo  yesterday morning.    How is Guatemala to handle its settling of accounts with the  past? This is the most tricky aspect of the whole process, and  it is the issue which the two sides will try to resolve in the  course of this week. There will also be discussion of new  settlements for those who have been driven from their homes --  people whom the civil war has made refugees in their own country.    "If we find a solution to these issues, this will open the  way to reaching our goal," Arnault said.    The goal is the signing of a peace agreement before the end  of the year. Agreement on this was reached in Mexico in January  when a timetable was drawn up for how month by month the various  conflict issues would be dealt with. Later this year there  will, for example, be discussion of the identity and rights of  the aboriginal population, the distribution of land, the  strengthening of the civilian state, the place of the army in a  democratic society, and the integration of the guerrillas into  political life.    None of these questions is easy to solve, and the settling  of  accounts with the past and the countless brutal breaches of  human rights is the most difficult question of all.    The figures are uncertain, but it is safe to say that at  least 130,000 people have been killed and 40,000 have  disappeared. The aim is to set up a "truth commission" which  will look into what has happened, and it is revelations  regarding its role in massacres and purges that the military  machine fears most of all. The armed forces have claimed the  whole time that they do not see the need for a truth commission.  Kirkens Nodhjelp [Church Emergency Aid] in particular has  played a role as a bridge-builder and helped to get the army to  agree to negotiations on this sensitive issue.    In his welcome speech to the envoys, Foreign Minister Bjorn  Tore Godal said that Norway is ready to make its contribution to  guarantee the economic base for the peace process. He also  stressed that peace is more than the absence of war, and it can  only be created by the parties themselves.    The leaders of the two delegations both stressed how  important it is that a truth commission be set up. "Clearing up  the past opens the door to the future," said Dr. Hector Rosada,  the government chief negotiator. The leader of the guerrilla  group, Carlos Gonzalez, said that it is important not only to  investigate breaches of human rights and to prevent new breaches  taking place, but also to punish where this is necessary.</p>

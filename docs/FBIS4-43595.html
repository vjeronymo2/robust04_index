			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis stressed that the  prerequisite for any progress on the Cyprus issue is for the  Security Council to be convinced that alternate ways should be  adopted that would compel the Turkish side to show political  will for a solution.    In an address at a gathering to commemorate the fallen EOKA  [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] fighters from  Paphos, which was organized today by the town's fighter  associations, President Kliridhis recalled that because of the  lack of political will, which has also been noted by the United  Nations, the National Council decided unanimously that the  discussion of the confidence-building measures [CBM's] has been  terminated and that we should proceed with discussions on the  substance of the Cyprus issue after the necessary measures have  been taken to break the Turkish intransigence. President  Kliridhis also reiterated that he is prepared to sign an  agreement on the CBM's provided the Turkish side accepts the 21  March document.    The president added that the Greek Cypriots are united in  the  most crucial phase of our national problem and expressed the  conviction that they will remain united in addressing it  successfully.    Arriving at the ceremony, President Kliridhis said that he  expects consultations on the Cyprus issue to continue in view of  the Butrus-Ghali discussion. Responding to a question, he said  that he has not yet received replies to his letters sent to the  U.S. President and the British prime minister. Responding to  another question, President Kliridhis said that he is not  pessimistic.</p>

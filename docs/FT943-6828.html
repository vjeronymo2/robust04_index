			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Swedbank trims annual profits forecast Swedbank, the Nordic region's largest bank by asset value, yesterday punctured some of the optimism returning to the Swedish banking sector by downgrading its full-year underlying earnings forecast because of worries over the state of the national economy. The bank reported a swing to an operating profit in the first six months of SKr1.75bn (Dollars 223m) from a loss last time of SKr1.59bn, due to a 53 per cent fall in loan losses to SKr2.7bn from SKr5.8bn in the same period last year. The result followed a similar pattern to those announced earlier this week by Swedbank's main rivals, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Svenska Handelsbanken and Nordbanken, which all reported sharply improved profits due to lower loan losses. However, Swedbank stressed that earnings before loan losses had weakened due to lower interest income, narrower margins and lower bond trading results. This was a feature shown by the other banks but overshadowed by the improvement in the loan losses which caused a crisis in the banking sector two years ago. Swedbank said lower loan losses could produce a full-year operating profit. But it lowered its forecast for profits before loan losses (and excluding capital gains) to SKr5.5bn from its earlier prediction of SKr6.5bn. It said uncertainty about the economy, mainly stemming from high interest rates, threatened to spill over into the house lending and consumer credit market. In the first six months, Swedbank's net interest income fell 18 per cent to SKr4.93bn from SKr5.99bn. Operating income before loan losses was ahead slightly at SKr4.48bn, but would have been down 15 per cent from last year's SKr4.2bn without a SKr1.58bn one-off capital gain. The banks' results were hit by lower returns from their bond portfolios. But the impact was softened, compared with banks in other countries, because Swedish accounting practices allow the banks to keep unrealised losses in the value of their investment portfolios out of the operating profit. Such losses are shown only at the year end as appropriations after operating profit. A beneficiary of this was Handelsbanken, which has increased its holdings of government securities and bonds by 76 per cent over the past year to soak up surplus liquidity. The bank said the value of its investment portfolio at the end of June was SKr2.7bn less than the purchase price. Under Danish accounting rules, this would have wiped out Handelsbanken's reported SKr2.3bn half-year operating profit. Similarly, Nordbanken, which made a SKr2.46bn operating profit, would have been hit by SKr2.9bn in below-purchase price values of external and in-house bond holdings. The figure was SKr550m at SE-Banken, which reported an operating profit of SKr2.22bn, and SKr416m at Swedbank.</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Cluff to explore Lake Victoria Mr Algy Cluff, chairman of Cluff Resources, the UK-based gold mining company operating in Zimbabwe and Ghana, said at the annual meeting that he expected next month to sign an agreement with the Tanzanian government for Cluff to explore an area of 190 sq km on the shores of Lake Victoria. He said the area contained the Geita mine, once East Africa's biggest gold producer but which closed in 1966. Development of the Freda underground gold mine in Zimbabwe was on schedule and on budget, said Mr Cluff. Recent drilling and exploration work made him confident that 'the Freda mine will be producing gold well into the next century'.</p>

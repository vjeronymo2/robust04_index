			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Retail trade: Ringing in opinions GIFT SHOP The unusually hot summer subdued sales at Collectables, a gift shop in the Metro Centre in Tyne and Wear. 'The weather affected most of retailing,' said proprietor, Mr Philip Lewis. 'When the weather is good people are on the lakes and on the beaches so these things are hard to monitor year-to-year.' He said sales had grown by about 5 per cent from the previous year, and that Sunday trading was adding an additional 12 per cent. The April tax increases had not negatively affected business, FLORIST In the three months from July to September, the eight branches of Dingley's florist in central Manchester and North Cheshire saw a rise in sales volumes of about 10 per cent from the same period last year. 'Our costs are up by about 20 to 25 per cent, but we are generally holding our prices about the same as last year,' said owner Mr Graham Heap. 'Total sales volumes are up because of an improvement in attitude. This time last year people were struggling to pay Pounds 15 but now they seem happy to spend Pounds 20 or more.' BUTCHER The Tesco store which opened in Medway last February has shaved 15 per cent off sales at Bruce Butchers. Mr David Bruce, owner, said he has brought down prices at his family-owned butcher by about 5 per cent, in spite of the fact that his costs have risen by 6 to 7 per cent. 'We have had to drop our prices to try and keep people coming,' he said. 'It is hard to compete against a superstore which also has Sunday trading.' Loyal customers stick to cheaper cuts of meat, such as mince. CLOTHES SHOP 'There is more optimism among shoppers this year,' said Ms Pam Jewitt, owner of No Sweat, a leisure clothing shop in the Metro Centre in Tyne and Wear. Her sales figures for August were 18 per cent up on the same month last year and prices were up by between 5 and 8 per cent on last year. She plans to expand to a third shop in the Metro Centre. She added that people were looking for affordable merchandise. The shop has stopped importing products from Germany and the US and now focuses its stock on UK product lines. GROCERS Independent grocers, increasingly finding their business eroded by the large retail chains, have not enjoyed the boom in food prices indicated by recent figures from the Central Statistics Office. 'I would not go along with those figures at all,' said Mr Les Brown, national treasurer of the British Independent Grocers' Association. 'I would say prices are more like 2 per cent up on last year.' Mr Brown sais that in his convenience stores in Hertfordshire sales volumes were about the same as last year.</p>

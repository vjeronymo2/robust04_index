			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / West steps up pressure on Iraq: Southern air exclusion zone planned in effort to counter violations of ceasefire terms THE US, Britain and France plan to announce an air exclusion zone over southern Iraq later this week in an attempt to protect Shia rebels from attack and to increase pressure on the regime of President Saddam Hussein. US officials say the three governments have agreed that 'blatant violations' of UN ceasefire resolutions passed after the Gulf war can no longer be tolerated. It is expected that Iraq will be told, perhaps as early as tomorrow, that helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft flying south of the 32nd parallel will be shot down. The White House declined to confirm the reports but said it was concerned about the treatment of minorities in Iraq. The announcement of an exclusion zone will be seen by some Arab governments as another step towards the political partition of Iraq. The Kurdish population in the north already benefits from air protection above the 36th parallel. Some US officials believe that the increased pressures on Saddam Hussein could lead to the collapse of his regime before the end of the year. The threat of an immediate military confrontation over UN access to information on Iraqi weapons systems eased yesterday when inspectors in Baghdad completed their present round of visits without incident. US officials let it be known at the weekend that military action was being prepared in case Iraq carried out its threat to bar the 22-strong inspection team from government ministries. It had been expected in Washington that the UN team would specifically ask to enter the Ministry of Military Industrialisation. But in New York, Mr Tim Trevan, spokesman for the UN inspections commission, said no request had been lodged to visit ministries because there was no need to at this time. 'Of course, we retain the right to designate any location in Iraq,' he added. Mr Nikita Smidovich, the Russian who heads the team, said in Baghdad: 'We have learned things that will be very useful and very helpful in our future inspection activities.' He added that 'normal relations' had been restored with Iraqi officials prior to yesterday's final round of inspections. Oil prices initially rose on the threat of new hostilities, then slipped back when Mr Smidovich said his team's mission had been successful. But the market remained on edge about the possibility of western action over southern Iraq. President George Bush has vehemently denied that the threat of renewed military action against Iraq was designed to boost his own flagging re-election campaign. But in Indianapolis yesterday, on his way to the Republican convention in Houston, he evoked the spirit of the Gulf war, recalling that the US had 'kicked a little Baghdad bully'. He added: 'Saddam Hussein miscalculated. He thought we'd grown soft over the years. He didn't think we'd commit our armed forces. He mis-read the will of the American people'. If President Saddam did not give UN inspectors access to Iraqi government buildings 'we have responses planned and they are strong responses'. The US has in place all the military equipment it needs either to bomb targets inside Iraq or enforce an air exclusion zone to the south of the 32nd parallel. Aircraft movements in Iraq would be monitored principally by Awacs aircraft flying out of bases in eastern Saudi Arabia, and supported by land and carrier-based strike aircraft. A specialised team of air warfare controllers was dispatched to Saudi Arabia last week from its base in South Carolina. The Saudi government, which has been concerned at the increasing signs of Iraqi assertiveness, is believed to have agreed to the use of its bases for US operations. Iraq's challenge last month to UN inspection teams was only the latest violation of UN resolutions, according to US officials. Resolution 688, designed to deter Saddam Hussein from harassing domestic opposition groups, has been ignored almost from the day it was approved. The intensification of Iraqi army efforts to crush remaining Shia rebel groups in the south have, however, reached a level which the White House felt could no longer be ignored, in particular the use of fixed-wing aircraft. For many months after the conclusion of the Gulf war Iraq made no effort to use fighter aircraft. However, evidence of fixed-wing flights has been building up over the past two months, leading Iraqi opposition groups to make direct appeals to the US for protection.

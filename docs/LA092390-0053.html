			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONVERSION CAUTIONS  </P> <P> This is a response to an article titled "Southland Hot Spot: Converting Co-Ops  to Condos" by F. Scott Jackson and Steven Solomon (July 22).  </P> <P> Cooperatives considering converting to condo should analyze carefully the  reasons for converting and consider the major change in home ownership. For  some it might not be the right solution after all.  </P> <P> Contrary to four crucial points outlined in the article:  </P> <P> 1 -- Cooperative financing does exist for California cooperatives.  </P> <P> 2 -- Conversions could be costly in some cases.  </P> <P> 3 -- Property taxes could be affected by a conversion.  </P> <P> 4 -- Community control over property is significantly altered.  </P> <P> There is financing available for cooperatives and individual cooperative  shareholders needing to borrow for purchasing, refinancing or equity borrowing  on their shares or cooperative interests through the National Cooperative Bank,  headquartered in Washington, and NCB Savings Assn.  </P> <P> Additionally, the Federal National Mortgage Assn. (FNMA) has a secondary market  program for housing cooperative blanket mortgages and individual share loan  financing through which local lenders can make these loans available  competitively with condominium loans.  </P> <P> A cooperative considering converting with a mortgage on the property will find  itself paying off an existing mortgage and each shareholder picking up a new  individual condominium mortgage. This means that the individual owner now  assumes personal mortgage liability as a condo owner, which the shareholder did  not have as a cooperator.  </P> <P> Property taxes may not be affected by the conversion itself if there are no  other financial considerations involved. However, taxes may be increased when  the first converted condominium unit is sold.  </P> <P> A very careful analysis is needed to see if the increased taxes and possibly  other expenses in the use of the property as a home will justify the ultimate  "high" resale price if in fact home values do continue to increase.  </P> <P> While the rules and regulations may be the same in regards to community control  over property, the ability to enforce them are totally different. As to  possession of the home, the cooperative and its owners have a landlord-tenant  relationship, thus providing the cooperative substantially greater control to  remedy disturbing behavior than a condominium, which normally has to seek a  court injunction to alleviate the objectionable behavior.  </P> <P> Additionally, a conversion may have federal income tax impact both to the  individual cooperative shareholder turned condominium unit owner on whatever  gain is realized in the transaction and on the cooperative corporation upon  dissolution. Both of these possibilities need to be carefully analyzed by  experienced Internal Revenue Code practitioners.  </P> <P> Contrary to the "white elephant" characterization of cooperatives, there are  over half a million people living in housing cooperatives who are members of  the National Assn. of Housing Cooperatives (NAHC). These and many hundreds of  thousands more throughout the country are obtaining reasonably priced and  affordable housing through housing cooperatives.  </P> <P> They have no desire to be part of a more expensive and a less controllable form  of mutual home ownership such as a condominium.  </P> <P> HERBERT H. FISHER  </P> <P> Alexandria, Va.  </P> <P> Fisher is chairperson of the board of directors of the National Assn. of  Housing Cooperatives.  </P> <P> </P></p>

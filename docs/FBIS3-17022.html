			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vlada Vishnevskaya from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Another battalion of Russian peacekeeping forces  will be sent to Sarajevo at the end of March, Deputy Russian  Defense Minister Georgiy Kondratyev told a news conference  today. The servicemen are currently undergoing special  training. The Ministry of Defense has drawn up a new training  program for this. There are more than 1,200 Russian  peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslavia.    As for the tasks of the contingent for keeping the peace on  the territory of the former Union, it was pointed out at the  news conference that Russia is the sole power capable of  separating warring sides. Russian servicemen are coping with  this task successfully. For over a year there has been no  bloodshed in the Dniester region and South Osetia. For the  first time, representatives of the warring sides themselves are  taking part in the work of the peacekeeping forces. That is,  these are in part trilateral forces.    One of the main problems of life today has also affected the  peacekeeping contingent; namely, the problem of money. During  1993 over 26 billion rubles were spent from the Ministry of  Defense's budget on financing operations to keep the peace on  the territory of the former Union. It is hard to estimate what  sum will be needed this year. The Defense Ministry hopes that  this and other problems will be resolved by the law adopted by  the State Duma on maintaining the Russian contingent to take  part in operations designed to preserve or ensure international  peace and security.

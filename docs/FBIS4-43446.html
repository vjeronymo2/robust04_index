			<p>BFN     [Text] A serious installation mistake has been discovered  in the Forsmark nuclear power station during an overhaul, Radio  Uppland reports. It is a so-called blast plate that has been  installed incorrectly. The task of the blast plate is to  explode if the pressure in the reactor becomes too high.  Because the plate was incorrectly installed, it would not have  been of any use if there had been an accident. According to Alf  Lindfors, head of the Forsmark station, it is a serious matter  that the fault was not discovered earlier.</p>

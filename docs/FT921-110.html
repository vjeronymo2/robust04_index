			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Japanese emergency package to stimulate economy THE JAPANESE government early today approved a package of emergency economic measures that will increase public spending by at least Y4,000bn (Pounds 17bn) in the first half of the fiscal year, which begins tomorrow. The measures - largely an acceleration of present spending plans - are a response to rising concern at the slowdown of the Japanese economy. Industrial output is falling sharply and money supply growth is at an historic low. Mr Masaru Yoshitomi, director-general of the Economic Planning Agency's co-ordination bureau, said the measures would give a strong stimulus to the economy, arrest further decline, and allow the government to reach its economic growth target of 3.5 per cent in 1992. It was not immediately clear whether the Bank of Japan, the central bank, would support the measures with a further cut in the official discount rate from its current level of 4.5 per cent. But Mr Yoshitomi said the package underlined the need for flexible monetary policy. Announcement of the package, which was widely anticipated, had little immediate impact on financial markets. Share prices in Tokyo opened higher, with the Nikkei average up some 150 points at around 19,800 in early trading. The dollar was little changed, and was quoted at Y133.05 after an hour's trading. Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said: 'The market still needs something more concrete and more immediate. The market is really waiting for any move by the Bank of Japan to lower interest rates.' The bank is expected to act shortly to lower rates, but a cut of just half a percentage point is likely to disappoint markets, where sentiment is extremely depressed. Although the fiscal package may provide a longer term stimulus to the economy, it does little to ease the difficulties of the securities industry. Under the government's measures, 75 per cent of public works expenditure budgeted for the entire fiscal year is to be spent in the first half of the year, leading to increased spending of 15.7 per cent, or Y1,500bn. Local government spending, which is roughly twice as much as that of central government, is to be accelerated at a similar pace. Spending by public utilities is also to be increased and moved to the first half of the year. Investment by the electricity industry for the year is to be increased over budget by Y300bn to Y4,600bn, with Y1,000bn moved forward to the first half of the year. Spending in the first half of the year by the telephone utilities will be increased over budget by Y90bn to Y1,290bn. The gas industry will adopt similar front-loading measures. Additional plans include special low-interest loan programmes to support investment in labour-saving equipment by industry and steps to boost consumer spending. World stocks, Page 41</p>

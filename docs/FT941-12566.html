			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Beyond the cyber-vampire: Challenges for video games makers With the deafening sound of 'finish him' in your ears, Baraka (a demon with blades for hands) decapitates yet another victim. Even more violent than the original . . . this game features great enhancements,' enthuses Gamepro magazine's review of Mortal Kombat II, the sequel to last year's 'top-grossing' video game hit. Digital murder and mayhem may not appeal to everyone, but it is just what the young males aged eight to 18 who buy 75 per cent of all video games want. A glance at the US top 10 games proves the point: Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter II, Streets of Rage 2, Tournament Fighters . . . Played with hand-held controllers, two players to a machine that plugs into the TV set, these are the games that absorb countless hours of youngsters' time. The video game industry has grown fat on screen battles. Last year, worldwide sales of home video game machines and game cartridges topped Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn), up from about Dollars 14bn in 1992. Yet there are signs that after a decade of rapid growth, the video game craze may be slowing down. Nintendo of Japan, which along with rival Sega Enterprises dominates the field, is projecting an 11 per cent decline in worldwide sales for its fiscal year ending March 31 to Y500bn (Pounds 3bn). In the US, its largest market, the company expects sales to remain flat for the year at Dollars 4.3bn. Suddenly, the world seems to be ganging up on video game makers. The UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission has launched an investigation of industry pricing policies; US lawmakers are proposing bills that would censor video game violence; competitors with more advanced technology are crowding into the market; and others, offering new forms of home entertainment such as interactive television, threaten to encroach on their turf. A slowing rate of growth in the video games market is inevitable, says Mr Robert Devereux, chairman of Virgin Interactive Entertainment (VIE); the high growth rates of previous years were unsustainable. To remain winners in this increasingly hostile environment, video game makers must learn some new moves. Like the characters in their own products, they face the possibility of extinction or the opportunity to jump to a new level of game playing. Mr Devereux, whose company is part of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group, argues that technological change - primarily the move from cartridge-based games to compact disc read-only memory (CD-Rom) - will provide the opportunity to draw new consumers into the market. CD-Roms, like audio compact discs, can play music. However, they can also be used to store video games or computer programs, or all of the above. Sales of multimedia personal computers equipped with CD-Roms are booming in the US, with sales expected to total 20m to 25m units over the next three years. The multimedia PC represents new opportunities for video game software developers which transfer their games to the CD-Rom format. With higher data storage capacity, CD-Roms give writers more freedom to develop games based on more detailed stories, incorporating live-action video. Sim City 2000, for example, challenges players to build and manage a city of the future. As the city ruler, the game player must build schools, pass laws and deal with emergencies. 'Challenge scenarios' include firestorms, earthquakes and tornados. Such games, with intricate plots and developed story lines, may be the key to the long elusive female video game buyer, some industry executives believe. However, if video game publishers are to expand the demographics of their market 'they are going to have to tone down their production values. The vertiginous frenzy of most games probably does not appeal to most adults, and the barrage of corny music is downright annoying,' says Mr Richard Shaffer, president of Technologic Partners, an industry consulting group. To placate critics of violence, several developers have begun labelling their games with a rating system akin to that used in the film industry. Most companies will eliminate sequences that could be 'X-rated' to ensure that their games are not banned by parents or toy stores, industry observers predict. CD-based products could, however, provide greater ammunition for critics who claim the games encourage violence, Mr Devereux admits. The pictures on CD-based games will be more vivid; Mr Devereux says this will make it more difficult for children to distinguish between games and reality. One example is Ground Zero Texas, a CD game soon to be released for the Sega Genesis machine. With scenes reminiscent of Waco, Texas - including a fire that engulfs the encampment - players in the role of government agents are assigned to clean out the aliens. The characters are real actors and actresses, in full-motion video. In the broader home computing market, video games developers will be competing with bigger fish. Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, recently expanded its efforts in the consumer field, with programs aimed at home computer users such as Creative Writer, which encourages children to write with help from Maggie and Max, two cartoon characters. The once distinct markets of video games and personal computers are converging, as prices of the latest CD-equipped video game machines rise and PC prices decline. And although there is still a Dollars 1,000 gap between them, the educational and entertainment values promoted by the PC industry appeal to a greater number of consumers than the raw grit of video games. Also intensifying competition in the video games market is a new generation of multi-player machines. One of the most promising is 3DO's 'interactive multi-player', priced at about Dollars 700. The fledgling Californian company has licensed two of Japan's leading consumer electronics manufacturers, Matsushita and Sanyo, to produce versions of the system that can play music CDs and video games. Among the 20 or so games so far available for the 3DO multi-player is Mad Dog McCree, based on a western gunslinger story, and Escape from Monster Manor, a shoot-'em-up game. Both feature sophisticated graphics. Looking further ahead, the ability to send video games - along with music, films and retail catalogues - via cable television services into people's homes, will create a new method of distribution to expand the games market. And the next step in terms of technology will be 'virtual reality games', which give the illusion of personally participating in the action. Players wearing helmets that project images before their eyes - whichever way they turn - might find themselves on a battlefield, driving a spaceship or hacking their way through a jungle. It will be several years before virtual reality becomes a consumer product, most analysts predict. By then, perhaps the video game industry will have more to offer than Mortal Kombat V or a sequel to Night Trap - a popular game that depicts masked cyber-vampires who attach clamps and drills to the necks of scantily clad young women. Sex and violence will undoubtedly remain a staple of the video game, as of other popular media. Yet as technology advances create opportunities for increasingly life-like images, the maturing video game industry could move beyond adolescent fantasies and comic-book style scripts - if it can muster the art and imagination to do so.</p>

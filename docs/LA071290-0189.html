			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ASSESSMENT PROGRAM TEST SCORES;  </P> <P> STUDENTS GET THE GOOD WORD; TEST SHOWS IMPROVED WRITING  </P> <P> High-school students throughout San Diego County showed strong improvement in  their writing skills, exceeding the growth displayed by their peers across  California, in the latest results from the nation's most comprehensive  standardized writing test being released today.  </P> <P> The gains give heart to state schools Supt. Bill Honig and especially to county  educators who have pushed hard for increased writing instruction at all grade  levels during the past four years.  </P> <P> Scores from the second year of the California Assessment Program essay test for  12th-graders taken last December show county students raised their average  score to 272 from 258, compared with a gain to 256 from 250 for all seniors  statewide.  </P> <P> (Essays are graded by teams of teachers on a range from 1 to 6, with 6 being  the best possible essay, and then converted by the State Department of  Education into scaled scores on a range from 100 to 400. CAP does not provide  individual student scores but only scores for schools and districts as a  measure of whether state educational goals are being met.)  </P> <P> In particular, students in the San Diego Unified School District -- the  nation's eighth-largest urban system -- boosted their scores to 261 from the  246 recorded on the first CAP direct-writing test in December, 1988.  </P> <P> The district, with 6,000 of the county's 20,000 seniors, posted its substantial  gain despite increased numbers of students with limited English skills -- 4.2%  of the total in 1988 to 7% in 1989. Madison, Hoover and San Diego high schools,  all with large numbers of limited-English and nonwhite students, made jumps of  more than 40 points in their scores.  </P> <P> Impressive gains were also registered by the San Marcos, Carlsbad, and  Escondido districts in North County, although San Dieguito remained tops in the  county, with a scaled score of 338. Only the heavily nonwhite Oceanside and  Sweetwater districts, and the rural single-school Mountain Empire district  scored below the state averages, although they all also showed gains over the  first-year scores.  </P> <P> The CAP writing results are carefully noted by educators, since the test is on  the cutting edge of a nationwide reform movement to require more essay- and  performance-based testing rather than multiple-choice exams.  </P> <P> As such, the test requires students to show what they have learned rather than  simply provide information about style, grammar and content. A similar essay  test is given to all state eighth-graders and will be expanded to elementary  grades in the next couple of years.  </P> <P> "I think the improvement shows that we have demystified writing" both for  teachers and students "by taking it out of the abstract and explaining it in  concrete terms," Tom Boysen, superintendent of the County Office of Education,  said Wednesday. "And the results show that gains can be accomplished at any  school, given good, sustained instruction."  </P> <P> His office has sponsored a host of efforts to help teachers improve their  writing instruction, as well as operating both the College-Ready Writers and  High School-Ready Writers projects at the secondary school level to provide  cash incentives for schools showing strong improvements.  </P> <P> "We've created good performance standards through the CAP test and made it  important for people to pay attention, so that they have clear, focused targets  to which they can judge their teaching," Boysen said, crediting UC San Diego  literature and writing professor Charles Cooper for developing the state's  direct-writing assessment.  </P> <P> Cooper has stressed that students need to practice all kinds of writings, that  gains in literacy are connected to specific uses, and that both teachers and  students need to be encouraged to enjoy writing as a discipline.  </P> <P> School districts throughout the county have now adopted new literature-based  reading instruction programs, where reading and writing are taught together  rather than separated into discrete subjects.  </P> <P> But Boysen said that the higher scores should not satisfy anyone yet.  </P> <P> "The new data shows that 57% of our students in the county now do acceptably  well on the essays, which means that they are graded with a 4 or better,"  Boysen said, "but our top high school in the county, Torrey Pines High School  (in the San Dieguito district), has 78% of its students at 4 or better.  </P> <P> "I think that, while we should be pleased to be at 57%, we should be asking  ourselves how we can get the entire county to 78%."  </P> <P> The CAP test requires students to write timed essays in one or more types of  writing: autobiographical; evaluation of an argument; interpretation of an  argument; reflection on an abstract idea; position on a controversy;  observation of an incident.  </P> <P> In statewide data not yet available at the county or district levels, Honig  said that Asian students improved to 260 from 253, black students improved to  215 from 209, and Latinos students improved to 218 from 212.  </P> <P> Honig said that non-native English speakers with English fluency, who  constitute 14% of the statewide senior class, increased their scores seven  points, to 243 from 236. But limited-English speaking students, 7% of the  total, dropped five points statewide, to 153 from 158.  </P> <P> In survey questions asked as part of the test, students indicated how many  writing assignments they do each week, how much time they spend on homework and  how much they read for pleasure.  </P> <P> Scores were higher for those students who did more assignments, read more and  spent more time on homework -- results that while not surprising are  nevertheless stressed by Honig as part of his "bully pulpit" effort to improve  attitudes toward education.  </P> <P> Students with only one writing assignment per week averaged 253, compared with  a score of 283 with students doing 11 or more per week. Students with two or  more hours of homework daily averaged 304, and those who read for pleasure one  or more hours per day averaged 310.  </P> <P> "The outcome once again demonstrates that, the more students write, as called  for in the new state English/Language Arts curriculum framework, the better  they perform academically," Honig said.  </P> <P> Boysen agreed, adding that he hopes students will be asked next year whether  they enjoy writing more, given the increased emphasis and practice in schools.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW TO READ THE SCORES  </P> <P> These are the San Diego County school-by-school results of the California  Assessment Program's writing exam administered last winter to high school  seniors throughout the state. During one class period, students are required to  write an essay from one of six general categories: autobiographical incident,  evaluation, interpretation, reflective essay, controversial issue and  observational writing. Each essay is graded for thinking and writing skills as  well as for basic mechanics, such as spelling and grammar.  </P> <P> The CAP program is designed to measure the progress of schools and not  youngsters individually. The grades are combined into a single scaled score,  ranging from 1 to more than 400.  </P> <P> The statewide average was 250 for the class of 1989 and 256 for the class of  1990. The average score for San Diego County was 258 in 1989 and 272 in 1990.  </P> <P> Results are listed by school district and by individual high school so that  parents can compare the performance of youngsters in their community with that  of students in the rest of the county. (Schools are listed alphabetically by  district.)  </P> <P> * State Rank shows how the school or district did in relation to all others in  the state. The range is from 1 to 99, with 99 being best.  </P> <P> * Relative Rank provides a way to compare a district or school with others  whose students are similar in terms of ethnic makeup and socioeconomic level  and in their ability to speak English fluently, as well as how often those  students move from school to school.  </P> <P> For example, seniors at Poway Unified, with a score of 307, did better than 92%  of others in California. But they did better than only 65% of other students  with similar backgrounds. Granite Hills students, on the other hand, did almost  as well when compared with similar students as when compared with students  statewide. With their score of 270, Granite Hills students earned a statewide  ranking of 67 and a relative ranking of 65.  </P> <P> WRITING EXAM RESULTS  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:1.78IN:1.78IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS"

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pits study piles pressure on British Coal BRITISH COAL faces severe difficulties in closing Grimethorpe colliery - one of 10 pits where production has ended - after an independent consultant yesterday rejected its argument that the mine is financially unviable. The support for the South Yorkshire colliery by John T Boyd, a consultancy appointed by the government, will add to British Coal's problems when it returns to the High Court probably next month to put its case for the closures. Meanwhile it emerged yesterday that the cabinet is unlikely to discuss coal at its weekly meeting on Thursday. This raises the possibility that a white paper on the issue, promised last October after the government was forced to back down on plans to close 31 pits, will be delayed beyond next week. The cabinet committee on coal will later this week be given an update on the DTI's latest proposals. It is likely to discuss problems posed by a further delay, not least for British Coal which has no contracts with electricity generators for coal sales after the end of this month. Boyd, in its final report on the 10 pits earmarked for early closure, gave some comfort to British Coal by concluding that it was preserving the fabric of the collieries in accordance with an undertaking to High Court judges. The judges last year ruled that closure of the 10 was illegal and ordered that an independent scrutineer should assist on future decisions. Unions have rejected British Coal's and the government's contention that Boyd can provide that role. Boyd's final report re-affirms its conclusion in an earlier draft that Grimethorpe failed to meet closure criteria because, according to Boyd, it was profit-making and could remain so. The pit could 'reasonably' be projected to be profitable, although performance would have to be improved over the next three years. Boyd found that Taff Merthyr, another of the 10, did not meet BC's closure criteria because it could have been viable for several weeks longer. Boyd does not recommend re-opening it but says miners should be compensated for loss of earnings. Boyd found Markham could become economically viable if there was weekend working and longer shifts, but the colliery would require an extensive amount of development and a 'substantial im-provement' in the work ethos. Although miners at Grimethorpe will welcome the Boyd report, they will be hard-pressed to win their case that the mine stays open. British Coal was placing considerable emphasis yesterday on Boyd's acknowledgement that the profitability of any operation is dependent on there being a market for its product. The white paper is unlikely to provide a market, and therefore a lifeline, for even half of the 31 threatened pits. 'The retention of Grimethorpe would be at the expense of another colliery with more realistic prospects of maintaining viable operations.' For Labour, Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said that the report showed Mr Heseltine had 'got it wrong again.' 'Last October he told parliament all 10 pits must close because they were clearly uneconomic. Now his own consultants have concluded he was wrong,' Mr Cook said. Monktonhall Mineworkers, the consortium of miners which runs an Edinburgh colliery leased last year from British Coal, has agreed a five-year deal with ScottishPower to supply the electricity company with 100,000 tonnes of coal a year. But it was not clear last night whether the contract, the second big order the company has won, would stave off a severe financial crisis caused mainly by delays in bringing the mine back into production. It emerged at the weekend that the 160 miners, each of whom has invested Pounds 10,000 in the company, had gone without wages for seven weeks after Bank of Scotland refused to advance more loans.</p>

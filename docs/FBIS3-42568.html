			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> Article by Igor Arkhipov, observer of the weekly CHAS PIK, </F> for OBSHCHAYA GAZETA: "Sobchak Has Given It to the St.  Petersburg Soviet Via Moscow"]    [Text] A long-standing dream of the mayor of St.  Petersburg has, finally, come true--the St. Petersburg Soviet  has been dissolved. Anatoliy Sobchak now governs the city  single-handedly.    In St. Petersburg, the essence of the opposition of the  representative and executive authorities, which went as far as  the surprise conflict of Aleksandr Belyayev and Anatoliy  Sobchak, amounted by no means to the question of whether new  soviet elections were necessary. The problem lay elsewhere--who  would draw up the statutes governing the municipal authorities  and elections. The deputies feared that were the initiative to  pass to the mayoralty, the successor of Soviet power in  Petersburg could be a "pocket" city duma, which would not be  permitted to control the administration.    On the final day of the city soviet's existence, 22  December,  the deputies displayed miracles of efficiency, adopting within  90 minutes, practically without time-outs for debate, their  rules of the game. In accordance with these, the city was to  have a council consisting of 124 deputies working on a  professional basis. This figure was unexpectedly deduced by the  Democratic Russia deputy Vasyutochkin on the basis of  mathematical calculations, modern management theory, and world  experience (in accordance with his system of methods,  incidentally, the duma in Moscow should consist not of 35, but  of almost 200 deputies). The mayoralty took this as an insult.  In addition, the council acquired the right to appoint and  dismiss senior functionaries of the administration and express  no confidence in it, dismiss (following a court ruling) the  mayor himself, even, and conduct a referendum in the city!    When the deputies' intentions became clear, the edict,  signed  by the president, "Reform of the Organs of State Power of the  City of St. Petersburg" appeared. It was no secret that the  author of this edict was none other than Anatoliy Sobchak. The  mayor took account of his recent gaffe: He had at the end of  November attempted to eliminate the Inner Council by his  directive and was accused of having broken the law and of having  appropriated the prerogatives of the president. This time,  Anatoliy Aleksandrovich resolved not to ignore the chief of  state.    The St. Petersburg situation is an example of how the model  of behavior adopted by the federal executive, forcing the  structural reorganization of the political system of the state,  is being carried over to the regional level. The impatience with  the statutes being prepared by the Petersburg Soviet on a reform  of the authorities was reminiscent of the charges leveled at the  Congress of preparation of a constitution "for itself." The  mayor's presentation of his version of a municipal  "constitution," on the other hand, is proving to be analogous to  the "phased constitutional reform."    St. Petersburg's mayor has now for certain reasons been  forced to show that he is no less royal than the king. In the  course of the parliamentary elections, Sobckak involuntarily  criticized Yeltsin and Russia's Choice, imitating the  "constructive opposition" (Mikhail Poltoranin, who showed up in  St. Petersburg two days prior to the elections, discovered with  horror that "the city is headed by an opponent of the  Constitution"!). After the defeat of the Russian Democratic  Reform Movement, which obtained in St. Petersburg only 8.66  percent, and after the local "Democratic Russians" ostracized  Sobchak as a "splitter" of the democratic movement, the mayor  had by way of moral and political rehabilitation to demonstrate  his "decisiveness." More precisely, concern himself with  avoiding early elections and become, essentially, "president" of  St. Petersburg.    The town governor is now not only head of the executive in  the city, but also "arbiter." "Arbiter," what is more, between  himself (that is, the administration) and the City Assembly. The  representative authority is generously endowed with truly sham  functions--50 deputies working on a part-time basis, meeting  once a week, have the right to vote on the budget proposed by  the mayoralty and stamp the mayor's directives; a two-thirds  vote is needed to override his "veto." The "Statute on the  System of the Organs of State Power" proposed by Sobchak, which  Yeltsin approved as a supplement to the edict, was drawn up with  a manifest claim to parody. The deputies' draft, for example,  had contained the following provision: If the Council has  rejected the candidacy of an official, the mayoralty may not  offer it for a second time within six months. In Sobchak's  version, this appears as follows: Following a lack of confidence  expressed in an official by the deputies, the mayor may retain  him "in a personal capacity," and the City Assembly is not  entitled to return to this matter for six months!    Aleksandr Belyayev, chairman of the St. Petersburg Soviet  and  now a deputy of the Federation Council, reacted negatively to  the recent initiatives of the executive and even promised on  behalf of the deputies to bring an action against the president  in the Supreme Court. Belyayev believes that a city assembly  working on a "volunteer basis" would, most likely, be formed  from government officials. His forecast seems more convincing to  many people than the mayor's claims that such a reform does not  signify a return to the soviets of the times of the CPSU but a  resurrection of the traditions of the pre-revolution city duma,  with class representation.    The position of Aleksandr Belyayev, incidentally, who has  traditionally been inclined to leave himself room for maneuver,  has been distinguished by a firm consistency as of late.  Belyayev condemned many representatives of Russia's Choice for  political extremism, warning: "If the `Choice' continues the  policy of procedural stunts, during preparation of the work of  the Federal Assembly included, and to fan hysteria over  Zhirinovskiy, an effective majority against the `Choice' and the  Liberal Democratic Party as extremes will take shape"....</p>

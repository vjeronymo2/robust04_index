			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / The new agenda - reform of civil servants In the last 10 years, the role of government in the economies of Latin America has been in decline, writes Stephen Fidler, Latin American Editor. As governments have privatised inefficient state industries and deregulated, there has been strong emphasis on the importance of market mechanisms in generating economic growth. Although few can claim to have completed market reform, the pendulum already seems to be swinging the other way - towards trying to improve the way that governments function. Studies of the successful Asian developing economies almost always underline the constructive role of government - and in particular meritocratic bureaucracies - in generating growth. However, because of the poor record of Latin American governments, some economists believe the optimal size of the state there is smaller than in Asia. Some functions, however, are inevitably the state's responsibility - legal systems and regulation of private utilities. In other activities - such as social services - the market may have a role but the state's participation is often essential. Mr Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan minister and the chief economist at the InterAmerican Development Bank in Washington, says: 'The agenda ahead is highly concentrated on these institutional issues.' He identifies one important problem seen all over the world but is particularly acute in Latin America: the tendency of departments of government to lose sight of their objectives. 'Institutions tend to fall under the control of the producers, rather than the consumers.' Bureaucracies tend to function for the benefit of those working inside them and attempts to reform them are often thwarted by powerful public sector unions. Furthermore, government bureaucracies have been weakened by fiscal stringency, another aspect of economic reform. This has reduced real wages in the public sector and its ability to attract talent. 'It's not at all clear whether significant progress has been made (in reforming bureaucracies), though the problem may be less critical because their scope to do harm has been reduced by the reforms,' he says. Mr Andrew Nickson, a senior lecturer at the University of Birmingham with direct experience of several Latin American bureaucracies, agrees that bureaucratic capabilities in the region are very weak. Some governments, encouraged by the IADB and the World Bank, are shedding large numbers of civil servants - but there is little evidence that the capacity of remaining civil servants is being improved. Not only are wages low, but career possibilities of civil servants are stunted. They can rarely move from one department to another (or from one municipal or state government to another) because there are no uniform civil service standards. There are some reasons for optimism that the trend toward decentralising government increases its accountability to the public. However, he says 'virtually every country pays lip service to the idea of a career-based civil service, but the reality is very far from the rhetoric. I don't honestly see very much change.'</p>

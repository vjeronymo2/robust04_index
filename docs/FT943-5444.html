			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Anyone for an armadillo? - Diary of a Private Investor / Kevin Goldstein-Jackson explains why he finds salerooms and their contents irresistible For aesthetic and investment reasons, I am an avid collector of all sorts of things including paintings, sculptures and interesting items. How, then, could I resist a lot, offered at my local auction, comprising a stuffed armadillo, a crocodile skin, a stuffed alligator, a stuffed marsupial, various wooden Chinese figures and a mule saddle . . . especially as the catalogue estimated only Pounds 40-Pounds 60 for it. Equally intriguing was a similarly priced lot consisting of 'two boxes of assorted curios, blowpipe, quivers, early shoes, polished stones, gas masks etc.' Also on offer were 'numerous pre-1947 coins and others', estimated at Pounds 30-Pounds 50. Perhaps I might find a 1933 penny worth more than Pounds 25,000. After all, I once bought a small collection of paintings at the same auction house only to find, when I got them home, that three more pictures were hidden behind one of the canvases. I enjoy local auctions. They are convivial and informal places where people sit on the chairs to be auctioned while a whole parade of objects is displayed and, rapidly, sold. Experts can, and do, find bargains although I have no such insider knowledge; I just buy what appeals to me. But, over the years of auction-going, from the grand venues of London to local salerooms, I have learned several valuable lessons. The most important is always to inspect the items before the sale starts. What might appear a flawless piece of china when held up during the auction can, on close inspection, turn out to be a mended item. A painting could look superb from a distance; close up, it might have irreparable damage. Close examination prevents such embarrassments. Auction customs have changed over the years. In the past, bids have been made by nods, winks, raising a hand or scratching your nose. In many venues today, they are made by displaying a 'paddle' - a length of wood or plastic to which a number has been fixed. Intending bidders register their name and address - and often, for major auctions, their business or banking details - with the saleroom. In return, they get a numbered paddle to raise when they wish to make an offer. Many auction houses use computers to track bids. For a novice, it is easy to overlook that the final bid price is not the only amount to be paid. To this must be added a buyer's premium, which is usually 15 per cent on the first Pounds 30,000 and 10 per cent on the rest. Some auction houses charge less; at Christie's in South Kensington, London, the premium is a flat 10 per cent. But remember that value added tax must be paid on premiums. While the major London salerooms offer a packing service, you have to take your own wrapping and packaging materials to most local auctions. Before visiting an auction room on viewing day - usually the day before the actual sale - I always get a copy of the catalogue. It is important to remember that the estimated prices given may vary considerably, up or down. In my early days of collecting, I used to write on the catalogue the limit to which I was prepared to go to acquire an item. I stopped doing this after a charity auction at which a friend kept bidding against me for a painting until it was knocked down to me at my limit. 'I'm sorry I bid against you,' I said later. 'But I really liked the picture.' 'That's all right,' he replied. 'I didn't want it. I saw you write down your limit for it, so I thought I would help the charity to get a full price for it.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Leaders of Japan's two main  opposition parties on Monday [27 June] agreed on the need to  form a new government by the end of Tuesday, but they failed to  come up with a plan of action to achieve that end.    The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the biggest opposition  group, and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic  Party of Japan -- SDPJ] agreed that the two parties bear great  responsibility to get the current political turmoil under  control, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news  conference.    LDP President Yohei Kono and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama  "shared a view that a new prime minister should be elected  before the end of June 28," said Kubo, the No. 2 man of the SDP.  "But our stances to have the situation in hand are not  necessarily the same," Kubo said, indicating there would be no  immediate formation of a coalition government by the two parties.    With Japan facing serious issues at home and abroad, and the  summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized  economies approaching, it is crucial to pick a new premier and  launch a new government as quickly as possible, Kono and  Murayama agreed, according to Kubo.    The meeting of the leaders of the LDP and the SDP came two  days after Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and his two-month-old  minority government resigned. During the 40-minute meeting,  Kono called on Murayama to consider the opening of new  government negotiations with New Party Sakigake, in addition to  negotiations with the LDP, Kubo said. The SDP and Sakigake,  both former members of the ruling coalition, have already kicked  off talks on a joint policy platform to be released soon.    Asked about the possibility of a new government being  launched by Tuesday, Kubo replied, "I cannot tell." "In the  case of a single-party government, you can tell the schedule.  But as for a coalition government, you cannot start until it is  known which parties will share the government," he said.    Kubo revealed that he has proposed via Chief Cabinet  Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai holding a meeting between Hata and  Murayama to explore the possibility of the SDP forming a new  government with the current ruling coalition. The coalition  must be weighing how to respond to the offer, he said.    Hata resigned with his minority government Saturday in the  face of an LDP-proposed no-confidence motion and an SDP demand  for the collective resignation of his cabinet as a prerequisite  for the SDP's return to the ruling camp. The coalition insists  it is the LDP and the SDP that should chart a course for the  formation of a new government, not the coalition.    Although some LDP and SDP leaders have voiced readiness for  a  tie-up of the two parties to succeed the Hata government,  resistance to such an alliance is strong within both parties as  they have sharp differences on key policy issues. Notably, the  SDP central executive committee has decided not to ally with the  LDP.    Kubo, who favors the SDP rejoining the ruling coalition,  asserted that the party should follow the committee decision as  it examines ways to form a new government. "I have been told by  party members to abide by the central executive committee  decision and I myself have followed the decision sincerely,"  kubo said. "The decision must be observed by all means," he  said.    The House of Representatives steering committee canceled a  lower house plenary session scheduled for 1PM [0400 GMT] because  the parliament was not prepared to pick a successor to Prime  Minister Hata, committee sources said.</p>

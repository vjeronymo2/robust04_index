			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F> Milica Ostojic-Pusara; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Ostojic-Pusara] Good evening, esteemed viewers.  We know that several days ago the so-called contact group for  Bosnia was formed, consisting of representatives of the United  States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations.  After the first meeting that was held in London, this group  will try -- if we understood it correctly -- to regain the  dynamics of the peace process on the ground, of course, with the  involvement of the warring sides.    Is this the path toward peace in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and what does the involvement of this  contact group mean in practice for the FRY? This evening we are  asking FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic about these  issues.    [Jovanovic] Every shift toward peace certainly represents an  alternative to the worst that had been our everyday life until a  few days ago, especially in the Gorazde region. In this sense  the contact group with the plan of contacts that it will have in  the period ahead is in a way contributing to the recovery of the  atmosphere and the creation of the necessary preconditions for  the renewal and strengthening of the negotiating process.    However, what is more important than the instruments  themselves, than the structure of negotiations, which also  include the contact group, should be the refreshing of the  approach to the Yugoslav crisis. The approach hitherto, the  one-sided, partial, selective approach, not only has it been  unjust, but it also became to a great extent the generator of  the crisis itself.    This was the case during the denouement of the latest  developments, when we saw the demonstration of partiality, which  was prevented at the last moment from resulting in an  escalation, an even worse situation. Therefore, now that we are  at the fresh start of renewing the negotiating process, everyone  should make a sufficient self-critical review and everyone  should on his part try to remove from his way of thinking, his  approach, and from his stands everything that has so far been  hindering the negotiating process, leading to its failure. As  for the foreign factors that have so far been involved in  solving or not solving the Yugoslav crisis -- depending on their  individual attitude -- there are certainly very serious and very  sound reasons for everyone to carry out the necessary revision  of the current approach to the crisis, and to introduce in these  approaches and stands the necessary corrections. If this does  not happen we would run the risk of the negotiating process not  only being unnecessarily prolonged and perhaps being made more  complicated, but also something worse, namely instead of being  food for peace, the process would become food for maintaining  the crisis and even renewing the military conflicts.    I say this because one side, at least one side in this civil  war, the Muslim side, will always find a reason to believe, to  be encouraged, or to be under the illusion that -- by further  complicating the procedure of negotiating, and occasionally  resorting to combat activities -- it will gain more than through  the negotiations. The negotiating process has, thus far, been  burdened by this very negative factor, and all our warnings that  the inequitable approach of the leading components creates not  only an inequitable final result but also makes it impossible  for the negotiating momentum to follow its logical course toward  a prompt conclusion. [sentence as heard]    We would like to see the contact group adopt, in the new  cycle of involvement, a fresh approach and cleansed views when  it comes to the question of how to get out of this crisis, and  how to make all the elements, the three warring sides, equally  responsible for the negotiating efforts and the final result.  In that sense we are ready to be as active, open, and  constructive as always, when it comes to solving the Bosnian  crisis, with the contact group and the other participants in the  negotiating process, which will most probably be resumed.    [Ostojic-Pusara] As has happened before, it is possible that  one of the warring sides -- and I am referring to the Muslims  here -- will ask for some kind of a retreat. We have been  reading recently that Mr. Izetbegovic, leader of the Bosnian  Muslims, has asked, that is, has sent a letter to the king of  Saudi Arabia, asking for the Organization of Islamic Conference  to be the fifth and equal member of the contact group.    [Jovanovic] This is one of the continuous efforts of the  Muslim leadership to complicate the procedure, making the  negotiating process more complex, and helping those elements in  the process whose natural interests are not in ending this  crisis as soon as possible, but rather in gaining maximum  advantage from it. The advantage is not equal for all the  participants in the war or the peoples of the Balkans in  comparison to the advantage that the non-Balkan factors -- not  all but some -- expect to gain from this crisis.    We know that the Islamic bloc of countries is fully engaged  in a very biased, one-sided, and aggressively provocative way.  Everything they have undertaken so far has been aimed at  deepening antagonism between the warring sides, and not at  narrowing their differences. Everything has been done to  facilitate the creation of conditions for the  internationalization of the military conflict, for unimpeded  outside involvement with impunity. The participation of Saudi  Arabia -- which, by the way, does not have diplomatic relations  with any other country except Muslim Bosnia -- could not be  interpreted as a constructive contribution to efforts made by  the contact group and other countries that are positively  oriented toward peace, for the revival of the negotiating  process.    [Ostojic-Pusara] It seems that this is, according to you --  and I suppose also the federal government -- a path toward  peace. There is talk now of a four-month cease-fire. Do you  believe that it would be possible within that period of time to  come to an overall peace solution, if the favoritism is  eliminated, of course?    [Jovanovic] It would be best to put a final complete stop to  that unfortunate war, and -- with the feeling of safety that the  war will not deepen or be renewed -- to make relaxed but rapid  efforts to find a final just and lasting political solution.  That is the view of the FRY and the Bosnian Serbs. That is  also the view of many other participants in the negotiating  process. However, the view of the Muslim leadership is  different. They want to have a fixed-term cease-fire, which is  reason enough for one to wonder why they are doing this.    [Ostojic-Pusara] Anything can happen in that time, right?    [Jovanovic] First of all, they are doing this because they  want to keep the option of renewing and extending the war.  Second, it is possible that they see this cease-fire as a lull  for arming and new provocations for renewing the war from even  better starting positions. It is also possible that they are  doing this in the expectation that they can materialize the  support that they are getting from their friends from abroad,  that they can turn this support into victory for themselves.    [Ostojic-Pusara] This could then be a preparation for war,  rather than a preparation for peace.    [Jovanovic] It could be a preparation for the continuation  of the political war, or part of the preparation for the  continuation of the armed conflict. In any case, the fact that  Saudi Arabia is singled out indicates that the Muslim leadership  could use this period of relative peace to turn to escalating  political pressure on the Serbs in Bosnia, in Yugoslavia, and on  the Serbian people in general, which would have a negative  effect on the negotiating atmosphere and perhaps even affect the  final outcome.    In any case, in the absence of the best solution, even the  not-so-good solution is better than no solution at all.  Therefore, even though the cease-fire would be a fixed-term  cease-fire, that in itself would not represent the failure of  the peace efforts if it is accompanied by a sufficient number of  guarantees given by relevant international bodies that this  period would not be abused for the preparation for war, or that  it would not be used as an opportunity to obstruct the  negotiating process.    These are things that can be negotiated, and -- without  wishing to prejudice the stand that the leadership of the  Bosnian Serbs will take on this issue -- I think that this is  not a question that can be put down as unsolvable. On the  contrary.    [Ostojic-Pusara] In your view, is it clear what actual means  this group has available to reach peace? How likely are abuses  here?    [Jovanovic] The contact group....    [Ostojic-Pusara, interruptsing It proposes things that will  later go to the conference....    [Jovanovic, interrupting] It first has to revive the  contacts that were severed or frozen due to the escalation in  tensions, and to create conditions for the start of the real  negotiating process in which the warring sides will -- with the  help of peace-loving countries from elsewhere -- try this time,  I hope successfully, to agree on a final political solution. It  is hard to predict what this solution will be like. It will  come as a result from the contacts and the first stages of the  negotiating process.    The basic question is whether all the participants in the  process have an equal desire for peace, whether someone still  has a desire for war, and whether the foreign participants are  all equally interested in reaching peace quickly and in a way  that is equal for all. The establishment of equality in the  treatment of the participants in the peace process is something  that is implied. So far there has been no equality because one  side, the Serbian side, has constantly been in an inferior  position. It was under multiple pressure, media pressure,  economic pressure through the sanctions, and political pressure  through isolation and satanization. These things cannot be a  contribution to the negotiating process, but rather, on the  contrary, they serve as a warning that this imbalance must be  urgently removed in order to make the process a real  conversation among equals. Then the result of the talks can be  based on consensus and freely expressed will.    Therefore, parallel to the cease-fire, which we hope will  take place in the near future -- the sooner the better --  parallel to that, work has to be done on the cessation, or at  least the suspension of the other forms of hostilities that have  been very obviously and aggressively expressed toward the  Bosnian Serb side, and Yugoslavia. The sanctions are one form  of these hostilities. They are affecting equitability, they are  making the negotiations more difficult, and are preventing any  political solution that is reached from being turned into  reality. We also have this media war that is still going on; it  is also a form of hostility. It is making the psychological  basis for negotiations more difficult and it is giving  credibility to the illusions, particularly on the Muslim side,  that -- with the assistance of these hostilities and those  expressed through sanctions -- they can obstruct negotiations,  something that, at the moment, it would appear they would not be  able to achieve with arms.    [Ostojic-Pusara] Are there any indications, Mr. Jovanovic,  that the peace process will include the principle of alleviating  the sanctions, or gradually lifting them?    [Jovanovic] I have already said that the sanctions are a  form of hostility directed toward one side alone, and this in a  direct way stops dialogue and negotiations from being a two-way  process, a process in which all the participants have equal  starting positions and equal reasons to expect that the positive  result of their talks will benefit everyone. The most  principled thing to do would be to eliminate this form of  hostility along with eliminating the armed form of hostility,  and the third form I have mentioned. If this cannot be done  immediately, it is certainly necessary to start lifting the  absurd sanctions as soon as the agreement on the cease-fire is  reached. The absurdity of the sanctions is becoming an eyesore  even to those who imposed them, not to mention how much they  create negative points for everyone, including those who imposed  them.    [Ostojic-Pusara] And those who called for them first, who  lost a lot because of them.    [Jovanovic] I was just about to say that.    [Ostojic-Pusina] The decision to call for a ministerial  conference -- which should be held at the beginning of next week  -- depends on the political success, that is, the negotiations,  on things that the contact group, as they call it, will find on  the ground, and on the dialogue with the two warring sides.    [Jovanovic] It is important that the contact group has an  equitable approach toward all the participants in the civil war.  This means if it has to exert pressure, then that pressure has  to be exerted at the same time and equally on all the sides. If  it is supposed to stimulate more successful negotiations, this,  too, has to be done equally for all. If this selective attitude  is maintained, when one side is constantly disfavored while the  other two sides are constantly favored, then it is clear that  this is a recipe for failure, not success.    [Ostojic-Pusina] We have been reading in the daily press  that the group has several initiatives -- everything in London  was behind closed doors -- and there is talk that the final  stage should again be the much talked about drawing of the  borders. Abuse is, of course, possible here.    [Jovanovic] You see, the demarcation of territories is  effectively the basic issue -- since the civil war is being  waged because every side believes or feels that it is endangered  on its ethnic territory by the other side or sides. The  question is merely whether the territorial demarcation should be  done before, after, or at the same time. All three methods have  already been tried. Not one of them has produced a conclusive  result even though the method used last summer and autumn was  the most successful so far. Were it not for the hesitation, not  to say obstruction, on the side of the Muslims at the last  minute, we would already have had peace in Bosnia for six or  seven months now.    However, whichever way you solve or try to solve this  question, it cannot be resolved by pressuring one side and  supporting the other sides. This has to be the result of  agreement, of consensus of all three sides, and the other  participants in the process have to offer only so-called  positive support to make the negotiations easier and help out  with useful ideas if there is a halt in the negotiations.    [Ostojic-Pusina] If possible, could you comment at the end  of this interview on Russia's role in the peace process? We  have witnessed some vacillations in certain statements and views  of the Russian administration. Some analysts say that the West  is involving Russia in the peace process only when the decision  has already been made. Others say that this is because Russia  does not want to defy the West over Bosnia or a place like  Gorazde. Can you tell us something about that?    [Jovanovic] You see, relations between Russia and the West  are very complex, sometimes contradictory, sometimes delicate.  In any case, we do not have enough data for a final  determination. It is possible that relations will exist in this  immature and fluid form until the elements of the new balance of  power are crystallized, which are at the moment being  established painstakingly, very controversially, and desperately  before our very eyes.    We, as the Balkans, as Yugoslavia, are only one weight on  the scales, sometimes heavier, sometimes lighter -- depending on  how either side wants to use the weight to improve or establish  the balance in its favor. What has been coming from Russia --  regardless of the reasons, which can be understood and  explained, and perhaps even justified -- is something that  characterizes one great power in its relations with another  great power, and shows that the interests of a great power and a  smaller country are not always in concord and uniform, and can  even be in contradiction.    This is not news to us. We have had evidence of such  behavior in the past in relations with other great powers,  including Russia -- both Red and Blue. The last time it  happened was when Russia voted for the imposition of sanctions,  and now giving approval for the engagement of NATO against the  Serbs in Bosnia is a similar moment, which will be food for  thought not only for us, for this generation, but for  generations yet to come. All great powers try to avoid such  acts as much as possible, and if possible not have anything to  do with them.    However, the nature of our relations with Russia is such  that  all such events nevertheless end as episodes, and they do not  influence in a more essential and more permanent way the  constants in the closeness of our interests in various spheres.  So, despite everything, Russia continues to play a positive and  constructive role in the settlement of the Yugoslav crisis  because, out of all foreign participants, Russia is still by far  the most objective and as such a necessary element for  correcting and balancing the one- sided policy of the majority  of other parties.    [Ostojic-Pusara] And finally, in summary, do you think that  this is a path toward peace, with the understanding of course  that the contact group must treat both warring sides equally,  and not as has been the case so far. This would mean a lot in  practice for the FRY.    [Jovanovic] Of course it is important for the warring sides,  but it is also important for the sides that are not at war. We  are not a country at war, but we are a very interested country,  we are very interested in having this war end in a just and  lasting way. However, we are nevertheless in an unequal position  for reasons that I have already mentioned, even though we are  expected to continue in our active and dominant partnership role  to build peace, to find the final political solution. This  partnership, this cooperation has to be based on mutual respect  and equal status, and not on the basis of subordination, which  is just another word for sanctions and the punishment of one  partner.    [Ostojic-Pusara] Thank you very much.</p>

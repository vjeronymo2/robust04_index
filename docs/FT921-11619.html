			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: The ass brays over the silence of the lamb  -Kevin Maxwell's lost appeal for privilege against self-incrimination THE COURT of Appeal's decision yesterday on Mr Kevin Maxwell's right to remain silent about the missing Maxwell millions has gone some way towards clarifying when a person facing possible criminal charges can invoke the privilege against self-incrimination in order to refuse to answer investigators' questions. It is now clear (in the absence of a successful appeal to the House of Lords by Mr Maxwell), that - in investigations involving legislation, such as the 1986 Insolvency Act or the 1985 Companies Act under which Parliament has either expressly or by implication removed the privilege against self-incrimination - the mere fact that a person's answers might incriminate him is not enough by itself to make it unfair that he should be required to answer. In private actions not involving legislation which has removed the privilege and where the individual concerned fears prosecution for conspiracy, the privilege can be invoked by individuals concerned as justification for refusing to answer questions in civil proceedings. The central issue in Mr Maxwell's appeal was whether he could invoke the privilege to refuse to answer questions put to him by the provisional liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management, which managed Maxwell pension funds, under the 1986 Insolvency Act. The Maxwell case is the latest in a long line of similar cases which have left the law on privilege in a state of uncertainty. The High Court has been divided on the issue. In July 1990, in a case arising out of the Barlow Clowes affair, the court ruled that a person being questioned under section 236 of the Insolvency Act (the same section under which the provisional liquidator of BIM wishes to question Mr Maxwell) was entitled to invoke the privilege. An appeal is now pending. In October last year, however, in an application arising out of the Levitt case, the court reached exactly the opposite conclusion. An appeal is also pending in that case. This was followed in November 1991 by a case involving Farr, in which the same question came up again before the judge who had heard the Barlow Clowes case. This time, however, he decided to follow the decision of the judge in the Levitt case. In the Maxwell case, heard by the High Court just before Christmas, Mr Justice Hoffmann also decided to follow the decision in the Levitt case, resulting in the present appeal. In the Barlow Clowes and Levitt cases, however, unlike the Maxwell case, criminal charges had already been brought against the individuals involved before the court was asked to rule on the availability of the privilege. Those appeals therefore will raise a further question, namely: if the privilege is not available because it has been removed by legislation, would it nonetheless be oppressive and unfair to allow questions under the Insolvency Act when criminal proceedings are pending? This question has already been dealt with once by the Appeal Court at the end of last year in a case involving a former director of London United Investments, the failed insurance group. The Appeal Court's answer was no. Although the Insolvency Act does not expressly remove the privilege, it is nevertheless by implication not available to a person questioned under the Act since otherwise the obvious purpose of the legislation would be defeated. The fact that the answers might incriminate him was not enough on its own to make it unfair that he should be required to answer, particularly in view of the fact that the position of the person involved meant he was more likely than anyone else to know the answers to the questions and, because of that position, he owed a fiduciary duty to the companies at the centre of the investigation. The Appeal Court yesterday faced the additional complication that in several recent cases involving investigations under legislation which has by implication or expressly removed the privilege, the individual concerned has been protected by a safeguard in the legislation which provides that nothing said by him in response to such questions is admissible as evidence in any subsequent criminal proceedings. The Criminal Justice Act 1987, for example, extends that safeguard to suspects being questioned by the Serious Fraud Office. They must answer the SFO's questions but what they say cannot be used as evidence against them in any subsequent prosecution. The safeguard is not, however, contained in the 1986 Insolvency Act, and in the absence of the specific imposition of such a safeguard by Parliament, it has long been established that civil courts have no jurisdiction to impose a condition on the use of such answers by the prosecution as evidence in criminal proceedings. The court ruled that as, following decisions in earlier cases, the Insolvency Act had by implication removed the privilege against self-incrimination - because to decide otherwise would clearly frustrate the purpose of the legislation - Mr Maxwell's appeal must be dismissed. The issues in the cross appeal by MGN against Mr Justice Hoffmann's ruling that Mr Maxwell was entitled to invoke the privilege in respect of a private action brought by MGN were by comparison far simpler. MGN's case was that, under the general common law, the privilege was not available to a defendant if immediately before the time of the alleged fraud which was the subject of the action, the defendant was a fiduciary, servant or agent of the plaintiffs bringing the action, and the purpose of the action is to recover money or property for which the defendant, as a fiduciary, was accountable to the plaintiffs. The court was not persuaded by MGN's proposition that where someone agrees to act as a fiduciary to a company he, by implication, contracts not to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination in any case brought by the company to enforce his fiduciary duties. It said the privilege against self-incrimination was so deeply entrenched in English law that any decision to curtail it or make it not available had to be a political decision taken by Parliament in the public interest. The Maxwell case has, however, pointed up one glaring anomaly in the present state of the general common law on the privilege against self-incrimination. It can be invoked by a person who fears prosecution for conspiracy to defraud but is not available to a person who expects to be prosecuted for fraud under the Theft Act. This is because the Theft Act provides that a defendant cannot refuse to answer questions or disclose information in civil proceedings on the grounds that this might incriminate him of a Theft Act offence. In recognition of this however, the Act specifically provides that nothing said by the defendant in reply to such questions is admissible in subsequent criminal proceedings against him. Conspiracy however is not a Theft Act offence. This, the Appeal Court noted yesterday, is logically indefensible. Fear of prosecution for conspiracy has effectively robbed these Theft Act provisions of their effect in civil cases. The Court will not be alone in thinking that Parliament must act quickly to correct this.</p>

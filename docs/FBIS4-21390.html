			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["BS-Press" report under rubric "According to Reports From </F> Correspondents and Information Agencies": "$320,000 on the  Project for Protecting the Black Sea From Pollution"]    [Text] The international program for the protection and  utilization of Black Sea resources under the aegis of the UN and  the World Environmental Protection Fund is to finance projects  aimed at fighting pollution in the Black Sea. The World Bank  has allocated $320,000 to elaborate an investment plan for  cleaning the Poti and Batumi shorelines (the construction of new  water and sewage works and the reconstruction of old ones and  the liquidation of heaps of toxic waste that constitute a danger  to the environment).    "The water treatment plants in the cities of Poti and Batumi  are currently not in operation. The regions adjoining these  towns are claiming the status of ecological disaster zones,"  stated Zurab Nogaideli, chairman of the Commission for the  Protection of the Environment. According to Nogaideli, a  minimum of $10-15 million will be needed in order to implement  the projects aimed at cleaning the Black Sea coastline in the  regions of Batumi and Poti.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Indian central bank to be revamped INDIA'S finance minister Mr Manmohan Singh yesterday announced that the 'internal control mechanism' of India's central bank would be revamped and its board reconstituted 'very soon' to prevent misuse of funds by banks in securities transactions, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. Mr Singh, who was questioned for nearly four hours by a parliamentary committee investigating the Rs37bn (Pounds 784m) Bombay securities scandal that broke last year, admitted failure of the Reserve Bank's supervisory machinery, and said that the bank had failed to take 'prompt corrective action'. However, the minister fiercely defended Mr S Venkitaramanan, former Reserve Bank governor, saying he had 'done his duty well' despite 'tremendous pressure of the foreign exchange crisis' India suffered in 1991. Mr Singh insisted that neither he nor his ministry had been aware that the funds which had fuelled the artificial escalation of the Bombay stock market last year came from banks 'in an illegal or clandestine manner', as suggested by the investigating committee.</p>

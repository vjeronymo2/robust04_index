			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Tarnish ruins the rosy picture: John Gapper examines the global and domestic implications of the failure of Spain's fourth-largest bank As predictions went, it was one of the less reliable of 1993. Mr Mario Conde, the flamboyant chairman of Spain's fourth-largest bank, was explaining why investors should trust him. Spain's central bank had just inspected the books and told Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) to reclassify Pta41bn (Pounds 200.98m) of loans as bad. There was nothing left to fear, he argued. 'If I was an investor looking at Banesto after this, I would think there were no asset quality surprises after such an intensive inspection. Nothing is going to happen like it happened in 1987 when we had to reclassify Pta100bn of bad debts,' said Mr Conde. He was speaking in September; on Tuesday, his prediction was brutally disproved. The Bank of Spain moved swiftly this week when shares in Banesto tumbled because investors' fears were growing over the bank's loan portfolio and its equity holdings in a wide range of industrial companies. It briskly sacked Banesto's board - including a vice-chairman of J. P. Morgan, the US corporate bank which has handled Banesto's raising of capital - and replaced them with its own management. It also said Banesto would be restructured using money from bank deposit insurance funds. Such actions signal the biggest state intervention to prop up a private bank since the Scandinavian banking crisis of 1991. Banesto's size alone means it will have repercussions for both Spanish banking and the American investors who put money into it on the advice of J. P. Morgan. Banesto is the 96th-largest bank in the world, with assets of Dollars 61bn. But Banesto's collapse failure has significance beyond its size. It poses questions about the ability of banks with large industrial cross-holdings to survive recessions. For instance, the Japanese banking system, probably the most troubled in the world at the moment, has been affected not only by asset price falls, but by a drop in the value of securities holdings. Banesto's fate is also a reminder of the difficulty of assessing the value of Spanish banks. This is because of their webs of cross-holdings and the opaque nature of Spanish accounting. American investors relied on J. P. Morgan to point the way through these complications to the underlying potential of Banesto. Some may feel their faith was misguided. Finally, the intervention places a question-mark over the apparently inexorable process by which brokers expect continental European banks to follow those of the US and Britain in recovering from the recessions which followed bad lending in the 1980s. Investors expecting shares in all weak banks to rebound strongly may have second thoughts. Mr Rod Barrett, a European banks analyst for Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, argues that the anticipated reward of investing in Banesto never appeared high enough. 'It always seemed to be quite a high-risk vehicle without a huge reward, and now it turns out that the risk was higher than we thought,' he says. Yet global investors have grown accustomed to banks being safe bets as economies have started to recover from recesssion. This expectation is one reason why American pension funds, among others, were willing to commit money to a bank which had long been regarded in Madrid as second-rate. Banesto shares had performed poorly for several years because of doubts about its underlying value, and because of scepticism about Mr Conde's ability to turn the bank around. For new US investors, the picture painted by J. P. Morgan, which both advised Banesto and invested Dollars 175m of capital from the Corsair investment fund it manages, was familiar. Banesto was portrayed by J. P. Morgan as a retail bank recovering from lending problems. It was under-rated because it was enmeshed in a tangle of cross-holdings that could be stripped away, supporters said. Seen in such a light, Banesto was an opportunity for rapid capital gains. The latest country to stage a banking recovery is the UK, where banks have performed strongly on the London stock market in the past year. The fastest risers have been the worst-hit banks such as Barclays, which made a loss in 1992. Spain has been seen by some brokers as a natural successor to the US and UK in terms of banking recovery. Spanish retail banks have comparatively high margins because of the conservatism of depositors. It is also a more concentrated market than some others, with the top five banks having a 30 per cent market share. These factors reinforced Banesto's attractions. Investors seized their opportunity when J. P. Morgan managed a two-part equity-raising exercise last May. They bought some Dollars 775m of new equity in Banesto, which was used to restore the bank's capital to the levels of competitors. J. P. Morgan took Dollars 175m on behalf of its Corsair fund, which was set up in the US to buy the shares of just such undervalued banks. But Banesto turned out not to fall into the category of a steadily recovering bank after all. The first clue to what lay ahead came a week ago when it shelved a Dollars 400m convertible bond issue planned to complete the Dollars 1.1bn capital-raising exercise. But there were several reasons why it was difficult for investors to discern the problems earlier: Despite J. P. Morgan's vision of its future, Banesto was not purely a retail bank. It controls both the 2,200-branch bank and a holding company with stakes in real estate, mining, and gases companies. Banesto has been trying to cut such holdings both to meet a Bank of Spain regulatory limit, and to release capital to use in banking. However, divestment could mean losses for Banesto if it holds the stakes in its books at a higher value than it could sell them for. This is why banks with similar equity holdings are at greater risk from recessions than those which only hold loans. It is unclear how much the Bank of Spain was worried by Banesto's cross-holdings. Mr Conde has been at odds with the political and financial establishment of Spain since he took over Banesto at the end of 1987. Some of his supporters argue that the Bank of Spain has been more strict with Banesto than others as a result. Controversy over Mr Conde made it more difficult for new investors to assess management competence. Banesto has admitted to painting a rosy picture of itself in the past. Speaking in September, Mr Conde said that he was unwilling to tell shareholders the whole truth about Banesto's plight in 1987, because 'they would have left the bank'. The fact that Mr Conde had been economical with the truth in the past made it harder to accept his words at face value. These factors meant that investors placed more weight on the judgment of J. P. Morgan's executives. Mr Barrett says that several investors in this year's capital issues told him they had initially taken the view that 'what is good enough for J. P. Morgan is good enough for us'. Mr Mendoza, J. P. Morgan vice-chairman, who was on Banesto's board as a representative of the Corsair fund, emphasised in September that J. P. Morgan had examined Banesto closely because of such complications. 'We spent a tremendous amount of time convincing ourselves that there was substance and truth there,' he said. It is not yet clear whether J. P. Morgan inadvertently gave investors a false picture of Banesto's state of health in the first half of last year, or whether the condition of the Spanish bank worsened substantially in the second half. Mr Barrett says he was 'alarmed' at Banesto's third quarter provisions against poor loans as recession deepened. But the implications of Banesto's failure extend beyond the degree to which J. P. Morgan's reputation suffers. It could damage the investment potential of Spanish companies, since investors may regard Spain's accounting principles and company structures as too risky. They could prove much harder to reassure in future after Mr Conde's lapse.  ------------------------------------------     BANESTO - EXPOSING THE FAULT LINES  ------------------------------------------      Capital Base BIS* capital ratio  ------------------------------------------ Other large Spanish banks      12.5 percent Banesto                        12.3 percent Deutsche Bank                  11.6 percent Bankers Trust                  10.5 percent Banc One                       12.3 percent  ------------------------------------------ Source: Banesto  ------------------------------------------</p>

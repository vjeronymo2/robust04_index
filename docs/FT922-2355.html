			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Insurers warned over laws THE INSURANCE industry came under fire yesterday from one of its strongest supporters. Mr David McIntosh, senior partner with Davies Arnold Cooper, the City firm of solicitors that represents a number of leading insurers, says that the industry must do more to influence the shape of future UK and European legislation, which may leave it with growing future liabilities. DAC says the combination of the legislative changes, an increasing tendency towards litigation in personal injury and other cases and the 'stridency' of the consumerist lobby is presenting business as a whole with big new challenges. The industry should neither oppose that trend outright nor remain passive, but campaign for practical improvements in order to 'prevent single-issue activists grabbing the moral high ground'. Mr McIntosh said: 'The insurance industry has been too reactive for years and years. The industry has to try and influence the scene ahead of litigation coming.' Mr McIntosh praised some recent initiatives such as the establishment of the Arson Prevention Bureau, which co-ordinates an industry-wide response to arson losses. Nevertheless, further action should be taken to increase the power of the industry's lobbying. Insurers should campaign for improvements in the conduct of civil litigation where their interest was affected by, for example, pressing for changes in the way personal injury damages were assessed. Insurers should also show greater willingness to pool information and statistics.</p>

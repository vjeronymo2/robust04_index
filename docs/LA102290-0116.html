			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ORGANIZED CRIME HITS SOVIET UNION;  </P> <P> BLACK MARKET: KGB CHIEF SAYS BOOM IS HELPED BY FOREIGN-BACKED PRIVATE  COMPANIES.  </P> <P> KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov said today that organized crime in the Soviet  Union is booming with the help of foreign-backed private companies.  </P> <P> "Organized crime has assumed a scale we could never have expected a couple of  years ago. . . . Brutality, violence and sadism have become widespread," he  told a news conference.  </P> <P> The head of the Soviet security police said criminals are taking advantage of  political disarray as the country tries to move to a market economy. Chronic  shortages have bred a thriving black market controlled by organized bands  operating across frontiers, he said.  </P> <P> Joint ventures -- private enterprises set up with foreign backing under  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program -- have become a front for  large-scale crime, Kryuchkov said.  </P> <P> "We are young businessmen, we don't have experience, our firms don't have their  own intelligence and counterintelligence," he said.  </P> <P> "But we've got to come to grips with them (joint ventures) because our state  suffers great losses. You just can't imagine how much. I estimate it runs into  billions of dollars," he added. The formulation of tight laws regulating the  activity of joint enterprises must be a high priority, he said.  </P> <P> Hundreds of joint ventures have been set up, largely with West European and  North American companies.  </P> <P> Interior Ministry officials say raids on some private companies have yielded  vast hauls of contraband goods, guns, flak jackets and even explosives.  </P> <P> Interior Ministry officials say some joint enterprises and purely Soviet-owned  private cooperatives are used as fronts to smuggle abroad valuable Soviet goods  such as caviar. Computers and other scarce equipment are then smuggled into the  country where they fetch high black market prices.  </P> <P> The operations drain the country of much-needed foreign currency.  </P> <P> Kryuchkov said the Soviet Union's recent entry into the international police  organization Interpol could help the battle against organized crime.  </P> <P> "We are working very badly in this battle against organized crime," Interior  Minister Vadim Bakatin told the same news conference.  </P></p>

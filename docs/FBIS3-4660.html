At the Japan-U.S. summit, Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa showed "a responsible reaction" over the "nuclear  issue" of the DPRK and, at the the budgetary committee of the  house of representatives recently, he urged "a special  inspection" of military sites in the DPRK. And he did not  forget to cry for "continued pressure on North Korea" whenever  an opportunity presented itself.    In an article contributed to THE WASHINGTON TIMES, former  Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said that "economic  sanctions" must be imposed on "North Korea" if it refuses to  accept "a special inspection." And Japanese Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata also vociferated about "special inspection" at a  recent press conference.    Such remarks of Japanese reactionaries are dastardly  utterances intended to bar the progress of the agreement reached  between the DPRK and the IAEA with much difficulty. What they  seek in this is to force unreasonable "special inspection" upon  us, disarm us and stifle anthropocentric socialism of Korean  style.    Considering that the "special inspection" is one of the  fundamental reasons that compelled our republic to declare its  withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to call for  this inspection is an act designed to force us out of the  treaty. In that case, a very dangerous critical situation will  be created on the Korean peninsula, and it will not bring good  results to Japan, either.    The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, looking  squarely at the current trend, and stop putting brakes on the  progress of the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.</p>

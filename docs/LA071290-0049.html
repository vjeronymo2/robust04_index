			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> U Got the Look: Prince, who has been known to appear on stage in little more  than a G-string and a guitar, is coming out with his own fashion line. The  Purple One plans to open a shop in the Minneapolis warehouse district in  September, and a line of official Prince merchandise -- T-shirts, sweat shirts,  jewelry, buttons, calendars and posters -- also will be sold through other  retail outlets. The apparel will be designed by his wardrobe department. GREG  BRAXTON  </P></p>

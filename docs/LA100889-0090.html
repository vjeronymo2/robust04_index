			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: TOUGH BOOKING?  </P> <P> Will the right-wing government of El Salvador give "Romero" its blessing? The  film, depicting the political transformation and eventual assassination in 1980  of Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, portrays the government as brutally  oppressive to all political reformists, Marxist or otherwise.  </P> <P> Warner Bros., handling foreign sales, has an exec in Latin America making play  dates for the film.  </P> <P> "I would think it will be a controversial issue (with the El Salvadoran  government)," said a Warner Bros. publicity exec. "It may never play there. We  just don't know yet."  </P> <P> But Jose Trigueros, a trade attache with the Salvadoran embassy in D.C.,  predicted otherwise: "It has not been raised as an issue. The ambassador has  gone to see it. He had some comments -- it's not entirely factual -- but he had  no problems with it. We are open-minded."  </P> <P> Another source close to the country's political situation questioned whether El  Salvador's ruling Arena party, which controls the military and has been linked  to death squad activity, would OK "Romero": "In that atmosphere, how much  pressure would it take to keep a theater from showing a movie so critical of  the government?"  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Warner Bros. will try to book "Romero" in Mexico this spring to  coincide with the Pope's planned visit. Said the Warner Bros. spokesman: "It's  a good hook. We can build some good publicity around it." John M. Wilson  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets commented  on the details of the contract for selling 18 Russian MiG-29  jets to Malaysia. He said that the contract costing 550 million  dollars will ensure employment for 100,000 people on Russian  industrial military enterprises over the next two years. There  will also be more jobs at enterprises producing spare parts for  military jets until the contract expires.    Soskovets emphasized that other ASEAN (Association of South  East Asian Nations) countries had also showed interest in  Russian military equipment. Soskovets stressed that the  contract with Malaysia was even more important since in 1994 the  Russian Air Forces had ordered only 17 military jets from the  military industrial enterprises.    Speaking on the contacts with Russian diplomats in Kuala  Lumpur and Delhi where the Russian governmental delegation had  stopped on its way from Malaysia, Soskovets regretted that  Russian diplomats hardly knew the realities of life in Russia or  bilateral economic relations and just kept complaining about the  conditions of living and working in the country where they were  sent. Soskovets announced that he had asked Deputy Foreign  Minister Igor Ivanov to make a report on the performance of the  Russian embassies in India and Malaysia.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: THE TOOZ COULDN'T SCARE AWAY DEATH  </P> <P> Death should have feared John Matuszak. The other way around makes no sense.  When the Grim Reaper came by to touch the Tooz on the shoulder Saturday night,  the big guy should have sprung from his bed, ripped open his hospital gown from  the neck down, roared like a primal beast and then poured the two of them a  drink. He should have scared Death to death.  </P> <P> When you consider how many times John Matuszak teased eternity before, toying  with alcohol and Quaaludes and guns the way he did, working hard and playing  harder, it is a wonder that he lived as long as he did. Yet, that's the Tooz  for you; he was a wonder. He was large and furry and ferocious, practically a  centaur of a man, but there was a wonderful puppy dog playfulness about him, a  wagging tail and eager pant, that makes his passing all the sadder.  </P> <P> It was more than a decade ago that Coach Paul Wiggin of the Kansas City Chiefs  had to pound on the Tooz's chest with his fists, had to watch this 6-foot-8,  300-pound manchild be strapped into a straitjacket and hauled away in an  ambulance after an overload of Valium and booze. In certain ways, John Matuszak  was dying to die. His big old heart gave out because it just couldn't keep up  with him.  </P> <P> Still, no way do you cut down a sequoia, and no way does it stand to reason  that a man of John Matuszak's spirit and structure could be felled after only  38 years. The Tooz lived longer and stronger in his hitch on the mortal coil  than many do in twice the time, and he seemed somehow indestructible, even  though other men his age have continued to excel at athletics. If nothing else,  at least we can now remember John Matuszak forever young.  </P> <P> The playing, the partying, the posturing, oh, the way this man lived. He liked  to sneak up behind unsuspecting women and hoist them onto his shoulder, like an  adagio dancer. One night in San Francisco, the Tooz literally picked up a pair,  carried them toward a nearby bar -- and forgot to measure the maximum headroom,  knocking the poor things into the transom.  </P> <P> "You big dumbo! Couldn't you see we wouldn't fit?" one of the women yelled.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry," said the Tooz, "but, hey, you got to play with the small hurts, as  Vince Lombardi used to say."  </P> <P> He would get away with stunts like that, because he could. No one scolded the  Tooz, either because of that happy-go-lucky charm of his that guaranteed  forgiveness, or because it would have been like scolding Godzilla for stepping  on all those trains. John Matuszak simply couldn't help himself. He was what he  was. Either you accepted it, or you waited until he went away before breathing  easy. All we can say is, if you knew him, you probably liked him.  </P> <P> Absolutely, the Tooz was out of control at times, no doubt about it. In  college, at Tampa, Fla., he busted a fellow football player in the chops with  an elbow during a game of pickup basketball, which eventually cost him $65,000  in medical and legal fees. Later, in that block-long Lincoln Continental of his  that stored so many of his worldly goods, Matuszak occasionally stashed the  machete or the Magnum handgun that he bought on whims.  </P> <P> One night outside Oakland, Kenny Stabler had to pay his roomie's bail, because  the Tooz had been weaving all over the freeway, shooting at roadside signs.  When the quarterback got to the jail, he found Matuszak standing outside a  cell, wearing only three things: handcuffs, his Super Bowl ring and a pair of  powder-blue, elephant-skin cowboy boots.  </P> <P> "That's my roommate," Stabler said. "I'd recognize him anywhere."  </P> <P> He was hell on wheels, the Tooz was. At the core of his astonishing physique  and undeniable football-playing ability was the fire of rebellion. Coaches knew  no way of controlling him. George Allen turned him loose in Washington after  two weeks. Wiggin watched him nearly kill himself. John Madden fined him  repeatedly for typical training-camp violations, like having a woman in his  room, but, seeing as how these were the Raiders, generally the money went  toward an end-of-the-year team party.  </P> <P> The most publicized infraction of the Tooz's playing career came before Super  Bowl XV between Oakland and the Philadelphia Eagles at New Orleans. Soon as he  hit town, Matuszak proclaimed himself gatekeeper and sergeant-at-arms. "I'm  going to see that there's no funny business," he said. "I've had enough parties  for 20 people's lifetimes. I've grown up. I'll keep our young fellows out of  trouble. If any players want to stray, they gotta go through ol' Tooz."  </P> <P> Next night, ol' Tooz was dancing with another player's wife at 1 a.m., and two  hours later, he was still as lit up as the entire French Quarter. Come morning,  Raider Coach Tom Flores slapped him with the obligatory $1,000 fine. Far more  offended was the coach of the opposition, straight arrow Dick Vermeil, who said  in a huff: "If he was an Eagle, he'd be on a flight back to Philadelphia, right  now!"  </P> <P> Matuszak nearly busted a gut, laughing.  </P> <P> "Why would anybody want to go to Philadelphia in the winter?" responded the  Tooz.  </P> <P> Whatever it was that made John Matuszak whatever it is he was, he was one of a  kind. He loved being with the Raiders, and they loved him. He was a hothead and  a sweetheart and a born actor who might as well have been reading his epitaph  when, in "North Dallas Forty," he screamed at one of his coaches that whenever  he called it a business, they called it a game, but whenever he called it a  game, they called it a business.  </P> <P> There is no logical explanation why a man of his proportions subsisted, for  great periods of time, on bagels smeared with Cheez Whiz and triple shots of  Crown Royal hooch, or why, when a female friend's pet poodles annoyed him with  their barking, he fed them sleeping pills until they rolled over and played  permanently dead.  </P> <P> That was John Matuszak. There is no explaining him, no excusing him. He was a  one-ring circus, one no tent could contain. The man who terrorized patrons of  saloons, who got sued for $1.5 million for football-tackling a male stripper on  a San Francisco stage, was the same man whose parents taped an autographed  photo on their refrigerator door, one that read: "Best Wishes to Mom and Dad.  You're the Greatest."  </P> <P> John Matuszak has gone off now, either to steal the devil's pitchfork or to  bend the bars of the pearly gates of heaven until somebody lets him in. We can  see him now, lifting female angels onto his shoulder. They'd recognize him  anywhere.  </P></p>

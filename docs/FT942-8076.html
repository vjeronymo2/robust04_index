			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Russia firm on Nato treaty General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, will tomorrow tell Nato leaders in Brussels that Russia insists on a special treaty with Nato, recognising its status as a military superpower, before it will agree to join the Partnership for Peace. The Partnership, announced in January, is designed to bring former Communist states into an association with Nato - falling short of the full membership which the central European and Baltic countries have requested and which Russia sees as a threat. Gen Grachev yesterday told the official Tass newsagency that President Boris Yeltsin, who has approved the defence minister's plan, expects recognition of Russia's special status. 'This can be done either with the aid of a protocol within the bounds of the Partnership programme or by a joint document signed by Nato and the Russian Federation.' In an interview last week in the weekly Moscow News, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, laid out the basic conditions for such a protocol. These were, he said, an agreement on common approaches between the two military powers which recognised their 'global strengths and responsibilities'; a commitment by Nato to invest in military conversion in Russia; and a commitment to extend joint peacekeeping and joint political consultations. Nato leaders maintain that Russia must join the Partnership on the same terms as all other members, but have stressed that Russia's size and military might confer on it a special status. Speaking in the Latvian capital of Riga on Saturday, Mr Luc Bouvard, president of the North Atlantic Assembly, said Nato 'would never tolerate' a position where any Partnership member state had veto rights or could dictate rules to Nato.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Proposed Volvo merger delayed THE ATTEMPT by Volvo, the Swedish car group, to become majority owner of Procordia, the Swedish food and pharmaceuticals conglomerate it owns jointly with the state, was still uncertain last night. The outcome of what would be Sweden's first privatisation of a partially state-owned company may depend on the verdict of the Swedish government's advisory privatisation committee. Headed by Mr Curt Nicolin, the committee was still considering its attitude to the proposed Skr38.7bn (Pounds 3.71bn) deal. The nine-strong body, made up of prominent financiers and industrialists, met yesterday for an hour to discuss the deal and decided to continue their discussions today. The commission's primary stated task is to advise Mr Per Westerberg, industry minister, on the timing, selling price and conditions for the privatising of Sweden's 35 wholly or partially state-owned companies. However, it is clear from the reaction of the Swedish government Procordia's second largest shareholder, that the commission's advice will be vital in deciding how ministers will react to the proposed deal. On the Stockholm bourse reactions were mixed. Volvo's unrestricted share price rose from SKr393 to SKr398 at the close of trading. So far this year Volvo's share price has surged by about 30 per cent as investors have shown increasing interest in buying its stock. By contrast, Procordia's unrestricted share price fell from SKr212 to SKr198. There were similar trends in London, reflecting the market view that the deal is good for Volvo but bad for Procordia. The outcome of the proposed merger may depend on talks between the two companies and the Swedish government. The judgment of the privatisation commission is now seen as vital if there is to be rapid agreement on Procordia's future. Last Friday the commission rejected Procordia's first offer of 10 Procordia shares for four Volvo shares on the grounds that it was too generous to Volvo shareholders. The second and existing offer was slightly modified to nine Procordia shares for four Volvo. Although Mr Nicolin and his colleagues do not have the legal powers to veto the share offer their views are bound to carry considerable weight. The commission also made some fundamental criticisms about the industrial logic of the deal, suggesting that it had advantages for Volvo but disadvantages for Procordia.</p>

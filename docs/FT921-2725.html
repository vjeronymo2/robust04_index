			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: DnB unveils NKr2.4bn share issue plan DEN norske Bank (DnB), Norway's biggest, yesterday revealed details of a planned NKr2.38bn (Dollars 364m) issue of preference shares, to be launched between May 22 and June 5, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. It is designed to boost capital adequacy to meet new Bank for International Settlements domestic requirements by the end of the year. The share capital increase is part of a NKr5.9bn rescue package organised in December by the state-backed Bank Insurance Fund, which also agreed to guarantee full subscription. The issue is to carry pre-emptive subscription rights for existing shareholders, at par value of NKr10 per share. After the issue, non-restricted shares will represent about 12 per cent of capital, while the restricted shares will be about 88 per cent.</p>

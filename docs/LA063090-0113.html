			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREAT WESTERN DEAL FOR FLORIDA S&amp;L IS BIGGEST U.S. BAILOUT  </P> <P> Great Western Financial agreed Friday to buy CenTrust Federal Savings Bank in  Florida in the biggest taxpayer bailout yet of a savings and loan. The deal  marks the end of a thrift that came to symbolize some of the worst examples of  greed and gluttony in the nation's thrift debacle.  </P> <P> Taxpayers will pick up a bill of about $1.7 billion for CenTrust. Great  Western, the Beverly Hills parent of Great Western Bank, will pay $86.4 million  for CenTrust's 71 branches and $5.2 billion in deposits. The deal makes Great  Western Florida's biggest thrift.  </P> <P> Former CenTrust Chairman David L. Paul was one of the biggest of the big  spenders among savings and loan executives. Last Saturday, auctioneers in Miami  sold about 16,000 items Paul bought with CenTrust's taxpayer-insured deposits,  including 1,440 Baccarat goblets, crystal toothpick holders, a cigar humidor  and a 12-place setting of Limoges china.  </P> <P> Separately, the government disclosed that the cost to bail out what had been  Gibraltar Savings was a surprisingly high $628 million, $522 million of that  for Gibraltar's California operation based in Simi Valley. Private estimates  had totaled about $400 million.  </P> <P> Security Pacific Corp. beat out Great Western earlier this week to buy the  Gibraltar operations, paying $141 million plus an additional $3 million for an  option to buy up to $1 billion in assets. Security Pacific receives 83  Gibraltar branches in California, six branches in Washington state, $5 billion  in deposits and $1.7 billion in home loans.  </P> <P> Friday's actions on CenTrust and 14 other thrifts put the government over the  top in meeting its goal of selling or closing 141 failed thrifts by today.  </P> <P> In all, the government said it actually disposed in that time of 155 thrifts --  17 of them in California -- through sale or liquidation at a cost to taxpayers  of $29 billion, as part of what was called "Operation Clean Sweep." The goal  was set in March by L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp.,  amid criticism by Congress and others that the thrift mop-up agency was moving  too slowly.  </P> <P> Government thrift officials were obviously pleased that they met Seidman's  target, which some skeptics doubted they could reach. "Operation Clean Sweep  has brought greater stability to the nation's financial system," Seidman said  in a statement.  </P> <P> Still, the government's three-month spree was made possible largely because it  sold only branches, deposits and low-risk home loans while stripping away the  bad assets such as risky junk bonds and empty office buildings that led to the  demise of the thrifts in the first place. In the case of CenTrust, the  government is still stuck with $3.1 billion in junk bonds, loans and various  securities.  </P> <P> Although selling the thrifts reduces the government's operating costs, selling  those bad assets is critical to cutting the rising costs of the government's  S&amp;L bailout, estimated to run $500 billion over the next 30 to 40 years.  </P> <P> Although the biggest single bailout to date, the CenTrust failure may be  eclipsed by the collapse of Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings and Loan  Assn. in Irvine. The Lincoln case is expected to cost taxpayers about $2  billion.  </P> <P> Although Great Western is paying $86.4 million for CenTrust, the deal actually  will cost the firm about $61 million. That's because Great Western is taking  over $3.3 billion in CenTrust home loans, consumer loans and securities and  turning them over for $25 million to Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to sell.  </P> <P> Great Western receives $5.2 billion in deposits. But only $1.78 billion of  those deposits are so-called core deposits, which represent deposits from more  loyal customers who are likely to stay with the institution. Paul funded  CenTrust largely with deposits from Wall Street money brokers who shift their  money around to institutions offering the highest rates.  </P> <P> Great Western agreed last July to buy 63 CenTrust branches for about $100  million, but the deal fell through after regulators seized it. On a comparable  basis, the government could have reaped about $40 million more had it let the  Great Western deal stand.  </P> <P> In a separate deal, Great Western is acquiring 18 branches with $700 million in  deposits for $3.75 million that had been part of Gibraltar's Florida operation.  Overall, Great Western now has 154 retail branch offices in Florida and  deposits totaling $6 billion.  </P> <P> Four other California thrifts have operations in Florida: GlenFed in Glendale,  H. F. Ahmanson in Los Angeles, First Nationwide in San Francisco and CalFed in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> FROM GOLDEN STATE TO SUNSHINE STATE  </P> <P> California savings and loans with branches in Florida.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.88IN:2.77IN:2.00IN:2.33IN:2.33IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Number of  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Number of  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Initial Florida  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> branches in  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> branches in  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> S&amp;L  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> expansion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> branches  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Florida  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> California  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> CalFed  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Feb., 1982  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 199  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 50  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 138  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> First Nationwide  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Sept., 1981  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 210  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 28  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 48  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> GlenFed  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Nov., 1981  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 235  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 66  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 147  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Great Western*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> May, 1983  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 384  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 154  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 213  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Home Savings  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> of America  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Dec., 1981  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 358  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 42  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 173  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *Includes Friday's acquisitions of CenTrust Savings Bank of Miami and Gibraltar  Savings Bank of Florida.  </P></p>

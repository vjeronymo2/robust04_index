			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ukraine's cast-iron loss-maker  -Anthony Robinson reports on the Krivoi Rog ore enrichment plant THE FATE of the last great Comecon investment project, a sprawling iron ore enrichment plant near Krivoi Rog in southern Ukraine, hangs in the balance following Germany's recent decision to pull out of what was planned as a classic communist resource development. The aim of the multi-billion rouble project, under construction for the last five years near the Ukrainian village of Dolinskaya, 450 km (280 miles) south-east of Kiev, was to process 33m tonnes of low grade oxidised iron ore annually into enriched iron pellets for the steel mills of eastern Europe. But the collapse of the Soviet Empire has saddled a now independent Ukraine with a vast unfinished construction site requiring billions more roubles to complete. Designed when Soviet energy prices were low and demand for steel was insatiable, the vast complex of power-hungry grinders, crushers and pelletisers will never be profitable by the western accounting standards. This became clear after Bonn took over east Germany's relatively minor 5 per cent stake. It found that, at world prices, the value of the 3.7m tonnes of pellets due to be delivered over ten years would be about DM220m (Dollars 133m), equivalent to only 7 per cent of the DM3.7bn investment - and that took no account of transport cost from southern Ukraine or of the pellets' low quality. The German cabinet's June 4 decision to pull out of the deal was reinforced by the fact that the steel mills that were scheduled to use the pellets had been scrapped as part of the post-unification destruction of East Germany's obsolete and polluting industrial plant. Bonn sent Mr Jurgen Molleman, the economics minister, to tell President Leonid Kravchuk personally of Bonn's decision. The Ukranian government, horrified at the implications of the German pull-out, asked it to reconsider, stating its own determination to complete the project. The Ukrainian government then sent letters to all the other participants - Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Romania asking for a meeting to review and renegotiate the deal. Senior Ukrainian officials working at the site privately concede that the original deal was highly disadvantageous for Germany and say that Ukraine is prepared to compensate it in other ways, provided it completes its vital segment of the plant. At present, however, Bonn is inclined to cut its losses. It plans to retain the DM1.7bn still to be disbursed and avoid the inevitable cost over-runs of a project that should have come on stream this year but is no more than half finished. But the former GDR and Bonn have already spent more than DM2bn on equipment, construction and wages for the 4,000 Polish and East German workers employed for the last five years in building three crusher plants, housing and ancillary infrastructure. Mr Volker Wittenbecher, the former-East German project manager says that 80 per cent of Germany's construction projects have been completed and 95 per cent of the equipment has already been delivered. Ukraine argues that the German part of the project can be completed with very little extra cost. Mr Viktor Hladush, a tough communist-era manager who used to run one of Krivoi Rog's five ore enrichment plants, is now the Ukrainian Minister of Industry. He originally opposed the decision to build the new plant, believing that existing plants should have been modernised instead. He insists that Dolinskaya will only be completed if it is profitable to Ukraine. But judging profitability is more than a profit and loss account calculation. If Dolinskaya is scrapped, hundreds of acres of former rich, black earth farm land will have been transformed uselessly into a half-finished industrial desert and billions of roubles will have been lost. Dropping the project also means that existing older plants in Krivoi Rog will continue to pollute the city. Millions of tonnes of low grade ore will remain on the waste tips surrounding the iron mines instead of being shipped off for enrichment. The possibility of using cheap, already-mined ores and the fact that most of the actual construction costs were to be borne by East Germany, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, originally attracted the Soviet leaders to the project. It followed the classic pattern of pre-payment for future deliveries of 'cheap' energy and raw materials already established by the Druzhba oil pipeline, which brings Russian oil to eastern Europe, and the Yamburg gas pipeline. Like all decisions of the now defunct Comecon, it also had a political motive - to reinforce east European dependence on Moscow. The collapse of both Comecon and the Soviet Union, however, has changed the political and economic landscape radically. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian prime minister has made it clear that Russia wants nothing more to do with the project. Ukraine has thus inherited both Moscow's original 51 per cent stake and the commitment to supply hundreds of millions of tonnes of ore, build a 60 km dedicated railway line from Krivoi Rog to Dolinskaya and supply water and energy from a nuclear power station at Nikolayev, in southern Ukraine (at present mothballed for safety reasons). In return Ukraine will receive 51 per cent of the 10m tonnes of pellets to be produced annually. On the same basis Romania, the second biggest partner, with a 27 per cent stake, is scheduled to receive 27 per cent of the pellets, followed by Czechoslovakia (14 per cent), eastern Germany (5 per cent) and Bulgaria (4 per cent). Czechoslovakian participation is now in doubt, however. The federal government has indicated its desire to withdraw, although the soon-to-be-independent Slovakian government is anxious to ensure a continuing supply of pellets for the East Slovak steelworks in Kosice, which already receives pellets from Krivoi Rog. Romania, whose dependence on Ukrainian ore is reflected in the size of its stake, seems the most determined to press on. More than 4,500 Romanians are hard at work completing the final pelletisation plant and the country has indicated a willingness to finish uncompleted sections if others pull out. The Bulgarians, with the smallest stake, are nowhere to be seen at the vast construction site with its miles of tubing, half finished crushing, sintering and flotation plants, rutted roads and piles of machinery, packing cases and building materials. Despite the fact that most of the German workers have already gone home, leaving only 200 to board up the nearly-finished assembly halls and make detailed inventories of everything left behind, Mr Ivan Stepanov, the Ukranian deputy director of the entire complex, expresses quiet confidence that the project will still be completed - sometime in 1995. He still hopes that the Germans, who alone appear to have kept close to the original schedule, will reconsider. 'We are looking for a compromise. If they no longer need their share of pellets perhaps they could be repaid in some other way. But if they walk away now they will not get anything back for what they have done.' Brought up in the Stalinist tradition of smoking chimneys and heavy industry the former communists who still run the Ukraine are used to thinking in terms of energy-intensive, resource-based projects like Krivoi Rog. Such thinking also permeates nationalist parties like Rukh, which point to Ukraine's allegedly rich natural resources as the basis for its future prosperity. The reality is much grimmer. The coal and iron ore mines which spurred the Ukrainian industrial revolution in the 19th century are now more of a liability than an asset. After a century of exploitation the iron ore mines are now deep holes in the ground. Coal production in the adjacent Donbas fell by more than 20 per cent last year and many of the deep, geologically-fractured mines are both dangerous and unprofitable. What is more, many of the plants that formerly consumed the 54m tonnes of steel produced annually by Ukraine before the dissolution of the Soviet Empire were either arms factories or heavy engineering plants - often producing equipment for the iron and steel industry. Like so much of the old command economy it was a self-sustaining circle which generated little in the way of consumer goods. Against this broader background the future of Dolinskaya is intimately linked to the future shape of the Ukrainian economy. A decision to pour many billions more roubles into completing the plant would confirm Ukraine's heavy industrial vocation. But they would be roubles that could otherwise be invested in building a more modern, consumer-orientated economy. Hard choices lie ahead.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 20 KYODO -- Japan asked other  Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers Sunday [20 February] to  cooperate to stem a further advance of the yen.    The request was made at a meeting of deputy finance  ministers  in Washington.    Kosuke Nakahira, the Japanese representative at the meeting  held at the U.S. Treasury Department, told reporters he told his  G-7 colleagues that volatility in foreign exchange rates is not  desirable.    Nakahira, vice finance minister for international affairs,  also said he explained the state of the Japanese economy and the  government's series of actions to pull it out of the prolonged  recession, including the 15 trillion yen pump-priming package  unveiled earlier this month.    He did not give any indication, however, of whether the  so-called G-7 deputies reached any agreement on his request.    The finance officials met to prepare for next Saturday's  meeting in Frankfurt of the G-7 finance ministers and central  bank governors. The G-7 groups Britain, Canada, France,  Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.    The Frankfurt talks were originally expected to be focused  on  aid to Russia, but Japan now hopes that the G-7 countries will  send some signals to the market that they do not desire further  wild swings in the yen's value.    The Japanese currency gained as much as 6 yen at one stage  in  last week's trading, propelled by speculation that the collapse  of Japan-U.S. "Framework" trade talks may prompt the U.S. to  deliberately guide the yen higher to slim its colossal trade  deficit with Tokyo.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alam Srinivas] </F>   [Text] A seemingly innocuous advertisement, tucked away on  the last page of THE ECONOMIC TIMES in April this year, caught  the attention of R.M. Kakkar, who heads the Bombay office of the  Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). The Madras-based advertiser had  evinced an interest in buying a paracetamol-making unit.    Under normal circumstances, such interest should not have  caused suspicion. Paracetamol is a legal antipyretic drug  commonly used to reduce fever. But the unit can also be used to  manufacture methaqualone (better known by its brand name  mandrax), a narcotic drug which is banned in India and many  other countries. It is also a drug that is causing major  headaches to the NCB. Kakkar, whose office has recorded an  increasing trend of the smuggling of mandrax tablets from India  to South Africa, decided to investigate the matter.    The major concern is that India is the world's largest  producer of mandrax. Though South Africa continues to be the  biggest consumer, neighbouring African nations such as Kenya,  Mozambique and Zambia, which so far were merely transit points  of the mandrax trail, are also turning into users now.    Recent seizures by the NCB, the Department of Revenue  Intelligence (DRI) and the Bombay Police, only confirm the  alarming rise in mandrax smuggling. In 1990, these agencies  seized 2,141 kg of mandrax tablets and powder in 60 cases which  in 1993 went up nearly seven times to 15,004 kg (in 283  instances). In the first quarter of 1994, seizures were over  7,000 kg in only six swoops. South Africa was the final  destination in most of the cases.    It is the easy money and huge profits that have attracted  drug traffickers into this trade. At a conservative estimate,  the annual turnover in the mandrax trade could be over Rs 1,500  crore and profitability is quite high. Rahul Rai Sur, DCP  [Deputy Commissioner of Police] (narcotics), Bombay Police, says  that the production cost per tablet is a mere Re 1 while the  selling price is anything up to Rs 100 on South African streets.    The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), a UN  organisation set up to prevent the illicit traffic and use of  drugs, is worried about this trend. In its 1993 annual report,  released in February this year, the INCB stated that "the  increasing illicit manufacture of methaqualone (mandrax)  constitutes a major problem in India" which "remains the main  source".    Mandrax is identical to barbiturates in its effect.  Barbiturates are depressants which act on the central nervous  system of the body and slow down many bodily functions.  Mandrax, like barbiturates, can be addictive and prove fatal if  consumed in combination with alcohol or other illegal drugs. At  the behest of the INCB, many countries have banned its sale and  production. India, too, banned the drug in 1984.    Since then, the country has found itself in the piquant  position of becoming a centre for the illicit production of  mandrax. The country's pharmaceutical industry is  technologically developed and the know-how to make the drug  exists as it was freely produced prior to the ban.    South Africa, on the other hand, has been a user country  since the 1970's. NCB officials contend that with the growing  economic prosperity of the majority black population in the  '80's, the demand for mandrax has gone up. To get an extra  kick, black workers, whose per capita annual income has trebled  since 1984, mix mandrax in liquor or smoke it in powdered form  with marijuana.    Given the huge profits, heroin and antique smugglers have  taken up the mandrax trade in a big way. On January 11 this  year, the Bombay Police arrested a 33-year-old doctor, Imtiaz  Ahmed Illiyas. Illiyas and his four colleagues were carrying 600  grams of heroin and they led the police to the largest seizure  (4,800 kg) of mandrax ever made. The tablets, destined to reach  Mozambique, were found in 206 drums stored in a 20-ft container  at Victoria docks.    In August 1992, the Bombay police stumbled upon a gang of  the  three Bhatt brothers and seized over 100 kg of mandrax tablets.  In addition to this, the police recovered an 11th century  sandstone icon (3 ft 3 inch in height) of Lord Parshawanath,  stolen from a Jain temple in Gujarat.    For heroin traffickers, shifting to an indigenous drug makes  business sense. Mandrax is more profitable as it is produced in  India unlike heroin. Further, the international crackdown on  heroin since the mid-'80's has also forced Indian drug  traffickers based in the Middle East to look at alternatives to  remain in the trade.    Police investigations indicate that some major mandrax gang  leaders may be based in Dubai. Sur says that he is on the verge  of charge-sheeting one of them. Police sources say the  investigative trail in at least two major cases leads to Dubai.    On August 19 last year, a jeep containing 150 kg mandrax  tablets was seized outside a restaurant in Bombay. The vehicle  was rented out to Milind Chalke, a resident of Andheri who owned  a tabletting factory in Paundvillage, about 30 km from Pune.  Chalke's trail led to a businessman based in Lusaka, Zambia,  who is suspected to have links in Dubai.    However, NCB officials, while admitting the involvement of  organised gangs, feel that the supposed Dubai links are still  weak. "It's too early to jump to conclusions," says the NCB'S  Deputy Director-General, A.M. Prasad. In fact, even the Bombay  High Court has released all the accused in the August 1993 case  on bail.    With the slow progress by investigative agencies in catching  the gang leaders, the mandrax trade continues unabated. The  modus operandi and the route are clear from recent seizures and  raids. The main production bases are centered in Maharashtra and  Gujarat though the NCB has found a few units in Rajasthan and  Madhya Pradesh as well.    According to NCB officials, even some of the legitimate drug  units, especially paracetamol-making ones, are being diverted to  produce mandrax. This was the reason why Kakkar was worried  about THE ECONOMIC TIMES advertisement. The technology and even  the chemical ingredients are the same for both drugs. In the  January 1994 case, the police found that Illiyas and his  partners were also producing mandrax at the Gujarat-based Ambala  Organics Chemicals Pvt Ltd, originally owned by 10 partners who  sold the sick unit for Rs 48.50 lakh to the drug smugglers.    The common way of smuggling mandrax is through the Bombay  port by falsely declaring export consignments and giving  incorrect names of both the exporting firm and the African  importer. The 4,800-kg found in the container at Indira docks  was supposed to contain red oxide. In December 1993, the NCB,  Bombay, intercepted a consignment of wooden boxes at Victoria  docks said to be carrying water heaters. Instead, the boxes  contained 1,500 kg of mandrax. Another 3,200-kg consignment was  seized by the NCB, Bombay, in January 1993. Packed in 320  plastic bags, it was supposed to contain talcum powder. Both  the exporter, Ganesh Export Import International, and the buyer,  Societe Generale d'Alimentation in Zaire, in this case were  non-existent.    However, as narcotic agencies in Bombay have geared up to  stop this illegal trade, the traffickers are changing their  routes. A lot of mandrax is now being smuggled out of Gujarat  ports. In one case, in July 1993, the DRI intercepted a lorry  on the Pune-Belgaum highway. Starting from Vapi, Gujarat, and  proceeding to the Tuticorin port in Kerala, the vehicle  contained 2,300 kg mandrax concealed inside 180 bags partially  loaded with onions. According to NCB sources, the mandrax was  bound for Africa via Sri Lanka.    What is of utmost importance to both the Indian authorities  and the INCB is the fact that the use of mandrax is spreading to  both the producer and transit countries. The INCB has noted in  its 1993 report that manufacturing bases and even the use of  mandrax have been found in countries such as Zambia and Kenya.  In Kenya, three factories were dismantled in 1993. Even in  India, there is an alleged case of a confectionery manufacturer  in Gujarat who was selling toffees containing mandrax in major  cities in Rajasthan. The toffee samples have been sent to the  forensic labs by the NCB for further investigations. As an  international narcotics expert in Delhi says: "If the problem  is not contained now, it could become a worldwide phenomenon  like heroin."</p>

			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Banda to review detention law President Kamuzu Banda of Malawi bowed to international pressure yesterday by promising a review and possible relaxation of the law allowing detention without trial, diplomats said, AP reports from Lusaka. Mr Banda's announcement came two months after at least 22 people were killed in anti-government riots, the nation's worst urban unrest since independence from Britain in 1964. The riots were sparked in part by the detention of Mr Chakufwa Chihana, an anti-government activist who had been held several weeks without charges being filed. Western donors froze Dollars 74m in aid in May to press for reforms. The president also said he would allow hundreds of Asians to appeal for the first time against the confiscation by the state of their businesses in the 1960s, according to diplomats.</p>

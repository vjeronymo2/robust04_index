			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The press center of Ukraine's Cabinet of  Ministers has circulated a statement for the media concerning  the activities of Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma  which our colleague Anatoliy Komirenko will read for you.    [Begin Komirenko recording] Leonid Kuchma, a recent prime  minister, now president of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists  and Entrepreneurs, has been remarkably active lately. Numerous  press interviews by the former prime minister have appeared in  Ukraine and neighboring countries, in which, using more slogans  than facts, he embarks on a search for scapegoats for the  present difficult economic situation in Ukraine.    In his latest press appearances, he puts the blame on the  so-called "Party of Power," the present government. Strangely  enough, in none of his appearances does Leonid Kuchma associate  himself with this party, although only six months ago he was one  of the top state officials who determined the country's  political and economic course, and therefore, commanded  considerable powers to overcome the crisis.    Taking the office of prime minister in Autumn 1992, Leonid  Kuchma declared his readiness to take upon himself  responsibility for the state of affairs in the economy. In  order to cure it, his government was granted the widest of  powers. Incidentally, despite the complexity of the situation,  the objective opportunities for a comprehensive reform in the  Ukrainian economy then were tangibly better than now. But did  Leonid Kuchma take advantage of them? The answer is evident  from the results of economic management in 1993, when it was  Kuchma who headed the government: A complete imbalance of  macroeconomic parameters that is having an extremely negative  effect on the present state of the economy, a 100-fold retail  price rise twice exceeding the rate of wage increase. The wage  share in a product's cost price has shrunk almost two-fold. If  one should also take into account the devaluation of the  population's savings, one can safely say that last year every  resident of Ukraine became much poorer than he was before Prime  Minister Leonid Kuchma took office. One should be reminded that  at his initiative the indexation of the population's incomes, as  well as the publication of price indexes for consumer goods,  were terminated. The former prime minister is currently passing  himself for a mouthpiece of producers' interests. But how did  they fare under his leadership?    During the time Leonid Kuchma was government head, taxes  grew  significantly and huge excise taxes were introduced. All this  befell the producer as a heavy burden and undermined  entrepreneurship. Creditor's indebtedness among enterprises has  grown 62 times over the past year, as a result of which the most  severe crisis of payments got under way, whose consequences are  reflected today in full measure in a decline of production,  overdue wages payments, and other disorders. The growth in the  budget profits was ensured not by the economy's incomes, but by  monetary emission.    In his time, holding the high post, Leonid Kuchma accused  the  National Bank of the karbovanets collapse, however, with the  17-fold growth in emission last year, the exchange rate of the  Ukrainian currency per dollar fell 36 times. As a whole, with  the three-fold devaluation of the dollar in Ukraine taken into  account, the purchasing capacity of the karbovanets decreased  100 times. This is not the fault of the National Bank but the  result of the absolutely unbalanced foreign economic and  currency policy by the Kuchma government, which caused the  outflow of money and capitals from Ukraine.    Legal relations in the state were significantly affected by  the hasty decree-making activity by Leonid Kuchma. The  abrogation or amendment of many enactments and their separate  provisions brought more confusion into legislation than order.  It is in the times that Leonid Kuchma headed the government,  that they began to impose a thesis on Ukraine's feebleness upon  society and disbelief in our state's ability to get out of the  crisis situation.    Obviously, Leonid Kuchma's personal inability to fulfill his  numerous promises to restore order in Ukraine and raise people's  living standards was far from playing the least important role  in this.    To a great extent the miscalculations made by the Kuchma  team  conditioned the worsening of the economic situation in the  Crimea Republic, resulting in the formation of anti-Ukrainian  sentiments there. Firstly, a ban on the export of agricultural  produce, grown on subsidiary plots of land, to Russia and other  countries, which were traditional markets to sell that produce,  affected Crimea more than other regions of the country.    A cunning blow against one of Crimea's leading industries --  wine-making -- was the introduction of high excise duties for  its products, at the same time, with the abolition of excise  duties for imported, often low-quality, beverages. As a result  of this arbitrary rule, the viability of world-famous Crimean  wines was artificially undermined, which led to a decline in  their production. Finally, the third blow against the Crimean  economy was the decisions preventing the development of lease  relations that had gained wide popularity, particularly in  Crimea.    One's attention is caught by Leonid Kuchma's attempt to  gamble on such a topical issue as Ukraine's nuclear disarmament.  In one of his latest interviews, he is threatening, with a  multitude of economic and environmental consequences involved,  to implement the trilateral statement by the presidents of  Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. But it is Leonid  Kuchma's signature that was put under the Massandra Protocol of  3 September 1993 on the withdrawal of all nuclear warheads from  Ukraine in the course of 24 months! So, when did he really  defend state interests? Last autumn in Crimea, or during his  interviews this spring?    Leonid Kuchma puts most of the blame on those members of  government whom he personally invited to join his cabinet.  Although, it is they who now have to put out the fire of the  crisis which they could not do last year, working under the  former prime minister's leadership. Perhaps, one should not pay  attention to all this. All sorts of things can be heard and  read at a time of a great public and political campaign, like  the recent and upcoming elections to the top state institutions.  However, the arguments and slogans used by Leonid Kuchma more  often than not mislead entrepreneurs and citizens in Ukraine and  those states whose papers publish his interviews. Take, for  example, the accusation against the present state leadership of  choosing the road of self-isolation. The reality proves  different. In actual fact, Ukraine is now following the road of  consolidating its state independence, at the same time,  establishing mutually beneficial economic and political  cooperation with the countries of both the West and East.    Suffice it to say that 35 various economic agreements have  been concluded with Russia alone, 28 agreements with Belarus, 25  agreements with Kazakhstan, 23 agreements with Kyrgyzstan, 16  agreements with Uzbekistan, and 13 agreements with Turkmenistan.  At the latest meeting of the heads of state and government of  the CIS countries alone, which took place in Ashgabat in  December 1993, Ukraine's representatives signed about 20  bilateral documents, the majority of which dealt with economy.    Ukraine, as a cofounder of the Parliamentary Assembly of the  Black Sea Economic Cooperation [PACZES], is working out draft  agreements on a significant expansion of mutually advantageous  contacts with the PACZES countries: Turkey, Romania, Armenia,  Azerbaijan, Albania, Georgia, and Russia.    Greece, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Poland expressed their wish  to join PACZES. Recently Ukraine, by the way, the first among  the CIS countries, initialled the agreement on partnership and  cooperation with the European Union which lifts restrictions on  our trade relations with the EEC countries. Such a balanced  policy will promote the stabilization of Ukraine's economy. And  if it were not for the consequences of numerous incompetent  decisions made by the Leonid Kuchma government in the first half  of 1993, which the present-day government has to overcome and  the fruit of which all the citizens of Ukraine have to reap, the  economic situation could have been stabilized much sooner.    The Cabinet of Ministers is working on the implementation of  a program aimed at overcoming the crisis phenomena in economy  and improving people's living conditions in 1994. It is exactly  this that the government of Ukraine regards to be its duty.

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Small streams bring big floods: The mighty Mississippi and the little River des Peres DOWNTOWN St Louis remains safe and dry behind its massive floodwall, but the city's southern fringes have begun to suffer in earnest after weeks of relentless rain. With the ground waterlogged and drainage streams already filled to overflowing, every new thunderstorm sends the Missouri and Mississippi rivers ever higher to set new flood records. But although the Mississippi reached a new crest yesterday at 47 feet, it remained 5 feet below the lip of the city floodwall. It was a much smaller stream, the River des Peres, which took its revenge on south St Louis, backing up to submerge newly-built homes down on the flood plain and even older houses that survived the floods of 1973 unscathed. The River des Peres is a drainage ditch built by President Franklin Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration in the 1930s, but the rising Mississippi had reversed its flow, driving it upstream. Two inches of rain on Tuesday evening swelled it even further and swept away hundreds of yards of sandbag levees that had held back its sewage-laden waters. 'This is much worse than 1973. It flooded right enough, but not like this,' said Mr Mike Coric, a printer who came to the US as a refugee from Croatia 28 years ago. Fifty yards downhill from Mr Coric's house, Hannover Street disappears into a sullen, brown lake, its surface disturbed only by the water spilling vainly from a handful of pumps. A sign reading 'Sightseers get out' stands guard at the water's edge. 'Those houses down there were all built in the last 10 years. People knew they were on the flood plain, but I guess the city ran out of land,' Mr Coric observed. A few miles away, Mr Don Rutledge yesterday began taking down the sandbag wall he had built around his antiques business. After a week without electricity, his concern now is to dry out his sodden basement, but he fears the task will be a long one. 'Most everybody got water in their basements. When you pump it out of the basement it goes into the sewers, and with the sewers all backed up, it just goes back into your basement,' Mr Rutledge said. Forecasters have had difficulty predicting when the Mississippi will crest because the basin is so full of water. But water levels are now expected to start falling, although the need to release water from swollen containment reservoirs will slow the fall. However, the weather system which has caused this year's heavy flooding remains stubbornly static over the Midwest. Hot moist air from the southeast continues to meet a cold front over the Mississippi basin and the rain will not let up until this weather system has moved along. Federal money is expected to start flowing quickly. The House of Representatives was due to vote yesterday on an emergency aid bill whose total has already risen in a week from Dollars 2.48bn to Dollars 2.98bn (Pounds 2bn), and may climb even higher before it has passed both chambers of Congress. Around Dollars 1.15bn of the emergency money will be directed to farmers, with Dollars 815m more going to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Money will also be provided to allow the Army Corps of Engineers to repair levees, locks and dams along the river.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov by </F> Zoya Dimitrova in Sofia on 1 April: "Even the President Has a  Right to His Personal Opinion"]    [Text] The prime minister gave 168 CHASA his first  interview following his operation, speaking over the telephone  from the government hospital in Sofia. He said he was not  surprised by the leap in the dollar's exchange rate because a  state cannot support negative balances of payments and trade  indefinitely, and this is bound to have an effect on its  national currency.    Professor Berov gave us this interview on Friday evening [1  April]. The next day, following Zhelev's self-serving  performance on the Panorama television program, we telephoned  the prime minister again. He said he does not intend to resign,  and confirmed that he would be at work on Thursday [7 April].  He did not comment on the president's assessment of the  government.    [Dimitrova] Professor Berov, this interview is being  recorded. Do you have any objection?    [Berov] Naturally not. Go ahead with your questions.    [Dimitrova] How do you feel, Professor?    [Berov] Normal. I intend to return to work soon.    [Dimitrova] How soon is that?    [Berov] I cannot say because it depends on the doctors. I  assume I will be at my desk on Thursday.    [Dimitrova] Your wife says you are walking 700 meters a day.  Is that true?    [Berov] Yes, sometimes even further, but I have not yet  reached Cherni Vrukh [peak of Mount Vitosha on outskirts of  Sofia].    [Dimitrova] Did the leap in the dollar's exchange rate  surprise you?    [Berov] What should I say? It was not a great surprise for  me because we had negative balances of trade and payments,  especially during the second half of last year. In the first  quarter of 1994, we again had a negative balance, which as yet  has not been taken into account, but there are some secondary  figures that indicate, I would say, that the sickness is  continuing. This is a sickness of the deficits in the balances  of payments and trade, and one of the causes is the embargo.    Can a state maintain negative balances of payments and trade  indefinitely without this affecting its national currency?    [Dimitrova] How do you react to the president's statement  that this government is sick and to the possible soundings on  forming a new government?    [Berov] How can I react? You know that initially the  government in Bulgaria is appointed by parliament. In any case,  anyone is entitled to express any viewpoint, and this is  naturally a matter of his own personal opinion. The president  has a right to a personal opinion.    [Dimitrova] Do you intend to make structural changes in the  cabinet?    [Berov] Yes.    [Dimitrova] It is said that you will close down certain  committees and replace them by ministries. Who will head the  Ministry of Privatization?    [Berov] Yes, there will be such a ministry. Rumen Gechev  will be the minister. I do not know if you have heard his name,  but he is well known among economic circles. You know that the  Constitution does not provide for any committees. So far, the  committees have continued to exist by force of inertia.  However, it is high time to dissolve them and allocate their  functions to different ministries or elevate some of them to the  level of ministries.    [Dimitrova] Which ministers will you let go, Prof. Berov?    [Berov] Oh, it is too early to say. First, I have no  conclusive data showing that anyone is not doing his job  properly.    [Dimitrova] I would like to ask you this -- of course, you  need not answer: Are you not sorry that you named as your  deputy one of the deputy prime ministers and not the other, who  is a more up-to-date politician -- I am referring to Valentin  Karabashev. Might he not have coped much better with the  situation facing the country?    [Berov] Valentin Karabashev had some long trips abroad  planned, and he is continuing these at the moment. I cannot  appoint as my substitute a person who would be absent at least  half the time.    [Dimitrova] Was this formal reason the only motive for your  decision?    [Berov] It is an important, substantial reason. The person  who stands in for me must be in the country. He cannot exercise  his right to rule -- it is not a right but a duty -- from a  distance of thousands of kilometers. You cannot play the game  like this.    [Dimitrova] The 168 CHASA weekly forecasted that a possible  caretaker government would develop into a "velvet dictatorship"  cabinet. What is your view on the ambitions and statements of  Dimitur Ludzhev, who has been using fascist phraseology in  recent months?    [Berov] This is evidently a matter of personal ambitions.  Regarding the fascist phraseology, the answer is clear. I  believe that dictatorship is impossible in Bulgaria, I will tell  you that straight. Even the most ambitious individual will not  be able to pull it off. Next, I assume you are familiar with  our Constitution and realize that it is not necessarily the  caretaker government that has to hold the elections. Look how  Mitsotakis fell from power in neighboring Greece. Yet he was  the very one who organized the elections in which he was  defeated.    [Dimitrova] We have before our very eyes the histories of  your neighbors Greece and Turkey. They passed through a form of  military dictatorship that introduced law and order in these  countries and stimulated their economies.    [Berov] Do you mean to say there is no law and order in our  country now? If we have to introduce a military dictatorship to  restore elementary order and legality, where are we going? I  believe that we have to be optimists.    [Dimitrova] One last question: Can you go over to the  window so we can take a photograph?    [Berov] I think you will have an opportunity for this on  Thursday when I return to work at the session of the Council of  Ministers. I do not think it is proper for someone to show  themselves at the window.    [Dimitrova] Then I will not insist. Thank you for the  interview.    [Berov] Have a nice evening.</p>

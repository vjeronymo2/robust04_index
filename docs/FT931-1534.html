			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / FBI likely to get new chief soon THE days of Judge William Sessions as head of the FBI appear to be numbered. Yesterday President Bill Clinton said he was waiting on a report from Ms Janet Reno, the new attorney general, before determining the director's fate. He also pointedly declined to confirm or deny reports of the existence of a short list to succeed Judge Sessions. Prominent on the list was said to be Mr Richard Stearns, now a state judge in Massachussetts but Mr Clinton's contemporary as a Rhodes Scholar in England and like the president, a campaign worker for Senator George McGovern in 1972. The FBI director came under heavy fire from the outgoing Bush administration, which accused him of misuse of public funds for private purposes. His stock had risen a little lately because of early FBI arrests in the World Trade Centre bombing. The administration was also reported not to want to remove him while the siege of a religious cult outside Waco, Texas, drags on. A further indication of of the administration's drive to purge law enforcement of Republican officials was provided yesterday when Ms Reno asked for the resignations of all US attorneys (federal prosecutors) from around the country. Ms Reno said she wanted to 'begin to build a team that represents. . . my views and the views of President Clinton.' US attorneys are political appointees, but more than 90 Republicans have continued to serve. There is one potential controversy to her action yesterday. The Republican US attorney in Washington, Mr Jay Stephens, has been aggressively investigating allegations of corruption against Mr Dan Rostenkwoski, powerful Democratic chairman of the House ways and means committee.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TRANSSEXUAL MAYORAL CANDIDATE TELLS YOUNTVILLE: 'CHANGE WILL DO YOU GOOD'  </P> <P> Things have been pretty lively around the veterans home since Terri Pohrman, a  transsexual Brigitte Nielsen-look-alike, starting running for mayor in tights  under the banner "The Change Will Do You Good."  </P> <P> The former Las Vegas showgirl was a regular entertainer at the California  Veterans' Home before she entered the race, but the stakes have gone up because  more than 700 of the 1,800 registered voters in this wine country town live  there.  </P> <P> The big-shouldered blonde with spiky hair faces two opponents in the April 10  election. She wants an additional 500 residents of the home to register to  vote. In the 1988 Yountville elections, only 535 people bothered to vote.  </P> <P> Pohrman visited the home on a recent weekend wearing roller-skates and a tight  body stocking with huge red cardboard hearts over her front and back. Later,  she donned a red sequined cocktail dress with a plunging neckline.  </P> <P> "All the guys got a big kick out of her," said Gene Sockness, 61. "She's really  welcome up here and shows us a good time. So what the heck, live and let live."  </P> <P> Pohrman's ambitions have panicked some residents of this conservative town of  3,200, situated in the Napa Valley about 40 miles north of San Francisco.  </P> <P> "I'm very serious about this," said Pohrman, 37, a costume jewelry saleswoman  who calls herself "Miss Terri."  </P> <P> "I'm going to be mayor and these people are scared," she said. "They think I'll  open a bunch of massage parlors and adult bookstores."  </P> <P> Pohrman moved to Yountville two years ago. A native of Portland, Ore., Pohrman  was a teen-age female impersonator before having a sex change operation in San  Francisco in the 1970s.  </P> <P> She opened a jewelry and dress shop and hit the road last year as a sales  representative. She first entered politics after the town's design-review  committee questioned the appropriateness of the advertising on her boutique.  </P> <P> City Manager Bob Myers says she violated ordinances by placing colored, plastic  flags around her shop and in the trees. She also had flashing neon lights and a  sandwich-board sign not allowed under local codes. The name of her shop was  Such a Deal.  </P> <P> Pohrman said she wants to bring the town together as "one big family," and  takes innovative stands on issues. On flood control, for instance, she says the  first thing she'd do is buy pink lifeboats for everyone.  </P> <P> "She's flamboyant for up here, but maybe not by San Francisco standards," said  60-year-old veteran Walter Allen, who lives at the veterans home.  </P> <P> Pohrman's critics include Carlee Leftwich, the mayor pro-tem and a six-year  council veteran who is running against Pohrman.  </P> <P> "Anyone who assumes that because the veterans are elderly and have health  problems that they are also stupid is making a terrible mistake," said  Leftwich. "I would never attempt to garner their votes by entertaining them."  </P> <P> Richard Kessler, a 65-year-old resident of the home, said of Pohrman: "She's  trying to work the vet's home for votes. To me she is nothing but a burlesque  queen. A lot of these old senile vets are taken in by her."  </P> <P> But Pohrman's conscience is clear: "I love those people," she said.  </P></p>

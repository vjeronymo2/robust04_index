			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NO PLACE LIKE HOME -- ANYPLACE;  </P> <P> MIGRANTS TEAR DOWN HUTS AS EVICTION NEARS  </P> <P> Rafael Martinez hurried to sell his home of three years Tuesday, quickly  agreeing to the buyer's price -- 20 cents a kilo for the wood and scrap metal  and $3 each for the two mattresses inside.  </P> <P> In all, Martinez earned a tidy $230 from the sale of his home, one of almost a  hundred plywood hooches in this migrant's camp in the coastal town of  Encinitas.  </P> <P> "This is enough to get me back to Tijuana and take care of me for a couple of  weeks," Martinez said. "I've had it. I could deal with the Border Patrol. But  how did the health department do this to us?"  </P> <P> Indeed, the about 125 remaining inhabitants of the Valle Verde squatters' camp  are asking the same question. The camp's residents include migrants from Mexico  and several other Latin American countries, many of whom have qualified for the  Immigration and Naturalization Service's year-old amnesty program.  </P> <P> Valle Verde was founded more than a decade ago, when the first residents  erected plywood shanties and camouflaged them on the chaparral-covered  hillsides across the road from affluent La Costa. The camp sits on El Camino  Real, near Olivenhain Road, sprawled across a couple of hundred acres of prime  coastal property, less than a mile from Carlsbad State Beach and the Pacific.  </P> <P> Before development began to encroach, Valle Verde was one of many migrant  worker camps spread across San Diego County's isolated northern area, close to  the nurseries and agricultural fields where thousands of aliens have been  traditionally employed. Over the years, the workers have lived through frequent  raids by Border Patrol agents, who were seen as more of a nuisance than a  threat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaints by Residents  </P> <P> But the San Diego County Health Services Department has accomplished in the  last six months what the Border Patrol had been unable to do in years. Last  summer, reacting to many complaints from area residents of trash, noise and the  growth of the primitive camp, county health officials declared Valle Verde a  health hazard and ordered the property owners -- the wealthy Texas Hunt  brothers -- to abate the site.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, after the abatement plan was approved by the California  Coastal Commission, the property owners posted notices in Spanish and English  throughout the camp telling the migrants that they had until Feb. 1 to leave.  The cleanup was left to the supervision of the leaseholder of the property,  Frank Wright &amp; Sons, a construction company.  </P> <P> Daryl (Ben) Benstead, who is overseeing the cleanup for the leaseholder, and  Wright came up with a plan to pay the migrants for razing the camp. The men are  paying 20 cents a kilo (equivalent to 2.2 pounds) for wood and scrap metal, $3  per mattress and 50 cents for each plastic bag filled with trash.  </P> <P> Benstead tried to stop the evictions, apologized to the migrants in a letter  and called them "good neighbors." He does not try to hide his bitterness over  the eviction. "I have no faith in human nature anymore. . . . I'm kind of  emotionally spent over this," said Benstead.  </P> <P> By Tuesday afternoon, the second day of the program, migrants had been paid  more than $1,000 for the scrap. The debris brought down from the hills by the  migrants had filled two 40-cubic-yard trash bins. Silvino Ruiz, one of  Benstead's helpers, was towing a portable scale around, weighing and recording  the loads.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Where Do We Go?'  </P> <P> Although county officials have succeeded in uprooting the migrants, they have  failed in attempts to find them housing. In a much-publicized move, county  officials announced in November that attempts would be made to find subsidized  housing for the about 12 families with children who live at Valle Verde. As of  Wednesday, none of the families had found housing.  </P> <P> Several migrants said that they will simply move to another camp farther north,  near Palomar Airport. A large number said they will wait until Feb. 1, when the  leaseholder will stop paying for scrap and trash and begin tearing down the  camp, and then decide where to go. Others, emboldened by their legal status,  talked about mounting a protest.  </P> <P> But the question heard over and over in the camp was, "Where do we go from  here?"  </P> <P> "Why are the authorities doing this to us? We have no place to go. Most of us  will just find another hillside or canyon to live," said a man called Tiburon.  "I don't understand gringos. In 1985, when I almost drowned at Carlsbad Beach,  they used a helicopter to save me. Now they're telling me to get out of the  only house I have. Why did they save me?"  </P></p>

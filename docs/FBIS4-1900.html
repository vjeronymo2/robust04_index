			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Under the Five-Ram City" column by Chang Jou-sang (1728 </F> 2677 2718): "Expose the Phenomenon of Fake Military Vehicles in  Guangdong"]    [Text] The date 28 January was "Black Friday" for a  handful of lawless persons who were using fake military license  plates. They never expected to receive such a lousy "New Years  gift." Scores of vehicles illegitimately using military license  plates fell into the dragnet set jointly by the garrison forces  and military transportation department in Guangzhou, Shenzhen,  and Zhuhai.    Although the flow of military vehicles accounts for less  than  5 percent of the total traffic in the crowded Zhujiang delta,  one can see all kinds of military license plates. In Guangdong,  an official responsible for the transportation section of the  Logistics Department of the Guangzhou Military Region said  military license plates from all parts of the country except  Tibet can been seen here. Experienced officers and men of the  garrison force who are responsible for exercising supervision  over military vehicles can easily spot the counterfeit military  vehicles. In the military vehicle inspection jointly organized  by the garrison forces and military transportation department of  the Guangzhou Military Region and investigated by relevant  departments of the General Staff Headquarters and General  Logistics Department and the Legal System Bureau of the Central  Military Commission, they examined more than 600 vehicles which  had been using military license plates and found that 31 were  using counterfeit military plates or licenses.  <H5>  Making Use of Military Vehicles To Smuggle and To Evade Taxes </H5>   It is difficult to discover where the fake military license  plates are forged, but Guangdong is surely one of the regions  where the practice is running wild. Because of the special  military mission of military vehicles and the preferential  treatment they enjoy in the Zhujiang delta, they are exempted  from highway and bridge tolls. As a result, a handful of people  blinded by greed take the opportunity to fish in troubled waters  and use counterfeit military license plates to gain advantages  at the expense of the state and collective. An individual  engaged in the transportation business said that he would save  annual highway and bridge tolls of over 10,000 yuan with a  military license plate. As Guangdong is a coastal province,  adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, a tiny handful of lawless  elements make use of the military plates to cover their crime of  smuggling, evade supervision by government departments, and  engage in all kinds of illegal activities.    There is great demand for these license plates. Lawless  elements seeking military plates and licenses stimulate almost  wild black market transactions. When a "Dongfeng" truck, with a  fake military license plate but without any license, was  intercepted in Shenzhen, a reporter asked the driver about the  source of the fake plate. The driver replied: I bought it for  600 yuan. When asked where he bought the plate, he said: I do  not know. The Guangzhou Military Region tracked down a truck  which was using fake military license plates by following clues,  and discovered an illegal ring involved in selling temporary  plates. The ring sold a total of 39 temporary military vehicle  plates at 10,000 yuan each. As of the time of the  investigation, the ring had illegally made a profit of 390,000  yuan. The black market price of a military license plate could  reach as high as several hundred thousand yuan. In spite of the  high prices, the forging of military vehicle license plates and  illegal transactions are spreading. Regarding the lawless  elements, the illegal gains made from using fake military  vehicles is several to many times higher than the cost paid for  getting a genuine military plate.  <H5>  Bizarre Dress Used To Pass Oneself Off As a Military Official </H5>   To pass oneself off as an owner or driver of a military  vehicle, one must pretend to be a serviceman or staff member of  a military unit. Most of these people appear in the capacity as  a staff member of a military enterprise. When a military  vehicle inspection group was examining a "Lingzhi" car with  military license plates at the Shaba toll collection station on  the Guangzhou-Foshan expressway, a long-haired female lieutenant  stepped out. The lady, who claimed to be the deputy director of  a unit of the Logistics Department stationed in Guangzhou, wore  a uniform with unmatched buttons and which was attractive, with  material which was apparently different from the standard. She  explained that the uniform was the latest issue. The servicemen  in the inspection group looked at each other in dismay. When  the inspector examined her "officer identity" card, which had  the chop of the management bureau of an ordnance factory, she  begged the female officer: "Please let me go, I am real." At  the military vehicle inspection post near the Zhuhai  Banzhangshan tunnel, the driver of a Toyota van, which had a  military plate, presented his "People's Liberation Army Identity  Card," which looked similar to the "officer identity" and  "serviceman identity" cards. "XX Real Estate Development Company  of XX Unit in Zhuhai" was printed on the cover of the identity  card. When the inspector asked the driver some questions about  the identity card, he just smiled and refused to answer.  <H5>  Huge Profits Result From Mass Production </H5>   In an office of the Highway Inspection Section of the  Guangzhou Military Region, this reporter witnessed hundreds of  various kinds of confiscated fake military license plates. Some  of the military plates and documents were of poor quality, and  could be identified at first glance. But the quality of most of  them was good enough to mistake them for real. According to  officials of the Transportation Bureau of the Logistics  Department of the Guangzhou Military Region, the workmanship and  materials used in making most of the counterfeit military  license plates were far better than the ones used in making  genuine military vehicle plates. The forging of driving passes,  driving licenses, officer identity cards, serviceman identity  cards, and staff identity cards corresponded with the forging of  military vehicle license plates. To forge documents, it is  necessary to forge the chops of military units and the officials  responsible for the work. One can easily see the mistakes in  the forged military documents and chops, such as "Logistics  Department of XX Unit Under General Staff Headquarters" and "XX  Unit Stationed in XX Office." A forged military vehicle license  even made the mistake of printing "Zhongguo Renmin Jiefang Jun"  [Chinese People's Liberation Army] as "Zhongguo Renmin Fangjie  Jun." An officer in charge of producing military vehicle  license plates said that he had already found more than a dozen  forged chops which used his name.    Looking at the military cars and trucks which sweep past and  gazing at the luxurious military cars parked in front of hotels,  this reporter is at a loss: How many of them are genuine?  Undoubtedly there are "underground factories" which forge  military vehicle plates and licenses in large numbers. But when  can these dens be smashed?</p>

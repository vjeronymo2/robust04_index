			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (3): Diversifying into new areas - The coal industry BAD news is not new at Ruhrkohle. Producing 80 per cent of Germany's hard coal output, the state-subsidised company has had to cope in the last three years with the twin problems of domestic recession and empty state coffers. Declining industrial orders from steel mills and a slowdown in electricity consumption have sparked a political debate which could revise the company's planned output level and which threatens to accelerate the coal mine closures. Under the restructuring plan, 12,000 jobs are due to go within the next two years. But job cuts could double, according to the company's estimates, as a result of falling output in the steel industry, plus calls in Bonn for a cut in state subsidies to support the Ruhr coal production. However, a bright spot can be found in Ruhrkohle's attempts to prove itself as a viable competitor in non-coal areas. While 98 per cent of Ruhrkohle's turnover came from coal mining 20 years ago, the company has diversified - 39 per cent of its business is now in environmental technology, trading, power engineering and construction. Steag, its largest non-coal subsidiary, operates power plants for district heating and offers related environmental and engineering services, and has seen profits rise in the last three years. Steag employs 4,500 people and had a turnover of DM3.5bn last year. Engineering services offered by Steag have been particularly profitable, rising by 13 per cent last year to DM48m. Waste management for power plants also increased by 15 per cent in 1992 to DM102m. Steag has also made advances in ventilation and clean-air technology. Following aggressive marketing abroad, especially in the US and Asia, orders for these divisions increased last year by 23 per cent and turnover rose by 48 per cent. Growth is also under way for Ruhrkohle Umwelt which specialises in waste management. The subsidiary, with 1,500 employees, reported a turnover of DM525m last year; profits for the four-year-old company were DM14m. Ruhrkohle's turnover this year is expected to reach DM900m as the company increases its stakes to majority ownership in the Richard Buchen company, which specialises in waste disposal and Weber Umwelttechnik, a Baden-Wurttemberg waste management company. Ruhrkohle Umwelt also plans to invest DM400m in new plants. A significant investment will go toward developing a recycling plant for plastics in Bottrop, which involves energy recovery for a oil refinery run by Veba, the large Dusseldorf-based power group. There, Ruhrkohle Umwelt intends to tap into the lively growth area of plastic recycling, for which Germany has the highest quotas in Europe. Plans include increasing plastic recycling capacity from 12,000 to 40,000 tonnes. With more than a million tonnes of plastic waste produced each year in Germany, officials at Ruhrkhole Umwelt are confident about the returns on such an investment. Another growth area for Ruhrkohle Umwelt lies in the cleaning up of contaminated sites. Last year, it cleaned up more than 80,000 tonnes of contaminated soil; and abroad, it is researching ways to clean-up war-damaged areas of Kuwait. Meanwhile, with Ruhrkohle's traditional coal business facing increased difficulties, the company's newer non-coal subsidiaries are setting their sights on potential markets in eastern Germany. Steag, for instance, is involved in supplying district heating in the town of Zwickau where it is collaborating with RWE and Bayernwerk, two of the largest west German utility groups. Steag will also modernising power supplies in the town of Leuna where it is building a gas and steam turbine co-generation plant. Similarely, Ruhrkohle has positioned its environmental subsidiaries to become a key player in eastern parts of the country. There, Ruhrkohle Umwelt plans to increase its turnover from DM70m to DM90m. It is also participating in the biggest clean-up operation for the region's brown coal fields. But the bright prospects of Ruhrkohle's non-coal subsidiaries have been dampened by the plight of Germany's coal industry. While sales in non-coal operations are expanding, this success is not in labour-intensive areas which could offset job losses in the coal business. Moreover, growth is also taking place mainly outside the Ruhr region. A three-year-old subsidiary of Ruhrkohle now offers vocational teaching for 6,000 employees a year, of whom 3,500 are workers involved in projects in eastern Germany. These schemes, however, are of little help to the 12,000 workers which are due to leave the company by the end of 1995. The diversification of the company provides relatively small compensation for the problems in the coal sector, which remains its core business. Ruhrkohle had further bad news from the steel sector this summer. The company is now negotiating with leading German steelmakers who want to renege on a contract to buy coke and coking coal from Ruhrkohle until the year 2000. The contract was originally devised as a lifeline for the company, whose subsidised coal and coke is too expensive to be competitive abroad. Despite its progress in non-coal areas, Ruhrkohle remains irrevocably tied to the future of coal-mining. The Ruhr itself faces a tough challenge in absorbing the job losses following the closure of mines. The figures are revealing: in 1970, more than 191,000 people worked in the Ruhr's mining industry; a decade later this had fallen to 140,000; then to 100,000 in 1990. Today the total is down to 89,000.</p>

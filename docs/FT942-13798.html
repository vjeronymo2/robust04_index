			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (6): Coffee house atmosphere - The Cairo stock exchange For romantic connoisseurs of emerging markets, Egypt's stock exchange in downtown Cairo still has that classic coffee house ambience. Aside from its recently added computer screens which now display the latest share prices, the physical appearance of the bourse has changed little since colonial times. The only problem is that more cups of coffee are drunk there than shares are traded. Since the country's vociferous programme of nationalisation in the late 1950s and early 1960s, under the presidency of Gamal Abdel-Nasser, what was in its day the world's fifth largest securities market has been reduced to little more than a maverick's cafe. Out of the 674 companies listed, scarcely more than 15 are actively traded, resulting in a highly illiquid and volatile exchange. Official market data is scarce and, when it exists, spurious. A number of local brokerage firms have begun compiling their own market reports, but even these differ widely. Perhaps the best reflection of the market's float was the description, in a recent Cairo newspaper article, of a fall in the price of shares in the Suez Cement Company, one of the more active listings which has a 21 per cent public holding, as 'a mini stock market crash'. This is not the stuff which makes emerging market fund managers rush to bring out a new prospectus. But salutary steps are taking place to reverse this decline. By next year, Egypt may well be vying for a place on international investors' portfolios. The revitalisation of the country's financial markets is a crucial item on Egypt's structural adjustment programme. The Capital Markets Law, passed in April 1993 and slowly bringing results, aims to go some way towards this end. The law provides for the establishment of modern brokerage firms and merchant bankers; investment vehicles such as mutual funds; the use of debt instruments and corporate bonds; stringent disclosure and transparency requirements for listed companies; and tax advantages to both floated companies and investors. Results so far include Egypt's first mutual fund, set up by the National Bank of Egypt, worth EPounds 100m. Hoechst Orient, the German/Egyptian joint-venture pharmaceutical company, is issuing the first ever corporate bond: a EPounds 30m issue with a five year maturity, underwritten by Banque Paribas. Cairo's stock exchange has been linked by computer to the bourse in Alexandria, thus reducing the discrepancy in prices between the two exchanges. And a string of corporate brokerage firms are rapidly being formed amid high expectations. The new regulations give a free run to foreign investors on the market, with no ownership limits - although companies' own bylaws may be restrictive - and no tax on dividends or capital repatriation. Furthermore, with the commercial banks awash with liquidity, resources are there to fuel domestic demand for shares. The only thing missing is the paper to invest in. Despite this, interest in the market is on the rise. According to figures complied by the Egyptian Financial Group (EFG), the current market capitalisation of the 15 or so companies which are actively traded is EPounds 11.5bn - this includes tranches in cement and textiles companies and a few banks. Last year's turnover was about EPounds 1.1bn and the average price/earning ratio has risen from 5.2 to 8.2 over the past year. The EFG Index is up by 19 per cent since January 1994 after a 38 per cent increase in 1993. 'The market has witnessed an upwards shift in demand without an increase in supply. Gradually more people are participating, in anticipation of what is to come,' explains Mr Hisham Tawfik of EFG. The most exciting source of new scrip is an ambitious privatisation programme. The government has undertaken to sell half of its assets in 314 state enterprises by the end of 1995. But difficulties in valuing company assets, overcoming huge debts and finding the political will to 'sell the family silver' have so far hindered any outright sales. Furthermore, a new share issue by the state-owned Commercial International Bank (CIB) did little to impress investors with the public sector's ability to organise a flotation. The CIB issued 1.5m shares to raise its capital by public flotation last September. The issue was 50 per cent oversubscribed. Eight months later, the 6,049 new subscribers had still not received their share certificates. Because informal trading of receipts is illegal, the new shareholders were unable to act upon their investments - a bad precedent for future subscriptions. Most local analysts argue that a strong signal from the government, proving its commitment to free markets, is essential before Egypt's stock exchange re-emerges. Otherwise, Cairo's downtown bourse will retain its quaint coffee house feel.</p>

Kuril District Administration Chief G. Dolin, assessing the  results of two years of visa-exempt exchanges, said, "the fact  that we islanders have stopped viewing Japan as an enemy is the  most important change."    Speaking at a press conference in Sapporo, the capital of  Hokkaido, Dolin said friendships have developed between Russians  and Japanese, while the views of the Russians on the territorial  dispute have moved closer to those of the Japanese.    The Russian delegation arrived in Sapporo on Sunday for a  six-day stay in Hokkaido and Tokyo to coordinate a plan for  visa-free group exchanges between neighboring regions of the two  countries this year.    South Kuril District Chief N.A. Pokidin pledged at the press  conference that efforts would be made to expand access for  former Japanese residents and their relatives to graves dating  from before the Russian takeover of the disputed islands.    The four islands -- Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the  Habomai islets -- were seized by Soviet forces at the end of  World War II and subsequently repopulated by Russians.    Russian refers to them as the South Kurils, while Japan  calls  them its northern territories.</p>

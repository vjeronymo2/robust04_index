			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce foreign holding breached ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine manufacturer, yesterday said non-UK shareholders had taken their holdings above the permitted level. The investors have been asked to relinquish their shares. The level of the group's foreign ownership of its shares has risen to 30.19 per cent, breaching the 29.5 per cent permitted by the company's articles of association. The limit was raised to its present level in 1989. Rolls-Royce has asked foreign shareholders which bought shares since the company said it had reached its maximum level last month to relinquish their purchase by July 28. If they fail to do so their shares will be sold and the proceeds returned. Buying from overseas investors has underpinned the share price in recent months. However, until the level of foreign shareholding is reduced below the maximum permitted limit, it is likely that all new purchases of foreign held shares presented for registration will be classified as excess.</p>

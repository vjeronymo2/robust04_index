			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (7): Company gains more time for better planning - Construction industry application / Asta's 'Powerproject' FOR the construction group Kyle Stewart, one of the benefits of using a project management system has been 'more time thinking and planning more productively,' according to the group's chief planner, Bob Reed. He keeps a close eye on the market for software, and first spotted Asta's Powerproject at an architectural RIBA exhibition in 1989. A construction company which specialises in large and commercial buildings, Kyle Stewart, part of the European HBG group, was no stranger to project management systems, and the idea of acquiring PowerProject was to build an integrated database consolidating all the cost and progress information on PCs. The package has now been in use for three and a half years, linked with the Foxpro-based database which stores project costs. Although PowerProject did not have all the features of a standard project management system at the time, Bob Reed spotted its potential as an easy-to-use tool for the planning engineers. Now 14 of them use the software, entering details directly through the screen. The output is mostly through Gantt-style time charts and precedence diagrams, one of the advantages being the high quality of presentation graphics. This is a valuable feature in the marketing phase of construction projects. The company now has an integrated system that covers every stage from tender to commissioning, controlling all project data such as technical drawings, and cost data. Kyle Stewart now uses the package all over Europe, and holds ten product licences. 'It has improved our planning and made us more accurate,' says Mr Reed. The chance he took on a relatively unknown product has paid off. Although the software system may be viewed as a 'lightweight' by some in the construction industry, full project management features are in development, and Kyle Stewart is beta-testing updated releases of the software. 'I'm quite please with the way it's heading,' he adds. ***** SOFTWARE DETAILS PowerProject PowerProject for Windows was launched in Autumn 1992, a totally mouse-driven PC-based project management system that allows both the experienced or inexperienced user to draw barcharts direct on to the screen as a linke barchart, so avoiding the need to understand network diagrams.

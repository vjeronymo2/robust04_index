			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Canary Wharf deal 'breaks new ground' BANKERS TO Canary Wharf, the office project in London's Docklands that went into administration last year, yesterday announced details of a complex Pounds 1.1bn rescue package. This is the first time that a company voluntary arrangement, by which companies are taken out of administration as a going concern, has been used for such a large company. Mr Iain Cheyne of Lloyds Bank said: 'In putting together a rescue package of this size, we are breaking new ground.' The secured lenders have agreed to restructure their existing debt of Pounds 568m, plus accruing interest over 14 years, deferring repayment of the loans until 2007. In addition, the lenders are putting up new finance of up to Pounds 278m. This sum includes the initial Pounds 98m private-sector payment for the Jubilee Line extension, which will be provided by the European Investment Bank, which is owned by the European Community. It also involves payment of Pounds 27m to the unsecured creditors under the company voluntary arrangement and Pounds 153m to support the long-term development of Canary Wharf. A further Pounds 300m will be paid to London Regional Transport over 25 years for the completion of the Jubilee Line extension, which has a current value of Pounds 80m. The consortium of lenders to Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf are Barclays, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Chemical Bank, Citibank, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Credit Lyonnais, Credit Suisse, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Lloyds Bank and Royal Bank of Canada. The company voluntary arrangements for five main Canary Wharf companies involves paying the 1,400 unsecured creditors up to 15p in the pound. About 130 creditors will be required to give warranties and will receive a further 25p in the pound. The claims of unsecured creditors are expected to be Pounds 117m to Pounds 149m. The proposed restructuring, refinancing and arrangements for the Jubilee Line extension contain complex conditions making the transactions dependent on each other, so no part of the proposals will go through unless they all do. Mr Stephen Adamson of Ernst &amp; Young, one of the administrators, said: 'The package is interlocking so unless all the agreements fall into place, nothing will happen.' The costs of Canary Wharf's administration have been between Pounds 13m and Pounds 14m. The administrators have called a meeting to vote on the company voluntary arrangements on September 30. The company is expected to come out of administration by October 31 if the arrangements are approved by more than 75 per cent of creditors by value. Canary Wharf's corporate structure will be reorganised under a parent company controlled by the banks.</p>

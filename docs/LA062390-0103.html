			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DU PONT SAYS 4 PLANTS TO TARGET OZONE EROSION  </P> <P> Du Pont Co. has authorized money to develop four production facilities for its  line of non-ozone depleting alternatives to chloroflourocarbons.  </P> <P> The plants -- in Corpus Christi, Texas; Louisville, Ky.; Dordrecht, the  Netherlands, and Chiba, Japan -- will be operational between 1992 and 1995.  </P> <P> The company didn't say how much their construction would cost.  </P> <P> Du Pont executives said the plants will be capable of producing more than 140  million pounds of hydrofluorocarbons annually -- enough to supply most  worldwide refrigeration needs through the end of the century.  </P> <P> The HCFCs would be produced for automobile air conditioners, appliances and  commercial refrigeration.  </P> <P> "These commercial facilities would be among the first to produce world-scale  quantities of non-ozone-depleting alternatives," said Joseph Glas, director of  Du Pont's Freon Products division.  </P> <P> Including the $240 million that it invested through 1990, the company said, its  total investment to commercialize CFC alternatives will top $1 billion.  </P> <P> In 1988, Du Pont announced that it would stop production of CFCs by the end of  the century.  </P> <P> The Wilmington chemical and fibers company has 10 facilities operating or under  construction for the production of hydrofluorocarbons. Later this year, three  facilities will begin operation in Corpus Christi; Maitland, Ontario, and  Humberside, England.  </P> <P> "Du Pont is working very closely with its customers during the transition,  particularly since the substitutes are not drop-in replacements, and companies  will have to modify and redesign equipment to use them," Glas said.  </P> <P> HCFCs are expected to be able to replace 30% of current CFC uses. The  alternatives have on average 95% less ozone depletion potential than CFCs.  </P></p>

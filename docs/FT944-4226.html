			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Clarke wins broad support - Conservative backbenchers A broad cross-section of Conservative backbenchers yesterday welcomed Mr Kenneth Clarke's revised Budget proposals, hoping that they would swiftly defuse the recent row over value added tax on fuel. MPs said the chancellor had delivered a bravura performance in the Commons, regaining the initiative against the Labour party following Tuesday night's defeat on VAT. Rightwing MPs expressed reservations, however, that the chancellor had opted for tax-raising measures rather than taking another opportunity to make cuts in public spending. Some MPs said that the tone of the statement had been too vengeful towards Tory rebels who had brought about the government's defeat. One said: 'There was too much of an air of 'serves you right for voting me down'. We could have done with a bit more humble pie.' The chancellor's tax-raising measures - on cigarettes, alcohol and petrol - were seen by mainstream backbenchers as the safest option after the row over VAT on fuel. A backbencher said: 'Booze, fags and gas are regarded as the three 'sin taxes' in this country, so it was safe for him to go for those.' He felt that any adjustment in the general rate of VAT to make up the shortfall in revenue would have led the government into a further rebellion. Mr Phil Gallie, the Tory MP for Ayr who abstained in Tuesday night's vote, said he was satisfied with the measures. He said: 'I am relieved that he did not put 2p a litre on petrol. If he had done that, the rise would have been tough on Scottish rural constituencies.' Mr Clarke's performance in the Commons, in which he accused Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, of having the 'brass neck' of complaining about tax rises he had instigated, also drew warm applause. However, others expressed concern that the increases in cigarettes and alcohol would have a negative impact on local industries. According to one prominent rightwinger companies in his constituency were facing much tougher competition following the relaxation of customs and excise duties and the growth of cross-border shopping. Two Euro-rebels also made clear that they remained unhappy at the chancellor's refusal to tackle spending on Britain's contribution to the European budget. They could not understand why the European budget remained 'sacrosanct' while the chancellor undertook sweeping tax rises. Last night the divisions in the party appeared to be as great as ever after a row broke out at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Tory backbench MPs. Mr Terry Dicks, a strong ally of the prime minister, turned on dissident MPs at the meeting, accusing them of 'conspiring behind John Major's back'. Mr Dicks accused Sir George Gardiner, a leading rightwinger, of 'two-faced, sanctimonious hypocrisy'.</p>

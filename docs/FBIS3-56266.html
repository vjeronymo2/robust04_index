Zyuganov told a press conference on Thursday that security  issues should be in the focus of Russian-U.S. talks.    "The system of security in Russia is completely disorganised  and the issue should be discussed in detail during the visit  before the situation goes out of control completely", he said.    Speaking on Duma affairs, Zyuganov said that his party had  already blocked with the Agrarian party and the Democratic  Russia.    "Doors for others remain open", he stressed and added that  communists are ready to unite with those factions which share  three of their basic principles: peace in the country,  well-being in every family and not only in elite families, the  understanding that the current situation leads to chaos and  upheavals.    Communists will focus on three tasks in the Duma and the  major one is to change the course of reforms. The other two  include the restoration of the state management in the country  and moral improvement in society.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] For a local Palestinian reaction to the Hadera  attack, reporter Mark Weiss spoke with Ghassan al-Khatib from  the Palestinian People's Party:    [Begin al-Khatib recording] Well, first of all I feel that  this is an expected and unfortunate natural reaction to the kind  of policies and practices the Israeli settlers and Army has been  practicing against the Palestinian people almost on daily basis.  Of course, I feel sorry for the killing of any human being,  including the persons that were killed in Hadera. But we have  to go beyond just expressing feelings and see exactly why has  this been happening and what is the way to overcome it. I think  that it is happening because of the frustration people are  feeling as a result of the occupation practices and as a result  of the lack of progress in the peace process. The only way to  get out of this circle of blood is simply to advance the peace  process on a fair basis, and second, that Israel should modify  its practices and policies in the occupied territories in order  to reduce the tension and the frustration among the Palestinian  people.

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Unions raise pressure on business and industry WESTERN Germany's public service unions yesterday stepped up their pressure on business and industry while changing strike tactics to avoid antagonising the public. As about 130,000 private sector engineering workers began token protest stoppages in the south, rubbish collectors struck for the first time and local transport strikes spread to Hesse, home to Frankfurt, the national financial centre. There were no signs of a break in the deadlock, blamed on the employers' refusal to increase their 4.8 per cent pay offer, although some easing of the disruption is likely today as the country winds down for the long May Day weekend. During a cursory cabinet discussion yesterday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl reminded colleagues of the importance of sending the correct signals to the private sector by keeping public service pay under control, and won agreement for a two-year freeze on ministerial pay. According to the oTV union, main orchestrator of the public sector strike, 215,000 people took part in stoppages yesterday, up from 75,000 on Monday and 175,000 on Tuesday. However, according to Mr Willi Muck, oTV deputy president, action would be reduced today 'from Wednesday's peak'. Disruption of local transport would be limited to specific areas, including the industrial and financial centres of North-Rhine Westphalia and Hesse. So far, the strike, largely limited to local transport and postal services, has failed to generate the widely forecast chaos. Unions have been meticulous in avoiding sensitive areas. 'Striking' hospital doctors have merely refused to do official form-filling. The oTV stressed that payment of state pensions would not be hampered. However, with local transport stoppages expected to well up again next week, the impact on business could increase. City centre retail sales have already fallen by up to 20 per cent a day.</p>

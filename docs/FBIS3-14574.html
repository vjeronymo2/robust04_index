Why was this decision  made? What effects will it have on the oil market?    [Aqazadeh] Fortunately, this year the Majles and the  government had predicted from the start that the current  situation would continue. Therefore, in the government's  proposal, a considerable reduction of income from oil had been  predicted, and the Majles reduced the government's proposal.  The figure this year is less than the figure for last year.  Hence, the concerns that the government and Majles had in mind  the situation of the market.... [pauses] They made the required  decisions regarding this situation.    Of course, on the other hand, with the commissioning of  certain major projects in the country, the demand for currency  has been reduced. For example, our own ministry -- which was a  major consumer -- our demand for currency has fallen  considerably compared to previous years.    We hope that the changes in the oil market will not affect  our macroeconomics [eqtesad-e kalan] too much. What has upset  us, however, is that oil is being sold at an unrealistic price.  This, on the whole, is not to the benefit of oil producers.    [Correspondent] Mr. Engineer, considering the OPEC decision  and your remarks, the price of oil will probably either remain  the same or go down. What is your prediction for the second  quarter of the year about the price of oil, taking into account  that summer is approaching and there will less domestic demand?    [Aqazadeh] Yes. Let me say that when we faced the  non-reduction in production in OPEC, a number of ministers  proposed that the same production ceiling should be kept for the  third and fourth quarter of the Christian year. Our decision is  for nine months [sentence as heard]. This decision was made  because our current difficulty is the second quarter. In the  third and fourth quarters, demand will go up automatically, and  the production ceiling can be in balance with the demand of that  time.</p>

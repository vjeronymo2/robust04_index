			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Management: When the time comes for shareholders to stand up and be counted Anybody who believes that shareholders will provide the key to better corporate governance may be a little optimistic. Consider the case of Tace, maker of environmental control equipment, versus its institutional shareholders, probably the most public and fierce of all recent boardroom battles. The protagonist, Michael Sandland, chief investment officer at Norwich Union and chairman of the Institutional Shareholders Committee, won kudos from the press, the Bank of England, and the public at large for his fight to rid the company of what was perceived to be profligate, inefficient and arrogant management. But behind the scenes, Sandland's activities were questioned by his own board as well as by fellow shareholders, and in the end, only one other institution agreed to help pay the bill for the effort. Norwich Union and Framlingtonalone were left to split a Pounds 60,000 bill for solicitors' services,with other costs paid by Tace's new management. To the public eye, it was a case of fund managers robustly defending their clients' interests after attempts to bring in a new and more efficient management failed. As the battle dragged on, institutions representing some 40 per cent of Tace's shares succeeded finally in toppling the management, only to have the company become the target of a successful takeover bid by Cambridge Electronics. But privately, quite another story emerged. According to an account of the battle prepared by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants, the matter began when a Tace director, concerned about excessive remuneration for the chairman, contacted the Bank of England. The Bank then advised the shareholder to contact Sandland, holder of 5 per cent of Tace's shares. It then appears that when attempts to replace the chief executive voluntarily were likely to be unsuccessful, Sandland lined up two other shareholders, Framlington and GT Management, to help him oust the board. But early on, GT dropped out, while other institutions needed active hand-holding to maintain their support throughout the affair. For his part, Sandland will not comment on the specific events. However, he argues that the desire to keep such battles out of the public eye - as well as the lack of resources available to fund managers to engage in them - makes institutions reluctant to engage in concerted action. 'You are unlikely to get some kind of pan-institutional framework because shareholders are unwilling to surrender to a third party their proxy rights,' Sandland argues.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Private View: Sprightly oracle of a decadent century - Bengali writer Nirad Chaudhuri looks back on 95 years of a full and controversial life and explains why he thinks the West is going rotten IN HIS 96th year Nirad Chaudhuri, the Bengali writer, burns with astonishing vitality. His memory is elephantine, his knowledge encyclopaedic. He is too poetic for a pedant, too passionate for a philosopher, too scholarly for a journalist, and too playful for his adopted role as the Cassandra of his century. Within seconds of my arrival he was giving a virtuoso performance which he conducted with elegant hands. He talked nineteen to the dozen, shuffling to the bookshelf to show off a prized volume or quotation, denouncing the new English Bible ('you cannot keep Christianity by making your religious literature accessible to shopgirls') and reciting the Lord's Prayer in Greek and Latin. Having come to quiz him about old age, I was disconcerted by this impish figure dressed like a perfect English gentleman and as proudly as a bantam cockerel. Eventually I asked if there were pleasures in being 95, or only disadvantages. 'It depends absolutely on the individual,' he said. 'I don't get on with elderly people at all because they consider me mad. I consider them dead.' He cackled. Chaudhuri was a premature baby and 'always scraggy'. He is 5ft tall and weighs six stone. Until late middle age his health was poor (for which he blames his failure to get his MA after a First in history at Calcutta). 'For myself I took special care that I should remain a live person. So for the last 50 years I have not taken any Indian food. And you don't know how I despise and hate vegetarianism. I don't eat much bread or anything else, only meat, vegetables, milk products and fruit. 'I have lived because lowly things have a longer life than higher ones: for instance, weeds, mice, snails survive where human beings may not. I am, from the purely zoological point of view, no better probably than a snail. 'But what I felt is that whoever has kept me like this - I don't believe in the ordinary kind of religion: it may be the universe, it may be the cosmos  -he has spared me my mind. I say the day I shall lose my mental efficiency, let me die. Chaudhuri claims to have written his two volumes of autobiography from memory. 'Memory comes from interest in life,' he declared, rattling off the names of the geological ages by way of demonstration. He got to his feet and, stiff and straight as a schoolboy, recited a Bengali poem he had learned in 1920 and some verses of Ronsard, the 16th century French poet. He had never revised his writings, never had to change his mind about the decadence of his century - though he admitted being temporarily deflected by England's post-war optimism. 'My mind doesn't change,' he said, 'because my mind is really a camera. I take credit only for developing the negative.' Don't you think the world looks a quite different place to the young and to the old? 'Certainly. But I have never lost the sensibility to the world which I had at 16. And I remain that idiot. I could not be a greater fool. That is to say, I am in layers. I am not one personality. The wretched people' (he did not specify which wretches) 'they are so very monolithic: they don't understand that I am layers of sedimentary rocks.' At the age of 29 he was struck dumb by a girl he saw in Benares. 'After the train left Benares station, I felt something had snapped here.' He touched his breast pocket. 'I lay down on the bed and cried for three hours for that girl,' he continued, shrieking with laughter. 'A man who can be such an idiot at 29 will retain his idiocy all his life]' Socrates said that one advantage of age is that sexual desire goes. Is that true? 'I don't know about women. But at no time in his life does man lose sexual desire. The only question is at what level he retains it. This is the horrible tragedy of age.' Sex was not love but could never be banished, 'just as alcohol remains in the best chateau-bottled wine.' In view of his own vitality I asked him if he was only professionally a pessimist. 'No, I am not professionally pessimistic, I am professionally realistic. As a student of history I cannot deceive myself as to the symptoms I see. That does not mean I have despaired of mankind for ever. My difficulty today is that while if I had lived at the end of the Roman Empire I should have easily pointed out where the new life was coming from - Christianity and the new Germanic blood - today I cannot. Because what I call the new country, America, is even more decadent, more rotten - from the human point of view, not technologically - than the old.' Every old man, I ventured, says things have been going downhill since his youth. What makes this century - your century - special? 'This is nothing to do with the natural change of opinion in elderly people. On the contrary. I may be disenchanted with the present state of the world but of mankind I have not despaired.' Chaudhuri grew up in Kishorganj, now in Bangladesh, hating the British rule like his fellows but, he says, compelled eventually to recognise its cultural superiority. He dedicated his first book, Autobiography of an Unknown Indian, a beautifully-written compound of lyrical descriptiveness and historical analysis, 'to the memory of the British Empire in India.' He lived in Calcutta until 1942, then Delhi, and settled in England at the age of 73 to ruminate on the decadence of both India and its imperial masters and what he calls the disaster of Indian independence. The result was the quasi-autobiographical Thy Hand, Great Anarch], completed in his 90th year. 'I am a dedicated imperialist', he explained. 'I did not get my idea of imperialism from that exploded intellectual creature of hatred, Karl Marx. I got it from the Roman Empire.' Chaudhuri's theme is the cycle of civilisations in which mankind ascends to the divine or sinks lower than the beasts. I remarked that Tolstoy had found intellectual comfort in the simple faith of peasants. Chaudhuri snorted. 'They don't understand. They are like animals. I have never been an egalitarian. I believe mankind will become so different in 1000 or 500 years that he will not be recognisable as the same animal. 'Zoological speciation may have ceased but mental speciation will continue. Why is it that when Bengalis come I understand them but they don't understand me? They are on a lower plane as a mental species. I admit an affinity with the dog. I admit an affinity even with a bird or an earthworm. So we never have the right to look down on anybody who is not grown to our point. But I have evolved mentally where others may not have evolved.' Foreign aid was a waste of time, he said. He told a former British High Commissioner that no amount of money could turn chimpanzees into English gentlemen. 'All collateral lines are dead lines while the European tip remains living. But it is causing me real pain that what I call the living tip seems to be withering.' What is the evidence for that? 'Simply, even the conception of physical love has disappeared. Taste in food has disappeared.' You mean sexual behaviour is immoral? 'I don't mean moral or immoral. I say it's become crude. Empire is gone, economic spirit is gone, industrial superiority is gone. Can these disappear without mental decadence? There is nothing wrong.' Nothing wrong with decadence? 'Nothing wrong. It's ageing. Now look here. This is fundamental to my thinking. Just as a man grows up, reaches the full majority of his power, then ages, so do nations. If you do not accept that then we shall never agree.' With that the old man whipped out his false teeth and held them grinning up to my face. 'There's nothing to be ashamed of, nothing discreditable,' he mumbled. He replaced the denture. 'It is the law of nature. Nobody can escape it. But there is a difference, as the Romans said, between perishing in your house full of years and honours and perishing of syphilis in a brothel.' He repeated the last phrase with relish. I asked for other symptoms of Western decadence. 'Physical energy has gone and the vitality which expresses itself in joie de vivre. Pleasure is not happiness.' What about art? 'Art is non-existent.' Music? 'Creation is non-existent, enjoyment remains. I formerly never fell below Schubert. Now I have come down even to Elgar. But in painting I don't acknowledge anybody to be a painter after Cezanne. Architecture disappeared. Artistic life is no longer: it's all fraud.' The obvious riposte, I said, is that you are an old man who won't accept modern aesthetic values. Chaudhuri was angry. 'This is absurd. Look here. I am the only man in India who has great monographs on palaeolithic painting. From that to Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Persian, European, all I can admire. You cannot say I am narrow. It is nothing to do with my age. This silly thing is always said about me - the idiots. If I can admire, for instance, Indian music and European music both, if I can admire palaeolithic painting to Cezanne, can you tell me that I am narrow? No. 'Then that is it.' I asked him if his unpopularity in India upset him; he countered by saying he was the highest-paid contributor to the Bengali press. But perhaps they like hearing the worst of themselves? 'No, Indians don't like it. What they did like was being criticised by white men. That nurses their grievance. Indians have two great passions: one is making money, the other is nursing a grievance.' He chortled. 'Now, in India they can do neither so they come to England' (he was hardly able to speak for laughing now) 'and complain they are being ill-treated. Not one son-of-a-bitch will go back. I have not met a single Indian in England in this 23 years who has not said 'we hate the English, they ill-treat us.' If I had felt that for even 10 hours I would have taken the aeroplane. Do you think I would submit to this insult? 'Their greed for money is because they have accepted defeat in life, and all people who accept defeat in life want to nurse a grievance. The elixir of success passes away but grievance, never]' What do you think of your own future? 'I may not arise from the bed tomorrow morning. Listen. From the age of 16 to about my 50th year there was not one evening I went to bed without thinking of death. Now I have come to terms with death. I have lost all fear of it.' The annihilation of death was horrible, tragic, he said, but had to be accepted. 'If at my age a fellow is not prepared to die next moment, he's a damned fool.' He quoted Marcus Aurelius: 'Mortal man, you have been a citizen of a great city and you are going to leave it. Don't complain.' 'I am going, but . . . ' He broke off and rummaged in a tray of odds and ends. When he turned round he was holding a small battery. 'I consider myself a little bit of electricity packed in a dry cell. And when the universe has done with me, I am thrown, like this . . . ' and he threw the battery into the fireplace. You have used your life to the full, I said. What was its purpose? 'My purpose is, first of all, to find what human value my country and civilisation has created which will remain valuable for all mankind. But also to find what mankind has done to make human life a great thing. Had I been a poet I should have brought something new. But what I can bring is an interpretation which would give faith.' But if we are coming to the end, like ancient Rome, not even your analysis is going to save us. 'Plato wanted to prevent the decadence of Athens, but that does not mean Plato has not been useful for later generations. What I say is this. If there remains any interest in India, any knowledge of the English language, I will live. If there remains any interest in mankind, my books will be read. Though they interpret the value of human life in terms of India that does not mean they lack some universal application. I shall form part of the mental life of future generations.' As I rose to leave, Chaudhuri barred the doorway. 'You can choose to be ordinary,' he said. 'You see here an extraordinary man.' I had to agree.</p>

The 51-year-old Carrick Cumnock and Doon Valley MP took the step before appearing in court where he admitted being drunk and disorderly and assaulting a policeman. Mr Foulkes was fined Pounds 1,050 with Pounds 500 costs and compensation by London's Bow Street magistrates' court. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said yesterday he had accepted Mr Foulkes' resignation 'with great regret'.</p>

Long says that the  small, unenthusiastic crowds in Los Angeles don't send chills down his spine.  </P> <P> It's time for the silver and black to stop pointing fingers and face the facts  -- they don't feel the chills because they seem to have left their spines in  Oakland.  </P> <P> JOSEPH P. HUBBELL  </P> <P> Pismo Beach  </P></p>

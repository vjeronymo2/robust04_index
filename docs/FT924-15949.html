			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / People: BM finds Woolley Bristol-fashion In choosing a new chairman, BM Group has gone for a completely different animal from Roger Shute, the man who built it up from nothing in 1979 to an international concern that will turn over about Pounds 600m this year. Shute, 47, succumbed this summer to stress and respiratory illness, aggravated by 60 cigarettes a day, as the stock market became increasingly nervous about its profit outlook in the midst of a deepening recession. For a start, the newcomer Moger Woolley, 57, is non-executive and will shuffle his BM duties with the chairmanships of packaging companies API and Dolphin, plus three other non-executive posts. Woolley spent 30 years at DRG, ending up as chief executive of the packaging group before it was taken over by Pembridge Investments in 1989. He then spent a few months as chairman of Parkway before it was taken over by Wace, and was also chairman of CHB, the housing wing that Beazer wanted to float, before Beazer in turn fell to Hanson. Shute, on the other hand, had lots of jobs before settling down as a construction equipment salesman and then striking out into self-employment. Coincidentally, Shute was backed by Beazer when he set up in business. But that was long before Woolley's involvement in CHB and the link rather is with Matthew Thorne, BM's temporary non-executive chairman, also ex-Beazer and a friend of Woolley's on the Bristol scene. Woolley plays cricket and, golf - badly of course - and talks of balance in one's life. Shute frequently expressed contempt for executives spending time on golf courses and once said: 'If you work 16 hours a day, seven days a week, you do better than the slob who works five hours a day, three days a week.' Now, however, having taken life a bit more easily, Shute's health has improved, he has cut down on cigarettes and remains honorary president of BM.</p>

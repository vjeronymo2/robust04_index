			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> JAZZ BUTCHER BLASTS OUT GLIB, FAMILIAR SLICES OF BRITISH LIFE  </P> <P> If names told the whole story, the Jazz Butcher could be a pretty tremendous  group. Suggesting as it does the savaging of a rich and varied art form, the  title well might lead one to expect some pretty impressive rubble to be left in  this band's wake.  </P> <P> Alas, in a world where governments can't even get accurate labeling from the  food industry, it may be some time before we get around to truth-in-advertising  legislation for rock acts. At the Coach House on Sunday evening, Britain's Jazz  Butcher neither carved up the past with any particular flair nor did it create  much of anything new.  </P> <P> Singer/rhythm guitarist Pat Fish, a.k.a. the Jazz Butcher, deserves some points  for endurance: Since 1982's "A Bath in Bacon" album his act has weathered  numerous personnel changes, shrinking to a solo or duo at stages. Even the  lineup he had Sunday -- with drummer Paul Mulreany, bassist Laurence O'Keefe  and guitarist Richard Fromby -- was missing two of the participants from this  year's "Big Planet, Scarey Planet" album.  </P> <P> If Fish's music hasn't suffered overmuch from its changing players, it may be  because it might not aspire to much in the first place. To Fish's credit, the  set's 20 glibly worded songs flew fast and furious, but they didn't fly very  far, being hampered by Fish's one-dimensional voice and a song construction  that often relied on just bashing out one or two chords.  </P> <P> On certain numbers, the band was very effective within those limitations, but  spread throughout the performance, one tended to peg Fish -- despite a  winningly manic stage manner -- as a small contender in an already crowded sea.  </P> <P> Many of his songs are rooted in the vagaries of British life, but they largely  lack the insight and humanity, not to mention compositional gift, of XTC's Brit  portraits, and Fish's whimsy falls far short of Robyn Hitchcock's quirky  explorations.  </P> <P> Though diminished by the similarity of the show's material, Fish and Co. did  have some semi-splendid moments, particularly on the uproarious, frantic  one-chord rap of "Chickentown," the muscular pop of "Burglar of Love," the  humorous take on the changing East in "Moscow Drug Club" and on two songs  dating from his first album.  </P> <P> One, the updated "Sex Engine Thing," goofily posited the august members of the  Traveling Wilburys as "sex engines," while "Zombie Love" built to a  sufficiently thrashing two-chord "Pushin' Too Hard"-like finale, aided by Downy  Mildew's Charlie Baldonado on guitar.  </P> <P> Except that they might lack Fish's self-assurance, Downy Mildew, the locals who  opened the show, would be just as well placed as headliners.  </P> <P> The quartet's engaging harmonies and arrangements -- favorably recalling 10,000  Maniacs at times -- call for only a bit more drive and personality to make this  a truly potent band.  </P></p>

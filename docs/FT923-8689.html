			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Economics: Few signs yet of UK upturn ECONOMIC news in the UK gathers pace this week with data on inflation, manufacturing output, unemployment, and credit business. The figures are not expected to be particularly encouraging, so pressure on the government to find a way of easing conditions looks set to continue. Official figures on Thursday are forecast to show that output was flat in June. This follows the latest Confederation of British Industry quarterly survey, which indicated that the number of firms expecting higher output over the next four months fell sharply in July compared with May. The Central Statistical Office's index of manufacturing output rose for three consecutive months at the beginning of the year - leading to suggestions that manufacturing output had 'bottomed out' in the first quarter - but disappointed expectations by falling in April and May. Unemployment figures are expected to show another rise, although in June the jobless total rose by a smaller than expected 7,000. The small drop was probably erratic, as there are few signs in the real economy to suggest that such a slowdown in unemployment growth is sustainable. The following include some of the other economic highlights of the week, with the median of economists' forecasts in brackets from MMS International, a financial information company. Today: UK, June credit business (Pounds 23m net repayment). Canada, June car sales (up 0.5 per cent).

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zhang Shulin (1728 2579 2651) and </F> XINHUA reporter Xu Jinpeng (1776 6855 7720)]    [Text] Haikou, 17 May (XINHUA) -- At the Haikou annual  meeting of the China Economic Restructuring Research Society  which opened today, Li Tieying, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau, state councilor, and minister in  charge of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring,  stressed: China's economic reform has entered the stage in which  a completely new system should be built. Only by arming our  minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and by studying the theory in depth  can we adhere to the correct course of reform, opening up, and  modernization; can we speed up the process of building a new  system; and can we take advantage of the current opportunity to  enable the economy to develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy  manner.    Li Tieying said: Since the 14th CPC National Congress,  especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee made the decision on some problems concerning  building a socialist market economic system, reform of China's  economic system, figuratively speaking, has shifted from  dismantling the old house to building a new mansion. The  thoroughgoing changes in the entire process of reform have been  demonstrated in all major spheres of reform-- microeconomic  reform has begun to shift from readjusting the policy of  reducing enterprises' tax payment and allowing them to retain a  bigger share of profits to building a complete new system; price  reform has begun to shift from decontrolling commodity prices to  letting prices of production factors be decided by the market;  building of the market system has begun to shift from developing  markets of key commodities to developing selective markets of  production factors; macroeconomic regulation and control has  begun to shift from mainly relying on administrative means to  mainly relying on economic, legal, and necessary administrative  means, and has entered an in-depth reform stage of straightening  out the basic economic relationships (including relationships  between the state and enterprises and between the central and  local authorities). Judging from both the scope and depth of  reform, this year's reform measures are unprecedented.  Currently, the State Council and all localities are endeavoring  to transform state-owned enterprises' operating mechanisms and  to experiment with building a modern enterprise system.  Implementation of the macroeconomic measures for reforming the  financial, taxation, foreign exchange systems has been smooth in  general -- this shows that China has made an important step  toward building a socialist market economic system.    Li Tieying pointed out: There are a number of problems  pending for solution in the economic life and reform of the  economic system. Basically speaking, these problems are related  to the failure to shift fundamentally the operating mechanisms  of enterprises; to the lack of intensity to reform the system of  property rights and to set up a new enterprise system; and to  the slow progress in changing government functions in economic  management and in establishing a social security system. He  said: In a sense, the difficult and crucial spots in economic  development are essentially the focal points of reform. To  seize the opportunity for development means to seize the  opportunity to reform. Reform aims to solve various structural  defects impeding economic growth and, therefore, to liberate and  expand productivity. Herein lies the profound significance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remark that "we should undertake reforms  as the second Chinese revolution."    Li Tieying said: The experiences of reform and opening up  over the past 15 years, to put in a nutshell, are: under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory, we have charted a  course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In  the past 15 years, while establishing a new socialist market  economic structure, we have also set up a new theoretical  system, which is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. Deng Xiaoping's concept  of economic affairs is a major component of his theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theses on economic development, economic reform, and  stability being the prerequisite for development and reform are  the theoretical foundations and action guidelines in promoting  reform and the modernization drive; it is a farsighted summation  of the practical experiences in continually deepening reforms.  Comrades in the economic restructuring front are duty bound to  arm their minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of economic  affairs and to use it to guide practical work of reform as this  is an important guarantee for smoothly promoting reform. The  greatness of Deng Xiaoping's concept of economic affairs lies in  its practicality. We must strive to translate this scientific  concept into practical work. This is the fundamental objective  of studying and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of economic  affairs.    In the light of realities in the current economic reform and  economic development, Li Tieying put forth five tasks:  Straightening out the relationship of state-owned enterprises'  property rights and pushing for the establishment of a modern  enterprise in a down-to-earth manner; cultivating the market  system and developing intermediate organizations of market in  keeping with the needs of economic development; effectively  overcoming major ups and downs in economic development and  achieving a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy; stabilizing grain and cotton production,  harnessing farmers' enthusiasm, and properly resettling surplus  rural laborers; and correctly handling the relationship between  reform, development, and stability under the new situation. He  urged comrades in the economic restructuring front to heighten  their spirits, emancipate their minds, and guided by Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's concept of economic affairs, go deep into  realities to conduct investigations, obtain firsthand  information, work out measures, and make fresh contributions to  the establishment of the new system.</p>

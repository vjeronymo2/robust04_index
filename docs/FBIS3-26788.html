			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, February 14 (XINHUA) -- NATO's ultimatum to  Bosnian warring sides "will not be prolonged for a single day,"  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said on Television France  2 Monday [14 February] evening.    On February 9, the 16 countries of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO) passed an ultimatum demanding the warring  parties in Bosnia to lift the siege of Sarajevo and withdraw or  put under UN control all the heavy weapons within a 20-kilometer  range of the city before a 10-day deadline.    NATO will launch air strikes on the mortar positions that do  not respect the ultimatum.    Balladur hoped that the Bosnian warring sides would conform  to NATO's demand and "return to the negotiating table."    "If they don't," he stressed, "it goes without saying that  what has been said will be done."    Balladur said that his government was deeply concerned with  the situation of the French peace-keeping troops in Bosnia, who  are on an "extremely dangerous" humanitarian mission.    He said that the government would "take every measure to  ensure their security."    The latest statistics showed that by February 1 this year, a  total of 10,760 soldiers of the UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR)  were stationed in Bosnia, 4,077 of whom were French.    Balladur said that France accounts for the largest share in  the UNPROFOR but it would be "meaningless" for them to continue  their presence if the fightings there "should go on for five,  ten or even 15 years."</p>

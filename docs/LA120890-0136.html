			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RECRUITERS FIND SCHOOLS AREN'T AT THEIR SERVICE;  </P> <P> ENLISTMENT: STUDENTS IN RICH DISTRICTS, WITH SIGHTS SET ELSEWHERE, ARE  VIRTUALLY UNTOUCHABLE FOR THE MILITARY.  </P> <P> A high school senior, Tim Gibson has his sights set on an academic scholarship  to New York University, where he hopes the school's business program will turn  him into a wealthy stockbroker.  </P> <P> Tony Mancuso, a junior fullback and nose tackle, dreams of someday winning a  place in the tradition-rich football backfield at USC or UCLA.  </P> <P> Both Newport Harbor High School students, Gibson and Mancuso represent the  hopes and dreams of most young people. But for military recruiters, these  students and other products of schools in wealthy Orange County beach  communities are virtually untouchable in the hunt to fill out the military's  volunteer forces.  </P> <P> Students in these areas come mostly from well-to-do backgrounds where the  median household income is more than $60,000 per year and enlisted military  service often is not even considered an option. In good years, recruiters say  there is cause to celebrate if one or two students from the affluent  communities make commitments to the enlisted services.  </P> <P> By contrast, at Estancia High School in neighboring Costa Mesa, where the  median income is about $40,000, Army recruiters say they can expect seven or  more students to enlist this year. Recruiters also have a much easier time  approaching potential candidates in even less affluent cities, such as Santa  Ana.  </P> <P> The dilemma that local recruiters face takes on added significance because of  the growing controversy about the mix of U.S. troops being deployed to the  Persian Gulf. The troops going there are predominantly minorities and  less-affluent whites.  </P> <P> In upper-class communities, local recruiters say that they are resorting to  unusual methods to overcome roadblocks thrown up by uncooperative school  administrators and parents in Irvine, Corona del Mar and Newport Beach.  </P> <P> One Army officer who trains recruiters for service in the county says the  reception by school administrators in wealthy coastal schools has been so  unwelcome that he advises his recruiters to cultivate school janitors as  sources of valuable information about potential recruits.  </P> <P> "In Irvine or Corona del Mar, if a kid joins the Army he's considered a rebel,"  said Sgt. Gary Watkins of the Army's recruiting station in Santa Ana. "They are  closed. They let you know that. They look at you like you are not wanted."  </P> <P> With tensions rising in the Persian Gulf, Marine Staff Sgt. Hector Martinez  said his recruiters are encountering more parents who have carried strong  anti-war sentiments since Vietnam.  </P> <P> "The flower children," Martinez said, describing those unreceptive parents,  "they use it (Vietnam) as an excuse."  </P> <P> Chief Petty Officer Ernie Howton, who heads the Navy's recruiting station in  Costa Mesa, said the affluence and abundance of educational opportunities makes  Orange County one of the most difficult recruiting areas in the nation.  </P> <P> Nowhere within the county is it more difficult than in Newport Beach and Corona  del Mar. In these communities, Army recruiters say they take into account  student career opportunities that accompany wealth, and their recruiting goals  are actually adjusted downward.  </P> <P> For example, in Newport Beach and Corona del Mar, where the median household  income is an estimated $60,600, according to the National Planning Data Corp.,  recruiters at the Army's Costa Mesa station said their goal from those cities'  two high schools combined is to sign up three students this year.  </P> <P> School administrators at Newport Harbor High and Corona del Mar High, however,  say recruiters enjoy good access to their schools. It's only that students from  wealthier communities tend to have more options open to them after high school  and enlisted military service is not at the top of their lists, they say.  </P> <P> "I think kids ought to do what they want to do," said Tom Jacobson, principal  at Corona del Mar High. "But I think it is fair to say that school communities  in Corona del Mar or Newport Beach probably don't view military service as  their goal. Some 90% of our kids go on to post-secondary education."  </P> <P> While interest in the enlisted ranks may be down among his students, Jacobson  said some have sought places in the military service academies.  </P> <P> Aside from the actual number of enlistments, recruiters say another measure  they use for student interest in the military each year is the number of young  men and women who take the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, or  qualifying exam.  </P> <P> This year at Newport Harbor High (enrollment 1,250) and Corona del Mar High  (enrollment 1,169), a total of 83 students took the exam. Across town, more  than 200 students took the test at Costa Mesa High School, enrollment 980.  </P> <P> Some recruiters who make more than 70 telephone calls a day to the homes of  prospective enlisted men and women are frustrated, especially by the responses  they say come from parents in the county's more affluent areas.  </P> <P> "If I wanted my son in the Army, I'd buy him one," said Watkins, quoting the  recent reaction of one parent to a recruiter's call. "The people are very  adamant. They say, 'Don't call back here.'  </P> <P> "They'll give you a dissertation and tell you that it (Vietnam) was an unjust  war. These are the people who tell you, 'Not my son. My son is going to  Berkeley.' "  </P> <P> The same message is communicated on the high school campuses.  </P> <P> "No, thanks," Tim Gibson said when asked about his prospects for enlistment  from Newport Harbor High. "I'm trying for a scholarship, academic or football.  There's no way I'd do it."  </P> <P> Tony Mancuso, whose pursuit of college sports is pushing him on to college,  said most of his classmates are on similar career paths.  </P> <P> "They would rather do other things," he said, sitting outside school on a  recent evening, waiting for a ride home.  </P> <P> Army Staff Sgt. Benjamin Guzman said that sometimes the negative responses to  his inquiries come with a figurative kick in the pants.  </P> <P> Last year, he said, a display of brochures at Corona del Mar High promoting  service in all branches of the military was sabotaged when flyers from an  anti-war group based in Philadelphia were found stuffed inside the government  information.  </P> <P> Guzman said the same high school turned down the Army's invitation for its  teachers to join recruiters for a catered lunch so that enlisted military  service opportunities for students could be discussed.  </P> <P> Jacobson said the incident with the flyers was not reported to him, but he  indicated that it could have happened, given the diverse interests of student  groups, some of which are unknown to him.  </P> <P> As for the lunch, Jacobson said the school receives frequent invitations to  similar events.  </P> <P> "We make a lot of choices," Jacobson said. "Some things just don't get done. We  don't appear at everything. Teachers teach all day long."  </P> <P> Dennis Evans, Newport Harbor High principal, said his school has done all it  can to cooperate with military recruiters. He said the root of the military's  dissatisfaction probably lies in Newport Mesa Unified School District's refusal  to turn over the names, addresses and phone numbers of its graduating seniors.  </P> <P> Although recruiters say other districts provide the valuable information in  various forms, Evans said the district has discontinued the practice at the  urging of parents, who began complaining about the influx of telephone calls  and junk mail to their homes from several sources.  </P> <P> "We don't treat the military any different than we do people from Princeton or  Stanford," Evans said. "The military is treated exactly the same. Military  recruiters would love for us to provide them the data. It makes their work a  little more difficult. We won't give that list to anybody."  </P> <P> On other local campuses, particularly in areas where the household incomes are  not as high, recruiters say they are warmly received.  </P> <P> On a recent trip to neighboring Costa Mesa High, where students come from more  middle-class backgrounds, Guzman's visit began with a chat with a school  guidance counselor who had nothing but praise for the opportunities enlisted  military service offers.  </P> <P> "College is a status symbol," said the counselor, who declined to be named.  "Parents project them (children) into four-year colleges. They think their kids  deserve much better than military service. Some could benefit from the  discipline the military service has to offer."  </P></p>

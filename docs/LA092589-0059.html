			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR AUNESE TO BE HELD AT COLORADO TODAY  </P> <P> A memorial service is scheduled on campus today for former University of  Colorado and Vista quarterback Sal Aunese, who died Saturday following a  six-month battle with inoperable stomach cancer.  </P> <P> Aunese, 21, the honorary Colorado football captain whose struggle with cancer  helped inspire his teammates to three consecutive victories this season, was  admitted to University Hospital in Denver a week ago with breathing problems.  </P> <P> "Sal Aunese was a special young man who fought a brave battle," Colorado  chancellor Jim Corbridge said. "We're all very proud that he was one of our  students."  </P> <P> "He was not only a fine athlete, but he was as nice a young man as you'll ever  want to meet," said Marie Romero, president of the Parent Teacher Association  at Vista High, where Aunese led the football team to a perfect record and a  section championship in 1985. "When he got sick, it hit us like a two-by-four  hit across the back.  </P> <P> "It will be hard for the town to get over this."  </P></p>

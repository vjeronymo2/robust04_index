			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT  </P> <P> ABC's Zahn Bids Adieu: Kathleen Sullivan has been notified that today will be  her last day as anchor on "CBS This Morning," even though Paula Zahn still has  not been officially signed as her replacement. Zahn, news anchor on ABC's "Good  Morning America," said goodby on the air on Thursday.  </P> <P> "I have a wonderful opportunity to go into," Zahn told viewers. "The details  are being worked out at this moment so we can't really talk specifically what  they are about." CBS' official announcement of the signing of Zahn -- at an  estimated $1-million salary -- has been delayed by the formality of ABC's  contractual option to make a matching counteroffer. Sources said that ABC was  unlikely to match CBS' offer, but Zahn's hiring by CBS has been held up because  ABC News executives have been in South Africa. Faith Daniels will be the  substitute host on "CBS This Morning" next week. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Heavy truck sales show recovery THE FIRST sign of recovery in the UK new vehicle market emerged last month with a rise in sales of heavy trucks, the first monthly year-on-year increase since September 1989. The commercial vehicle sector is a significant economic barometer, with vehicles going to many sectors from retail distribution to construction. While new registrations at the light end of the commercial vehicle market, led by sales of small vans, continued to fall heavily in March - in line with the continuing decline in the car market - registrations of trucks above 15 tonnes last month were 18 per cent higher than a year ago. As a result, heavy truck sales for the first three months, at 4,250, showed a year-on-year increase of 2.7 per cent. Truck makers have suffered their steepest decline of the post-war period with sales falling last year to the lowest level since 1954. In part, heavy truck sales last month were artificially inflated by a change in safety regulations, with mandatory fitting of anti-lock braking systems from April 1 pulling some registrations forward into March, but heavy truck makers insisted yesterday that the market had bottomed out. 'The market (for heavy tractors and articulated trucks) stopped falling in the last two months of last year and there is now an upward trend,' said Mr David Thomas, director of the truck division of Mercedes-Benz (United Kingdom). Mr Dieter Merz, managing director of Scania (Great Britain), UK subsidiary of the Swedish heavy truck maker, said 'generally we are seeing a trend that the market is stabilising at a low level. 'I am confident that the market is moving up slowly. Fleet operators that have delayed replacing vehicles for two years can hold off no longer.' The rise in demand is coming from the medium and long range distribution sectors, including sectors such as the oil industry, where safety regulations limit the age of trucks in service. Sales to the construction industry remain very depressed. Commercial sales down, Page 10</p>

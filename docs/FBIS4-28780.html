			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand and Cambodia intend to speed up the  establishment of the Mekong Committee after it has laid dormant  for nearly two decades because of political instability in  Cambodia, according to the Foreign Ministry.    A statement released following a 45-minute meeting between  visiting Cambodian Minister of Public Works and Transport Ing  Kiet and Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday morning said  Thailand and Cambodia agreed to the importance and benefits of  the early establishment of the Mekong Committee.    Both countries are also open to other Mekong countries --  China, which is the source of the Mekong River, and Burma  joining the Mekong Committee after it is set up officially.    Cambodia officially rejoined the three other riparian  countries Thailand, Vietnam and Laos in their efforts to work  out common grounds for the use of the river in February 1993.    The four countries said a common framework would be  completed  within a year with each country setting up a working group to  draft the framework with the United Nations Development  Programme serving as coordinator.    Sources said an agreement had still not been reached on the  sensitive issue of the use of the water in the Mekong River.  Ing Kiet, the chairman of Cambodia's Mekong Committee, said  after meeting Science, Technology and Environment Minister  Phisan Munlasatsathon on Friday that Cambodia was open to other  countries joining the committee after a framework on the use of  the Mekong is completed.    "As soon as our authority finds a solution acceptable to all  four governments, why not expand the committee to outside  countries. We are open to that," he said.    Ing Kieth is on a five-day official visit to Bangkok, Nong  Khai and Maha Sarakham as guest of the Science, Technology and  Environment Ministry.    He is scheduled to leave Bangkok today.    Bilateral cooperation and the current political situation in  Cambodia were also raised during the meeting with Sqn Ldr  [Squadron Leader] Prasong.    The two ministers expressed the hope that tomorrow's talks  between government and Khmer Rouge representatives in Phnom Penh  would be successful.    Both agree the development of Cambodia and support for the  prosperity ot the Cambodian people are important to bringing  about peace and prosperity in the region as a whole.    Thailand could cooperate with its neighbour in the area of  infrastructure development and energy.</p>

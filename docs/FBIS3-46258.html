With a  total investment estimated at greater than 5 billion yuan, the  project is the largest joint venture in Shenzhen. On 5 October  1993, Premier Li Peng met with Li Ka-shing, the richest person  in Hong Kong and the president of Hutchison-Whampoa Ltd. Li  Ka-shing was attending a signing ceremony in Beijing for the  project. Premier Li Peng said during the meeting: China faces  an increasing demand for transportation as its economy develops  further, its door opens wider, and its foreign economic and  trade activities increase. The mainland's use of foreign funds  has been expanded to include the area of infrastructure,  including ports, railroads, airports, and power stations.    Premier Li Peng's remarks have summed up from another angle  the trend of Hong Kong businessmen's investment in the mainland.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / How To Spend It: Dino II fits the bill WAY BACK in 1963, when Aram Designs was about the only place in England where you could find truly contemporary furniture and when the very first Habitat was thrilling its new customers in London's Fulham Road, Zeev Aram designed a multi-purpose storage system called Dino. Those were the days when flexible storage systems were concentrating the minds of many of the design gurus of the day. Most of the systems that emerged were too clever by half. So multifarious were the options, so infinite the possibilities, that most of us gave up working out the permutations, waved a hand at something simpler and said 'We'll take that.' Dino, though, was different. True, it needed a greater mind than mine to cope with all the measuring-up and fiddling about, but its essence was engagingly simple. A system of beechwood uprights set 3 ft apart with grooves cut at 3 in intervals along both sides formed the framework. Into the grooves could be fitted four sizes of storage boxes and drawers, four sizes of cupboard doors, writing tables, bunk beds and kitchen units. It could be used in the kitchen, study, sitting-room, bathroom, bedroom . . . almost anywhere. And on top of all that, it looked very attractive, too. Its attractiveness became part of the problem. The range was so wide that the manufacturers found it impossible to cope with the range of products and when Aram Designs moved from its Kings Road site to Covent Garden, the system was discontinued. However, round about the time that Dino was launched a small boy called Jasper Morrison was born who grew up to be a designer. He had been aware of Dino most of his life. 'It was,' he says, 'a design far ahead of its time. I always loved it but felt it could be made simpler to make it more accessible.' Twenty years after it was discontinued Jasper Morrison suggested to Zeev Aram that Dino be re-edited, updated and re-introduced. Dino Mark II, pictured below left, is the result. The look has been retained - uprights with grooves to take the shelves are its essence - but it has been greatly simplified. It is now primarily a shelving system (no bunk beds, cupboards, kitchen cabinets and the rest) with two different heights: 1100 mm and 2060 mm. The width from centre to centre is 900 mm, the depth 330 mm. There are also storage boxes in two depths which also fit into the uprights. Height and width can be altered by simply cutting the uprights or the shelves to the size required. The shelving could therefore usefully be used in a room with a sloping ceiling, with each upright cut to fit. The uprights and shelving are made of MDF (a new improved and strengthened medium density fibreboard) while the tray and drawers are in solid beech. Whereas the old system had to be clipped to the wall Jasper Morrison has made the new one free-standing using aluminium bracing to stabilise it. Though the system is officially easy to assemble with the help of a screwdriver, those for whom the letters 'DIY' strike terror into the heart can take advantage of Aram Designs' installation service. The design is just as pleasing to look at after all these years. The distinctive crenallated edges are still there but the overwhelming impression is of shelving that is simple but not stark. Warm, useful and, above all, flexible, it is the sort of storage that almost every house could do with. Tall uprights are Pounds 76 each, low ones Pounds 46, base shelves, Pounds 15, single shallow drawers are Pounds 54 in solid beech, Pounds 33 in MDF, single deep drawers are Pounds 66 in solid beech and Pounds 45 in MDF. The system is on display at Aram Designs at 3 Kean Street, Covent Garden, London WC2B 4AT and 65 Heath Street, Hampstead, London NW3. Aram Designs also has an explanatory leaflet which it will send on request.</p>

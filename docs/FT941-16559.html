			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Trade negotiators face hectic three months: Structure of the World Trade Organisation must be agreed Although the Uruguay Round of global trade talks formally ended on December 15, trade negotiators returning to Geneva this week after the Christmas break have a busy agenda in prospect. In the next three months they must decide on the structure, membership and work programme of the World Trade Organisation, the body which will police fair trade rules and implement the results of the Round. Recommendations will be put to ministers when they meet in Marrakesh on April 12-15 to sign the Uruguay Round accords. It is already accepted that work on the link between trade and the environment will feature strongly in the work programme. But the nature of that work has yet to be agreed and big differences remain between rich nations and poorer countries who fear environmental concerns will be used as a pretext for trade protection. Other issues jostling for the WTO's attention, such as competition policy, worker rights and currency movements, are also likely to be contentious. Ministers will also be asked to approve transitional institutional arrangements for transforming the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade into the WTO, which will come into effect with the rest of the Uruguay Round by July 1995. These arrangements, which are likely to include the setting up of an interim committee for the WTO, will mean more staff and money, but Gatt officials insist extra demands will be modest. In addition, ministers must decide on WTO membership and, in particular, what to do about countries applying to join Gatt which want to become original members of the WTO. Of these, the most important by far is China. Trade officials will also be using the coming weeks to complete country tariff schedules. For most countries this will simply be a matter of formalising what has already been negotiated, but substantive talks are continuing on textiles tariffs and between the European Union and Latin American banana exporters. Countries have until February 15, when all draft final tariff schedules must be in, to negotiate improved offers. But they cannot withdraw concessions already made unless trading partners fail to deliver their part of the bargain. Meanwhile, the Gatt secretariat has until the end of March to check the tariff and services schedules for consistency, and tidy up the Uruguay Round texts ready for endorsement in Marrakesh. Trade negotiators must also try to reach agreement in several areas where they failed to meet the December deadline. The most pressing is completion of talks on a Multilateral Steel Agreement, which the US would like to tie up before April. A renewed attempt to agree a revised Gatt code on subsidies for civil aircraft is planned to conclude by the end of this year. Talks on liberalising trade in four key services sectors will also continue this year. Negotiations on financial services will kick off later this month when the US and Japan hold talks under their bilateral negotiating framework. Negotiations on labour services, shipping and basic telecommunications are due to start within a month of the Marrakesh meeting. Talks on financial and labour services must conclude in 1995 but those on shipping and telecommunications will run into 1996. Finally, just to ensure that trade officials are not left twiddling their thumbs, a new set of negotiations is already programmed for the start of the WTO in 1995. To take just one example, the Uruguay Round commits countries to initiate work on common standards for professional services, beginning with accountancy.</p>

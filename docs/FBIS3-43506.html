Speaking to newsmen, Mr. Robaina said  Cuba will survive the U.S. trade embargo imposed on her despite  the current difficulties she is facing. He said in spite of the  sanctions, basic social services such as health delivery,  education, and transport continue to operate normally.    The foreign minister, whose visit is the first to Africa  since he was appointed nine months ago, said Cuba has had to  face the difficulties with a lot of hard work. He said the  efforts and sacrifices of Cubans over the years have started  yielding positive results.    Mr. Robaina said the existing bonds of friendship between  Cuba and Ghana are very healthy and that he is here to put  Cuba's case across. He said what Cuba expects from Ghana now is  an increase in the level of cooperation in all areas of mutual  interest.    On Cuba's foreign policy, Mr. Robaina said his government is  taking steps to adopt a new policy to meet the changing times.  The delegation was met on arrival by the foreign minister and  acting attorney general, Dr. Obed Asamoah. From Ghana, it will  go on to Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola, and Namibia.</p>

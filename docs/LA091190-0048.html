			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> FESTIVAL SCREEN HIGHLIGHTS  </P> <P> Following are reviews of highlights of screenings in the Los Angeles Festival  today and Wednesday:  </P> <P> Today  </P> <P> The Elephant Keeper  </P> <P> Thailand  </P> <P> Screens at 8 p.m., Los Feliz Theater, 1822 N. Vermont Ave.  </P> <P>  Tedious, interminable, needlessly repetitive Thai film protesting the  decimation of the country's magnificent teak forest and centering on a man, an  elephant keeper, seeking to survive this destruction. Prince Chatri Chalerm  Yukol brings considerable polish and technical finesse to his film, but the  urgency of its theme is dissipated by its sheer ponderousness. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

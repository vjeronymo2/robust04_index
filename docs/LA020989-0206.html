			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> INDIA TARGETS ELUSIVE CARBIDE FIGURE  </P> <P> A court today declared Warren Anderson, the former chairman of Union Carbide  Corp., an "absconding offender" in an effort to extradite him from the United  States to face charges in the Bhopal gas leak, the world's worst industrial  disaster, in which more than 2,000 people died.  </P> <P> Chief Judicial Magistrate R. C. Mishra issued a warrant last Nov. 15 for  Anderson's arrest to answer homicide charges filed by the Indian government.  Repeated summons have failed to bring Anderson to Bhopal, Indian government  counsel U. S. Prasad told Mishra in requesting the former executive be declared  an absconder. Mishra granted the request, which is designed to make it easier  for the Indian government to initiate extradition proceedings. India and the  United States do not have an extradition treaty, but individual extraditions  are possible.  </P></p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Demergers replace the buy-outs: Nikki Tait analyses the rise of the latest US boardroom favourite No one could claim that merger and acquisition work is booming in the US. Leveraged buy-outs have ground to a near-halt, and there has been only one acquisition of more than Dollars 1bn this year. But what about 'demergers'? Last week, Ralston Purina, the St Louis-based consumer products company with interests ranging from dry-cell batteries to pet food, announced the possible spin-off of its baking subsidiary, Continental Baking Company, to existing shareholders. This is the nation's largest wholesale baker, and the division's near-Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in annual sales derives from such standard household fare as Wonder bread and Twinkies cupcakes. The business was bought for Dollars 475m in 1984, and its likely divestiture will probably involve a Dollars 600m dividend payment from Continental to Ralston. That, in turn, has spurred thoughts that the consumer products group - which has just bought Ever Ready in the UK from Hanson - may be planning further acquisitions. Even if the transaction is approved by Ralston's board this month, it will take months to complete. Nevertheless, Ralston does not seem to be the only company taking advantage of the demerger concept. Only a few weeks ago, for example, Dial Corporation, another consumer products conglomerate, spun off its sizeable financial services division as an independently quoted company. And a mere 24 hours before the Ralston news, Union Carbide, the chemicals group, confirmed that a demerger of its industrial gases business should be complete by the end of the second quarter. A few swallows do not make a summer, but figures from Securities Data, which tracks deal activity generally, confirm - at least, tentatively - that 'demerger' interest is on the rise. In the first quarter of 1992, the firm calculates that 13 demerger deals were announced. This contrasts sharply with the six or seven demerger proposals unveiled in each of the five preceding quarters. In fact, activity in the first quarter of 1992 represents a return to levels last seen during the first nine months of 1990. Then, there were 17 demergers announced in the first quarter, 13 in the second and 19 in the third. In one sense, the timing of this rise in demerger activity is surprising. Demergers have often been seen as a defensive reaction to hostile bid activity or shareholder agitation. Perhaps the best recent example would be USX, the large steel and energy group which split these two activities into separately quoted companies - US Steel and Marathon - under dogged pressure from Mr Carl Icahn, the corporate raider. Today, although shareholders' grievances are still being voiced, they are more likely to come from institutional investors than from buccaneering bidders with fistfuls of threatening cash. Hostile bids have largely disappeared. However, in other respects, the modest rebirth in demergers may be more explicable. Usually, the aim of the demerger is to rid a diversified group of a lowly rated subsidiary, and hence improve the stock-market image of the remaining business. Companies contemplating such a move invariably talk of 'enhancing shareholder value'. With Wall Street at record levels, and some trade buyers facing financing problems, divestiture by means of a demerger may begin to look more attractive than the conventional sale route. Certainly, it spares management any criticism that a business - which itself may not be in the best of health - has been undersold during a recessionary credit crunch. Even so, choosing between a demerger and a trade sale is rarely easy. For example, Mr John Teets, chairman of Dial, admits that the decision over how to handle the group's transport manufacturing business - also up for divestiture - is more finely balanced than the earlier election to demerge the finance arm. 'A spin-off is much more complicated than a sale,' he notes. 'The business has to stand alone, on a credit rating which is at least triple-B. It must have the ability to offer performance bonds on contracts it bids for. And it must have a cash-flow and earnings record that's going to be recognised on Wall Street.' The real test of any demerger, of course, is whether shareholder value is, indeed, created - and, as no one can ever judge how shares in an 'undemerged' company would have fared, any judgment tends to be subjective. But the process is certainly not a guaranteed winner. Mr Icahn's punt on USX, for example, ended with the sale of his 13.3 per cent stake only eight days after the stock spilt at the equivalent of Dollars 30 per old USX share. The tycoon had bought the stake up to five years earlier, at an average price of Dollars 24. His return significantly underperformed that of the US stockmarket generally. Still, Mr Icahn may have been wise to get out when he did. Since just before the stake sale in May 1991, USX-US Steel shares have eased from Dollars 25 3/4 to Dollars 24 3/4 and USX-Marathon shares have fallen from Dollars 26 1/4 to Dollars 21 1/2 . So, in share price terms and even allowing for recession, the demerger has scarcely been a startling success. However, if the long-term impact is sometimes debatable, the immediate reaction may be more positive. Ralston, whose bakery business operates in a mature market and has suffered profit pressure recently, had the satisfaction of seeing its shares gain Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 48 1/2 last week, after the news was announced.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPLETED SPIN-OFFS TO SHAREHOLDERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Value Dollarsm          Number of Deals  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Q1 1990                 1,300.0                  7 Q2 1990                 1,780.5                  4 Q3 1990                   111.9                  7 Q4 1990                 1,946.6                 10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Q1 1991                   347.8                  2 Q2 1991                 3,103.7                  4 Q3 1991                   453.0                  5 Q4 1991                   564.4                  4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Q1 1992                   441.7                  1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Securities Data  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

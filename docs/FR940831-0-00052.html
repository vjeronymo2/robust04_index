Your claim must contain information that will enable us to determine if we did provide misinformation to you about your eligibility for SSI benefits, or the eligibility of a person on whose behalf you were considering applying for benefits, which caused you not to file an application for the benefits. Specifically, your claim must be in writing and it must explain what information was provided; how, when, and where it was provided and by whom; and why the information caused you not to file an application. If you give us this information, we will make a determination on such a claim for benefits if all of the following conditions are also met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) An application for the benefits described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(2)(i) of this section is filed with us by someone described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section, as appropriate.

This application may be_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) An application on which we have made a previous final determination or decision awarding the benefits, but only if the claimant continues to be eligible for benefits (or again could be eligible for benefits) based on that application;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) An application on which we have made a previous final determination or decision denying the benefits, but only if such determination or decision is reopened under &sect;416.1488; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A new application on which we have not made a final determination or decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The establishment of a deemed filing date of an application for benefits based on misinformation could result in the claimant becoming eligible for benefits or for additional benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

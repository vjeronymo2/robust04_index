			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Think-tank calls for farming 'safety net' Agricultural subsidies to farmers in the European Union should be phased out and replaced by a 'safety net' of social and environmental payments in rural areas, the Royal Institute of International Affairs will recommend this week. The radical proposals from the Chatham House think-tank are the latest in a groundswell of pressure for further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, intensified by the proposed entry of east European countries into the EU. In a 10-point programme of reform to be unveiled in Brussels on Thursday, the institute calls for a comprehensive policy for rural development to replace the CAP and take on a comparable political importance. It says this would involve 'organisational changes' in the European Commission and the Council of Ministers - a hint that farm policy would be better dictated in future by a wider range of ministers than just agriculture ministers. The institute says the difficult negotiations leading to the MacSharry reforms of 1992 left European agriculture ministers reluctant to embark on further big changes. But it says the reform process is incomplete and further change is needed 'sooner rather than later' to address the integration of eastern Europe, with its vast agricultural potential. The report, based on eight months of deliberations by European policymakers and agricultural experts, is designed to coincide with the arrival of the new Commission next year. It recommends that support prices for all CAP products be cut to near world market levels over a period of five to seven years and border tariffs should be correspondingly lowered. Existing compensation paid to farmers for price cuts should be phased out, while compensation for reductions in support prices in as yet unreformed sectors, such as sugar, should not be related in any way to output levels in order to discourage overproduction. It should also carry specific time limits. The institute wants production quotas for sugar and milk to be transferable across borders in the short term, and to be eliminated in the long term. By contrast, payments for adopting environmentally-friendly practices should be available to all farmers. It calls for member states to have greater freedom to introduce social and environmental schemes provided these are strictly controlled by the EU to prevent unfair competition. The extent of EU financing for such programmes should vary according to member states' ability to pay - a policy designed to promote social cohesion within the EU. The report says: 'Adopting such a programme would leave the EU with an agricultural support system which protects the farmer from market collapse but serves only as a safety net. 'It would facilitate the entry into the union of the countries of central and eastern Europe without unacceptable budgetary cost . . . Above all it would allow the EU to develop rural policies which were more closely attuned to the social and environmental objectives of the union.' Sir Michael Franklin, chairman of the European research programme and co-author of the report, said: 'We're clear the best route is through a carefully-constructed programme over several years to minimise disruption and give investors and farmers a greater degree of confidence and certainty on which to base their plans.'

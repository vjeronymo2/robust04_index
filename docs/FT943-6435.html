			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Zurich Alusuisse, the aluminium, chemicals and packaging company, is holding a news conference on 1994 business developments on Tuesday and Ciba, the pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, reports first-half results on Wednesday. Brokers say the two stocks could well provide the market with some positive news, helping to lift some of the gloom cast by the disappointing mid-term results in the banking sector. SBC and UBS are holding press conferences on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.</p>

The results of the 1993 survey came just two days after  Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton met  in Washington but failed to find a breakthrough in stalled  "framework" trade talks over a U.S. demand for setting  "numerical targets" to assess the openness of Japan's markets.    The survey found 76.3 percent of respondents said they feel  emotionally attached to the U.S., up 2.6 percentage points from  a similar study two years ago.    The Prime Minister's Office conducted the nationwide survey  from last September through October covering 3,000 people aged  20 years or older, of which 2,134 or 71.1 percent responded.  The poll has been taken annually since 1977.    An official of the government office attributed the slight  rise in the figure to Clinton's pursuit of "change" in his  nation and his fresh image, characteristics shared by Hosokawa.    The report also showed 68.6 percent see Japan-U.S. relations  as favorable, up 6.1 points.    On the bilateral trade dispute, those believing the recent  tough U.S. trade stance against Japan is understandable grew  6.3 points to 36.8 percent.    In contrast, those who believe Washington has been acting  emotionally on the trade row with Tokyo amounted to 35.2  percent, down 7.2 points, according to the study.    The latest report said those feeling emotionally attached to  Russia dropped 4.2 points to 11.0 percent, while those who do  not feel close to Russia increased 5.2 points to 84.8 percent.    The survey also found that people's feelings of closeness to  two major neighbors -- China and South Korea -- remained almost  static.    On the other hand, those citing Asia as the region to which  Tokyo should most channel its economic assistance leaped 4.9  points to 54.5 percent, according to the report.    The study also revealed that 43.8 percent of the respondents  believe Japan, as a member of the region, should promote  economic cooperation with Asia-Pacific countries.    Those saying the current level of assistance to developing  nations is sufficient, however, inched up 0.5 point to 45.6  percent, while those seeking more active cooperation fell 2.6  points to 32.6 percent. People seeing no need for such aid rose  0.9 point to 12.1 percent.    The official of the Prime Minister's Office said the  languishing economy was a major factor for the increasingly  tight-fisted sentiment in Japan.    The report found 45.7 percent believe Japan should  internationalize itself to fulfill its duty as a major global  power, compared with the 44.1 percent posted in the last survey.    In response to a newly introduced question on which area  Japan should internationalize itself most, 25.3 percent said the  nation needs to pursue a greater political role -- through the  expansion of its participation in the United Nations and  disarmament efforts.    Concerning Japan's role in the international community, 48.4  percent responded their country should contribute to resolving  global problems such as environmental conservation.    Some 28.8 percent pointed to the need for personnel  contribution and participation in U.N. peacekeeping activities,  while 21.0 percent said economic assistance to developing  nations is most needed.</p>

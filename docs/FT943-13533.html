			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Shanks &amp; McEwan chiefs get Pounds 761,000 pay-off Shanks &amp; McEwan's former finance director and former chief executive, who both resigned from the Glasgow-based waste contractor unexpectedly, received a total of Pounds 761,000 in compensation payments. The payments cover Mr Roger Hewitt, the chief executive who resigned in January when the group issued a profits warning, and Mr Alastair Fowler, the finance director who resigned at the end of September. They are disclosed in the group's annual report. The company, which last month cut its dividend by 43 per cent after announcing a plunge into the red with pre-tax losses of Pounds 6m for the year to March 26, declined to identify the size of the individual payments. However, Mr David Downes, who succeeded Mr Fowler as finance director, noted that both men had three-year employment contracts. All executive directors are now on two-year contracts. According to the annual report the compensation payment includes the estimated Pounds 10,000 value of a car.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: US retailers' growth slackens LEADING US retailers blamed the severe winter weather, which affected many parts of the country last month, for a slowdown in sales growth during February. Most of the major retail chains posted increases in 'same-store sales' during the trading period, but the scale of the improvements was sharply diminished from the strong advances seen in previous months. Some comparisons were also affected by the fact that 1992 was a Leap Year, and hence February's trading last year included an extra day. "Sales of consumer products and home electronics were strong throughout the month with winter storms adversely affecting sales, particularly in apparel lines, after the holiday weekend,' said Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman of K mart. He also noted that temperatures had been 'unseasonably mild' in February 1992. At Sears, Roebuck, Mr Arthur Martinez, head of the merchandise division, said underlying sales trends remained 'encouraging'. Sears saw a 2.2 per cent advance in domestic same-store sales during the four weeks to February 27, while K mart posted a 1.1 per cent improvement for the four weeks to February 24. Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer in sales terms, saw a 6 per cent rise in same-store sales if February 29, 1992, was excluded from the comparison. With that day's trading same-store sales for the month were flat. Among the department store chains, Federated Department Stores - which takes in Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; Straus and The Bon Marche - posted a 1.4 per cent increase in same-store sales for the four weeks ended February 27; J. C. Penney managed a 4.7 per cent advance from its core department stores over the same period; and May Department Stores a 2.7 per cent improvement. Woolworth saw domestic same-store sales actually fall by 3.4 per cent.</p>

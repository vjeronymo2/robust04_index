			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> UNFULFILLED PREMISE IN 'RED EARTH, WHITE EARTH'  </P> <P> CBS' "Red Earth, White Earth," tonight at 9 p.m.(Channels 2 and 8), is  supposedly about white farmers in conflict with Native Americans over  reservation land. That's just a backdrop, however, for soap opera with a hint  of social conscience.  </P> <P> Timothy Daly is Guy Pehrsson, driving home in his Mercedes to his grandfather's  farm after a 10-year absence. Things have changed. Grandpa (Richard Farnsworth)  has had a stroke, the farm is in debt and Guy's drunken, bitter father (Ralph  Waite) is carelessly running things. His mother (Genevieve Bujold), a free  spirit and former alcoholic, has moved in with her young Indian lover Tom  (Billy Merasty) who was Guy's best friend.  </P> <P> The good cast has nowhere to go, although Farnsworth is always a pleasure and  Bujold, looking too young and fragile even without makeup to be the mother of  an adult, has some affecting moments.  </P> <P> Merasty is strong but under-used, a victim of the film's blurred emphasis.  Waite is wholly unsympathetic and Daly's role is curiously passive. He is not  directly involved in the white/Indian conflict, not even as a catalyst.  </P> <P> Dramatic tension unravels as though writer Michael DeGuzman never decided what  he was after; director David Greene is left to film a series of scenes that  trail off like a forgotten punch line.

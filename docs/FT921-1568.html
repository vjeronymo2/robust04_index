			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / New 'Magalogue' mail order catalogue MR George Davies, former head of the Next clothing chain, is to launch a new mail-order magazine next week. He calls it a 'magalogue' - a combination of magazine and catalogue, Gary Mead writes. The monthly publication will be given away free with some newspapers and will also be on sale in branches of Dillons retail newsagents. A partnership between Mr Davies and the Asda supermarket chain already sells a range of Mr Davies' clothes.</p>

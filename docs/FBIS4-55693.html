			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(gag)": "An Elite Military Brigade Is Being </F> Formed in the Czech Republic"]    [Text] Prague--Establishing the rapid deployment brigade  is one of the Czech Army's priorities. This is one of the few  development programs the military can undertake in view of the  tight budget (27 billion korunas [Kc]).    It will cost Kc800 million to establish the rapid deployment  force of 3,000 men (they will begin to fulfill their tasks on 1  July). Colonel Karel Hejzek, of the General Staff, who has been  entrusted with establishing the brigade, rejects the view that  this ambitious project, like the grandiose but unprepared plans  to professionalize the Federal Army, will also fail. He  maintains, among other things, that by yesterday, when the  recruitment centers closed, 600 reserve soldiers had signed up  for the rapid deployment force. Nevertheless, he envisages  that, after the medical examinations and psychological and  physical tests, one-third of the men will be rejected. "We are  not an institute for fallen aristocrats," says the colonel. "We  do not intend to moderate the strict selection criteria, even if  we have to begin training with less than the full complement of  personnel in the units." Until now, two-thirds of the planned  number of men have been serving in the brigade. However, if  Col. Hejzek's group were to apply the standards governing the  selection and training of the elite U.S. Army units, the public  would probably accuse it of tyrannizing people. "I am  disappointed by the physical prowess of the recruits that have  joined up," admits the colonel. The Army would like to pay the  professionals in the rapid deployment force well and also offer  them language and specialist training. The one thing that  worries the experts is the reaction of the soldiers recruited  for further service to the standard of accommodation, which does  not even reach the normal standard. There are also problems  with apartments for the families of career soldiers. Because of  this situation, very capable professionals are refusing to move  to the elite brigade's garrisons.</p>

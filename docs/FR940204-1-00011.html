Alternative Measure of Relative Scarcity and Value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Inherent in the calculation of the petroleum equivalency is a measure of the relative scarcity and value to the Nation of all electric generation fuels. This proposed rule uses a resource based measure of scarcity and value. It utilizes the estimated reserves of electric generation fuels and their rate of consumption as an estimate of each fuel's scarcity and value. Though we are confident of the soundness of this approach, we recognize that there is some support for a measure of resource scarcity and value based on its market price. The previous rule utilized this approach. It has been suggested that a BTU adjusted market price of fuel might be a more realistic and measurable reflection of the scarcity and value of electric generation fuels. Under this approach, long term price projections such as those made by the Energy Information Administration could be used instead of marginal prices to address the problems associated with frequent updating of the petroleum equivalency factor to reflect market prices. We seek comments on this alternative market price based approach as well. Comments are sought on the merits of the market price based approach and its impact on the users of the petroleum equivalency factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

DOE invites any person who has an interest in the proposed rulemaking, or who is a representative of a group or class of persons that has an interest in the proposed rulemaking, to make a request for an opportunity to make an oral presentation. Such a request should be directed to DOE at the address indicated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The person making the request should briefly describe the interest concerned and if appropriate, state why he or she is a proper representative of a group or class of persons that has such an interest, and a daytime telephone number where the requester may be contacted. Six copies of a speaker's statement should be brought to the hearing. In the event that any person wishing to testify cannot provide eight copies, alternative arrangements can be made in advance of the hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Conduct of the Hearing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOE reserves the right to select the persons to be heard at the hearing, to schedule their respective presentations, and to establish the procedures governing the conduct of the hearing. The length of each presentation may be limited, based on the number of persons requesting to be heard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A DOE official will be designated to preside at the hearing. This will not be an evidentiary or judicial-type hearing but will be conducted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553 and section 501 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, 42 U.S.C. 7191. Questions may be asked only by those conducting the hearing. At the conclusion of all initial oral statements, each person who has made an oral statement will be given the opportunity, if he or she so desires, to make a rebuttal or clarifying statement. The statements will be given in the order in which the initial statements were made and will be subject to time limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any further procedural rules needed for the proper conduct of the hearing will be announced by the presiding officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

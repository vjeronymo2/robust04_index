			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt, Zurich speculate on FOMC meeting With any decision on US interest rates from the FOMC in Washington consigned to the American afternoon, bourses could only speculate on the result, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT had its fun in the post bourse as the September bund future took a view on the Washington meeting, and jumped 44 basis points to 91.99 on the proposition that the Fed would impose a 50-point rate rise later in the US day, a forecast that was later confirmed . After a rise of just 4.30 to 2,143.14 in the Dax on the session, the post bourse saw an Ibis-indicated peak of 2,158.13 before it closed at 2,152.65. However, Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt, said there was little trading as investors bided their time ahead of the FOMC decision; short-covering, she added, took the Dax constituents up in the afternoon. Turnover rose from DM5.1bn to DM6.6bn. Schering, the pharmaceuticals group, dropped DM42.50 to DM915 as it said that two of its drugs were under examination, and regained only DM6 after hours after stating that neither were carcinogenic and calling a press conference for tomorrow morning to elaborate. Construction stocks were strong, Strabag rising DM17.50 to DM510.50 on a 20 per cent increase in orders in the first half of 1994. In chemicals, BASF rose DM4.90 to DM327.20 as its Wintershall subsidiary forecast a profit from its gas operations in 1995, a year earlier than originally planned. AMSTERDAM recovered all of Monday's losses, helped by good gains in a number of the blue chips. The AEX index improved 1.89 to 417.07. Unilever rose Fl 3.10 to Fl 199.60, a number of brokers having issued positive reports following last week's results. Among them was James Capel, which reiterated its buy recommendation and remained optimistic about earnings per share growth during 1995 and 1996. Philips and KPN also saw buying strength as they announced plans to establish a joint venture, together with Graff Pay-Per-View, of the US, to provide a new media service in Europe. Philips put on 30 cents at Fl 58.20 and KPN added 70 cents at Fl 50.50. Hunter Douglas shed Fl 1.30 to Fl 83.70 as profits were taken following its better than expected results, while Wolters Kluwer added Fl 1.50 at Fl 120.50 after announcing a 23 per cent gain in first-half profits and forecasting 20 per cent growth over the full year. MILAN returned after Monday's holiday and continued to monitor the political temperature, following last week's unexpected rise in interest rates and a weekend of meetings between coalition partners in Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government. The Comit index closed 9.72 higher at 654.15. Analysts expect the nervousness to continue, with the 1995 budget due to be presented to parliament before September 30. Among individual performances, Fiat advanced L35 to L6,385, Benetton rose L650 to L22,450 and Olivetti L75 to L2,195. ZURICH took the Frankfurt line on FOMC prospects and the SMI index rose 18.1 to 2,588.7. Roche certificates and Nestle were the most active stocks, with gains either side of 1 per cent. In banks, UBS recovered with a rise of SFr25 to SFr1,112, and SBC bearers rose SFr3 to SFr397 ahead of results which arrived after hours. However, analysts flinched when they saw the figures, which included a 63 per cent drop in first-half trading income, and said that the shares would tumble today. MADRID fell against the trend, the general index losing 1.71 at 311.18. Bonds were slightly firmer but most banks were down, with BBV off Pta45 at Pta3,040 and BCH Pta80 at Pta2,665. ADR stocks such as Endesa, Pta50 lower at Pta6,010, and Repsol, down Pta95 at Pta3,930, became less attractive as Wall Street lost its impetus late in the European day. PARIS drifted higher in a session that was characterised by a lack of corporate news. The CAC-40 index improved 5.40 to 2,012.35 in thin turnover of about FFr2bn. STOCKHOLM staged a modest recovery as the market reversed three days of losses. Ericsson, the telecommunications group, provided the main support for the market, but shares in the forestry sector were also strong. The Affarsvarlden general index was little changed, down 0.3 at 1,400.3, in moderate turnover of SKr2.2bn. Ericsson B shares rose SKr4 to SKr393 ahead of tomorrow's six-month figures, while Electrolux lost SKr3 at SKr368 in spite of reporting an improvement in half-year results. TEL AVIV fell another 2 per cent, the Mishtanim index closing 3.74 lower at 183.40 after the Israeli finance minister Mr Avraham Shohat said Israel's 1994 inflation rate would be double digit, revising an official forecast of 8 per cent. Mr Shohat had more news for the market after hours when he proposed a capital gains tax on share profits, specifically a 10 per cent tax on real profits from share investments. He said that the market would be closed on Wednesday and Thursday to ease the way for his recommendation.

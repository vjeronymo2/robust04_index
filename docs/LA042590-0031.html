			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VISTA TO GAUGE THEATER SUPPORT  </P> <P> The Vista City Council has taken another step toward expanding its cultural  arts center by approving $15,000 to study the feasibility of raising money for  a $2-million theater in Brengle Terrace Park.  </P> <P> The Tucson-based Martin Group USA will conduct an eight-week study to "tell us  pretty concretely whether or not there is support for this proposed project,"  said Cathy Brendel, assistant director of the Parks and Community Services  Department.  </P> <P> If support for the theater in the community is found, the $15,000 study  approved Monday night will then develop a plan to raise the funds, recruiting  community leaders and corporate sponsorship.  </P> <P> "I don't think the results will stop us in going ahead to do the campaign,"  Brendel said. "But it will certainly help show us the way."  </P> <P> The direct-mail survey will provide the fund-raising campaign with a timetable,  a preliminary budget and a time frame for construction of the playhouse. The  study will also determine exactly how much the house will cost.  </P> <P> The proposed 200-seat theater is now called the Moonlight Theater but may be  changed to honor "a wonderful donor," Brendel said. The theater would provide  the only non-school, enclosed auditorium in the city and house the Moonlight  Youth Theater, which now rents school auditoriums for its performances.  </P> <P> None of the $2 million for the project would come from city funds, Brendel  said.  </P> <P> The proposed theater is part of a larger, $10-million cultural-arts center  expansion planned for Brengle Terrace Park.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Switzerland's Pirmin Zurbriggen says the outcome of the men's combined  competition at the World Alpine Ski Championships is still open.  </P> <P> But only, he might have added, if Marc Girardelli takes a wrong turn.  </P> <P> Zurbriggen, enduring a sub-par year by his standards, placed 11th in the  combined slalom Monday. Though Zurbriggen could feasibly win the gold medal,  Girardelli is in control.  </P> <P> Even the slalom winner, Norway's unheralded Ole Christian Furuseth, conceded  the combined title to Girardelli.  </P> <P> The slalom results will be paired with a downhill Friday to determine the  combined medalists, with somewhat heavier emphasis given to the downhill in  computing the final standings.  </P> <P> Girardelli, an Austrian who skis for Luxembourg, positioned himself nicely in  the slalom -- in third place. He has won three of the last four downhills on  the World Cup circuit this season.  </P> <P> Two women's training runs were canceled Monday in nearby Vail after  Switzerland's Beatrice Gafner fell coming off a jump and suffered a broken  right leg and torn knee ligaments. Officials ordered the jump to be shaved.  </P></p>

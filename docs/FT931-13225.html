			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Letter: Aiming for a known target Sir, Re your editorial, 'How to target inflation' (January 19), to be really effective, targets should be simple and easily conveyed, and the consequences of failing to meet those targets should be known in advance. This all sounds too simple for governments, but for individuals it is highly relevant. A target on earnings could be set with the conditions that, say, monetary policy will be changed in a specific way if they are breached. The condition might be that interest rates will be set at 2 per cent above average earnings figures. This is simplistic, but would be clear to negotiators, etc  -if they pushed hard for higher earnings, they would know they were directly contributing to the cause of higher rates. At present, negotiators and individuals find it all too easy to blame someone else for the problem. If people knew that higher increases in earnings would lead to higher interest rates and therefore mortgage rates and so on, they might consider whether pushing for higher settlements was worthwhile.

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Syria throws doubt on Israeli readiness to reach peace deal Syria expressed its disappointment yesterday at Israel's reaction to the summit meeting on Sunday between President Hafez al-Assad and US President Bill Clinton, and said it cast doubt on the Jewish state's willingness to make peace. After the meeting in Geneva, Mr Assad said Syria had made a strategic choice to seek peace with Israel and was ready for a full normalisation of relations with all its neighbours. 'We are surprised by the contradictory reactions in Israel,' Mr Farouq al-Shara'a, Syria's foreign minister, said on arriving in Amman to brief Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan on the outcome of the summit. 'We were expecting a big welcome to what was announced in the wake of the summit between the two presidents,' he said. 'Instead of that we are hearing statements on a referendum and demands for more. All of this makes us doubt the real intentions of the Israelis in achieving a just peace.' Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, yesterday confirmed his support for an eventual referendum on peace with Syria in what was seen as an attempt to put pressure on Damascus and win over domestic opposition ahead of peace talks which are due to resume next week. Israeli ministers, who are deeply divided on the issue, emphasised that a choice on whether to call a referendum or hold national elections on territorial concessions to Syria would only be considered once a peace agreement had been finalised and initialled. Political analysts said Mr Rabin, in raising the referendum possibility, was more concerned with sending a message to Syria that Damascus would have to be more flexible and conciliatory to win over a sceptical Israeli public. Mr Rabin, they said, was also playing a domestic political gambit to marginalise the opposition both inside and outside his Labour party, encourage the Shas party to rejoin the weak coalition and calm the 13,000 Golan settlers to enable the government to negotiate without facing a nationwide campaign against the peace talks. Mr Rabin said: 'If and when we come to a draft of a peace treaty between Syria - and it demands a painful price, perhaps beyond what the residents of Israel expect - if, I emphasise if and when, in my opinion it will have to be brought to a referendum.' President Assad has consistently demanded an Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights, and he repeated this basic objective during more than five hours of talks with Mr Clinton. The Israeli proposal for a referendum was certain to be viewed with the deepest suspicion in Damascus because it would mean that whatever deal was ultimately negotiated could be subsequently overturned. Under such a scheme, Mr Assad would be obliged to commit himself, without a parallel guarantee from Israel. Syrian officials have stressed that future negotiations with Israel, due to resume next week in Washington, would be meaningless without an understanding that Israel would acknowledge ultimate Syrian sovereignty over the Golan.</p>

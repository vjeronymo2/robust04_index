In a  statement at Larnaca Airport, Clark said that during his  presence in Cyprus he looks forward to constructive talks. He  added that it is important that everyone knows that time is  passing and that with this set of events we want to conclude an  agreement on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] as soon as  possible. And if this is not possible, we must know it as soon  as possible.    Clark said that as a practical measure we want a clear  indication by the end of the week when the UN secretary general  will submit his report to the Security Council.</p>

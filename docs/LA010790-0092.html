			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: CHEVRON HAS JUST CAUSE TO DOUBT PENNZOIL'S MOTIVES  </P> <P> Is Chevron Corp. just paranoid, or does having Pennzoil Co. as a major  stockholder really pose a threat to its independence? It turns out that its  fears could be justified -- at least if you interpret tax law the way that  Chevron does.  </P> <P> If there was one thing that amazed Wall Street after Pennzoil confessed that it  had purchased nearly 9% of Chevron's stock, it was the harsh reaction that the  disclosure elicited from Chevron's management.  </P> <P> No company likes another company buying its shares. But Pennzoil went out of  its way to assure Chevron that it bought the 27 million shares because it was  trying to avoid a big federal tax bill on the billions that it won in a lawsuit  against Texaco. Pennzoil said repeatedly that it wasn't interested in acquiring  Chevron.  </P> <P> It turns out that Chevron actually believes that Pennzoil isn't looking for an  acquisition. What it doesn't believe is that Pennzoil will be content as a  passive investor. Chevron thinks the only way that Pennzoil can avoid a big tax  bill is to actively influence Chevron.  </P> <P> "To get the kind of tax treatment that they are talking about -- a tax deferral  -- they've got to replace the property they had with property that's similar,"  says a source who's very familiar with Chevron's concerns.  </P> <P> Pennzoil received its award from Texaco after Texaco illegally interfered with  Pennzoil's acquisition of Getty Oil. And since Pennzoil would have had direct  influence over Getty and its assets, Chevron now believes that Pennzoil would  need to exert comparable influence over Chevron to win what will be a tough  battle with the Internal Revenue Service.  </P> <P> "They have to get something that looks like what they had at Getty," the source  says. The Getty agreement would have given Pennzoil control over the top  positions in the company, board seats and structural control, the source notes.  </P> <P> "To get this kind of replacement requires them to be something more than a  passive investor in Chevron," the source added. "I don't know what their intent  is, but it's not to be a passive investor."  </P> <P> And you think your tax return is going to be complicated.  </P> <P> Stock Market's Always Warm in January  </P> <P> Are you an investor who's tired of tracking interest rates? And are you bored  with trying to figure out whether the economy is, or isn't, in a recession?  </P> <P> Then maybe you should base your investment decisions on the calendar.  </P> <P> In his annual booklet called "The Stock Traders Almanac," market guru Yale  Hirsch points out that January has been the second-best month for stocks during  the past 37 years. So investors whose only research tool is the calendar  wouldn't have been too surprised by last week's sudden spurt in stock prices.  </P> <P> January's average 1.5% rise in prices is topped only by the 1.9% average gain  recorded by all the Novembers from 1950 to 1988.  </P> <P> Nobody, of course, really knows why the stock market would do well in January  and November. But Hirsch and I thought up a few possible explanations. The  optimism that accompanies any new year could account for January's gain, while  relief that elections are over could explain November's euphoria.  </P> <P> If Hirsch is onto something, investors should be careful next month. Stock  prices have fallen an average 0.1% in February. But the two worst months are  May and September, down 0.5% and 0.6% respectively.  </P> <P> What Will Develop in the Polaroid Case?  </P> <P> Polaroid's litigation against rival Eastman Kodak is coming to an end.  </P> <P> But two major questions remain: How much will Kodak have to pay Polaroid for  infringing on its patents? And when will Judge David Mazzone of the U.S.  District Court in Boston decide on the amount?  </P> <P> In recent days, Wall Street has been raising its estimate of the windfall. It  is widely speculated that Kodak will be forced to fork over an incredible $1.5  billion to $2 billion.  </P> <P> That guess may or may not turn out to be right. But Wall Street has another  thing wrong. Mazzone won't make his decision in the next few weeks, as has been  rumored in the financial markets. His decision probably won't come until March  at the earliest, according to a source familiar with the case.  </P> <P> But, heck, that'll just leave more time for the excitement to build. And it is  getting exciting.  </P> <P> Alex Henderson, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, had thought that the  most Polaroid could hope for was $800 million. But recently, after reading the  264 pages of post-trial briefs that Polaroid submitted to Mazzone just before  Christmas, Henderson was so moved that he upped his estimate to $1.5 billion.  </P> <P> "The Polaroid brief fleshed out its critical arguments substantially,"  Henderson says. Before that, he says, Kodak looked like it could argue for a  lighter award.  </P> <P> But weighing the pot o' gold doesn't stop there.  </P> <P> Mazzone could decide to treble the damages as punishment to Kodak. Henderson  figures that will give Polaroid $2 billion. (The interest on the award, which  is included in the $1.5 billion, would not be tripled.)  </P> <P> Over at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., analyst Peter Enderlin has his  own calculations. He recently told clients that Polaroid could get $2 billion.  </P> <P> Others in the investment community are making a case for as little as $600  million in damages to as much as $4 billion.  </P> <P> The only thing that is certain is that Polaroid will get something from  Mazzone. And that has been enough to levitate Polaroid's stock of late.  </P> <P> Here's how the post-award situation could shape up. Analysts feel that Kodak  could weather an award of up to $2 billion without its stock being hurt. If  Polaroid gets more than that, Kodak shares -- now in the mid-$40s -- could get  walloped.  </P> <P> Also in the mid-$40s, Polaroid's stock price probably already has an award of  $600 million to $800 million calculated into it.  </P> <P> An award of $1.5 billion could get Polaroid's stock up to $53 a share, the  analysts believe. And in the unlikely event that it gets $3 billion, Polaroid's  shares could be worth $70.  </P> <P> Spin the wheel.  </P> <P> No Speedy Conclusion Expected in Hilton Sale  </P> <P> If you are waiting for the Hilton deal to be completed, you'd better find  yourself a comfortable chair. And you might also want to cool your expectations  a bit. A reliable Wall Street source who is familiar with what's going on in  the negotiations to buy Hilton tells me that he'd be surprised if anything  major happens for at least another month.  </P> <P> Only the first round of bids have been submitted so far and, as reported by the  Wall Street Journal, the prices right now seem to be about $90 a share. But  even that isn't chiseled in granite. The source says bankers all over the world  have gotten pretty cheap lately, and Hilton may not have the cash flow to  justify even a $90 price. Last summer, when takeovers were hot, people thought  that Hilton might fetch as much as $140 a share.  </P> <P> And the most recent timetable had been to have some sort of authoritative  announcement later this month. All of that is now wishful thinking, the source  says. There is one bit of good news: Barron Hilton hasn't threatened yet to  take his company off the market.  </P> <P> Good News and Bad in Eastern Europe  </P> <P> A lot of good things will come out of the political reforms occurring in  Eastern Europe. You've heard these before: The economies of the Soviet Bloc  nations will open up to Western products; billions of dollars that the United  States now spends on defense can be used to fight some pressing domestic  problems, and so forth.  </P> <P> But, as is often the case in life, there is a downside for the United States  that could result from the political upheaval in these lands. Money that  European and Japanese corporations might have spent opening operations in the  United States could be diverted to the lower-wage countries such as East  Germany.  </P> <P> Peter Rona, head of IBJ Schroder, a unit of the Industrial Bank of Japan, says  conversations that he has had during recent trips to Eastern Europe indicate  just such a trend.  </P> <P> "Americans are losers and not losers," predicts Rona, who has very strong ties  to Eastern Europe and the Far East. Americans are losing, he says, "in the  sense of reduced European investment in the United States."  </P> <P> But there is nothing to keep American companies from starting, or acquiring,  subsidiaries in Eastern Europe so that they, too, can compete in the newly  opened markets. General Electric, for instance, recently acquired a Hungarian  light bulb manufacturer, and American telecommunications companies have been  fighting for business in Poland and Hungary.  </P> <P> European companies have been big investors in the United States over the years.  Not only have they invested in financial instruments, such as U.S. Treasury  securities, but they've also acquired companies, built manufacturing plants and  made investments in joint ventures in the auto, steel and other industries.  </P> <P> The U.S. economy would have suffered had these investments not been made.  </P> <P> If Rona is correct, American business will have to make changes if it is to  keep its U.S. plants running with foreign help. Two things that American  companies will have to do are: get back into the forefront of technological  advances and better prepare American workers.  </P> <P> Rona says one West German manufacturing executive recently drove home this  point. Why, the West German said, should I invest money in plant and equipment  in the United States and have to put up with ill-trained workers and drug  problems, when I can build facilities in East Germany and hire good, dedicated  workers at a much lower cost?  </P> <P> "People here are still not sufficiently sensitive to the fact of foreign  competition," says Rona.  </P></p>

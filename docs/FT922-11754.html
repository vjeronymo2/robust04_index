			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling put firmly in spotlight A WAVE of overnight buying put sterling firmly in the spotlight on currency markets yesterday, writes James Blitz. Having closed at DM2.9140 the previous night, the currency opened in London at DM2.9310 yesterday and closed at DM2.9308. It also strengthened against a lifeless dollar, finishing at Dollars 1.7630, compared with Dollars 1.7480 previously. In New York it ended at Dollars 1.7625. By the end of the day, sterling had clambered above the French franc in the ERM grid for the first time since it joined the system in October 1990, reaching its best levels for nearly a year. Traders said overnight buying of sterling, estimated to be around Pounds 400m, came from a number of sources, including Singapore and another Far East Asian state. One trader explained the pound's popularity as a reaction to better news about the UK economic recovery. He also said that foreign investors had been short in sterling assets. There were claims, too, that investors were gambling on the possibility that sterling would soon enter the narrow band of the EMS. By contrast, the D-Mark had a bad day, ending weaker against most currencies. According to Mr Julian Simmonds of Citibank, uncertainty about the German currency may be linked to the run-up to this weekend's G7 meeting in Washington. 'There is a feeling that the G7 will push for lower interest rates in Germany to promote growth throughout Europe,' he said. 'That is why the Mark is being sold.' The D-Mark dropped to its lowest level for a year against the French franc, closing at FFr3.3773 from FFr3.3795. Fears of a strike by German public sector workers also unsettled the currency. The French unit was at its highest level in a year against the D-Mark on a combination of corporate demand and investor confidence that the government of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, will keep the French franc strong. In late Asian trading, the dollar ended steady against the yen and the D-Mark on continued bullish sentiment. Earlier it reached a high of Y134.58, after which strong resistance prompted dealers to take profits. The dollar closed in Tokyo at Y134.25 and DM1.6701. In London, the US currency continued to sag, slipping from DM1.6700 to DM1.6635. Traders said operators saw no reason to buy dollars until they have fresh information on the state of the US economy. The next pointers are due today with the publication of US durable goods orders for March, and latest weekly jobless claims. In the US, the dollar was softer against most currencies at midday after swaying delicately in narrow trading bands throughout the morning. The US unit finished New York trading at Y134.20/27 and DM1.6620/25.</p>

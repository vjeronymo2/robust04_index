			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Change in unit trust fees rule Unit trust managers will be allowed to deduct annual charges from the capital of the funds they manage and will no longer be limited to taking fees out of the income stream from dividends, the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, said yesterday. SIB has been under pressure from the unit trust industry to alter new rules on unit trust pricing which had restricted the source from which fees could be derived. It said it was 'not expressing a view on the appropriateness of adopting the practice of charging to capital'.</p>

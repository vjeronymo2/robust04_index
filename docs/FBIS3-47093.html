The source quoted Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae as  telling members of a National Assembly committee that when the  IAEA team arrives in Pyongyang, South and North Korea and the  United States will simultaneously announce their positions on  three issues.    Song explained the government position on the process and  prospects of Pyongyang-Washington negotiations to members of the  National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification  Committee in a meeting at the Federation of the Korean  Industries, said the source who attended the meeting.    The three issues are inter-Korean exchange of special  envoys,  suspension of the "Team Spirit" joint South Korea-U.S. military  exercise, and high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington.    What the three countries will say about the issues has not  been decided, and Washington seems unsure of Pyongyang's  negotiating posture, a second source who also attended the  meeting said.    When the IAEA inspectors arrive in Pyongyang, North Korea is  expected to announce that it has decided to resume inter-Korean  talks and is willing to open working-level contacts with the  South to discuss mutual nuclear inspections based on the  South-North non- nuclear declaration, he quoted National  Unification Board officials as saying.    Seoul will announce that it is willing to suspend Team  Spirit, while Washington will announce that it will hold a third  round of high-level talks with Pyongyang on condition of the  IAEA nuclear inspection and progress in inter-Korean talks.    An opposition Democratic Party lawmaker said: "I've heard  that even if the government announces suspension of Team Spirit,  it will make the final decision on when to suspend it after  watching progress in inter-Korean talks and settlement of the  North Korean nuclear problem."</p>

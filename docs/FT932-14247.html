			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Business and the Law: Liquidating ambiguity - The SFO's increased powers to use material obtained by liquidators against suspects in court The powers of the UK Serious Fraud Office to use information obtained under questioning when a suspect's 'right to silence' has been removed have once again been strengthened. In a recent judgment, the Court of Appeal removed any restrictions on the SFO using material obtained by company liquidators or administrators as evidence in a criminal trial. This means that any information gathered by liquidators using their powers under section 236 of the Insolvency Act 1986 to compel interviewees to answer questions can be demanded by the SFO and used freely in subsequent criminal prosecutions. The ruling was received by the SFO as a welcome clarification of the relatively new body of law affecting its powers. It undoubtedly amounts to a strengthening of these powers. As one appeal court judge said, it is likely to make SFO prosecutions more efficient, render issues clearer to juries and speed up some over-long fraud trials. However, the ruling has been seen by some defence solicitors as a further example of the creeping erosion of their clients' traditional protection against self-incrimination. Concern has also been expressed - largely by liquidators - that the ruling could hinder both liquidators and administrators in carrying out their work quickly and efficiently in the interests of creditors. The legal challenge was brought by lawyers acting for Mr Muhammed Naviede, the head of the Manchester-based Arrows Group, who currently faces fraud charges brought by the SFO. In his wake, further challenges were also mounted by two defendants facing charges over the Maxwell affair - Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Larry Trachtenberg. The long-running action brought by Mr Naviede reached the High Court last November. Mr Justice Vinelott ruled then that while the SFO could demand that liquidators pass over transcripts of section 236 interviews, restrictions should be placed on the use of this material; in addition an undertaking should be given by the director of the SFO that he would not use the transcripts in ways inconsistent with those restrictions. These restrictions were identical to those placed on the SFO in relation to information it obtains from its own 'section 2' interviews when the right to silence is removed. These curbs prevent the SFO using such information in direct evidence. Such material can only be used when a defendant, giving evidence at trial, makes a statement that is inconsistent with evidence given during a section 2 interview. Last month these restrictions were removed by the three appeal court judges, Lord Justice Dillon, Lord Justice Steyn and Lord Justice Rose. They gave the reasons for the judgment just before Easter. The thrust of their argument was that the Criminal Justice Act 1987, which legislated for the creation of the SFO and its powers, was perfectly clear on the point. It was plain that, under the wording of section 2 of the act, liquidators should be regarded as persons from whom the SFO was entitled to demand information, Lord Justice Dillon said. Civil courts had neither the jurisdiction to impose restrictions on the SFO's use of this information nor the power to exact undertakings from the director of the SFO, he added. The implications of removing the High Court's restrictions prompted different responses from liquidators. Their central concern was whether or not the effective removal of all confidentiality from interviews would damage their ability to collect information from company directors who might fear prosecution. Ernst and Young, the liquidators of Arrows, saw no reason why the efficient conduct of liquidations should be adversely affected. However, administrators acting for various Maxwell companies took a different position, arguing that the public interest in ensuring that liquidations are efficiently carried out justified restrictions on the SFO's use of their information. The restrictions imposed by Mr Justice Vinelott in the High Court had struck a reasonable balance between the public interest in prosecuting fraud and the public interest in the speedy and efficient conduct of liquidations, they argued. The restrictions would mean that the readiness of people questioned by liquidators to talk openly would not be impaired. Lord Justice Dillon said: 'The reasoning is that persons examined under section 236 are more likely to be co-operative and to give full and truthful answers to office-holders if they believe that their answers will be treated as confidential and will thus not be used against them in any prosecution. 'Consequently it appears that some office-holders make a practice of giving assurances of confidentiality to persons who are being examined under section 236.' However, in rejecting the public interest argument, he pointed out that under the Insolvency Act, statements made during a section 236 interview can be admissible evidence in criminal as well as civil proceedings. Liquidators should plainly not offer assurances of confidentiality to persons they are about to question when these would be inconsistent with other statutory obligations such as those owed to the SFO under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, he said. Any assurance given by a liquidator to a director of a company which would prevent the liquidator from fulfilling another statutory obligation would be invalid. When the scope of current legislation became more widely appreciated, the practical difficulties faced by liquidators would be reduced, he said. Afterwards, Mr Mark Homan of Price Waterhouse, president of the Society of Insolvency Practitioners, said the ruling could make directors marginally less willing to answer questions during section 236 interviews. However, in other cases, the clarification of the law could encourage people to disclose more information voluntarily, rather than less. Mr Neil Cooper, head of corporate recovery at Robson Rhodes, said that the ruling might affect the amount of information passed to liquidators, but agreed it could have long term benefits. Although company directors could go to great lengths to avoid giving information, liquidators had to be very circumspect about 'cosy deals' not to pass information on to the SFO, he said. 'We have always regarded the need to be able to communicate information to the relevant authorities as one of the prices we have to pay.' He agreed liquidators could benefit from the Court of Appeal clarification. 'Liquidators don't want to be put in the middle between company directors and the SFO in proceedings which may not advance the case of creditors at all,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The intervention by the government in eight banks,  which was expected, is now a reality. Many people, however, were  taken by surprise. The announcement was made by the high council  of the General Bank Superintendency, which disclosed that since  25 January the eight banks in question had been receiving funds  from Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund]. The  banks in question are Banco Maracaibo, Banco La Guaira, Banco  Metropolitano, Banco Construction, Banco Barinas, Banco  Amazonas, and Sociedad Financiera Fideca.    Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez, a member of the  General Bank Superintendency's high council, after reading the  official communique, told reporters that the guaranteed 400  million bolivares [as heard] per depositor, which totals over  350 billion bolivares, will be paid with approved bonds worth  400 billion bolivares. The fact of the case is that, according  to Sosa Rodriguez, the decision marks a new phase within the  process of stabilizing and strengthening the national financial  system. Sosa said that reports by the General Bank  Superintendency and Fogade prove that assets and operations at  the eight banks have deteriorated.    [Begin Sosa Rodriguez recording] The measure is the result  of  a General Bank Superintendency decision and the reports issued  by Fogade and the Central Bank. The basic reason--which is easy  to understand--is that Fogade provided quite ample funding to  those banks and the time came when these institutions could not  back up Fogade's funds with assets. Consequently, Fogade could  no longer continue funding them. [end recording]    Meanwhile, the announcement of the interventions was not  well  received by the business sector, which believes they will foster  distrust and concern regarding the economy, especially since the  authorities have not disclosed the steps followed in an  intervention. This was confirmed by Jorge Serrano, first vice  president of Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of Associations  and Chambers of Commerce and Industry].    [Begin Serrano recording] Many businessmen have checking  accounts at those banks and will find their operations  restricted. Fedecamaras has been receiving calls since  midmorning from businessmen asking what to do. The government  should disclose this information to the country as soon as  possible; if possible within a few hours. [end recording]    To conclude, the intervention will not affect the extensions  granted by the General Bank Superintendency to the eight banks  in question to restore the capital lost by former shareholders.  The extension will expire on 29 June and the Superintendency  will decide how long the eight banks will remain closed.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Japan backs Seoul minister for WTO The diplomatic contest for top job at the new World Trade Organisation intensified yesterday, after Japan decided to back Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister. Japan's initiative will complicate the search for consensus between the 123 members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is due to be replaced by the more powerful new body in January. Until yesterday, Mr Kim was an outsider, backed by Australia and some Asian countries. The endorsement by the world's second-largest economy now gives him the clout to rival the two front-runners. They are Mr Carlos Salinas, former president of Mexico, who is expected to receive US support; and Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister backed by the European Union. Japan's move means the choice of a WTO head, crucial to the organisation's success, now rests on negotiations between the world's three main economic blocs, the US, Europe and Asia. Governments aim to make a decision by late autumn. Tokyo's public endorsement of Mr Kim, announced late on Thursday by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, is the latest sign of how Japan's previously passive foreign policy is becoming less dependent on the US, in favour of its increasing trade and financial ties with Asian neighbours. 'We prefer a candidate from our region,' said a Japanese foreign ministry official. 'Japan attaches great importance to Asia, especially in terms of trade, and we believe this is a good way to encourage neighbouring countries to be active in the WTO. It may lead to more trade liberalisation in those countries.' This appears to be a blow to the EU's hopes that Mr Ruggiero would win the support of Mr Kim's backers. Brussels would continue to promote Mr Ruggiero, said an EU official yesterday. Asian nations have reservations over the candidacy of Mr Salinas because they fear he might be coloured by Mexico's links with the US in the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>

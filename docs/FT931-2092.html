			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / International Company News: Pounds 32m buy-out at Lombard Continental LOMBARD Continental Insurance, the provincial insurance arm of US group Continental Insurance Company, is to be bought by its management for Pounds 32m. The new company will begin trading in June and includes all the incumbent senior management currently responsible for the provincial business. In 1992, Lombard Continental had gross premium income of Pounds 70m - 65 per cent of which came from personal insurance. Mr Andrew Laing, the new managing director, said: 'Our business will continue to focus on the provincial insurance market. The current hardening of rates in the insurance market and our selective underwriting policy provide us with every opportunity to develop our business successfully.' Mr Laing added that an independent chairman was presently being sought. Two non-executive directors are also to be appointed, one of which is to be a nominee for Electra Kingsway, the lead investor in the venture. Other institutional investors include Phoenix Development Capital Fund, Bank of Boston and Brown Shipley Venture Managers.</p>

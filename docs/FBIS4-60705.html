			<p>BFN     [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said that  Pakistan and India can live in an atmosphere of complete peace  and harmony if the Kashmir issue is resolved. Addressing a  dinner hosted by the Association of Pakistan Professionals in  New York last night, he said the security situation in the South  Asian region has further worsened due to the Indian plan to  deploy Prithvi missiles. He said that the only target of these  missiles is Pakistan and this has aggravated further the tension  which has been caused by the Kashmir problem.    President Leghari said that contrary to the India-U.S.  secret  talks in London, Pakistan's silent diplomacy with the United  States is continuing and it is not secret. The diplomacy is  aimed at resolving the issue of the Pressler Amendment in the  context of the efforts to realize the goal of nuclear  nonproliferation in South Asia.    President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said that Pakistan  welcomes all reasonable proposals. It, however, will not accept  any unilateral restriction on its peaceful nuclear program. On  narcotics control, the president said that the Government of  Pakistan has recently taken speedy steps to eradicate the  operations of the drug mafia and also enacted stringent laws to  root out drug trafficking. On the privatization of the power  production projects of [word indistinct], the president said  that progress in this regard has been halted due to lack of  appropriate legal regulations. He said that the whole process of  privatization will be very transparent and in conformity with  the law. In future, thermal power production will be entrusted  only to the private sector, while the government will take care  of hydroelectric power production.</p>

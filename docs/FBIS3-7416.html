			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 23 KYODO -- The successor to GATT,  the World Trade Body, will set up a panel on trade and the  environment, according to a draft accord obtained Wednesday.  The draft, obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE, says the panel's job  will include examining links between trade and the environment,  charges and taxes for environmental purposes, and ways of  settling disputes.    Negotiators are to meet in April in Marrakesh, Morocco, to  sign the final accord on the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade  talks.    The seven-year talks were concluded in December, when it was  provisionally agreed to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade, under whose auspices they were held, with a World  Trade Organization (WTO).    Despite a proposal that panels to be set up by the WTO  should  include one on the environment, developing countries were  concerned that industrial countries might use environmental  concerns as an excuse to adopt protectionist measures.    In an apparent bid to ease such concerns, the panel's remit  will include looking at the effect of environmental measures on  market access, sources close to the negotiators said.    The committee will report to a ministerial meeting after two  years, and that meeting will decide whether the panel should be  kept or disbanded, the draft shows.    The sources said the draft will be confirmed at the trade  negotiation committee of GATT next Wednesday, and will be  formally signed by ministers of the negotiating countries in  Marrakesh.</p>

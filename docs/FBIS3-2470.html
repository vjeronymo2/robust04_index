			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Gao Jun: "Contest Plan to Make </F> China Green"]    [Text] The government is launching an annual contest to  reward the nation's greenest cities, counties, townships and  villages.    The move is a new initiative to boost the country's  tree-planning drive.    Cities will be in the running to become one of the country's  "top ten" if at least 85 percent of the local residents have  voluntarily planted trees, said a circular issued by the  Forestry Ministry and the National Afforestation Committee.    At least 30 percent of each city must be covered with trees,  grass and flowers. Each resident should have at least 5 square  metres of green space.    In addition, every construction project must include green  areas.    The judges will also consider no candidate in whose area  there has been a serious natural or man-made forestry accident  in the past five years, said the circular.    As well as the green cities, the judges will select 100  counties and 100 townships and 1,000 villages each year, the  circular said.    The winners will receive medals and certificates, but their  titles will be revoked if their standards fall, the circular  added.    The green contest aims to boost the drive to control soil  erosion and to relieve the damage caused by storms and sand.    It is also designed to encourage local farmers to make more  profits by planting trees and developing forests.    Forestry officials said the prize winners should also  perform  a leading role in improving the farmers' living standards and  helping them escape poverty.    Meanwhile, China's top forestry official vowed yesterday to  work full time to improve procedures to prevent forest fires.    The news came during a national telephone work conference,  chaired in Beijing, during which it emerged that forest fires  decreased remarkably last year, thanks to the persistent efforts  of local governments and forestry staff. Forestry Minister Xu  Youfang told the conference that the area of forest hit by fires  nationwide last year tumbled 54.3 percent from 1992.    The number of individual fires fell by 34.7 percent, he  said.    And the figures are respectively 41 and 42.3 percent lower  than the average level of the previous five years, he added.    However, he went on to call for better equipment and  training  for the country's forest firefighters to enable them to cope  with all emergencies.    Xu also stressed that regulations or fire prevention should  be improved and more strictly enforced.    A professional network to prevent forest fires should be  established to analyze and research the causes an spread of  fires, he said.    State Councillor Chen Junsheng called on local governments  to  remain vigilant saying they must do all they could to avoid  anything that might cause similar damage as suffered by other  countries in recent forest fires.</p>

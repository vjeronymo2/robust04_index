			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Fikret Abdic, former Bosnia-Herzegovina </F> Presidency member and leader of the Cazin Krajina separatists,  to Belgrade Television in Belgrade on 24 Feb -- recorded]    [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Abdic, do you  wish to give a statement for Television Serbia on the essence of  the agreement that you have reached here in Belgrade with  republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic, mediated by  Serbian President Slobdan Milosevic?    [Abdic] Of course I wish to make a statement because I came  here publicly, in the function of peace, because it is known  that 18 days ago a fierce armed clash occurred between the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps and the Srpska army. For the  past 18 days I have been trying to do what could be done over  the telephone in contacts with Slobodan Milosevic and Radovan  Karadzic to stop the armed clashes. It is known that we have  drawn up a cease-fire agreement and an agreement on the  cessation of all hostilities, however, there are still instances  of violating this agreement. Therefore, this was actually the  reason why I turned to Slobodan Milosevic to ask Radovan  Karadzic to meet with us here in Belgrade and to review once  again the declaration which we signed on 22 October 1993, which  Slobodan Milosevic also signed.    I can conclude with great pleasure that Mr. Milosevic  expressed readiness to call Karadzic, and that he remained  committed to all the principles we agreed to on 22 October.  That is why we have signed this agreement, and with this  agreement I can guarantee the citizens of Bihac -- and the  citizens of western Bosnia -- peace. That is the most important  thing. Moreover, I believe that when peace is the issue, one  must choose neither the time nor the place, nor spare oneself or  fall under the influence of various comments, but must rise to  the occasion since it is people and lasting peace that are at  stake. It is the duty of all of us to do everything possible to  ensure peace returns to all the territories. I have been  criticized for striving too hard for peace in the autonomous  province of Western Bosnia, rather than for peace throughout  Bosnia- Herzegovina. I have to say that in my opinion, peace  must have a starting point. The most realistic starting point  is precisely in the autonomous province of Western Bosnia. I  believe that we can establish peace throughout  Bosnia-Herzegovina based precisely on the principles of this  peace.</p>

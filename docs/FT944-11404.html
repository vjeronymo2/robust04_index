			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Venezuelan soldiers on patrol Thousands of Venezuelan National Guard soldiers today begin 24-hour patrols in the country's big cities to check a wave of violent crime that cannot be controlled by regular police forces alone. The guard, a branch of Venezuela's armed forces, normally does not appear in such force except under special circumstances, such as natural disasters, civilian or military disorders or national elections. In announcing the new deployment of National Guard patrols, Major General Rafael Montero Revette, minister of defence, said the operation would be in effect until the end of December, and guardsmen would work in co-operation with police forces. 'I want to clarify that the intention is not to militarise the cities, but to offer better security to the population.' A recent increase in theft and armed robbery comes as Venezuela struggles with a deepening economic recession. Official figures put unemployment at 13.5 per cent for the third quarter of 1994.</p>

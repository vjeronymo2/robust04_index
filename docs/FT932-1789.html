			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Weak metals market 'may delay sale of Pechiney' PECHINEY, the French state-controlled aluminium and packaging group which is a candidate for privatisation, may have to wait for an improvement in the metals market before it can be sold, according to its chairman, Mr Jean Gandois. Mr Gandois, who has been an enthusiastic supporter of privatisation, warned that the current state of the aluminium market was not conducive to a sale to the private sector. Pechiney has been badly affected by the recent steep increase in imports of cheap aluminium from eastern Europe. Mr Gandois, speaking at the annual meeting of Pechiney International, its 67.9 per cent owned packaging subsidiary, said the group's first priority was to 'reduce its losses and then to be privatised'. The group's privatisation prospects may also be affected by its plans to raise capital for Pechiney International. Mr Gandois said the unit was on course for a slight increase in net profits this year from FFr1.07bn in 1992, but might need new finance to continue its acquisition programme. Pechiney was to have been sold in the mid-1980s, but the 1987 stock market crash halted the privatisation programme. It is one of 21 companies scheduled for sale by the new centre-right administration. The government hopes to proceed with the first of the proposed privatisations in September. However, several companies on the list, including the Bull computer company and Air France, are regarded as unsellable, at least in the short term, because of financial problems. Pechiney had been considered one of the stronger candidates for sale, due to its high profile among international investors. However, Mr Gandois' warning effectively rules out an early sale, as the government would be unlikely to press ahead with a sale against the management's wishes.</p>

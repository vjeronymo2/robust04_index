			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Newspapers link in coupon project THREE RIVAL newspaper groups yesterday announced a joint venture to produce advertising inserts for selected weekend titles with a total potential circulation of 9.5m. Brand Movers, an equal-shares venture by Express Newspapers, Mirror Group Newspapers and The Telegraph, is to publish a colour magazine-format brochure  - to be called Moneysavers  - offering price-saving coupons for goods including foods. Revenue will be split according to the circulation of the newspapers. None of the newspapers was prepared to predict how much would be raised. The News International group of daily and Sunday titles is due to launch a similar insert on November 22. Brand Movers said that the first Moneysavers would appear 'in the near future' and be published periodically. Such 'free-standing inserts' are big business in the US, where each individual receives an average of 1,200 coupons each year. Nationwide, a potential Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.55bn) in price reductions are offered. Manufacturers pay retailers about Dollars 600m annually to participate. A total of 8bn coupons were delivered in the UK last year, against 5bn the previous year. Brand Movers denied that the scheme was a response to declines in newspaper display advertising but one clear target is to take revenue from TV.</p>

Nateq Nuri said: this act and the approval of crimes  committed by the regime occupying al-Quds [Jerusalem] was  expected, but the silence of the Christian community on the  subject was not.    Referring to the Afghan civil war, Nuri said the recent  events in Afghanistan reveal that Afghan leaders and ringleaders  lack political maturity, which allows for foreign intervention  and continued clashes.</p>

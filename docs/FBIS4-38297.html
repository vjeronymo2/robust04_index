			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Shafiq al-Asadi: "Abu-Dhabi Rejects the Logic of </F> Occupation by the Zionists or Iran"]    [Excerpts] Abu-Dhabi -- The United Arab Emirates [UAE] has  reaffirmed its insistence on full sovereignty over the islands  of Tunb al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu-Musa, and emphasized  that it will not forfeit a single inch of their territory.    Diplomatic sources in Abu-Dhabi have stated that "this is a  firm and irrevocable position regardless of the statements and  threats of Iranian officials which are not based on any legal or  historical ground relating to these islands which were forcibly  occupied by Iran in 1971."    They added that "the statements of Iranian officials on the  islands and Tehran's talk of eternal sovereignty over the three  strategic Gulf islands reflect a conceited and arrogant Iranian  mentality and Iranian policy toward the neighboring states,  governed by upstaging and charges of treason, hegemony, and  service to Zionism which Tehran knowns well. [no closing  quotemark as published]    The sources were commenting on the statement of the Iranian  Foreign Ministry's spokesman who said that the UAE's position  "opens the way to Zionist hegemony."    The sources described the statement of Mahmud Mohammadi, the  Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, and his reaffirmation of  "Iran's eternal sovereignty over the three strategic islands in  the Gulf," as a "violation of the spirit of the era and of the  international will that disputes should be settled by peaceful  means and recourse to the international community if  negotiations between the two sides fail." [passage omitted]    The sources said that "Iran's continued occupation of the  islands reflects a mentality of hegemony. The logic of  occupation is rejected, be it in Palestine by the Zionists or in  the Gulf by the Iranians." [passage omitted]</p>

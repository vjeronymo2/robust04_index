			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>   [Excerpt] Kigali, June 19 (AFP) -- A young Rwandan woman  was killed and three others were injured when three shells fell  on the Red Cross hospital in the centre of Kigali Sunday [19  June], as France continued preparations for sending an  international intervention force to protect civilians from the  conflict.    Philippe Gaillard, head of the Kigali delegation of the  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said one shell  fell on a hospital building, another one near by and a third  close to a wing where 50 orphans were sheltering.    The hospital, the only medical centre in the government-held  sector of the city, has around 600 patients -- "injured people  who can't walk and can't be moved," Gaillard said.    The Tutsi-led rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)  intensified  its shelling of the town centre Sunday, a UN spokesman said.  The rebels had seized control of Mount Kigali, a hill  overlooking the south-west of the town, he added.    Wounded men, women and children lay helpless on stretchers  or  plastic sheets outside the hospital Sunday. The medical team of  three Doctors and five nurses is running out of bandages and  places to put their patients, Gaillard said.    Gaillard said he had pleaded with the RPF to stop shelling  the hospital but was rebuffed. The RPF told him the hospital is  within the government-held zone and that government forces are  in position in the hospital's immediate surrounds, he said.    The rebels continued their advance in the rest of the  country  Sunday towards Butare in the south and Kibuye in the west.  General Romeo Dallaire, commander of the UN Assistance Mission  in Rwanda said he was "surprised" at the speed of the RPF's  advance.    The rebel movement seized the town of Gitarama, a former  government hold-out situated between Kigali and Butare, a week  earlier.    In Kigali, the UN had attempted to persuade the warring  factions to observe a truce for a few hours to allow the  evacuation of civilian refugees from the Sainte-Famille church  building. The evacuation of displaced persons in the rebel-held  sector was set to occur simultaneously.    On Saturday, the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR)  had  stepped up its evacuation of civilians trapped in Kigali on  either side of the front line, with six convoys from the  Mille-Collines hotel in the government-held sector and from the  King Faisal hospital in rebel territory.    The Mille-Collines hotel is now empty and UNAMIR now plans  to  resume evacuations from the hospital as well as the  Sainte-Famille church, UN spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante said.

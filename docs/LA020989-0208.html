			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH HAS HORSESHOE PIT INSTALLED  </P> <P> President Bush has ordered a 40-foot horseshoe pit installed near the tennis  courts on the White House south grounds. Not one to sit in the Oval Office,  Bush already has strolled down to inspect the work, which is being handled by a  National Park Service crew, and an aide confirmed today that the pit will be a  40-footer. The game of horseshoes apparently is one of the President's favorite  forms of relaxation, and the aide said Bush also had a pit installed at Camp  David.  </P></p>

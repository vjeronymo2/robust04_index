			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vanya Manolova] </F>   [Text] Today Bulgarian Foreign Ministry Stanislav Daskalov  and Peter Kooijmans, foreign minister of the Netherlands, who is  visiting our country, signed a joint political declaration of  the two countries' Foreign Ministries. According to Mr.  Daskalov, the document specifies the main directions for  bilateral cooperation, but the important thing is that these are  refracted through the prism of our common aims to integrate us  in the European and Euro- Atlantic structures.    Prior to this, Acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev talked  for almost two hours with Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud  Lubbers and Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans. During the  meeting they discussed the difficulties of the transition and  the possibilities for stimulating our bilateral relations,  especially in the sphere of investments and cooperation in  providing financial credits.    Through its representatives, the Netherlands assured us that  in the near future it will ratify the interim trade agreement  between Bulgaria and the European Union. The guests expressed  the Netherlands' readiness to invest in our transportation  projects, including the new Danube bridge.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Arts: Hot Stuff - Theatre Yet another rock musical has opened in London's West End, and even for non-addicts the cult has a certain attraction. This consists largely of watching other people so evidently - and harmlessly - enjoying it. Hot Stuff has arrived at the Cambridge from the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester which is developing a musical style of its own. Basically it is an excuse for going through the pop songs and stars of the 1970s. Not all of them are immediately recognisable and the diction is less than distinct. Still, the audience applauds each new number as soon as it starts. There is the veneer of a plot picked up from the Faust legend: a young man who gives up everything to become the greatest rock star in the world. A screen in the background records what happens in the decade: not only the resignation of President Nixon and the fall of Saigon, but also the decaying nature of the world of rock. 'Nothing could be worse than the last 10 years,' says someone towards the end. Then Mrs Thatcher appears in 1979 and David Dale, who has been playing Helen of Troy throughout, does the prime minister in drag. Paul Kerryson directs and the whole show is mildly infectious.

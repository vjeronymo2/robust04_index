			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPUTIES SEARCH FOR MISSING TEEN  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies appealed to the public Friday to help find a missing  17-year-old San Bernardino youth who has the mental and emotional development  of an 11-year-old.  </P> <P> Erick Scott Appel has been missing since July 12. Investigators said he is  schizophrenic and may experience hallucinations without medication.  </P> <P> "Erick is extremely trusting, vulnerable and susceptible. He is like a 10- or  11-year-old kid in a lot of ways," said Vince Appel, the youth's father.  </P> <P> Martha Appel, his stepmother, said the teen-ager looks and speaks normally but  tells fanciful, farfetched stories. He blinks his eyes hard when nervous, she  said.  </P> <P> The youth is 6 feet, 1 inch tall, weighs approximately 130 pounds and has blue  eyes and brown hair in a crew cut. He was last seen riding his purple and white  BMX bicycle.  </P> <P> San Bernardino Sheriff's Detective David Heard said investigators do not  believe the missing teen-ager ran away.  </P></p>

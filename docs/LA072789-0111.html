			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: EX-PRESIDENT TO RETURN  </P> <P> Just a week after it dismissed Chief Executive H. David Bright, National  Education Corp. has announced that former President Jerome W. Cwiertnia is  returning to his old job and assuming the position of chief operating officer.  </P> <P> NEC Chairman David C. Jones named Cwiertnia, 48, acting president and chief  operating officer and indicated the appointments will become permanent at the  company's next board meeting.  </P> <P> National Education in Irvine is the nation's largest vocational training  company.  </P> <P> "I take this as a pleasant surprise," said Arthur Rade, analyst with the New  York brokerage of Merrill Lynch. "Cwiertnia is highly thought of both  internally and in the investment community."  </P> <P> Cwiertnia's appointment was seen by some analysts as another rebuke of Bright's  reign by National Education's board. When he resigned last March, Cwiertnia  said it was because he wanted a position that would give him more  responsibility while analysts said the real reason was that he and Bright often  clashed.  </P> <P> Following his resignation as president, Cwiertnia continued to serve as a  consultant. He earned $685,400 in 1988, according to public records. GREGORY  CROUCH  </P></p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Swiss bank threatened with lawsuit over meaning of 'm' Two British businessmen are threatening to sue Union Bank of Switzerland after one of its Swiss branch managers supplied a reference saying that a customer was good for Pounds 18m, but later insisted that it had meant Pounds 18,000. Two managers said that in Switzerland 'm' refers to 'mille', not millions. The dispute arose after the collapse of the sale of a Spanish resort development, in which the two British businessmen had a majority stake. The sale of the development depended on the receipt by the investors who had agreed to buy it of a loan of Pounds 18m. The transaction is one of several thought to be under investigation by the Metropolitan Police. Detectives want to interview Mr George Lagoudontis, a Greek businessman who allegedly agreed to lend Pounds 18m last May. After Mr John Collins and Mr Tony Etridge had agreed to sell their majority stake in a Valencia golfing and leisure resort last year, they tried to verify the standing of Royal Trust of Greece, Mr Lagoudontis's company. Mr Beat Hunold, manager of the UBS branch in Glarus, replied in German to Barclays, Mr Collins' and Mr Etridge's bank, that Mr Lagoudontis was 'good for 18m sterling'. However, when the reference was checked again after delays in the transfer of Pounds 18m and the exchange of contracts, Mr Hunold and a fellow manager wrote on July 15 to say that he had not meant Pounds 18,000,000. 'In Switzerland, 'm' is used as an abbreviation for 'mille' (thousand) and 'mio' for million. Therefore, we understood your request to be for 18,000, so our reply to you was absolutely correct,' they wrote. The legal department of UBS in Zurich has defended its stance and said it cannot give more information to Mr Collins' and Mr Etridge's solicitor because it supplied the bankers' reference to Barclays in London. Mr Collins said that UBS was trying to 'defend the indefensible' in not admitting that it was at fault over the reference. UBS in Zurich said that Glarus was a rural branch that might easily believe 'm' to be an abbreviation for thousand. Although a price of Pounds 18m was agreed for the development - in which Mr Collins and Mr Etridge held a controlling stake through companies in the Isle of Man - the buyers now believe it is worth less than Pounds 10m. Mr Zack Goodman, who acted as agent on behalf of Jouvin, a Channel Islands company that intended to buy the development for private investors, said the Spanish recession, together with prolonged uncertainty, meant that its value could have been 'at least halved'. He said the sale had been delayed solely because of uncertainty over the loan.</p>

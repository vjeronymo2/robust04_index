			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Henry Kissinger and  Cyrus Vance today hailed President Clinton's decision on  extending most-favored-nation treatment status for China and  decoupling that status from human rights issues.    The result of this "difficult but correct decision," they  said, is a New China policy, which "will better serve both  American interests and those of peace and stability in Asia."    The two former secretaries of state made the comments in an  article entitled "The Right decision", published in the  WASHINGTON POST Monday [6 June].    They pointed out that America's broader interests in Asia  "require a reasonable relationship" with China, and that peace  and economic progress in Asia are in America's interest and  require Chinese-American cooperation. Stability in Asia is in  America's interest but is only possible if both America and  China are engaged in its pursuit. "Withholding MFN would have  ruptured one of the world's most important bilateral and  potentially productive relationships," they noted.    They went on to say that the United States and China share  many other interests in the region, which "can best be advanced  through a regular, comprehensive and frank dialogue at the  highest levels." they described the meeting in Seattle last  November between President Clinton and his Chinese counterpart  Jiang Zemin as "a useful first step," and expressed the hope  that "with the MFN decision behind us the two leaders will  establish a strategic dialogue between our two countries."    Praising the administration's New China policy for opening  the door to broadening and strengthening U.S.-China relations,  they reminded that pursuing better relations with Beijing is not  a favor which America bestows on China. "It is in America's  interests. America and China need each other in our mutual  search for regional stability."    Referring to the importance of China's cooperation to the  United States on a number of major issues, Kissinger and Vance  warned that China's cooperation on these matters cannot be taken  for granted. "China will base its decisions on a hard-headed  assessment of its own national interests, as will we. Settling  the MFN-human rights issue, vital as it is, does not guarantee  smooth sailing on other issues."    But they stressed in the article that cooperation is more  likely to be forthcoming "if Washington and Beijing both work to  strengthen the central strategic relationship between our two  countries."</p>

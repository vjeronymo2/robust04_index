			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Metered homes to get lower water bill Average water bills in houses with water meters will fall by 1 per cent to Pounds 97 in the year 1994-95, according to Ofwat, the water industry regulator. Average sewerage bills will fall by 3.8 per cent to Pounds 102, Bronwen Maddox writes. The watchdog said the fall was partly because metered customers used an average of 11 per cent less water. Average water bills in households without water meters will be Pounds 94 - a rise of 6.8 per cent. Average sewerage bills will be Pounds 105, a rise of 8.2 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yasir 'Arafat is demanding that Israel immediately  transfer to the Palestinians self-government powers in all of  the West Bank. 'Arafat raised this demand during his meeting  with President 'Ezer Weizman in Pretoria. This was learned by  our correspondent 'Imanu'el Halperin. Prime Minister Rabin was  briefed about this development.    The Swiss president, who also met with Mr. Weizman in South  Africa, proposed to establish a sixth committee in the framework  of the multilateral talks. His proposal calls for establishing  a committee to deal with human rights in the region. The  deliberations of this committee would be coordinated by  Switzerland. Israel will examine the proposal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- The country's political  circles, shocked by the pro-communist line taken by Hanchongnyon  (The Korea Federation of University Student Councils) at its  three-day anniversary ceremony in Kwangju late last week, are  moving to act against the group's pro-North Korean bent.    During the ceremony, the activist student organization  issued  pro-North Korean statements and called the Korean war "the war  for fatherland liberation," echoing Pyongyang's definition of  the conflict.    Worried about activist students' pro-North Korean bent when  the Stalinist state's nuclear program has become the focal point  of international concern, the political circles are urging the  government to do something about the students.    The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) expressed deep  concern over Hanchongnyon's pro-communist line at a high-level  meeting on Tuesday. Rep. Yi Se-ki, chairman of the policy  committee, called the students' meeting "a worrying development"  while giving a briefing on what happened in Kwangju.    Chairman Kim Chong-pil, unable to conceal his shock at the  students' describing the Korean war as having been fought to  liberate the fatherland, said, "They denounced our system and  supported North Korea's communist system.    Other participants in the meeting were also surprised at the  display of a miniature mockup of "the cultural palace of the  people" in Pyongyang during the students' gathering in Kwangju.    Emerging from the meeting, spokesman Pak Pom-chin said,  "communism has now become a tested legacy of history, and I  can't understand how college students, as intellectuals, can  call the Korean war the war for fatherland liberation, echoing  the North Koreans' theory." He then called on the students to  drop "the anachronistic behavior."    Secretary-general Mun Chong-su said, "I was told they put on  display some miniature mockups of the house where Kim Il-song  was born and the Cultural Palace of the people. What should I  think of this display? It's beyond common sense and  understanding, however hard I might try to understand in view of  their status as students."    Chief policy coordinator Kang Sam-chae added, "It's shocking  to hear them crying for the downfall of the civilian government  despite the times having changed. It appears that they have now  reached a dangerous level and we should not let them remain at  this level."    Chairman Kim recently produced evidence that an apparent  pro-  North Korean organization has distributed leaflets to important  figures which support Kim Il-song's planned power transfer to  his son, Chong-il, under the chuche (self-reliance) ideology.  Hanchongnyon then declared a pro-North Korean line. Faced with  these developments, the DLP plans to call a meeting with the  government shortly to call for action against pro-North Korean  elements in society.    Chongwadae [presidential offices], though shocked by  Hanchongnyon's declaration of a pro-North Korean line, is moving  to increase the people's sense of national security.    The combination of the nuclear issue having entered a  critical phase, the inscrutability of North Korea's leaders and  Hanchongnyon's abrupt move toward Pyongyang is causing  Chongwadae officials great concern about pro-North Korean  elements in the South.    In addition to thoroughly investigating communist  sympathizers, the government should paint a true picture of  Hanchongnyon so that the organization cannot take root in  society, one official said.    "Those students, though small in number, denounce the  legitimate civilian government based on popular support, while  blindly supporting North Korea's chuche ideology and communism  though their fictitiousness -- this has already been proven.  I'm just surprised that such students are still leading the  student movement. The situation now requires us to increase our  sense of national security, in addition to judicial action  against them."    He added, "The North Korean nuclear issue is now facing a  critical moment and there is the possibility that food shortages  and other economic ills will force North Korea into abrupt  action. These and Hanchongnyon's pro-North Korean line make us  worry about national security."    He then called on South Koreans to cooperate in the  government's investigation of Hanchongnyon leaders.    The opposition Democratic Party is critical of  Hanchongnyon's  pro-North Korean line, while attributing the student  organization's stance to the confusion in the government's  unification policy.    Supreme Councilor Cho Se-hyong said, "It's true that  Hanchongnyon's inaugural statement contains some improper words  and phrases. Nonetheless, I can't understand why the government  is making a political issue of Hanchongnyon, rather than dealing  with it according to the law.    "The government is heightening the people's unease by  creating a tense atmosphere over the North Korean nuclear issue,  and I demand that the government announce what measures it has  to deal with the nuclear issue."    Soldier-turned politician Rep. Yim Pok-chin said, "Students  had not been such activists until recently and I can't  understand why and how they have changed into such activists."    Deputy spokesman Kim Yong-sok said, "It appears that  students' radical demands and extreme acts have shocked  citizens. But the government should be held partially  responsible for the undesirable acts of students because it has  monopolized information on North Korea on the pretext of its  being the sole agent of carrying out unification policy.    "The government should guarantee the freedom of unification  policy debates and present its blueprint for unification to the  people so that students will wake up from the illusion that they  alone can achieve unification."</p>

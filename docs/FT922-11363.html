			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Patten chosen to steer Hong Kong to 1997 handover MR CHRIS PATTEN, the Con-servative party chairman, is to become governor of Hong Kong. His task will be to steer the colony through a sensitive period as it approaches the handover of sovereignty from Britain to China in 1997, making him in all likelihood Hong Kong's last British governor. He is expected to take up the post in July. The appointment yesterday by Mr John Major, the prime minister, was immediately welcomed by Hong Kong businessmen and politicians who saw Mr Patten's close relationship with Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, as beneficial for the colony. Mr Patten lost his parliamentary seat in the general election while playing a pivotal role in his party's victory. He said at a London press conference: 'I have long admired the Hong Kong success story and I come to the job with a determination first and foremost to uphold the interests of all the people of Hong Kong.' His move represents a break with the tradition of the governorship being held by senior diplomats. Mr Patten, 47, replaces Lord Wilson of Tillyorn, a career foreign office official, who is retiring. The governorship commands a Pounds 140,000 tax-free salary, the highest in the Civil Service, a mansion and grand life-style. Mr Major offered it immediately after Mr Patten lost his Bath seat, and he was understood to have been led to accept by 'gut instinct'. Mr Major said: 'He will have a vital job to do at a critical time. No one could do it better.' Mr Patten's decision throws his future in British politics into question. He is understood to have rejected as 'unseemly' any early return to cabinet by an artificially arranged by-election. Mr Patten deflected questions about his own future in UK politics with a quotation from a hymn by Cardinal Newman: 'I do not seek the distant scene, one step enough for me.' Though Mr Patten has clearly not ruled out a return to Westminster, his commitment to staying as governor for the full five years will mean he is not able to take part in the next election. On criticisms from the Labour party that the governorship was a 'consolation prize' for having lost his seat, Mr Patten admitted that had he remained an MP he would probably not have been offered the post. Mr Henry Keswick, chairman of Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong conglomerate, said the appointment was 'very good news indeed'. Mr Keswick, who was believed to have lobbied Downing Street for Lord (formerly Sir David) Wilson to be replaced, said: 'Hong Kong needs a politically skilled leader of the highest rank and is very fortunate to have Chris Patten.' Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, which has emerged as the main opposition party in Hong Kong's nascent democracy, voiced cautious optimism. He said a politician was better for Hong Kong than a diplomat, and 'if he is a good politician, I am sure he will pick things up very quickly'. Mr Cheng Kai-Nam, a pro-China politician, said Mr Patten's appointment showed the British government was attaching importance to Hong Kong ahead of the transfer to China. But he expressed disappointment that Mr Patten had little knowledge of Hong Kong and Chinese affairs.

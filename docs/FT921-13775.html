			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Economics: Spotlight picks out UK activity INTEREST will focus upon the state of UK economic activity and upon price pressures in Germany this week. There is little sign, however, that economists in major financial markets expect any convincing evidence of economic recovery in Britain or that the Bundesbank has German inflation under control. In Britain, Wednesday's industrial production figures for November will come under close scrutiny. News last month of a fall in manufacturing output in October raised fears that Britain might be heading for a 'double dip' recession and generated much pre-Christmas gloom about the economy. The median of City forecasts from MMS International, the financial services company, suggests that manufacturing output will be flat in November and 2.6 per cent lower than in November last year. The provisional retail sales figures for December are expected to be similarly uninspiring, following today's report from the Confederation of British Industry that the Christmas trade was better than a year ago but that it nevertheless fell far short of shopkeepers' expectations. German figures this week are expected to show an acceleration in consumer price inflation and money supply growth. The figures are likely to stiffen Germany's determination to maintain a tight monetary policy when the Group of Seven finance ministers meet in the US on Saturday. Among the economic highlights of the week ahead, with the median of city forecasts indicated in brackets from MMS International, are the following: Today: UK, December provisional retail sales (unchanged on month, up 0.5 per cent on year). France, November industrial production (down 0.5 per cent). Germany, Bundesbank publishes monthly report. Tomorrow: UK, December M0 narrow money (up 0.2 per cent on month, 2.8 per cent on year), M4 broad money (up 0.2 per cent on month, 5.7 per cent on year), December bank and building society (M4) lending (Pounds 2bn). Japan, November machinery orders, December trade balance (Dollars 9bn surplus, customs cleared). Canada, December consumer price index non-seasonally adjusted (unchanged on month, up 4.2 per cent on year), CPI seasonally adjusted (up 0.2 per cent on month), November adjusted retail sales (up 0.8 per cent). Wednesday: US, Western foreign ministers confer in Washington concerning humanitarian aid for states of the former Soviet Union. Fed releases the 'tan book' on economy for February 4-5 meeting of the open market committee. December housing starts (1.09m), building permits.

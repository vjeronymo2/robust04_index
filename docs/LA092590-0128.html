			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: PARIS;  </P> <P> CURTAIN RISES ON ONE GERMANY  </P> <P> One week before German unification, some of Europe's leading political figures  gather in Paris today for a one-day seminar on the impact of a united Germany  in a changing Europe.  </P> <P> Among those providing their wisdom will be French President Francois  Mitterrand, European Commission President Jacques Delors, West German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and one of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's closest  advisers, Alexander N. Yakovlev.  </P> <P> The timing of the seminar, sponsored by several European newspapers, together  with the prominence of those attending, reflect both the priority attached by  Europe's leadership to German unity and the uncertainty of its meaning.  </P></p>

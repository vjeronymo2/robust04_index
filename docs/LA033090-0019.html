			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PEDESTRIAN TUNNELS UNDER FREEWAY CLOSING TO CURB CRIME  </P> <P> Sepulveda residents living along the San Diego Freeway expressed relief  Thursday that city crews will begin boarding up four pedestrian tunnels that  the residents say provide "easy access, easy exit" to criminals and vandals.  </P> <P> "It's the best news I've had all week," said Mae Coleman, who lives two houses  away from a pedestrian tunnel on Rayen Street. Coleman and many of her  neighbors attribute neighborhood problems such as crime and vandalism to the  dark, dank tunnel that cuts under the San Diego Freeway at the end of her  street.  </P> <P> After several years of community complaints, the Los Angeles Board of Public  Works on Wednesday agreed to temporarily close tunnels at Chase, Rayen, Tupper  and Superior streets with plywood. Work is scheduled to begin Tuesday. City  officials said the much more expensive procedure of closing the tunnels  permanently will be done later.  </P> <P> Residents and police say the tunnels, built to provide a way to cross the busy  freeway, are frequented by drug dealers, transients and thieves. Police said  people occasionally are accosted in the tunnels, which often are covered with  graffiti and reek of urine.  </P> <P> The tunnels provide "easy access, easy exit" for criminals, Coleman said.  </P> <P> "We prefer them being blocked off," said police Sgt. J.W. Thompson.  </P> <P> The four Sepulveda closures are the first in a new city program created in  response to the increasing number of requests for tunnel closures.  </P> <P> Of the 219 pedestrian tunnels in Los Angeles, 44 have been closed in the last  30 years. Seven more, including two in the San Fernando Valley, are in various  stages of being closed permanently. That process, which involves filling the  tunnels with sand and bricking over the entrances, can cost $55,000, City  Engineer Robert Horii said.  </P> <P> Horii said the four tunnels in Sepulveda are scheduled to be closed permanently  during the 1990-91 fiscal year, which begins July 1. In the meantime, the  entrances to the tunnels will be blocked by plywood. Plywood barriers cost  between $500 and $1,000, said Dave Reed, assistant director of the Los Angeles  Bureau of Street Maintenance.  </P> <P> "It won't stop them," Coleman said of the plywood's effectiveness against  thieves and vandals. "But I'll take it for the moment."  </P></p>

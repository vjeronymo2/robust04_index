			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: DeGroote agrees to CDollars 23m penalty MR MICHAEL DeGroote, former chief executive and controlling shareholder of Laidlaw, the Canadian waste services group, has been barred from trading securities for five years and has agreed to a substantial financial payment in settlement of insider trading allegations. The Ontario Securities Commission said Mr DeGroote, his business associate Mr Henri Herbots, and Seakist Overseas, a Channel Islands company, had agreed to pay a total of CDollars 23m (USDollars 18m). The bulk of the money will be distributed among Laidlaw shareholders as compensation for losses they suffered in early 1991 when the company's shares were driven down by heavy short-selling, much of it initiated by Seakist. In addition, Mr Keith Walker, a stockbroker employed by Midland Walwyn of Toronto, who handled Seakist's account, will surrender his broker's licence. The insider trading allegations relate to a period shortly after Mr DeGroote stepped down at Laidlaw. Mr DeGroote provided a CDollars 27m loan to Seakist to finance short sales of about 3m Laidlaw shares. Within a few weeks of the short sales, Laidlaw announced a sharp drop in revenues and earnings. Seakist then covered its short positions, earning a gross profit of about CDollars 16.5m. The OSC alleged Mr DeGroote knew that Laidlaw's earnings would be lower than earlier forecasts, and he was aware of mounting tensions between the company and ADT, the international security systems and car auction group in which Laidlaw is the largest single shareholder. Mr DeGroote has insisted that he had no material undisclosed information about Laidlaw. His lawyer said that the loan to Seakist was not illegal, but that Mr DeGroote 'is tarnished by an error of judgment that will continue to haunt him'. Mr DeGroote has accepted the settlement to avoid a 'lengthy, intensive and emotionally draining' hearing. The others involved in the case did not dispute the OSC's charges. Mr DeGroote, who now lives in Bermuda, spearheaded Laidlaw's growth from a small Ontario trucking company into one of North America's largest waste services and school bus operators. The insider-trading allegations are not the first controversy over Mr DeGroote's departure from Laidlaw. He sold his Laidlaw shares to Canadian Pacific near the peak of the market and shortly after leaving, started a new waste-management firm.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR BRADLEY SNUBS MOLINA, BACKS TORRES IN SUPERVISOR RACE  </P> <P> Snubbing a City Hall colleague, Mayor Tom Bradley on Tuesday endorsed state  Sen. Art Torres for Los Angeles County supervisor from a field of nine  candidates that includes Councilwoman Gloria Molina.  </P> <P> Torres' campaign advisers said the endorsement would carry weight not only in  Los Angeles city neighborhoods that make up about one-fourth of the new 1st  District, but in other communities as well.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of people who don't live in the city who think Tom Bradley is  their mayor," said Dee Dee Myers, spokeswoman for Torres, a Los Angeles  Democrat.  </P> <P> Molina sought to turn Bradley's support of Torres to her advantage.  </P> <P> "Tom Bradley demands an absolute kind of loyalty, and that is something I don't  provide to anyone," she said. "I have enjoyed my independence on the council."  </P> <P> Molina said she did not seek Bradley's endorsement, but conceded that it would  help Torres. The councilwoman questioned the extent of the help, contending  that the mayor's popularity has declined because of his political problems.  </P> <P> Torres said the mayor's endorsement "means that I can get along with people at  every level of government."  </P> <P> Molina and Torres are seeking to become the county's first Latino supervisor  this century in the Jan. 22 election. Other candidates include state Sen.  Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) and Sarah Flores, a former aide to Supervisor  Pete Schabarum. The new district was carved out by a federal judge who ruled  that the old district lines denied the county's 3 million Latinos political  representation.  </P> <P> Bradley said his endorsement came as the result of a long friendship with  Torres.  </P> <P> "He and I have been friends and mutual supporters," the mayor said. "I've known  him for almost as long as I've been in politics. I admire him for his vision  and for his courage and for his creativity. . . . I believe that he will bring  to the board progressive, forward-thinking ideas and the ability to make  friends and to work together with the city."  </P> <P> Asked about Molina, Bradley said: "I'm here to support Art Torres, not to talk  in a negative fashion about any other candidate."  </P> <P> The other major candidates downplayed the endorsement.  </P> <P> Flores issued a press release listing her endorsements from 58 mayors and city  council members within the new 1st District.  </P> <P> Calderon said: "I never sought Bradley's endorsement because I don't believe  it's important. . . . It puts Art Torres in an interesting position. He has  taken a strong stance criticizing the city of Los Angeles for dumping over 70%  of its garbage in the San Gabriel Valley and then he turns around and goes to  get the endorsement of its chief."  </P> <P> Torres responded: "You're going to have sour grapes from any candidate who  doesn't receive the support of Tom Bradley. . . . The people in the San Gabriel  Valley know and respect Tom Bradley. The people in Los Angeles know and respect  Tom Bradley."  </P></p>

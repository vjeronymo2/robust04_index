			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Arts: Film-makers baptised in fire - Nigel Andrews talks to director Chen Kaige about the true cultural revolution going on in China We know how an individual recovers from a nightmare. He wakes up, turns on the bedside light, stares round at comforting reality: soon the horrors start to disperse. But how does a nation recover - especially from a nightmare that began as a dream? 'I really believed in Mao a long time ago,' says film-maker Chen Kaige, whose Cannes Golden Palm-winning epic of Chinese history Farewell My Concubine opened in Britain this week. 'Everybody did. We had no other reference points to the outside world. We had never been out of China. We believed in communism like Nature.' And they believed right up to, and into, the Cultural Revolution. Like any nightmare, though, this one finally got bad enough to wake everyone up. Farewell My Concubine's half-century-spanning story of two rival Peking Opera actors ends in 1977, after the Gang of Four were arrested and the CR reached official fade-out. But the horror of that period gives Chen's film its dramatic last act, shock-punctuated with betrayals, arrests, show trials and summary deaths. And in men like Chen himself, Zhang Yimou (Raise The Red Lantern) and Tian Zhuangzhuang (Horse Thief) China's agonies have given China a generation of film-makers, baptised in fire, who have become the greatest and bravest in its history. Chen's debut feature Yellow Earth (1984) began it all. It was the first Chinese film anyone could remember that portrayed real people in real, remote landscapes. 'The land where we shot the film,' he says, 'was the birthplace of so-called 'Chinese civilisation.' And incidentally of the Communist party. Yet cameras had almost never been there before. When I got there I was shocked. People were very quiet, very guarded, very austere. Yet reading their faces was like reading Chinese history.' Before Chen made Yellow Earth, the country's cinema had alternated big-screen melodramas - love and betrayal amid the cherry blossoms - with march-and-sing propaganda film bearing titles like 'Heroic Red Women Save The Jute Factory.' Farewell My Concubine wryly invokes both traditions. It is melodramatic; and it does allude, paradoxically, to the propagandist pageantry of Maoist cinema. But like all Chen's work - The Big Parade, Life On A String - Farewell takes the scenic route to enlightenment. It gives the devil his photogenic due before rendezvousing with truth, sense and freedom. It also counterpoints the public dream of Maoism with the private dreams of its unheroic 'hero.' A gay Peking Opera actor who plays the Queen on stage to his rival and idol's King, he suffers not just for his art but for his homosexuality. 'He's the guy who cannot make a difference between real life and life on stage,' Chen says. 'He's a beautiful dreamer, he lives like ET.' ET? 'Yes, he comes from another planet. He cannot get on with ordinary people. He lives in his art, and finally he sacrifices himself for his art.' But why set that sacrifice in 1977 - surely the year of hope and emancipation for China? 'This man belonged to the old times. Farewell My Concubine is not just a political story, it's an artistic one. He was coming into a new age where he knew he would not belong. He would not be useful or comfortable. 'Today Chinese Opera is dying. The government tries to play patron, but it doesn't work. The life style on which Opera is based is gone. We used to be very close as a community, the Chinese people. Where I lived, I could hear the people curse in the next room. We'd say 'Hello' to each other every morning. It's not the same in modern-day China. In the old days you could ring an Opera troupe and say, 'Lets have a performance in the courtyard]' 'Peking Opera was an amazing form, so dedicated, and so enclosed] If you talk to old performers as I did, you find they knew nothing about the outside world or politics. But when they talk about Opera their eyes and faces come alight. They're dreamers, like my hero.' But experienced dreamers also know when a dream is ending. Killing himself on stage in the film's last scene, perhaps Chen's hero senses the distant shadow of Tiananmen Square, reaching out to choke the hopes of those who believed that tyranny might have vanished with Mao. For Chen it has never vanished. His recent films were made with non-Chinese finance and initially banned in China. Yet he and his contemporaries have gone on making films that hammer against the walls of silence and intolerance in their country, walls raised during the 25 years of Mao's rule. 'Maoism was a beautiful dream of establishing a new world, a new society. We all tried to believe in it. And we did believe in it, up until the Cultural Revolution. 'What you see in Farewell about that period is true. People started to denounce and betray each other. I denounced my own father when I was 14. He was accused of being a secret agent for the Kuo-Min-Tang (Chinese Nationalists). It wasn't true. But the point is, people lived in fear. Fear of being kicked out from society. So to stay in society they needed to denounce other people to prove their loyalty. That's how Mao ran the country.' Now a quarter century after Mao let 'a thousand flowers bloom,' in order to search out and cut down the nonconformist shoots, a band of cinematic survivors has created something like a true cultural revolution. Last year Chinese film-makers were the most prolific prize-winners on the festival circuit, snapping up the Golden Lion/Bear/Palm consecutively at Venice, Berlin and Cannes. 'There was one very emotional moment in Cannes,' says Chen. 'An American journalist asked me, 'You young film-makers in China have made such great progress, how do you feel about this?' The answer is, we have been working towards this for ten years] I was very emotional, I almost cried. Only I and other young directors know how difficult it has been. You have to fight enemies you don't even know; you're attacked from every direction. That is why as a generation we are pretty strong. I'm sad to say it, but we are strong.'</p>

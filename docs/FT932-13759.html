			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Tarmac venture wins Pounds 85m order AN Anglo-US joint venture involving Tarmac, Britain's biggest construction and building materials group, is part of a consortium which has won an Pounds 85m order to build a 100MW gas-turbine power station in Brunei. Tarmac, Black &amp; Veatch, the US power plant engineers, and General Electric of the US which will supply turbines, are to build the power station in Bandar Seri Begawan, the Brunei capital. It will be close to the existing Gadong power station. Tarmac and Black &amp; Veatch two years ago formed TBV Power to bid for power station work. The Brunei deal takes the value of orders won by the joint venture to almost Pounds 360m. Mr Brian Staples, chief executive of Tarmac, said the contract could pave the way for other orders in the south-east Asian market. TBV Power is exploring opportunities in countries such as Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia. Construction in Brunei is due to start almost immediately and is expected to be completed by spring 1995.</p>

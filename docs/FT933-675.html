			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Late-paying debtors - right to interest is necessary, but perhaps unenforceable Sir, Comments on the damage done to small businesses by the late payment of invoices have abounded in your columns. As a small company working with customers of all sizes, we have never experienced such problems; indeed, we have survived the recession with improved cash flow and no bad debts. Our secret? Simply a bookkeeper who takes the trouble to ring and ask - very politely and, if necessary, very regularly - for our money. Legalised interest charges will be unenforceable for most of us. Talking to our customers about our money is a cultural inhibition; moaning about it, it seems, is not. Martin Conradi, Showcase Presentations, 6 Buckingham Street, London WC2N 6BU</p>

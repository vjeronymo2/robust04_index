			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Sainsbury to deputise for Heseltine MR Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is continuing to make good progress in hospital in Venice following his mild heart attack earlier this week, his department said yesterday. It is expected that he will fly back to the UK in the next few days and will undergo further medical tests. During Mr Heseltine's absence, ministers at the DTI will continue to fulfil the responsibilities described in their portfolios and to represent the department as appropriate at cabinet committees. Mr Tim Sainsbury, DTI minister of state, will attend cabinet meetings as the department's most senior minister. Mr Sainsbury will also take responsibility for issues requiring a decision by a minister. His responsibilities cover areas such as industrial competitiveness; electronics and mechanical engineering; aerospace; shipbuilding and regional development. Trade minister Mr Richard Needham told a conference of 120 business people yesterday that they should target the Asia Pacific Rim for energy exports. Mr Needham said the area offered an unequalled rate of development and while British industry had made some inroads, more could be done.</p>

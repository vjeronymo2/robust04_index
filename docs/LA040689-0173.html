			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST INTERSTATE JOINS OPEN-SATURDAY CLUB  </P> <P> First Interstate Bank joined the herd Wednesday, announcing that its 321  branches statewide will be open on Saturdays, beginning in May.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based bank was the last of the state's five biggest banks to  decide to open its branches on Saturdays. The hours will be from 9 a.m. to 1  p.m. and the branches will offer full services.  </P> <P> Within the past week, Bank of America, Security Pacific, Wells Fargo and Union  Bank all have announced plans to open their branches on Saturdays, beginning  April 15.  </P> <P> First Interstate said its move to Saturdays was in response to customer surveys  and to the decision by the other big California banks to increase their  business hours. Many smaller independent banks have maintained Saturday hours  for years.  </P> <P> First Interstate said additional branch employees may be hired, but that staff  costs are not expected to increase significantly. First Interstate is in the  midst of a companywide cost-cutting campaign.  </P> <P> While the other four banks also have extended their weekday hours, First  Interstate did not and will continue to be open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday  through Friday.  </P></p>

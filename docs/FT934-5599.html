			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (3): Buzzwords GEOGRAPHICAL information systems (GIS) are computer systems that use spatial and topographical data as an element, usually in a database. Like may acronyms, it is undergoing a change, driven by the broadening scope of GIS: some argue that it should now stand for Geographical Information Science. CDM - corporate data modelling (see Horsham story, page 12 in this survey). This is modelling exercise for data which determines, in simplest terms, what is located where, and what its relationships are with other data items and systems. EUROSTAT - Statistical Offices of the European Community - holds five million series of data relating to all members of the European Community and other countries, currently moving towards harmonisation of geographical data for such applications as agricultural (Common Agricultural Policy) administration. GPS - Geographical Positioning Systems provides global or local co-ordinates of a position from satellite readings. A vet or animal health inspector, for example, might carry a laptop, which can read a specific co-ordinate for the location of a herd with a disease. Also used in yachting for navigation systems, and more recently for mobile security and anti-theft devices on cars. RASTER and VECTOR graphics formats are suited to different sorts of graphical information. Raster information is easily scanned (captured) and expressed as dots or pixels on the screen, such as colour television and games machines. Raster deals well with solid blocks of colour, but needs high-volume storage. VECTOR is graphics data expressed as lines or vectors. Every piece of data in a vector picture is a line. This is suited to maps, drawings, building layouts, technical drawings. The conversion of raster to vector is an extremely expensive process because of the intelligence needed to recognising shapes - for example, a circle.</p>

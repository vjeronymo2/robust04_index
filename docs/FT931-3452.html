			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Profits begin at home HSBC Holdings is clearly pleased with the diversification represented by last year's acquisition of Midland Bank. But the 68 per cent increase to Pounds 1.01bn in the Hongkong Bank's attributable profits shows where the group's most dynamic growth still lies. Even without the currency conversion factor and the Pounds 270m gain from the sale of the Cathay Pacific stake, income in the Asia-Pacific region continues strong. Midland is unlikely ever to match the Hongkong Bank's astonishing return on average shareholders' funds of over 30 per cent. The danger remains of over-estimating the bank's resilience if the Asian boom falters. At some stage, though probably not before 1994, rising US interest rates and narrower margins on Hong Kong business could produce a noticeable dent, especially if the political situation remains tense. Midland's profits should rise as provisions fall. HSBC's computer systems could bring remarkable efficiency gains, but they will take years to flow through and the bulk of the cost-cutting in Midland is complete. HSBC may thus not yet have found the complete answer to its diversification dilemma. It is still heavily dependent on its volatile traditional market. The eventual answer might yet be to float all or part of the Hong Kong operation locally. The bank says nothing could be further from its mind when it is making so much money there. Indeed, but the chance could vanish for good if political trouble really strikes.</p>

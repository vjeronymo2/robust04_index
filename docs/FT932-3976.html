			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Arts: Today's Television The schedules are packed with repeats, and Fridays are no longer saved by 'Have I Got News For You' which ended its run last week with a tub of lard standing in for Roy Hattersley who, we were told, had failed to turn up for the third time. Thus it is an excellent day for taking advantage of the long evenings and getting to work in the garden. You could wear a Walkman and listen to The Movie Quiz on Radio 2 (7.00) ..stick the mobile phone in your pocket and you could even take part and win yourself a year's cinema pass for two. Switch to Radio 3 at 7.30 and you can listen to the BBC Philharmonic In Cambridge playing music by four contemporary Cambridge composers: Alexander Goehr, Hugh Wood, Thomas Ades (who graduated from King's last year with a double starred first) and Robin Holloway. Flick over to Radio 4 when that ends and you will catch the final part of John Diamond's programme about the week's newspapers, Stop Press and then a repeat of Kaleidoscope's award-winning programme 'Larks Ascending' about Vaughan Williams' evocation of the British countryside (9.15).</p>

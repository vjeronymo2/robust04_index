			<p>BFN     [Text] When President Yeltsin travels to the Far East on  June 14, he may take a decision to build a Russian space center  at Svobodny 18, a town in the Amur region.    A spokesman for the Aero-Space Army Command disclosed to  Interfax on Saturday that Yeltsin, scheduled to visit Kyzyl,  Tuva (a republic within the Russian Federation) and  Blagoveschensk (the Amur region), would also go to Svobodny 18  for an on the spot decision on the construction of a space  center there.    He revealed that essential documents were currently being  drafted at the government's request to explain the need for such  a Far Eastern project.    At Svobodny 18, a town where a strategic missile division  was  once deployed, intensive work is underway to refurbish the  facilities. Launch sites are being remodelled there for small  aircraft of a Rokot type.    As the Aero-Space Force Commander Vladimir Ivanov has  reported, the first Rokot is to be launched in 1996 from one of  the five silos that has remained after the disbandment of the  division in line with START.    Subsequently, a new complex is to be built at Svobodny 18  for  an Angara-24 heavy booster, which will be superior to the  currently used Proton rocket since it is less polluting and can  launch heavier loads to orbit.</p>

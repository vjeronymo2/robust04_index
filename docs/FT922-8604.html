			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / US retailer all over the shop / Examining mounting criticism of Sears Roebuck Ed Brennan, a third-generation employee at Sears Roebuck who rose from the shop floor to become its chairman, sits in Chicago's 110-storey Sears Tower and ponders a question about capital expenditure. The carpet is thick, the view magnificent, and Mr Brennan does not appear to know the answer. An adviser interjects. The required figure will be disclosed in the retail and financial services group's annual report. Perhaps he could search it out and communicate later? Mr Brennan, mollified, delivers a homily on the dangers of statistics. By chance, an identical conversation arose weeks earlier. The setting was the spartan headquarters of Wal-Mart, an aggressive discount chain which recently ousted Sears as America's top-selling retailer. Don Soderquist, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, had nipped into a neighbouring office, cornered the finance director, and extracted the answer. It took two minutes and there was no minder in sight. The comparison may seem trivial but it epitomises much of the criticism surrounding Sears. Struggle as the 106-year-old behemoth may to cut costs and streamline operations, it is still dogged by inefficiency and overmanning. The antique furniture does not shift easily and the paternalistic attitudes of top corporate officers seem equally fixed. 'The central issue is culture,' says Edward Weller, retail industry observer at Montgomery Securities, a San Francisco broker. 'Sears was so caught up in its post-war success that when the world passed it by in the 1970s, the company didn't know it.' Criticism of Sears has been mounting over the past five years, since its peak profits after tax of Dollars 1.63bn in 1987. The company - which employs more people than any US corporation except General Motors  - has been on a slide since then, making less money last year than in 1983. Its share price has oscillated around the Dollars 40 mark for four years after a high of Dollars 59.5 in 1987. Not surprisingly, investors are unhappy; some have complained vociferously. At its annual general meeting on Thursday, five separate 'dissident' motions are on the agenda. Mr Brennan knows there will be trouble. Already some of his opponents have spoken out publicly. These include the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), one of the biggest institutional investors in the US; some of the sales agents for Allstate, Sears' large insurance subsidiary; and Robert Monks, a professional shareholder activist, who tried to win a board seat at Sears 12 months ago. Battle lines have been drawn. On one side, Mr Brennan will be challenged by his critics to field an adequate 'industrial' defence in terms of improved operating performance and to outline strategies to recoup lost territory. On the other, the dissidents will be trying to take advantage of the changing climate of US corporate governance to give shareholders greater influence on the company through independent board directors. Against this background of declining performance and mounting disenchantment, Sears' problems should be put in perspective. Having started out as a catalogue operation in the 1880s, it had come to symbolise 'mainstream America' by the mid-1950s and by the 1960s was able to state bluntly: 'We are not a store for the whimsical or affluent . . . We are not a store which anticipates . . . We reflect the world of Middle America.' The roaring Eighties, followed by the recession-hit Nineties, have presented two distinct challenges. First, after a sharp rise in consumer spending and expansion in US retail space, Sears turned to consumer-based financial services. In 1981, at a cost of Dollars 800m, it added the Dean Witter Reynolds investment banking firm and Coldwell Banker property services to Allstate, the large composite insurer it already owned. 'Stocks 'n' Socks', muttered Wall Street rather derisively. In its zest to become all things to all men, Sears overlooked the trend of the US retail market. Specialty retailers, or 'category killers', started coming into their own in the late 1980s and stealing business from department stores. Toys 'R' Us is probably the best-known example in the UK  -but in electronics, the pattern was repeated by Circuit City, in fashion by the likes of Nordstrom. More recently, a second trend has emerged. Discount retailers, led by Wal-Mart, and the warehouse clubs (out-of-town barns, selling at rock-bottom prices to a membership customer base) are making the running. 'Value' has become the buzzword: quality, branded goods at the lowest price. On both scores, Sears has been slow to respond. At the end of the 1980s, it introduced 'power formating', dividing the business into seven areas: appliances and electronics, home improvement, automotive, home furnishings, women's fashions, children clothing and men's apparel. Each was to have its own distinctive space and image within the overall store. In the case of electronics, for example, Sears effectively developed an in-house boutique, Brand Central, and broke with tradition by introducing rival name brands alongside its own strong Kenmore appliance brand. On the price front, Sears actually closed its doors for two days in 1989 to adjust prices across the board. Amid much fanfare, it re-opened and declared its commitment to a policy of 'everyday low pricing'. But such catch-up moves did not address the retailer's deep-seated flaws. A far more fundamental change was needed if Sears was to match its rivals. In 1989, Sears' expenses accounted for 30 cents in every dollar of sales; at Kmart, the figure was 23 cents, and at Wal-Mart, 16 cents. Worse, Sears' bureaucracy, especially on the merchandising side, was cumbersome. There was, for example, one raft of head office buyers, with marketing staff who talked to the stores; store managers who took responsibility for the profits of their properties, and who picked what they wanted from the buyers' lists; and then regional store managers who had responsibility over the store managers, and their own marketing operations. Inevitably, suppliers would find the head office buyers and regional managers at odds, and the supply chain would stagnate. Shifting this juggernaut's course has not been quick or easy. On one hand, Mr Brennan says 275 stores out of 860 'will essentially have the ingredients of the power format by the end of 1992'. (This could mean a full-scale revamp or a more superficial division of existing floor-space). When asked about the pace of further change, he prefers to stress spin-off merchandising benefits over hard numbers relating to the group's performance. The cost picture is no clearer. More than 40,000 jobs have been axed since Mr Brennan resumed direct responsibility for the retail division in August 1990, including those of the regional managers. But Sears' competitors still have an average five-point cost advantage. 'Their expenses (are) running at about 23 cents on the dollar while ours are at 28 cents,' Mr Brennan acknowledged. (The 1991 figure stood at 29.2 cents for Sears). This disparity prompted Sears to commission a 'benchmarking' study - in essence, a detailed comparison with other retailers' organisational structures, with particular emphasis on staffing and costs. The results? 'There will be additional jobs to go,' says Mr Brennan. 'It's a very difficult task to realign a business. In some areas we're at the end of the job losses.' He refused to discuss numbers. To date, the earnings figures show little benefit from Mr Brennan's strategy. After-tax profits fell to a low of Dollars 902m in 1990, before rebounding to Dollars 1.28bn last year. At first glance, the merchandising division appeared to mirror this improvement; its profits, Dollars 787m in 1987, advanced from Dollars 257m in 1990 to Dollars 486m in 1991. But within this figure, domestic retail operations made just Dollars 90m, and Dollars 394m came from the credit business. This, moreover, was on turnover of Dollars 25bn. Significantly better figures are expected this year; earnings per share are forecast to top Dollars 4.50, compared with Dollars 3.71 in 1991. This will be partly due to cost savings on the retail side; partly to a rebound at Allstate; and partly to strong figures from Dean Witter. Before competitors start rubbing their hands in glee on Thursday, they should pause. Only one alternative strategy has been mooted to pull Sears out of the mire - spinning off the financial services companies as a separately quoted stockmarket entity. In share price terms, a demerger could look attractive. One observer reckons the retail division and financial services companies, traded separately, might be worth Dollars 57-Dollars 66 a share (before the allocation of corporate overheads). Operationally, the advantages are debatable. There is potential for an increased amount of cross-selling between Allstate and Sears the merchandiser but at present the two groups only generate a small percentage of each others' total revenues. The demerger study proposal is the third preference on a list of five ideas being put forward by dissidents on Thursday, says Mr Monk, who has contacted 300 institutional shareholders (see graphic). The dissidents face one other crucial problem in battling for reform. About 22 per cent of Sears' shares are held by employee profit-sharing plans whose trustees are appointed by the board. Sears' critics know they have little chance of securing support from this block. The most they can realistically expect is a strong protest vote. That, at least, might send signals to the board which, apart from Mr Brennan, is composed of non-executives. Mr Monks cites recent ousting by directors of chairman Robert Stempel as head of the executive board committee at General Motors as a sign of a changing climate. 'I think the GM action removes every modicum of a doubt that a board is required to take responsibility. In the past, it has usually gone along with management.' Given the record of inaction at Sears, it is possible that nothing will be done to appease shareholders. The company cannily reduced board numbers from 15 to 10 last year, and the figure is now nine - despite promises to bring in new blood. These remaining directors may be inclined to give Mr Brennan the benefit of the doubt until the results of his strategy are clearer. But the raised voices of the critics will not be silenced if the company gives any further ground to its competitors. If Sears does not find a way to reach into the hearts and purses of middle America, Mr Brennan may discover that magnificent views do not necessarily make magnificent companies.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------               SEARS ROEBUCK: THE TOWERING INFERNO  --------------------------------------------------------------------- With Sears Roebuck's dissidents are asking for: *Increase confidentiality of shareholder voting process *Split responsibilities of chairman and chief executive *Call in independent investment bankers to study break-up values  (demerger idea) *Directors to be elected annually, reather than current staggered  three-year board terms *Directors to own at least 2,000 shares each  --------------------------------------------------------------------- After-tax profit (loss)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds m                          1991     1990    1989   1988   1987 Merchandise group                  486      257     647    524    787   Domestic stores                   90       37     292    240    503   Credit                           394      330     288    325    263  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Allstate Insurance group           722      701     815    953    946  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Dean Witter                        345      233     166     86    (40)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group   61       26     127     90    129  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Corporate &amp; inter-group   transactions                    (335)    (315)   (246)  (199)  (189)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                            1,279      902   1,509  1,454  1,633  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

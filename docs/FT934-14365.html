			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Private View: The man who put religion back in Russia THREE babushki peering through a picket fence at the rubble of a dynamited church changed the life of Michael Bourdeaux. He was serving as an Anglican curate in Middlesex when his former tutor passed him samizdat documents obtained via Paris. The documents described how a group of Orthodox monks in the Ukraine, branded by the Communist authorities as homosexual, drunk, parasitic vagrants, had been evicted from the Pachaev Lavra monastery and dumped in the forest. The curate decided to investigate. He was a Russophile who had learned the language as an 18-year-old national serviceman. After modern languages and theology at Oxford he had spent a year at Moscow University among the children of the Soviet elite, one the first British students to profit from a cultural agreement between Nikita Krushchev and Harold Macmillan. 'I had no agenda, no illusions,' he says of that time. 'Some of my very best friends were members of the Komsomol. What I learned about Russia I did not learn from books but from conversations with ordinary people - plus my own two feet.' One of the things he learned was that Krushchev, to appease hardliners upset by his denunciation of Stalin, had instituted a campaign of religious repression fiercer than anything since the 1930s. So when the samizdat fell into his hands four years later, in 1964, he sought out friends in Moscow. They directed him to the ruins of the church of St Peter and Paul, blown up the previous week. 'The atmosphere on the square was appalling. Everyone was frightened. Around the rubble there was a wooden fence and some old women were looking through. I went up to one of them and asked: 'Can you tell me what's happened?' 'She jumped.' Canon Michael Bourdeaux threw his arms in the air to illustrate. 'I said: 'I am a foreigner. If you're afraid, don't worry, I won't talk to you.' She turned to me: 'Afraid? On the contrary, we need you.' She put her arm on my shoulder and said 'Come with us.'' Keeping a discreet distance, Bourdeaux followed the women to a house in the suburbs. They asked him why he had come to Russia. He said he was a Christian who wanted to find out about the persecution. Pressed further, he told them about the Ukrainian documents. 'They asked who wrote them. I named the three authors. They just collapsed in tears and said: 'We wrote those documents.'' To discharge this personal commission, as he calls it, Canon Bordeaux decided that, rather than campaign, he should set up an academic research body to monitor religious freedom in what was then the Soviet bloc. He and Keston Research are acknowledged experts and, although financially depleted by the collapse of Communism, continue to watch developments. But Bordeaux, who devoted his life to the cause of religious freedom, is today disappointed to the point of bitterness by events in post-Communist Russia. 'One of the great moments of human history has been missed,' he told me this week. 'It was the great ecumenical opportunity of the 20th century and it's been blown because of the hardness of the attitude of the Orthodox hierarchy. They were quite unprepared for freedom.' Is that because they were puppets of the old regime? 'Only a number, a very small number. But there was a kind of Soviet mind-set within the hierarchy. When the system collapsed they felt the great moment had arrived for re-establishing the unchallenged supremacy of Orthodoxy. 'That's not how it is, and it's not how it's going to be in the future Russia. Russia is going to be a pluralistic society. I love deeply the Orthodox church and its tradition but I do not love its attitude.' The Russian Orthodox is at loggerheads with the Roman Catholics and alarmed by the success of western evangelical sects - especially dollar-backed American imports. Its leaders have been pressing Boris Yeltsin to sign a statute passed by the demolished parliament that would re-create a state watchdog body, require religions to re-register and restrict the proselytism of the interlopers. If the mediation of Patriarch Alexi II had not failed, and the tanks not moved against the White House, that law might be in force. Aren't some manifestations of the religious revival rather ugly: the nationalism, for example? 'What you describe is the fringe of a fringe. That has nothing to do with the heartbeat of Orthodoxy. Pamyat (the ultra-nationalist movement) uses religion for its own purposes.' What about anti-semitism? 'That has got slightly further into the churches. I have heard Russian bishops come out with anti-semitic remarks which would be totally unacceptable in a western society, and they are not even aware of what they're saying. There is anti-semitism. It's there in Russian society.' Is religion not a disruptive factor in a country trying to achieve democratic stability? 'I couldn't agree with that. Because religion, at least potentially, is a uniting factor rather than a divisive one. What one looks for, but at the moment doesn't find, is a Christian leadership which says Christians are going to be very positive.' Isn't Russian Christianity rather primitive? 'I think the answer to that has to be a qualified 'yes'. This is not entirely its own fault. There was a great element of superstition in it before the Revolution, alongside a lot that was good. The ethics and morals were admirable. Communism threw out the superstition and threw out the good as well. 'Christianity actually led the way in the democratic process in Russia,' he continued. 'It played a far greater role in keeping the flame of freedom alight than you realise.' Religious dissidents, including Jews, had helped inspire secular democrats in and out of prison, he said. Lithuanian demonstrators shot on the streets of Vilnius in 1991 were all Christians. So the Kremlin was right to fear Christianity? 'I used to say Christians only wanted to improve things in society, not overthrow it. I must have said that hundreds of times in public. Now I am not quite sure I was right.' What Bourdeaux fears most is an alliance between former communists - 'even the best like Yeltsin' - and the would-be theocrats of the Orthodox Church. 'I would be terrified of that, a unity between church and state.' You'd get a sort of fascism? 'Yes, you could have a kind of Russian nationalist fascism, backed by the church. There are elements in the church that would welcome it.' Do you believe that only religion can provide the moral basis for democracy? 'The human race has not evolved any more stable or satisfactory system of governing a society than one where the basic social morality is based on the Christian faith. 'There is a tremendous possibility for implementing precisely that in Russia today. That is why I am so profoundly disturbed and shocked that the different Christian groups are not able to work with each other.' Do you mean atheism is not a moral position? 'I would say yes to that. Individual atheists have a strong individual morality - I wouldn't dream of saying otherwise. But there is no sufficiently common set of principles within humanism or atheism for society as a whole.' Does that mean our increasingly atheistic democracies in the West will fail? 'Don't ask me to analyse our own society,' the canon replied. 'But what disturbs me is this tremendous instability. The Church - and I don't see where else it's going to come from - has been unable to give young people a kind of social cohesion. I don't see that our politicians are solving that problem - and certainly our church leaders are not solving it either.'</p>

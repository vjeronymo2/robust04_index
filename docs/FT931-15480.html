			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ratners cautious on annual results RATNERS, the heavily- indebted jewellery retailer, said yesterday that its UK operating profits rose more than 20 per cent in December, despite a 27 per cent fall in sales in the month. Christmas 1991 had been a time of heavy price cutting. This was a more positive trading statement than had been expected and the group's shares rose 1 1/4 p to 13p. However, Ratners warned that the financial year to the end of this month would show pre-tax losses at about the same level as last year's Pounds 24.4m, before exceptional charges, which were Pounds 98m last time. The loss forecast disappointed analysts, who were expecting a lower figure. Mr James McAdam, executive chairman, said the figures for December showed the trading strategy of going for margins rather than volume was working. Mr Gerald Ratner, the former chief executive who left suddenly in November, was thought not to have agreed with this strategy. Mr McAdam said the group's results were within limits agreed with its bankers last summer, when they promised to maintain borrowing facilities until June this year. He was confident that new arrangements could be reached with bankers. Mr McAdam said savings of Pounds 50m had been achieved in 1992-93 and stocks had been cut by Pounds 60m. But he warned of a provision in the year's figures for further rationalisation of about Pounds 20m. The annual figures would show an operating profit in the US and a loss in the UK, Ratners said. In the US sales in December fell 8 per cent. Group sales in the 11 months to the end of December were down 18 per cent. Mr McAdam said group debt would be about Pounds 250m at the year end at constant exchange rates, but would rise when the dollar debt was translated at actual exchange rates.</p>

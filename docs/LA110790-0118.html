			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE: HIGH-TECH FLASH-FORWARD  </P> <P> THE SHOW: "The Flash"(CBS) Thursday 8:30 p.m.  </P> <P> THE SET-UP: Police scientist Barry Allen (John Wesley Shipp, pictured) fights  evil in mythical Central City in this stylishly noir series that looks  something like "Batman," the feature film released last year. Amanda Pays plays  Tina McGee, our hero's budding love interest and a pushy research scientist who  helps him discover his superhuman power. Pays is on familiar high-tech ground  here, having played baby sitter for mutant male Max Headroom.  </P> <P> THE LOOK: The coolest article of clothing in the show is Shipp's heroic body  suit, an eye-catching brick-red number complete with muscle-enhancing black  shadows air brushed onto the pecs. There are four Flash suits, custom molded to  Shipp's body at $25,000 apiece. Designer Robert Short, an Oscar-winning special  effects/makeup artist, says the latex suits were specially treated to play down  their rubber surface so they would look like basic stretch unitards. And, he  says, they're hot inside. Shipp gets around that problem by wearing an  undergarment that is water cooled, like one developed for race car drivers.  This keeps him from swimming in sweat. Pays may be an aggressive career woman,  but she wears decidedly unaggressive clothing, especially retro '30s and '40s  long tapered skirts, pleated slacks and vests. Bob Miller, costumer in charge  of the show's everyday outfits, mixes modern with vintage styles from Warner  Bros. wardrobe department.  </P> <P> THE LABELS: A galaxy of designers, from Californian Tina Hagen to Giorgio  Armani and Ralph Lauren are mixed and matched.  </P> <P> THE STORES: Along with stock from Warner Bros. costume department, and a rental  shop, the Costume Rental Collection, available only for the trade, Miller shops  the California Mart and finds suits for male characters at Neiman Marcus (the  Byblos label) and the Shoe and Clothing Connection in Encino (WilliWear).

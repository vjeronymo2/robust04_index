			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Capt. Oleksandr Dranikov: "Garrison Life: A </F> Concerned Individual's View: Are Secrets the Only Thing Being  Protected From Outsider Eyes in the Zaporizhzhya Garrison's Air  Defense Unit?"]    [Text] "Did you say the military unit?" asked the old man.  "I usually walk through its territory on my way home from the  bus stop. It's closer that way because it saves me walking  around," continued my guide. Exchanging the customary phrases  about the weather and the price of bread, we found ourselves  near a gray fence.    "You need to go that way," said my new acquaintance and  pointed to the right.    "What about you?" I asked, knowing that the old man also had  to cross the territory of the military unit.    "No-o-o," he drawled. "I pass through a hole in the fence,  not through the checkpoint [kontrolno-propusknyy punkt]."    With that we parted. About two hundred meters away, I saw a  rickety white-and-blue gate, behind which I could see the parade  ground. My arrival elicited no reaction from the soldiers at the  checkpoint. The duty officer [cherhovyy chastyny], who stood  next to them, also showed no special interest in the unknown  officer. A live broadcast of the Winter Olympic Games was being  shown on television. I remembered the talkative grandfather and  thought to myself: "The old man needn't have crawled through his  hole; he could have walked through the checkpoint without  bending his back, both literally and figuratively." No one  stopped me; only the need to find out where I could find the  commander forced me to introduce myself to the duty officer  [cherhovyy chastyny]. So much about what actually happened.    In theory, however, the relevant officials of the SAM  brigade  vigilantly supervise compliance with the checkpoint regime and  thereby, the protection of military secrets.    On my second day on this assignment, I was asked to submit  my  pass allowing me to work in the operational units. Inasmuch as I  did not have one, I was refused permission to visit the  battalion on duty. There's no finding fault with that. Colonel  Shetulskyy, the deputy commander of the brigade, was acting in  accordance with his orders and instructions. I had to be content  with collecting materials in the support subunits and staff  offices.    However, it was not the wounded pride of a journalist that  compelled me to take up my pen. I simply began to have some  doubts: Are military secrets the only thing being protected from  outsider eyes in the unit?    About an hour before a trip that ultimately did not take  place (and they did not ask to see my pass until almost the  moment before I was to get into the car that was leaving for the  garrison of a group of battalions, the brigade's officers told  me that the buildings of the officer personnel of the battalions  were extremely badly heated. The temperature in the apartments  never rises above 18 degrees, and then only if electric heaters  are used. Virtually all the residents use electric heaters, as a  result of which power in the electric circuits falls to 150  volts, causing power failures.    In addition, the children of the officers are not always  able  to get to school. Because of fuel shortages, the school bus did  not operate on a regular schedule. This circumstance became the  subject of serious discussion at the corps commander level.  Following this, the situation improved. "Internal reserves" were  found at brigade headquarters. But after a month or two, the  children were once again running about the base instead of  attending school.    Obviously, the fuel situation is critical. Even the training  of the launcher crews has to be conducted in the manner of  "simulate manually, what the machine would do". Although,  frankly, this kind of training is of little use. In order to  approach the launching equipment, the driver of the loading  vehicle must back up some 30 meters onto rails. This requires  practice, not simulation. The total distance that the loading  vehicle has to travel during training is only 200 meters. If  there is not enough gasoline to travel 200 meters, what hope is  there of transporting school children, who need to be driven ten  kilometers?    But not all the vehicles in the unit are laid up. There  seems  to be enough gasoline for the command vehicles. I saw for myself  that the "personalky" [personal use vehicles] do not spend too  much time in the car pool.    It is possible that things are not all that bad in the  brigade. But I cannot judge, because I did not see. The  "facilities" were not the only thing I was not allowed to visit;  they did not let me into the residential zone of the base of the  battalion group [mistechko hrupy dyvizioniv], nor into the  soldiers' barracks. I have reported only what I learned from the  officers. Probably the laurels of the literary hero who loved to  bellow "No admittance!" give some officials no peace.</p>

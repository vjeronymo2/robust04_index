			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: French bank close to shake-up The French government is expected to finalise plans by the end of next month for a FFr3bn to FFr4bn (Dollars 508m-Dollars 678m) recapitalisation of Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled banking group. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who last year was appointed chairman of Credit Lyonnais with a brief to stabilise the bank following the aggressive expansion strategy pursued by Mr Jean Yves Haberer, his predecessor, has for months been in discussions with the economy ministry over the recapitalisation. Credit Lyonnais declined to comment on a report in yesterday's Les Echos, the French financial newspaper, that the recapitalisation would be completed before the announcement of its 1993 results in late March. However, government officials indicated that it should be concluded over the next few weeks. The recapitalisation follows months of uncertainty for Credit Lyonnais, which has been clouded by controversy over the write-offs left by Mr Haberer's loans policy. It fell into a net loss of FFr1.8bn in 1992 and made a net deficit of FFr1.05bn for the first half of 1993 when its capital ratio slipped to only just above the legal minimum of 8 per cent. Mr Peyrelevade is expected to make further hefty provisions for 1993 to clean up the balance sheet in preparation for Credit Lyonnais's privatisation. Analysts suspect that this would take the capital ratio below the minimum. The loss for 1993 could be FFr3bn to FFr4bn 'which suggests that Credit Lyonnais will need a capital injection of the same order', said Mr Stephane Arrouays, European banking analyst at BZW Securities. The French government, under fire from the European Commission over its latest FFr2.5bn recapitalisation plan for the Bull computer company, is thought to be anxious to restrict its direct capital injection into Credit Lyonnais to under FFr4bn. Other options include accelerating Credit Lyonnais's asset sales and floating off FFr25bn to FFr28bn of its property in a newly-formed state-controlled company. A similar scheme was implemented before the privatisation of the Credit Commercial de France banking group in 1987.</p>

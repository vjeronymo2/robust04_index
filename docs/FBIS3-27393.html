Second, by closely centering  on economic construction, we should make great effort to give  rise to a public opinion atmosphere of the whole party paying  attention to economic construction and should concentrate the  attention of all fields at higher and lower levels on the  central task of economic construction. All departments on  propaganda and ideological front should make full use of their  respective advantages to carry forward their role in theoretical  guidance, public opinion guidance, spiritual encouragement,  cultural appeal, and external propaganda with a view to adding  vigor to the province's economic development. Third, we should  give prominence to reform, increase the dynamics of propaganda,  and support reform in a clear-cut manner. Fourth, by closely  seizing the key link of emancipating the mind, in line with the  province's situation and the realities of respective localities,  we should guide the people with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  on the essence of socialism and the theory of socialist market  economy to truly make clear what is socialism, to foster a new  concept suiting the socialist market economy, and to make  innovations boldly and make progress positively. Fifth, we  should energetically advocate the main melody, improve the  quality of the people, and enhance the people's pioneering  spirit to create a good social environment for reform,  development, and stability. At present, we should particularly  exert great efforts in straightening out cultural market and  further perfecting the province's systems, rules, and  regulations on management of cultural market so as to orient the  management of cultural market to the orbit of  institutionalization and regularization as early as possible.  Sixth, we should always conduct propaganda and ideological work,  with the people as the mainstay, and with the purpose of  training new persons with lofty ideals, moral integrity,  education, and a sense of discipline.

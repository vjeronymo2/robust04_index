			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACUPUNCTURE FIGURE PLEADS NO CONTEST  </P> <P> Former state Acupuncture Examining Committee member Chae Woo Lew has pleaded no  contest to conspiracy charges in a far-reaching scheme to sell answers to the  state licensing exam for acupuncturists, district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi  Gibbons said.  </P> <P> So far 24 acupuncturists in Los Angeles have pleaded guilty in the scandal.  Another 20 await disposition in their cases.  </P> <P> In exchange for the no contest pleas entered Tuesday, prosecutors are likely to  drop 56 bribery charges filed against Lew, Gibbons said.  </P> <P> Lew, of San Mateo, could be sent to prison for four years when he is sentenced  Oct. 27. He was charged in February with bribery, conspiracy to commit bribery  and conspiracy to dissuade a witness. Prosecutors contended that Lew, 53, was  paid at least $500,000 to rig the state licensing exam from 1982 until 1988.  </P></p>

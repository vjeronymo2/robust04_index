			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Smithfield traders sign up for space The Corporation of London yesterday announced it had let more than 95 per cent of the trading space in the refurbished east building of the Smithfield meat market. This follows a long dispute over the rents for stalls in the market between the corporation and Smithfield market traders, who for several years refused to rent space in the new development. Smithfield's east building will open in January next year. The corporation said that it would soon start refurbishing the market's west building.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Letter: Ukraine's nuclear weapons stance correct Sir, Your editorial 'Nuclear rift over Ukraine' (May 5) is excellent. It is the first serious attempt to look at the issue of nuclear disarmament from the Ukrainian side as well. Any newly-independent country is bound to be somewhat sensitive about its independence. This applies particularly to Ukraine, which has waited for independence for more than 300 years and is now being told, rather unceremoniously, 'you hand over your nuclear weapons to the neighbouring country which has deprived you of your independence for a few centuries'. Ukraine did move its tactical nuclear weapons to the Russian Federation last year, the first such gesture that any country has made. Nobody seemed to say thank you. Now it is simply being beaten into handing over its strategic nuclear weapons. The reservations about this and signing the Start agreements and nuclear non-proliferation treaties should be understandable. First, the cost of moving these nuclear weapons, as you state yourself, is enormous and beyond the current financial capacity of Ukraine. Second, handing them over to a country which is politically fragile, which has had an imperialist past, and where many of the present leaders keep threatening Ukraine does not look overly appealing. Third, there seems to be no provision for allowing Ukraine a share of the proceeds from the sale of the materials. Finally, none of the nuclear powers seems to be willing to give a strong enough guarantee to Ukraine about the inviolability of its borders once the nuclear weapons are removed. Crude political pressure from abroad will merely increase the rank of those in Ukraine who advocate its holding on to nuclear weapons, at least for a while. This would be a pity, both for Ukraine and the rest of the world. Bohdan Hawrylyshyn, chairman, council of advisers to the parliament of Ukraine, CP 5, CH-1231 Geneva, Switzerland</p>

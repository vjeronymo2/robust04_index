			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SWEEPING OVERHAUL OF ARGENTINA'S ENERGY SECTOR URGED  </P> <P> A report by the World Bank urges Argentina to make a sweeping reorganization of  its energy sector to allow for more competition, more realistic pricing and a  greater participation of the private sector.  </P> <P> According to the report:  </P> <P> * Argentina's oil reserves are one-third lower than the country claims, and its  oil output could fall by almost 40% by the end of the century.  </P> <P> * Gas reserves, seen as the key to future energy development in the South  American nation, are also smaller than the Argentine state oil company has  calculated.  </P> <P> * Plans for additional nuclear power plants should be scrapped in favor of more  economical alternatives.  </P> <P> World Bank economists and oil industry analysts see an opportunity for  Argentina to expand its oil exploration and production in the wake of Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, which has led to a doubling in the price of oil.  </P> <P> Rafael Quijano, an analyst with the Petroleum Finance Company Ltd., a  consulting firm in Washington, said in a recent study for the U.S. Department  of Energy that only a small fraction of Argentina's territory, estimated at 10%  to 20%, has been tested for oil.  </P> <P> For Argentina to take advantage of the Middle East crisis, Quijano said, it  needs a coherent oil development policy.  </P> <P> The administration of President Carlos S. Menem, who took power in July, 1989,  is trying to liberalize traditional Argentine energy policies with "bold"  measures to spur domestic and foreign investment.  </P> <P> But Quijano contended that there now are too many policy conflicts among  Menem's ministers, and turf battles among the federal government and provincial  authorities, to entice foreign capital to participate in oil exploration and  production in Argentina.  </P> <P> Such participation is badly needed if the country is to increase its weak oil  output and expand the size of its reserves, both of which have declined since  1981.  </P> <P> The Argentine state oil company, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, includes in  its estimates a significant volume of oil reserves "classified under the unique  concept termed 'conditional reserves' " that are not recoverable under existing  economic conditions, the report said.  </P> <P> To obtain reserve volumes in agreement with "currently acceptable definitions,"  the bank revised the official YPF estimates, excluding those reserves for which  no production technology exists or for which there are no processing and  transportation facilities.  </P> <P> The bank calculated that Argentina's proven oil reserves were 1.41 billion  barrels at the beginning of 1988, with little change during 1989 -- 35% lower  than YPF's estimates.  </P> <P> Projecting into the future, the World Bank estimates that Argentine crude oil  output could drop from about 165 million barrels in 1990 to 101 million in the  year 2000, a 39% loss.  </P> <P> Under the bank's "minimum supply scenario," by the year 2010 crude oil  production would plunge to 30 million barrels a year and to 18 million barrels  by 2014.  </P> <P> Downstream from well production, the Argentine oil sector is hobbled by other  serious problems, the bank said.  </P> <P> YPF, responsible for most of Argentina's oil output and processing, suffered  total losses of $1.7 billion in 1987 and $1.8 billion in 1988, the bank said,  and its refineries are "grossly inefficient energy consumers" and suffer high  levels of production losses.  </P> <P> Oil export prospects, in turn, are jeopardized by inadequate port facilities.  </P> <P> While the bank said Argentina has developed the largest nuclear power program  in South America, it advised the country to "eliminate new nuclear plants from  the (energy) development program" since they would not be as economical as  other power-generating options.  </P></p>

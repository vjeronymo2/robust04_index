			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The European Union [EU] has come somewhat closer  to Finland's demands concerning farming. Foreign Trade Minister  Pertti Salolainen in Brussels ponders in the following remarks  whether a negotiation result will be achieved on the basis of  the new offer during the night:    [Begin Salolainen recording] Well, that depends entirely on  whether we will get our central views accepted. As has been  noted, this document is not acceptable to us as it is; there  must be considerable improvements made to it. We are currently  deliberating them among ourselves and preparing our own  counterproposals. That will indicate whether a solution can be  found. [end recording] [passage omitted]    Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto is, however, still  dissatisfied.    [Begin Haavisto recording] There are numerous points. Of  course, the two most central ones are that we must get the  subsidy arrangement to extend to all of Finland and, secondly,  that the arrangements for the transition period must be such  that they do not cause unreasonable problems for any sector in  Finland. [end recording]    The Finnish Government will meet in an hour to study the  situation in the EU negotiations, i.e., a couple of hours before  the original deadline. Prime Minister Esko Aho thinks that  there is, if necessary, a margin of flexibility in the timetable.</p>

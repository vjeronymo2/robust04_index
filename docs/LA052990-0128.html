			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BRAUDE URGES TOTAL SMOKING BAN IN ALL L.A. RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> City Councilman Marvin Braude, in a bid to protect nonsmoking diners from  secondhand smoke, proposed today that Los Angeles become the first major city  in the nation to ban smoking in all restaurants.  </P> <P> The city, whose 3.5 million residents endure the nation's worst air, already  has a 2-year-old law that requires restaurants with 50 or more seats to set  aside 50% of their tables for nonsmokers.  </P> <P> Citing a recent report at the World Conference on Lung Health, which estimated  that 32,000 people die each year due to exposure to secondhand smoke, Braude  said "the time has come" for a complete smoking ban at all restaurants.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most publicized prohibition against smoking in restaurants was  adopted in 1987 by Beverly Hills, but under pressure from restaurateurs, the  city's lawmakers later weakened the law, allowing restaurants to set up smoking  sections for up to 50% of their customers.  </P> <P> Several hundred municipalities require nonsmoking areas in restaurants, but  only the resort community of Aspen, Colo., has a complete ban, Braude said.  </P></p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Private sector porridge: Government plans to shake up the prison service Rioters who tore apart Strangeways Prison, Manchester, during the 1990 disturbances were dismantling Britain's prison system to a far greater extent than they realised. The rebuilding of Strangeways has enabled the government to make a bold move in attempts to reshape prison management and industrial relations. It announced this week that the public and private sectors will be invited to submit rival bids to manage the new prison. Many public sector trade unions grew weaker during the 1980s; the Prison Officers Association (POA) was not one of them. With a reputation for being hard-line and behaving as an equal to the prison service management in determining how prisons are run, it has traditionally been seen as one of the biggest barriers to change in the service. The Strangeways announcement is the latest evidence that the government has no plans for a miners-style confrontation with the prison officers. Reform will be pursued through introducing variety into the way prisons are run, and strengthening the service's management. Members of the POA immediately assumed that the Strangeways contract was bound to go to a private company to advance the government's efforts to experiment with private prison management. There might, however, be a still bigger prize for the government if the public bid succeeds and can be used as a stalking horse to introduce new working arrangements in the public sector. The Home Office prison department's chances of continuing to run Strangeways  -and probably the chances of the POA being represented there - depend on it producing, with the union's co-operation, an imaginative bid outside existing working arrangements. Were this to happen the effects would be felt throughout the service, particularly on the POA. Mr Kenneth Clarke, who became home secretary in April, sees reform, of Britain's prisons as one of his priorities. Senior management was criticised in Lord Justice Woolf's report on the riots at Strangeways and elsewhere, which spoke of 'frequent complaints from managers and staff of a lack of visible leadership'. The union was often criticised in private by some of Mr Clarke's predecessors, who accused it of being obstructive and opposed to change. But they recognised that its members did a job most people would never volunteer for, and were armed with considerable industrial power through their preparedness to stop doing it. Prison life is rough, tough, sometimes utterly rotten. Britain has some good jails; it also has others where inmates are locked three to a cell without internal sanitation for most of the day. Some reports by Judge Stephen Tumin, the government's own chief inspector of prisons, read as though they had been lifted from a Victorian bookshelf. In a report on Dartmoor in June he expressed himself 'aghast' that the same brushes had sometimes been used to clean plates, eating utensils and toilets, and found the bath houses so deplorable that he recommended their immediate closure. The lifestyles of corrupting and depressing institutions affect staff and inmates alike. Social stability in prison is built around understandings negotiated between prisoners and between prisoners and officers. A frequent criticism of the officers is that, behind the prison walls, they use their trade union strength to impose working arrangements which reflect their own interests. 'I suppose what concerns the government is that we remain a strong trade union with the capacity to represent our members effectively,' says Mr David Evans, the union's general secretary. 'We are not going to compromise on that. But we are not fighting the government. We have told Mr Clarke we are willing to examine any proposals that would contribute to the effective running of the prison service.' Naturally, the union does not believe it is the central problem of the prison service; neither do present home office ministers. Mr Peter Lloyd, the prisons minister, says his own experience in private industry suggests that when a union is accused of being over-powerful it usually reflects deficiencies in management. Evidence to support this view came in this week's report of the inquiry into brutality at Ashworth high-security hospital, Merseyside. The report spoke of POA members filling a vacuum left by managers who had little power. In 1987 the prison service began introducing the optimistically-entitled Fresh Start, a new pay, working hours and conditions package. While this has produced some efficiency improvements, it has also provided fresh opportunities for disputes over staffing levels. Fresh Start maintained the style of negotiated change which still characterises industrial relations in the service. The sign that the government was prepared to use more radical methods came with legislation to allow the private management of remand prisons. Wolds, on Humberside, opened as Britain's first privately-managed remand prison in the spring: its management Group 4 Security, its staff represented under a single-union deal with the GMB general union rather than the POA. The government has already extended the scope of the legislation by parliamentary order to allow the private sector to manage newly-built jails for convicted prisoners. Blakenhurst, in Hereford and Worcester, will become the first later this year. Ministers are not treating Strangeways as a new prison covered by this order. When parliament reassembles, it will be asked to confirm another order extending the powers of private management to established prisons. Once this is done, the option of private management will be widely available in the service. The government had begun restructuring the prison service before April's general election under Mr Joe Pilling, a new director-general regarded by colleagues as a man with strong management skills. A move to agency status operating at arms-length from Whitehall, will come soon. To achieve far-reaching change, however, the government must look to the individual prison level and Strangeways is an important step towards this. A new governor will be appointed soon to prepare the prison's bid. Ministers are open minded about how and when to extend the Strangeways concept of competitive bidding. 'If privately-managed prisons continue to prove themselves, it would make sense to see where else private management could be used', says Mr Lloyd. Before that happens, however, the government will start to devolve management of public prisons - setting specifications but leaving it to individual governors to decide how to meet them. This is similar to the way in which Wolds, Blakenhurst and any other private prisons will operate. But if governors in state prisons are to be allowed the freedom of devolved management at anything like the level enjoyed in the private sector, they will eventually need scope to negotiate their own agreements at local level. This would present the POA with a dilemma. Local governors would want new agreements which offered more flexible working practices and challenged the POA's established power - just as the Strangeways bid will have to do to succeed. There would be a natural reluctance on the union's part to go along with this. But with the decision to allow both public and private sectors to bid to run Strangeways, the government has a new weapon in its armoury. Local POA members would know that if they failed to support efforts to modernise the service, their prison might also become a candidate for a competitive bid from the private sector.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / World Trade News: US growers add Nafta to list of foes - A look at conflicting interests and market perceptions beneath the free trade banner FLOODS, droughts, dust storms, and pestilence were once the natural adversaries of the farmer. Now, says Mr Bobby McKown, a 55-year-old citrus grower in central Florida, the enemy list is longer. It includes: water controls, pesticide and fertiliser record-keeping, occupational safety regulations, zoning limits, the Endangered Species Act. Even worse, in Mr McKown's view, will be the North America Free Trade Agreement, which he says threatens the existence of the Dollars 8bn Florida citrus industry. Despite American advantages in technology and infrastructure, Florida fruit and vegetable producers say they cannot compete head-on with Mexico without import duties to compensate for higher costs. Florida expects to be the state hardest hit by the competition because its growing season is virtually identical with Mexico's. Average farm wages in Florida of Dollars 9.58 an hour compare unfavourably with Mexico's 35 cents an hour. The US is already the largest market for Mexican horticultural products, and Mexico is the largest single foreign supplier in the market. particularly if its quality is upgraded through American investment. The agriculture talks in the Nafta have been contentious - officials still disagree on timetables for tariff phase-outs on the most sensitive products. Most items will become tariff-free either immediately or within 10 years. The most sensitive may have a 15-20 year phase-out period. Last week, the Mexican farm talks were reportedly stalled. Not only are there considerations of products and trade flows on the table, but there are environmental, economic and social concerns. Mr McKown, a member of the US trade representative's influential agriculture policy advisory committee, is hoping that Florida's produce will excluded from the Nafta. But negotiators have found that once one country asks to remove a sector from the table, the other threatens to remove one of its. (Canada is expected to conclude a separate agreement with Mexico and maintain the current free trade agreement rules for agriculture with the US.) Although Mexican horticulture exports to the US are almost nine times more than the reverse, the US industry sees Mexico as its fastest growing fruit and vegetable market. However, Ms Jodean Bens, manager of international trade for the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, says the safeguards against import surges must take into consideration both volume and price factors. The US industry needs a dispute settlement which works swiftly, before produce spoils. But none of this will satisfy the Florida industry. Mr Bob Crawford, state agriculture commissioner, warned in May that thousands of jobs would vanish in the sugar and vegetable region, in tomato production and the citrus industry.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: OPERA  </P> <P> Brunnhilde Hit by Falling Scenery: Soprano Hildegard Behrens was struck on her  face and chest by falling scenery during Wagner's "Die Gotterdammerung" at the  Metropolitan Opera Saturday night.  </P> <P> Behrens was later released from Roosevelt Hospital after being treated for  several bruises. The soprano stumbled at the end of the immolation scene and  was hit by a column of cork that signified the collapse of a palace. It was not  known if Behrens would be able to participate in her next scheduled performance  of "Die Walkure" Tuesday. Also in doubt is continuation of the filming for  television of the "Ring" cycle for Deutsche Grammophon. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federation Council, the upper house of the  Russian parliament, will find it extremely difficult to approve  the federal 1994 budget as it was passed by the State Duma, the  lower house, in second reading Wednesday, Budget Committee  Chairman Nikolay Gonchar told journalists.    In particular, he described the increase of the military  expenses by 3.5 trillion rubles rather than by 18 trillion as  proposed by the Federation Council as insufficient. This  decision, he said, will bring the manufacturing industries of  Russia's 33 regions to their knees.    Gonchar was critical of the Duma decision to set up an  extra-budgetary army support fund where finances obtained from  privatization would be channeled. He said that if cash were  available, it had to be included in the budget.    He also thought that the financing of regions was  insufficient.    Gonchar thought that the upper house could not confine its  functions to approval or disapproval of what the Duma decided  about the budget. He did not rule out the possibility that  conciliation procedures could be used to have the budget  endorsed by the upper house.</p>

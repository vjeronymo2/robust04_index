			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Stress case sends a shock through employers' systems: Macho managers are being told that caring can work out cheaper When a social worker last month successfully sued his former employers for stress, business leaders treated the case as a potential catastrophe. Mrs Ann Robinson, head of the Institute of Directors policy unit, said: 'Most of us who employ people had better shut up and go home. It will make people think very carefully about employing anyone at all.' Mr John Walker had a nervous breakdown in 1986 after his workload grew with a rising number of child abuse cases. When he returned to his office, he found paperwork had built up and help promised by his head office was withdrawn. He suffered a second breakdown and was later sacked on the grounds of ill-health. As Mr Walker prepared to claim Pounds 200,000 damages from Northumberland County Council, the Health and Safety Executive was drawing up its first advisory notes on occupational stress. The guidance, to be published early in the new year, argues that stress is no longer simply the employee's problem. Alongside the Walker case, it confirms that stress can be treated as a work-related injury, with employers shouldering a duty of care. The executive says: 'Good communications are very important between employer and employee. The worst thing to do when someone's stress threshold has been crossed is to let the situation continue, because the problem will get worse and worse.' The Walker case has led lawyers to weigh the risk of personal injury damages against the cost of dismissing staff suffering from occupational stress. Solicitors Dibb Lupton Broomhead are holding a seminar in March at which personnel officers will be reminded that their last resort is to sack stressed staff. The firm argued that even unfair dismissals are less costly than personal injury damages. However, solicitors Booth &amp; Co said the Walker case demonstrated how employers should listen to employees' concerns to prevent personal injury claims. Mr Tom Flanagan, head of the firm's employment unit, said: 'It is dangerous to take the macho view. Employers should adopt procedures to check people's workload and pick up potential problems like this early. 'An employee under stress, just like any employee who has suffered a work-related injury, would be able to recover damages only if the injury and its results were reasonably foreseeable.' The Association of British Insurers highlighted concerns about stress-related claims, including repetitive strain injury (RSI), at its annual seminar on employers' liability earlier this year. A former Inland Revenue typist was awarded Pounds 79,000 compensation in January after losing her job because of RSI. Sedgwick, the risk management company, says stress-related claims in California are now running at more than 3,000 a year. Some larger companies, such as Marks and Spencer, have adopted their own strategies to help staff cope with stress. In May the retailer piloted a 'managing pressure' programme, designed to teach employees - from senior management through to the shop floor - how to cope with an 'unprecedented' set of pressures from both inside and outside the job. According to the Institute of Personnel and Development, which publishes its own study of occupational health in February, dealing with employees' stress can be an effective way of managing companies efficiently. Mr Doug Gummery, the institute's policy adviser, said: 'There is a trend towards less people doing more work for a little bit more pay. Organisations will have to do all they can to foster a different culture from the de-layering and rationalisation of the 1980s and early 1990s. 'They will have to look after the health of people at work because that is where they are going to get economic benefit - otherwise they are likely to find themselves in costly court cases.'</p>

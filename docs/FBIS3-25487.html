The head of the Bophuthatswana  delegation, Mr. Ephraim Keikelane, said after a meeting in the  Pilanesberg Game Reserve that they had suggested that  Bophuthatswana should have a confederal relationship with South  Africa. Mr. Popo Molefe of the ANC said they have spelled out  the ANC's latest constitutional proposals in detail. He said  both sides would report back to their principals, and a second  round of talks was imminent, possibly before the negotiating  council met on Monday [21 February].</p>

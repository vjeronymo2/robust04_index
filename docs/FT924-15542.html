			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Leading from weakness THE MINI-SUMMITS at which world leaders so often meet are becoming increasingly like group encounters, or therapy sessions. Participants alternately seek to console one another, or fly into tantrums. This is hardly surprising; seldom have so many important governments been so dangerously weak. President Mitterrand can at least retire gracefully if he wishes, for convincing medical reasons. President Bush can only be saved by an electoral wonder; Chancellor Kohl has somewhat longer to rebuild his ruined prestige. Mr Miyazawa is accused of covering up yet more corruption in the Japanese ruling party. Meanwhile Mr Major, who stood out until only a few weeks ago as the one secure and confident leader in the big industrial countries, has joined the critical list. Only Mr Amato in Italy and President Yeltsin in Moscow enjoy the grim security which comes from manifest national crisis. The reasons are all at bottom economic, but there are three quite different problems intertwined. The English-speaking countries and Japan are suffering what is at heart a financial crisis. In all these countries the banking system is sick from the excesses of the 1980s, and kept weak by the belated onset of supervisory prudence, which earmarks the bulk of banks' earnings for balance sheet repairs. Meanwhile, creditworthy borrowers are badgered to repay, and the more questionable kept on minimal life-support, with devastating results for the small company sector. Until banking recovery is complete - a matter of years even in favourable circumstances - debt deflation is likely to persist. Massive damage can be avoided only through large interest rate cuts, as the US and Japanese authorities have clearly understood. But in continental Europe the problems are quite different. The banking system is sound, but fiscal deficits are excessive, mainly, of course, in Italy and in reunited Germany, which has contracted symptoms from the third crisis - the collapse of the former Communist economies. Fears to persist Even without the deflationary convergence conditions imposed by the Maastricht treaty, the troubles of continental Europe would demand tight monetary policy to offset government excess. That is why Britain's membership of the ERM became unsustainable. Even if better timing had enabled the country to join at a less demanding exchange rate, the weakness of the economy would have undermined the currency. The markets eventually find out an unsustainable policy. Sterling has now been devalued sharply, but it continues to fall mainly because of the perceived weakness of the government. Confidence will be restored in due course if the government can convince the markets of its anti-inflationary credentials. Even though actual inflation is likely to remain low, the market's fears will persist like a toothache. Mrs Thatcher showed an effective approach in 1981. It involved firm resistance to public sector pay demands and fiscal tightening, including tax increases - then, to check monetary growth, but necessary now to help restore the external balance. Given an equally convincing package now, the weakness of sterling would become a source of competitive strength: the currency would be seen as undervalued, and the large interest-rate cuts which some enthusiasts have been demanding could at last be made with acceptable risk. Difficult task This is a demanding agenda for Mr Major, but at least he has time to tackle it. The world's leaders jointly face a more difficult task: to prevent a worldwide recession from inspiring a retreat into isolationism and trade protection, as happened in the 1930s. This task is doubly difficult for weak leaders. The impetus for European integration should keep Britain and her partners on speaking terms, and must do so. Mr Major has quickly recognised this, and so ended a terrible 10 days of his premiership with some credit. But the US is the key to world co-operation, and progress will have to wait for the election of its next president. It is encouraging at least that there has been so little overt protectionism in the campaign so far, and that Governor Clinton, a Fulbright protege, still the likely winner, may turn out to have the instincts of an internationalist. Continued co-operation and open trading are important for the most prosperous countries in the world, but they would rub along without it. It is vital, however, for the most disrupted and for the most dynamic countries  -the former Communist world, which desperately needs some hope, and the rapidly emerging market economies of the Pacific and Latin America, where there is a risk that success could be smothered at birth. That success must be preserved primarily for the sake of the huge populations at risk; but for the richest countries Latin America offers not only growing markets, but badly needed proof that there is, after all, life after debt.</p>

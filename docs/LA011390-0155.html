			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN SOUGHT IN AUTO SHOP SHOOTINGS SURRENDERS  </P> <P> The brother of an auto shop owner killed by a disgruntled employee surrendered  to police for questioning Friday, two days after he fatally shot his brother's  murderer and fled, police said.  </P> <P> Juan Alonso Romero, 22, the brother of slain shop owner Alfonso Alonso Romero,  had been sought for questioning since Wednesday when he shot the employee  shortly after the man killed his brother. He was released after questioning and  is not expected to be charged, said Police Lt. Earl Porter.  </P> <P> The disgruntled worker was identified Friday by police as Roberto Diaz Valle,  24, of Santa Ana. Valle pulled a 9-millimeter pistol and gunned down Alfonso  Romero, 30, and a bystander, Victoriano Salgado Delgado, 29, after Romero fired  him from his job as a mechanic at El Gato Repair Shop at 1706 W. 1st St.  </P> <P> Alfonso Romero's wife, Elia Padilla, 18, was also shot and critically wounded  by Valle, who police said also went by the name of Alejandro Salazar. Padilla,  who was shot twice in the shoulder and side, was released Friday from Western  Medical Center-Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Police said Juan Romero rushed to his brother's shop from a neighboring garage  when the shots rang out. He allegedly spotted a handgun tucked in Delgado's  waistband, grabbed it and fired, hitting Valle in the head. Romero then  allegedly jumped into a 1981 yellow Toyota pickup truck and sped away.  </P> <P> Alfonso Romero's partner, Roberto Medina, said Friday that Delgado returned to  the shop with a gun after arguing with Valle earlier in the day.  </P> <P> Porter declined to say whether Juan Romero explained why he fled, and would not  release any further details about his hourlong conversation with police, citing  Romero's status as a material witness to a homicide.  </P> <P> Porter also said Juan Romero suffered a slight gunshot wound in the shooting,  but added that he had no details on how and when Romero was shot.  </P> <P> Funeral arrangements for Alfonso Romero were pending Friday.  </P> <P> Staff writer Lily Eng contributed to this story  </P></p>

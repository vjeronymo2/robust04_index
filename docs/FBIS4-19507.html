			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "More Than 140 Caught in Northern </F> Anti-Mafia Operation"]    [Text] (ANSA) Milan, April 18 -- More than 140 people were  arrested in pre-dawn raids around the northern city of Milan and  in several southern regions in a police operation code-named  Scorched Earth, aimed against organized crime groups  specializing in arms and drug trafficking, robbery and fencing  stolen goods, police announced Monday [18 April].    Police carried out more than 300 searches and confiscated an  unspecified number of weapons, drugs and ammunition in the  raids, which were a follow-up to Operation North-South which a  few months ago struck at the drug and arms pipeline between  south and north.    Most of the arrests, police said, were made in the northern  region of Lombardy and in the poorer outskirts of Milan, where  drug dealers are most active.</p>

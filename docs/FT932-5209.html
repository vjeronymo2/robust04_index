			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms active Speculation that Wednesday's mould-breaking agreement between British Telecom and MCI of the US might lead to other giant cross-border deals prompted sharp rises in both Cable and Wireless and Vodafone. The fuel for the rumours were suggestions from industry commentators as to how such powerful international telecoms groups as AT&amp;T might react to the threat of the potential global alliance posed by the BT/MCI tie-up. However, London telecoms specialists were sceptical, arguing that the wide range of joint ventures and marketing agreement already existing between the industry leaders would complicate any similar moves. In addition, not all press and market comment on the BT deal was positive, with the scale of the financing bringing the comment from one telecoms analyst that: 'BT has got it all to prove now.' BT shares fell 3 1/2 to 418p, C&amp;W gained 9 to 753p aided by recommendations from Hoare Govett and Goldman Sachs, while Vodafone climbed 13 to 456p on good turnover of 9m. A bout of profit-taking took the wind out of the sails of the major property stocks, which had surged on Wednesday follwoing the news of Mr George Soros' move into the sector. British Land, which will link up with Mr Soros, dropped 26 to 318 x-d, Land Securities 8 to 575p and MEPC 5 to 443p. The latter's results yesterday showed further confirmation of the slow turnaround in the property market. NatWest Securities raised its net asset value forecast from 400p to 450p for this year. Investor attention turned instead to some of the second line property stocks, where Asda Property jumped 8 to 93p, and Chesterfield 10 to 370p. In Banks, TSB put on 4 to 189p, with Strauss Turnbull said to have been shopping for stock. Shares in Sidlaw Group, the oil services, packaging and textiles company, jumped 20 to 350, after announcing that it had received a letter of intent from Amoco for a 10-year contract to provide logistics support in the North Sea. Elsewhere in the sector, BP retreated in early trading on certainty regarding the implications of the collision of one of its tankers with a cargo ship off the Belgian coast. However, as the stock market rallied later, the shares recovered and closed 2 ahead at 308p, after trade of 7.6m. Norcros closed 3 down at 165p, after surprising the market with a 2-for-7 rights issue to raise Pounds 49.7m. Profits were down from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds 11.5m, although the dividend was maintained. Bumper profits at Rowe Evans sent the shares climbing 12 to 53p. The threat of a 24-hour strike at British Airways today overshadowed an announcement of a 7.8 per cent year-on-year increase in May passenger traffic figures. The shares gave up 6 1/2 to 297 1/2 p, in trade of 2.2m. The good passenger traffic figures were appreciated at BAA where the shares closed 4 ahead at 767p. The positive mood in the property sector and continuing recovery in the housing market continued to boost P&amp;O and the shares gained another 8 to 616p. Volume was 1.3m. Shipbuilding and submarine group VSEL Consortium raced 26 ahead to 795p, after it reported full year figures ahead of market expectations. Profits jumped 16 per cent to Pounds 55.6m and the company also increased the dividend. Charterhouse Tilney predicted profits for the year to March 1994 would come in at Pounds 63m. Profit-taking and a more cautious outlook following Wednesday's figures saw Vosper Thornycroft ease 7 to 588p. Shares in motor components group T &amp; N closed 7 ahead at 184p, after strong demand which followed a successful placing of its shares at 170p, to raise Pounds 36.9m. Sentiment was further enhanced by a positive recommendation from Strauss Turnbull for motor component stocks. British Aerospace shares put on another 3 to 370p. Cautious press comment after Wednesday's results put the skids under Siebe. The shares closed 7 lower at 477p, having been lower earlier in the day. A cautious annual meeting at Glynwed International left the shares 2 lighter at 299p. Plans to increase prices on some of its products together with a recommendation from SG Warburg sent British Steel through the 100p barrier to close 3 ahead at 102 1/2 p, in trade of 10m shares. ASW rose on the same sentiment and finished 5 ahead at 220p. Zeneca, the recently demerged bioscience arm of ICI, announced that three investment institutions had, in accordance with Stock Exchange rules, notified it of shareholdings. Zeneca shares continued weak, on the general uncertainty overhanging the sector, closing 8 adrift at 626p. ICI rose 13 1/2 to 687p.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 41-ACRE SITE;  </P> <P> BURBANK OKS DEVELOPER'S MALL PROPOSAL  </P> <P> The Burbank City Council on Tuesday voted to negotiate with Alexander Haagen  Co. for development of a major shopping complex on 41 acres of downtown  redevelopment property.  </P> <P> Council members voted unanimously for the Haagen plan, which calls for an  enclosed two-level mall with offices, hotels and restaurants. The $160-million  shopping center would be anchored by the Ikea furniture store, and by Buffums  and Sears, Roebuck department stores.  </P> <P> City officials will negotiate with Haagen in the next two months to work out  financial arrangements and to refine the development plan. A final plan will be  voted on by the council once negotiations are completed.  </P> <P> The council voted to reject another proposal that included a $981-million  retail, office and entertainment complex with a three-level mall and a dolphin  arena.  </P> <P> City Manager Bud Ovrom said the Haagen project would give the city a solid  retail base downtown.  </P> <P> The city has tried to develop the downtown property for almost 20 years. The  site is at Magnolia and Burbank boulevards near the Golden State Freeway.  </P> <P> Walt Disney Co. last year abandoned a proposed $611-million  retail-entertainment center on the site. Disney officials said their project  would have been too expensive.  </P> <P> Haagen is a major developer of shopping malls in Southern California. The firm  recently completed the $125-million Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw Plaza in southwest  Los Angeles.  </P></p>

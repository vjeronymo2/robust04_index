			<p>CSO     [Text] Patna, May 11 -- The Bihar Chief Minister, Mr. Laloo  Prasad Yadav, today said that the Assembly elections in the  State would be held in January next year. The term of the  present Assembly expires in March 1995.    Mr. Yadav claimed that the ruling Janata Dal and its allies  would get two-third of the seats.    He expressed hope that by then the voter's identity cards,  as  directed by the Election Commission, would be ready. He said the  State was prepared to spend 50 per cent of Rs 100 crores  required for the purpose.    Mr. Yadav told reporters that the Vaishali Lok Sabha  by-election was a dress rehearsal before the Assembly elections.  He denied that there was any criticism in the party over the  selection of the Janata Dal candidate for the by-election. He  said, "We needed Mrs. Kishori Sinha. We did not want to take any  risk about it".    He said that he wanted to dispel the charges against the Dal  that the party was biased against the upper castes. Mrs. Sinha  had filed her nomination as a Janata Dal candidate after  resigning from the Congress(I).    Mr. Yadav said that the Congress(I) should not complain  about  the defection of Mrs. Sinha since the Central Government had  survived because of defections. He quipped that Mr. Ram Lakhan  Singh was most competent to speak on the subject.    The Chief Minister expressed his unhappiness, over the  leakage of letters written by two Janata Dal M.P.s -- Mr. Nitish  Kumar and Mr. Brishen Patel --which reached the Press before he  received them.    However, he did not want to discuss the letters. He also  refused to answer questions pertaining to Mr. Patel's criticism  regarding his style of functioning. He described the M.P.s as  his younger brothers.    But he said that the people who had been helped by him  earlier were now speaking against him. He said that the M.P.s  were not fit to pass such comments.</p>

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Howard ready to privatise 10 more prisons A FURTHER 10 prisons in England and Wales are to be run by the private sector to complete the first phase of the government's privatisation programme, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, announced yesterday. With two prisons privately managed already, this would bring to 12 the number of prisons run by the private sector. Prisons of all types - including maximum security prisons holding terrorists - will be included in the programme. Mr Howard said his aim in the first phase was to have around 10 per cent of the 132 prisons run by private companies. This would create a viable private sector of three or four companies competing with directly managed establishments. The government is also to investigate using private finance to build new prisons. The Prison Service will invite bids from the private sector to finance, design, build and manage a new prison on Merseyside and another in south Wales. This will be one of the first fruits of the private finance initiative launched last year to attract private capital for public sector projects. The announcement drew renewed attacks from the opposition, prison staff and penal reformers. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, described the plans as 'a diversion of time and energy from the real task of penal reform and fighting crime'. The Prison Officers Association, representing more than 25,000 officers, warned of possible industrial action because of overcrowding and inadequate staff as a result of government policies. One action being considered is to refuse to accept new inmates into prisons, forcing their detention in police cells. The Howard League for Penal Reform said that commercialising prison management weakened accountability to parliament. Mr Brendan O'Friel, chairman of the Prison Governors' Association, said there were serious doubts about the success of private sector involvement. However, the announcement was welcomed by companies in the fledgling private prison sector. Mr Jim Harrower of Group 4, which runs the Wolds remand prison on Humberside, said the opportunity to win further contracts would give the company 'critical mass' in the field. The first five privately managed prisons will be newly built. The Wolds prison and Blakenhurst prison in Hereford and Worcester have already opened under private management. The contract to run the new Doncaster prison goes out to tender later this month and the contracts for the Merseyside and south Wales prisons will be let next year. Details, Page 8</p>

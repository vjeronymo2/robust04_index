			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / British Association for the Advancement of Science: Cities urged to review hospitals MORE LARGE inner-city hospitals should be closed, says Sir Bernard Tomlinson, author of the government report which last year recommended closing several London hospitals. 'Every city should take a fresh look at its hospital base,' Sir Bernard told the association. 'Actual closure of hospitals has so far mostly involved smaller peripheral or specialty hospitals but it is now necessary to consider the closure of some large hospitals, most of which are in inner cities.' Sir Bernard, former professor of pathology at Newcastle University, said the main factor forcing change was medical progress, which enabled general practitioners to treat many patients at home who would previously have required hospital care. In addition many patients, particularly the elderly, stayed in hospital much longer than they needed because community services could not take over their care. At the same time 'lack of ready access to GP care results in many patients using hospital accident and emergency departments for primary care, again increasing hospital and probably overall health service costs'. He said London's health services needed greater changes than those of any other city. 'No other city has such a concentration of expensive teaching hospitals.' In contrast, London's primary services were worse than those of any other city, with less medical, nursing and support staff. Others at the association session on 'Healthcare on a limited budget' backed up Sir Bernard. Professor Alan Maynard, head of York University's Centre for Health Economics, said NHS resources could be used more efficiently if routine surgery was carried out at district hospitals rather than teaching hospitals. The saving for colo-rectal surgery would be about 40 per cent. Professor Bryan Jennett, a neurosurgeon at Glasgow University, said: 'Services are now available more cheaply in the districts, as a result of changing medical practices.'</p>

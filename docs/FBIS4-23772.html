			<p>BFN     [Text] The Supreme Court's constitutional chamber has  handed down its verdict concerning the request made by the  parliamentary opposition about the lifting of its deputies'  parliamentary immunity. In its 10 June verdict, the  constitutional chamber said that the National Assembly's 23  April Resolution No. 004AN on the lifting of some deputies's  immunity is unconstitutional. This is because it is not in  conformity with Article 70, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the  Constitution as well as Articles 43 and 44 of the National  Assembly's rules of procedure. The chamber also said that the  way the National Assembly's request was made was in defiance of  the Constitution's Articles 79 and 89. It, therefore, declared  the resolution null and void.</p>

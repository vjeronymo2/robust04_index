In his opinion, the party will play  its part in the presidential elections in 1996 and help the  voters to make up their minds.    Medvedev said that President Boris Yeltsin is ready to form  the party, and that the initiative has already brought about a  response.    An organizing committee of the Russian Presidential Party of  Reformers has already been set up in the Siberian city of  Irkutsk. The committee has proposed that the revival of the  country, the integration with the international community,  democracy, commitment to solving internal and external problems  by peaceful means, as well as to private ownership and  enterprise should be proclaimed as the new party's main  principles and tasks.</p>

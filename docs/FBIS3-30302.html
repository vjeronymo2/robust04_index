			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 27 (CTK) -- Defense Minister Antonin  Baudys confirmed to CTK today that three Czech UNPROFOR [United  Nations Protection Forces] soldiers arrested on the  Austrian-Czech border Wednesday [26 January] for alleged weapons  smuggling were not carrying six hand grenades or any explosives,  as had been reported.    What they were carrying, Baudys said, was one (functional)  trophy pistol and a fake grenade with no fuse or charge. The  soldiers were travelling with their unit by bus back to the  Czech Republic for their regular leave when a 60-man Austrian  anti-terrorist commando group stopped the unit's two buses at  the Wullovitz-Dolni Dvoriste border crossing, removed the three  soldiers, questioned them, and handed them several hours later  to Czech authorities in Dolni Dvoriste. The other 67 soldiers  cleared customs with no problem.    Baudys said the raid had apparently been intended to  intercept someone else and probably been prepared in advance,  since accompanying the commandos were Austrian journalists and  TV crews.    He admitted that the three soldiers had committed an  offence,  "but it doesn't deserve the dramatic antics of the whole  situation and with which it was carried by the media."    The three are now in Cesky Krumlov, south Bohemia -- where  Czech UNPROFOR troops are trained -- awaiting a decision by  military police and state representatives on their fate.    On Wednesday an Austrian rapid deployment team stopped  another bus of Czech UNPROFOR soldiers heading for Vienna.  According to the AUSTRIAN PRESS AGENCY (APA), they found a  handgun, two clips and 40 rounds of ammunition for a Kalashnikov  machine gun.    According to Jaromir Novotny, director of the Czech Defence  Ministry's Foreign Affairs Section, no soldiers were questioned  and the bus was allowed to reach the Czech Republic. He could  not confirm the discovery of the weapons as he had not received  an official Austrian report, he said.</p>

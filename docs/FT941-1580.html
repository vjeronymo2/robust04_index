			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Quality Software meets market hopes Quality Software Products, the Gateshead-based developer of large scale accounting software, met market expectations at the end of its first year after joining the main market. The group made profits before tax of Pounds 553,000 in the year to the end of December, a 54 per cent decline on the Pounds 1.2m recorded the year before. The company said the profit figure was struck after Pounds 1.3m had been invested in positioning the business for a much larger market. Turnover rose slightly to Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 13.1m). Earnings totalled 7.3p (20.6p) and a dividend of 1.25p is recommended. QSP specialises in accounting software for large companies. The 1993 year was a period of extreme disruption not only because of flotation but also because it completed an advanced, open systems, version of its flagship Olas product. Universal OLAS has now been sold to eight customers and is live at one, Express Gifts. Mr Alan Mordain, chairman, said the remaining systems would be fully operational by June. The company's prospects have been greatly improved by deals struck earlier in the year with IATA, the airlines organisation, Continuum, a supplier of insurance software and with Global Software, a US accounting software company with some 800 customers. It is thought likely that many of Global's customers will wish to adopt the advanced client-server design of Universal Olas. Mr Mordain said that the six principal modules in Universal Olas had now been completed and were ready for installation.</p>

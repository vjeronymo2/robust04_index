			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / World Trade News: US tariff calls upset Japanese car makers JAPAN's car makers are uneasy over calls by the US motor industry to impose tariffs on two additional categories of imported vehicles. The move by the US manufacturers has heightened fears of renewed friction between the Japanese and US car industries. The Japanese are increasingly concerned by US car executives lobbying before the presidential inauguration of Mr Bill Clinton, who is expected by many Japanese executives to take a tougher stance on bilateral trade. The big three US car makers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - are campaigning to extend a 25 per cent tariff, currently imposed on truck imports, to multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs), such as the Toyota Previa, and to four-door leisure/utility vehicles. The US car industry, in the past, has repeatedly complained about the low level of imports of car parts and cars into Japan. And while Japan has removed all import tariffs on motor vehicles, and most Japanese car companies announced distribution tie-ups and joint ventures, frustration over non-tariff barriers such as closed distribution networks has mounted within the US industry. A sharp increase in market share by Japanese imports of the US MPV market has been the cause of recent friction.</p>

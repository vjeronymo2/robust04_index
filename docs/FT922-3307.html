			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Warning to Bonn on EFA decision THE German aerospace industry is pressing for a decision this month on Germany's participation in the four-nation Pounds 20bn European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project amid growing signs that Bonn could further delay a decision on whether to pull out. Mr Karl Dersch, president of the German aerospace industries association and a member of the Deutsche Aerospace board, warned yesterday at a Financial Times conference in Berlin of the dire consequences for German industry of a withdrawal from EFA. Criticising the political pressures threatening German participation in the programme, he said: 'The European aerospace industry cannot live with a policy driven constantly by election schedules and party politics in the member countries, resulting in short-term and short-sighted populistic ad-hoc decisions.' He warned Germany could face 'another 1945 when all our scientists went away either to the US or to Russia' if the country's aerospace industry did not participate in EFA. The lack of far-sighted policies risked not only destroying the defence technology competence of an EC member country but also 'the entire structure of European security and defence co-operation,' he said. Deutsche Aerospace, part of the Daimler-Benz car group, has said it would have to close at least two of its 14 domestic plants if Germany withdrew from the EFA. Withdrawal would also threaten up to 10,000 jobs at Deutsche Aerospace and another 10,000 jobs at German suppliers. Mr Dersch and officials of the Dutch Fokker aircraft group said merger negotiations between Fokker and Deutsche Aerospace were advancing. Deutsche Aerospace, with Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, is bidding for 51 per cent of Fokker.</p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bronfman empire in fresh crisis NERVOUSNESS over the future of Royal Trust, Canada's second biggest trust company, has ignited another crisis of confidence in the business empire controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family. Share prices of companies in the Bronfman orbit, especially those related to Royal Trust, have tumbled to their lowest levels in at least a year, following RT's announcement that it was seeking an equity injection from an outside investor, preferably a large financial institution. RT's shares closed at CDollars 2.11 on the Toronto Stock Exchange last Friday, a 31 per cent drop over two days. RT traded at almost CDollars 20 in 1989. Among Bronfman holding companies, Edper slumped by 32 per cent last Thursday and Friday to CDollars 2.25. Hees International, the group's merchant banking arm, was down 11 per cent to CDollars 6.88, while Trilon Financial, which has a 44 per cent interest in Royal Trust, slipped 25 per cent to CDollars 3.15. A Bronfman spokesman described the sell-off as an inevitable reaction to the troubles at RT and at Bramalea, a Bronfman-controlled property developer which filed for bankruptcy protection last month. However, he said that other parts of the group, which included natural resource, life insurance and consumer products companies, were 'very healthy', with healthy lines of credit. RT's business consists mainly of mortgage lending, fiduciary services and a variety of banking functions. It has taken several writedowns on its UK and North American assets over the past three years and is expected to set aside a further large amount from fourth-quarter 1992 earnings. It suffered a nine-month loss of CDollars 227m (USDollars 189m). Analysts said investors were uncertain whether a buyer would willingly step forward for RT. Royal Bank of Canada, the country's largest financial institution, is among those in discussions with the Bronfman group. Trilon has said that it would contribute CDollars 100m in new equity.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Head of Alcatel subsidiary held in bills probe The chairman of an Alcatel Alsthom subsidiary was yesterday placed under detention by a French magistrate probing false billing and overcharging of France Telecom, one of the company's largest clients. Company officials said Mr Pierre Guichet could step down as head of Alcatel-CIT, the telecoms equipment arm of the French transport and telecoms group, after a board meeting today. They said the move would help limit damage to relations with France Telecom and would not imply any admission of guilt by Mr Guichet, who has rejected allegations of wrongdoing. The resignation would be the second in the past week by the head of a company involved in a spate of corruption investigations which have rocked French industry this year. Last Friday, Mr Michel Mauer resigned as chairman of Cogedim, the property developer and a subsidiary of Paribas, the merchant bank. He stepped down to answer charges of corruption in a case involving illicit financing of political parties. The departure of Mr Guichet would be a further blow to Alcatel Alsthom, which has been shaken by corruption investigations this year. In July, Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of the company, was placed under investigation after allegations that he used company funds for construction work on private properties. The investigations, combined with a warning of a fall in profits this year, have prompted a sharp fall in the company's share price. Alcatel's shares are about 40 per cent below their level of the beginning of the year. The probe into the alleged overbilling of France Telecom is a complex case which started last year. Alcatel says that two employees, who subsequently left the company, manipulated prices for equipment supplied to France Telecom to their own advantage. In November last year, Alcatel paid the state telecoms operator FFr62m (Pounds 7.4m) to compensate for the losses and the damage to relations between the two companies. Since Mr Guichet was placed under investigation in May, however, the probe has broadened. It at first centred on overbilling concerning transmission equipment, involving an estimated FFr80m of damages to France Telecom. Mr Jean-Marie D'Huy, the investigating magistrate, is now examining whether false billing extended to switching systems and switchboards. Judicial sources say the damages could be in excess of FFr400m. Alcatel said that Mr Guichet had presented himself voluntarily before Mr D'Huy in a court in Evry, west of Paris.</p>

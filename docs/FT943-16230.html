			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / People: Frances Heaton joins Harrisons &amp; Crosfield If Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the industrial conglomerate which is recovering from several difficult years, was ever to face an unwelcome takeover bid it would not be short of merchant banking advice. Frances Heaton, 49, the former director general of The Takeover Panel, has just been appointed a non-executive director. She joins a board which already includes Sir Richard Lloyd, deputy chairman of Hill Samuel Bank, and Martin Anderson, the new finance director who joined from Hill Samuel a couple of months ago. Heaton, an executive director of Lazard Brothers, trained as a barrister, and joined Lazards in 1980 after a stint at the Treasury. She is also a non-executive director of The Bank of England, Commercial Union and WS Atkins. She is the first non-executive director to be appointed to the board since George Paul, the former chief executive, took over as chairman at the end of May. Paul has been making a number of changes to his board and several directors are departing over the next year as part of a move to do away with the group's old divisional management structure. Tom Preston, 61, who has worked for the group for over 30 years, retires from the board shortly following his appointment as chairman of the recently floated Australian companies. Peter Savage, 50, head of the chemical and industrial division, is leaving at the end of the month having completed the rationalisation of the chemical businesses. Peter Simmonds, 54, head of the food and agricultural division, is taking early retirement next May and Jim Miller, 57, also retires next year after a new managing director of Harcros Timber &amp; Building Supplies has been appointed. Under the reorganisation, the managing directors of the operating companies will report directly to Bill Turcan, 51, who replaced Paul as chief executive.</p>

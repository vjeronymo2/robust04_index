A number of well-known companies will be  absent this year from the forthcoming ILA '94 International  Aviation and Space Show, which will be held at the Schoenefeld  Airfield in Berlin from 28 May through 5 June. After the  withdrawal of German Aerospace, it will indeed be a small show.  Other German and international exhibitors either do not want to  enter the show or have now withdrawn. Only the space industry  will be present in Berlin in the measure it had originally  planned. For that reason, the space exhibits will have the most  appeal for the 250,000 exhibit visitors expected.    The main attraction for ILA guests interested in satellites  and rocket projects will certainly be Hall C, where the European  Space Agency (ESA) and the German Space Agency (DARA) will  exhibit their most important and successful applications--and  research satellites as well as the most successful booster  rockets in the world--the Arianes.    The fascination of space is brought closer to the visitors  in  an extravagant "holorama" show. Through the new technique of  "virtual reality" simulations, the visitors will be able to  experience a space trip to Mars and Jupiter. Talks, conferences,  and discussions by and with space experts will be held daily in  the forum of Hall C.    The decision as to whether Ulf Merbold or the Spaniard Pedro  Duque is to be orbited by a Soyuz rocket and spend 30 days in  the Mir space station this fall will also be announced in  Berlin. Jean-Marie Luton, director general of ESA, will make the  announcement on 30 May.    This year's manned space mission and a second ESA/Russian  flight scheduled for 1995, for which Thomas Reiter and a second  German astronaut are already in training and which is planned to  last 130 days, are preparatory for the large international space  station that is to be put into Earth orbit early in the 21st  century by the Americans, Russians, Europeans, Japanese, and  Canadians.    Unfortunately, that ambitious project, which will cost many  billions of dollars, is not yet certain. The Congress of the  United States is to vote on it in June, and the "Freedom" or  "Alpha" station may or may not become a reality. The  justification for this project has shifted from the purely  technical/scientific gains to be had to the political benefits  this major multinational project would have for future relations  between peoples and states.    The decision of the Americans vis a vis the space station is  awaited with considerable anxiety in Europe because decisions  related to it have had to be altered and postponed many times  already. It is still expected that ESA, under the overall  control of Germany, will develop a laboratory module for  weightlessness studies; the module will be docked permanently  with the space station.    Should the United States actually withdraw from the project,  Europe could perhaps link the station module up to the Russian  Mir-2 complex, which is scheduled to be put in Earth orbit in  the late 1990s. In general, however, all European decisions as  to their manned space projects are currently on hold, and will  remain so until a final decision is taken on the large space  station.    Probably the research ministers of the participating ESA  states will not meet in Paris until late 1995 to discuss their  further actions. The same situation also holds with respect to  the decision on a European astronaut transport vehicle, by means  of which technicians and researchers will be able to fly from  Earth to and from space stations. After finally dropping the  Hermes vehicle, which had become too heavy and too expensive,  plans are now being developed for a less expensive, conventional  astronaut capsule capable of transporting the four crew members  and a ton of cargo to and from orbit.    Exhibited at ILA '94 will be the first designs and models of  this capsule, which will be launched by the new European  Ariane-5 rocket, which is near readiness. Certainly, Germany's  commitment to manned space projects will be an issue in the many  conferences and presentations. After numerous controversies, the  public debate about that issue has notably subsided for the time  being, at least until final decisions and money appropriations  for the Columbus and astronaut capsule have to be made.    Studies now underway concerning these manned space projects  are--for the time being at least--being supported by Germany in  the ESA budget to the tune of 100 million German marks [DM] per  year. That amount represents only about 6 percent of the total  space budget contained in the overall budget of the Federal  Ministry of Research.    Meanwhile, countless managers, politicians, scientists, and  technicians involved in the space industry in both West and East  Europe are taking advantage of the ILA in Berlin, especially for  intensive talks about, for example, how cooperation with Russia  might be strengthened. Precisely in this matter, our country can  provide an enormous amount of technical potential and know-how  in any future cooperative ventures. This new East-West mediator  role played by the German aviation and space fair can--with  time--become increasingly more important, thereby ensuring that  ILA will continue functioning in that role in the coming years.</p>

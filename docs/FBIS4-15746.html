			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Strasbourg April 11 TASS -- Russian nationalist  leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said on Monday that NATO military  bases in Italy should be bombed in response to air strikes  against Bosnian Serbs in Gorazde.    Zhirinovsky arrived in France with a Russian parliamentary  delegation to attend the spring session of the parliamentary  assembly of the Council of Europe.    The leader of the largest one-party faction in the Russian  lower house said NATO's air-strike had been aimed "against  Russia, against Slavs." "If I were the president, we would bomb  those bases in Italy... They bomb one town, we bomb another  town," he told reporters.    Zhirinovskiy said that he favoured the peaceful settlement  of  the Yugoslav crisis, adding that it was NATO who initiated the  aggression. NATO's action "is against Russia. For the most  part, it serves the interests of Germany in the Balkans. It is  against Christians, against the Slav people," the leader of the  Russian Liberal Democratic Party stressed.</p>

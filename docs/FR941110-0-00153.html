			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While we agree with the above commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advocating more guidance on the selection of remedies, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have developed an enforcement scheme capable of doing just  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, we are bound by the statutory provisions giving HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the States some discretion in designing their own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schemes within a Federal framework. Therefore, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing the method by which facility deficiencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including physical environment deficiencies, will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured, and we are linking specific categories of remedies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with certain levels of noncompliance. We are revising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.408 accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters believe that level 1&hyph;1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies, now referred to as isolated deficiencies which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a potential for minimal harm, must be cited and a plan of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction required. Additionally, these commenters urge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that every deficiency should be cited before leaving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. They believe that unless each deficiency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cited, important patterns of repeat noncompliance can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> missed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree. As we stated in the preamble to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule, providers must be aware that they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for complying with all participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. Notifying the facility of this level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency acknowledges that a problem could potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur if the deficiency is permitted to go uncorrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While no formal plan of correction is required for this low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level deficiency and no remedy is applied, correction is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary nevertheless.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exit conference focuses primarily on the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serious preliminary findings by the surveyors. While the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey team documents its observations relative to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey, the surveyors' findings are not official until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider receives the official deficiency statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters commended HCFA for prohibiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities from challenging the choice of remedy or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies. These commenters assert that giving the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the right to challenge the existence of deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately protects their rights. A few commenters agreed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the choice of the remedy should not be appealable but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the scope and severity of a deficiency should be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters believed providers should be permitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formally appeal both the existence of a deficiency as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as challenge determinations of scope and severity and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The most important issue on which to grant an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal is the existence of deficiencies which lead to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy. We are requiring that such an appeal before an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative law judge be offered, and that dispute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution procedures be applied first, at the request of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provider.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Providers have the opportunity to appeal certifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of noncompliance leading to an enforcement remedy but, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the one exception noted below, do not have the opportunity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to appeal either the level of noncompliance or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement choice made by HCFA or the State. We have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reached this conclusion for several reasons. First, as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general matter, whether HCFA or a State chooses one remedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or another to address facility noncompliance is a matter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that we believe is a prosecutorial prerogative of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government, not with the provider of services. It is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inherent function of government in this context to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choices as to which kind of enforcement action will best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve prompt compliance so that residents face  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliant conditions for as short a time as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, in the case of provider agreement terminations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even if a facility were able to successfully contest a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion that immediate jeopardy exists, the agency could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still proceed with the termination action since the agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to bring such an action is not limited to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate jeopardy cases, but may span all noncompliant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility behavior. As has been agency policy for many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years, the determination of what remedy to seek is beyond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge in light of the government's fundamental necessity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to protect the welfare of facility residents as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expeditiously as possible. This is especially the case with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to provider agreement terminations since residents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be at considerable risk even where there is no immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, in the case of most alternative sanctions, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations are structured so that whether a facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance falls in category 1 or category 2, HCFA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the States have complete discretion to choose from either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category. Thus, even if a facility were able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successfully demonstrate that the agency had erred in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion that the noncompliance belonged in category 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that fact would be irrelevant since noncompliance in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category 1 could still trigger the same remedy. Only a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> showing that the facility was in substantial compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would enable the facility to avoid sanctions, and it is this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue that we agree must be subject to challenge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, with respect to the imposition of temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management, a facility facing this remedy would have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to argue during informal dispute resolution that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency had erred in concluding that immediate jeopardy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existed. Should it succeed in making this showing, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy would not be imposed. On the other hand, should the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility fail to convince agency officials that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance was of a lesser nature, the facility would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> face temporary management well before it could more formally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge the agency finding of immediate jeopardy. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even if the facility ultimately prevailed in a hearing in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proving that its noncompliance posed less than immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy, the facility's appeal would not be effective since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the remedy would have already been imposed and the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would either have achieved substantial compliance or been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminated by the time of the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this reason, we considered whether, in light of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sequence of events, facilities should be given a prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing in temporary management cases, but concluded that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would completely undermine the purpose of this remedy which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to resolve the most serious noncompliance in the shortest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible time frame. This is particularly the case when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities facing such remedies have available to them an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informal means to contest agency action prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposition of the remedy and when, ultimately, it is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's choice to accept temporary management rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> face termination. Accordingly, we concluded that in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balancing of interest of facilities and residents in such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, the interests of residents must take precedence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

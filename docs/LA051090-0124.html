			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> TEAR-DRENCHED TUNES FROM TORCHY FORDHAM  </P> <P> You may walk into a Julia Fordham show whistling a happy tune, but don't expect  to leave that way. The young singer-songwriter will wipe that smile off your  face -- fast.  </P> <P> She's a compelling singer who infuses her songs with as much ache and pain as  possible, but Fordham, who played the Henry Fonda Theatre on Monday, also makes  an impact with a style that's subtle and minimalist. Songs like "Girlfriend"  and "Porcelain" are intensely personal tales that probe the sad, painful side  of romance.  </P> <P> Large stretches of the show allowed you to wallow in unrelieved gloom. But it  wasn't an unpleasant experience. Fordham is like one of those old-fashioned  torch singers from the '20s and '30s who could make those tear-drenched songs  very appealing.  </P> <P> Though backed by a five-piece band in the 90-minute show, she sang some songs  accompanied by just piano -- in the classic torch-singer mode. The most  distinctive aspect of her style is her ability to flit up and down her range in  the course of one phrase, from her brawny lower register to those crystal-clear  highs.  </P> <P> Her best song was one of her encore numbers, "Happy Ever After." Despite the  title, it's not, of course, a happy tune. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

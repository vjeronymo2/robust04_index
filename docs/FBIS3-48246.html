			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yoshihisa Inoue, political reporter: "Writer </F> Critiques Ozawa's Five-Month Performance"]    [Text] Immediately following establishment of the Hosokawa  government, I pointed out in this newspaper that, "Although  there is criticism of the dual power structure, party leader  Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] played the  foremost role in establishing the coalition government and  should assume responsibility for the future of the government."    However, in reviewing Mr. Ozawa's record for the past five  months, I must conclude that my expectations were betrayed. I  cannot help but feel that he emphasized "destruction of the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and assumption of leadership in  the ruling coalition" rather than "efforts to create a new  government for the people."    I would like to address Mr. Ozawa now with the words, "Do  not  take actions that will minimize the importance of politicians,  but follow the cardinal path for politicians."    The Hosokawa government unmistakably portrays the qualities  of a dual power structure. The "official" leader is Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and, although he has dropped somewhat  in public opinion polls, he enjoys very high support ratings for  his cabinet in comparison to those of previous LDP prime  ministers. The "unofficial" leader, needless to say, is Mr.  Ozawa.    Ever since the establishment of the new government, it has  been faced with three major policy options. They were the  revision of and balloting on the draft legislation for the  political reform laws when they passed the House of  Representatives without the participation of LDP members,  opening of the rice markets and compilation of the new fiscal  year budget after the end of the last calendar year. The  standard viewpoint now is that the handling of each of the three  issues was based on concepts advocated by Mr. Ozawa.    I see some logic in the handling of the rice issue, but  question the handling of the other two issues. In order to  arrange for a compromise with the LDP, there was talk of fixing  the ceiling for small electoral districts to 280 and a block  system for the proportional representation districts. However,  the ruling coalition acceded only to an increase in ceiling for  small electoral districts from 250 to 270.    It appears that the hard-line position taken against the LDP  involved the sidetracking of efforts by Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura to seek a coordinated position with the LDP  and inducing a further disintegration of the LDP.    I had the same impression even when they pushed through a  major 45-day extension of the Diet session. Even under 38 years  of LDP rule, it was rare for the Diet session to be extended for  the "number of days proposed" by the ruling party. I sensed an  attempt to worsen the predicament of the LDP.    And that was not the sole effect of the extension.  Realization of the major extension of the Diet session, in  effect, blocked any potential for retreat on the part of the  Hosokawa government. If the prime minister who publicly  committed himself to passage of the political reform laws by the  end of the last calendar year fails to attain passage during the  extended Diet session, his only remaining options will be the  dissolution of the House of Representatives or mass resignation  of the cabinet. That being the case, the prime minister is being  treated "no better than a 100-yen disposable cigarette lighter."    If the ruling coalition were to seek smooth sailing of Diet  deliberations concerning political reform, it should have sought  a compromise with the LDP about extension of the Diet session.  They should have also given the prime minister an escape route  from the pending situation.    I also have difficulty in seeing any logic behind the  compilation of the budget after the calendar year end. Mr.  Ozawa, who served as deputy chief cabinet secretary in the  Takeshita cabinet and in the important post of LDP secretary  general in the Kaifu government should have realized the ill  effects of not compiling the budget by the end of the last  calendar year in these recessionary times.    Mr. Ozawa might refute these statements in this manner, "I  am  fully aware of those facts. This is a case where both the ruling  coalition and the Hosokawa government are taking a stand with  their backs against the wall. Moreover, political reform  represents the `plan of the century' for Japanese politics."    However, I do not agree with such a position. The ruling  party has the obligation to constantly determine the majority  desire of the general public and to strive for realization of  those desires. If one were to weigh the significance of  political reform and relief from the current serious  recessionary situation, it should be obvious as to which should  be given priority.    Any conclusion to the above comparison should be  self-evident  if one would only weigh the ill effects on the welfare of the  general public between a one-month delay in implementing  procedures for economic recovery versus a similar delay in the  passage of the political reform laws. Any failure with respect  to action on the economic front will only serve to worsen the  prime minister's position.    I have other reasons for being unhappy with Mr. Ozawa. The  issue pertains to the general contractor situation. Why is it  that he hesitates to take the initiative in testifying before  the Diet? Although Mr. Ozawa emphasized in comments before a  press conference on 8 November 1993 about a 5 million yen  contribution from Kajima that "the contribution has been  properly accounted for under the Political Funds Control Law,"  he did not clarify which political funding organization received  the contribution. He has thus failed to give enough  clarification to dispel any suspicion about the donation.    His position on the issue is clearly inconsistent with a  book  authored by him which reads, "We must publicly divulge every yen  of receipts and disbursements concerning political funds and  provide complete transparency concerning the flow of such funds."    Initially, the Social Democratic Party of Japan launched a  move to summon Mr. Ozawa to testify as a witness in the matter,  but withdrew the demand based on opposition from within the  ruling coalition. This situation disqualifies the ruling  coalition from speaking of political reform and reflects a  failure to recognize the gravity of the problem.    I will express one more grievance. The incident arising from  the barring of NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN and SANGYO KEIZAI SHIMBUN  reporters from press conferences reflected a high degree of  immaturity by Mr. Ozawa. I couldn't believe my ears when he  said, "Press conferences are conducted as a matter of service  and are not obligatory." I would like to see Mr. Ozawa conduct  himself so that he does not "belittle himself."    In observing Mr. Ozawa in the past several years, I get the  "impression that he constantly seeks the shortest possible route  to achieve his goals." I do not insist that his approach is  wrong, but the resistance posed is occasionally so overwhelming  that he is forced to take a "circuitous route." Attempting to  force his way around probably finds him short of resources to  attain his ultimate goal.    It is definitely a case where the prime minister  demonstrates  performance that is no more than that of an amateur and it is  probably no easy task to manage an eight-party  wooden-mosaic-like ruling coalition. But, Mr. Ozawa must have  formed the Hosokawa government well aware of such limitations.    At the Shinseito general meeting of members of both houses  on  4 January, Mr. Ozawa announced, "I hope to serve the coalition  in the new year without being as self-centered as I was during  the last year." I would like to see him use the new year as an  occasion to deal with Japanese politics in a transitory stage  with renewed resolve from the vantage point of a national leader.</p>

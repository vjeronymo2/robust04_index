			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 15 February carries the "Details" program  dealing with Bosnia, Russian-British talks, and British affairs.    The program concludes with announcer Sergey Dorenko saying:  "As we learned this morning from our sources in the Kremlin,  the president will postpone his keynote address to parliament  from 18 February to 24 February, and an official announcement on  this will be made a little later. Our sources believe that now  is not the time for the president to speak to parliament while  there still remains the slightest hope of a peaceful resolution  of the Bosnian crisis. In parliament, there are very many  politicians who are capable of demanding of Yeltsin the most  resolute measures up to and including military ones."</p>

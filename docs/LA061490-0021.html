			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEAL IN DISH FROM PUERTO VALLARTA;  </P> <P> EMISSARY: BEA BENDER'S ARRIVAL IN THE RESORT COMMUNITY BENEFITED MEXICAN AS  WELL AS AMERICAN MENUS.  </P> <P> About 20 years ago, an American woman named Bea Bender moved to Puerto Vallarta  and began to explore the local cuisine. As years passed, Bender became an  expert in preparing traditional Mexican food and also in adapting the available  ingredients to American favorites. The result was a weekly cookery column, "Out  of Bea's Kitchen . . . With Love," that appeared in the English language  newspaper, Vallarta Today, starting in November, 1982.  </P> <P> Bender's recipes ranged from carne asada, nopales salad and guacamole to  American-style tomato spice cake with cream cheese frosting. In between were  such cross-cultural dishes as shark bisque, mango bread and tacos filled with  chicken salad.  </P> <P> When Bender arrived in Vallarta, meals were based largely on seafood and on  dishes that did not require refrigeration. Local meats were tough, and  convenience foods were unknown. Not until the early 1980s was whipping cream  available.  </P> <P> "Everything was made from scratch, like cakes, mayonnaise, yogurt, biscuits, or  brought by northern friends and guests from a long-running want list of  stateside goodies," she said.  </P> <P> Born in New York City, Bender and her husband, Bernie, lived for many years in  Van Nuys before moving to Mexico. In Puerto Vallarta, their son, Michael,  opened the town's first modern, air-conditioned meat market with refrigeration.  This was the Super Carniceria "Chico's," a place where expatriates could get  American cuts of beef, and turkeys for Thanksgiving. Bernie Bender, a retired  dentist, helped out in the market, and Bea provided recipes for the customers  and cooked batches of deli-style foods.  </P> <P> "My culinary reputation grew rapidly as I found myself preparing kilos of  granola, sauerkraut, corned beef, mango chutney, sour dill pickles and yogurt  to service the meat market," she said.  </P> <P> The limited refrigeration, water and electric power shortages of early-day  Vallarta led to the popularity there of a type of dish called tinga, which  Bender defined as "a meal-in-a-dish stew."  </P> <P> The following menu centers around Bender's festive chicken tinga, Pollo de la  Patria. Carrots, chayote, green beans and green pepper go into the pot along  with the chicken. Almonds, raisins and capers add to the rich flavor, and the  seasonings include orange juice, saffron, cinnamon and cloves. Baked Cumin  Rice, a recipe from Bender's column, goes with the chicken.  </P> <P> An appetizer plate, a chilled soup and a chutney show off the fruits and  vegetables that are so well-liked in Mexico. The appetizer plate combines  orange and cucumber slices, pickled onions and marinated poblano chiles. The  soup contains cantaloupe and grapes, and the chutney is made with mangoes.  </P> <P> For dessert, Bender suggested a walnut torte drenched with a combination of  melted butter and honey.  </P> <P> SOPA DE MELON  </P> <P> 3 cups peeled, diced cantaloupe  </P> <P> 1 cup diced cooked potato  </P> <P> 1 3/4 cups half and half  </P> <P> 2 cups orange juice  </P> <P> 1/2 cup white wine or 1/4 cup dry Sherry  </P> <P> 1 cup seedless green grapes, halved  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Lemon or lime slices  </P> <P> Combine cantaloupe, potato and half and half in blender and blend to smooth  puree.

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Man in the News: Former rebel with a pacifist cause - Alija Izetbegovic The route from Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, northwards towards Croatia, is marked not only by road signs but by Serb Orthodox church domes, Moslem mosques, and Catholic spires. Despite the religious and cultural diversity of the industrial heartland of Yugoslavia, there are few political slogans or flags extolling the Bosnian parties representing these three communities. It is a world apart from the other side of the River Sava, where flags proclaim the nationalism of President Franjo Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union. Unlike the neighbouring presidents of Serbia and Croatia, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia, has refused to play the nationalist card since winning office in November 1990. Mr Izetbegovic is astute enough to know that nationalist symbols can divide, not unite, the fractious communities over which he presides. But holding Moslems (44 per cent of the 4.3m population), Serbs (33 per cent) and Croats (17 per cent) together in a fragile peace has been put to the test this week. Territorial ambitions by Serb and Croat nationalists in Bosnia-Hercegovina have brought the republic to the brink of civil war. Armed gangs of Serb extremists formed barricades around Sarajevo on the pretext of seeking justice for the murder of a Serb at a local wedding. In reality, they were protesting against the overwhelming vote for independence from the rump Yugoslav federation by Bosnia's Moslems and Croats. The sight of the barricades sent ripples of panic and fear through the capital's bazaars - once ruled by the Turks, and later the Hapsburgs, and where Serbs, Croats, Moslems and Jews have co-existed for centuries. But Mr Izetbegovic, determined not to be intimidated by the Serbs, or provoked by a younger generation of Moslems urging him to take a tougher line, adopted an almost Gandhi-like, pacifist response. After talks with Serbian leaders, and peaceful demonstrations, the barricades were lifted. It was a telling example of how this once rebellious writer's adherence to a philosophy of patience and tolerance can cool tempers and defuse an explosive situation. It would have been understandable had this small, soft-spoken, 66-year-old writer and lawyer used his office to seek redress for present and historical grievances against Moslems. In the mid-19th century, his ancestors were expelled from Belgrade, capital of Serbia, after a constitutional clause was enacted banning Moslems, Jews and gypsies from living in the city. Mr Izetbegovic's grandparents settled in Samac, on the Sava, then moved to Sarajevo. There, the young Alija, born in 1926, witnessed several Serbian massacres of more than 100,000 Moslems during the second world war. At the age of 20, he had a brush with the communist authorities for his political activities, for which he received a three-year prison sentence. On release, he completed his law studies at Sarajevo university, and worked as a legal adviser for two large Bosnian enterprises. In 1983, he was sentenced again - this time for 14 years, commuted to five - for writing the 'Islamic Declaration', a political tract which sought to reconcile European democratic principles with (Sunni) Islamic teaching. He was released in November 1988 and founded the Moslem-based Party of Democratic Action which won the most seats in the republic's first free parliamentary elections in November 1990. 'He is aware of the bloody history of the Balkans,' says a close friend from his university days. 'He knows that instability in Bosnia-Hercegovina has always provided opportunities for satisfying the territorial ambitions of Croatia and Serbia. Both have traditionally vied for influence and expansion into this republic.' That partly explains why Mr Izetbegovic has declined to side with either Bosnia's Serbs or Croats. 'He tries to have good relations with both communities so as to preserve the traditions of co-existence in Bosnia,' says another government minister. Other officials argue that the Moslems will be forced to seek their own state to protect themselves from Croat and Serbian territorial ambitions. Mr Izetbegovic rejects this idea. 'Our home is in Europe, and not in a fundamentalist state. My aim is to have an independent, democratic republic which conforms to European standards.' His friends support this view. 'I used to think that Izetbegovic was politically nave, that he would be trampled upon in such a way he would be radicalised,' one of them says. Another friend says: 'I slowly realised that he had a different sense of time, preferring to negotiate, rather than react. He believes there is always a tomorrow, and that time is on his side.' Over the past few months, it often seemed that time was running out for Bosnia's Moslems. President Tudjman and President Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader, have been fomenting instability in Bosnia-Hercegovina so as to divide the republic among themselves, Mr Izetbegovic says simply: 'This should not happen.' At the same time, the federal Yugoslav army has been withdrawing from war-torn Croatia and moving into Bosnia. The republic risks becoming a huge garrison for discontented, mainly Serbian, soldiers who might be tempted to side with Bosnia's Serbian population if there is an outbreak of violence. Mr Izetbegovic is sanguine, however. 'We will talk to the generals. I am not so sure that the army will side with the Serbs.' This strategy of negotiation has paid off so far. This week, General Milutin Kukanic, head of the federal army garrison in Sarajevo, declined to join the Serb barricades. Mr Izetbegovic is hoping, with the army on the sidelines temporarily and a referendum to support him, that the European Community will recognise Bosnia's independence. He believes this will prevent Croatia and Serbia from trying to divide Bosnia and setting up cantons based on ethnic communities - an impractical objective given the complex ethnic patchwork of the republic. 'Our independence must be recognised, and it must be backed by the deployment of United Nations peace-keeping forces as soon as possible,' Mr Izetbegovic said recently. So far, the UN is deploying 13,000 troops to keep the peace in Croatia; only the administrative headquarters will be in Sarajevo. 'If the UN forces were sent, the tension would decrease,' the president says. This weekend Mr Izetbegovic will again put his case for the recognition of the republic to the EC in Brussels. 'What more can we do?' asked a close colleague of the president. No doubt, he will get a sympathetic hearing. But it may be that that is all he will get.</p>

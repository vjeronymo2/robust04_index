			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Gardening: How impulse can cost you the earth - Robin Lane Fox finds astonishing price differences at garden centres We all watch the retail price index for its ups and downs: I am a keener observer of the impulse index. This tells you what percentage you have to pay for buying on the spur of the moment and not shopping around. In December, it outperforms the FT index. It is particularly fascinating to keen gardeners who are, usually, peasants at heart. The index tells them something about fellow gardeners who are not such peasants and are not so keen on the dirty bits of their shared pastime. To work out the index, you must price what you want at two or three different places on the road into central London. Begin with its origin, then its first significant urban outlet, and then its final resting place in the vibrant heart of today's capital where everybody is cutting each other's throat. Those of us who go back to a product's origin are said in the trade to be 'sourcing'. My sourcing begins where the wolds first become evident in the Cotswolds. Away from the A40, white-flowered jasmine, 3ft high, is being sold by growers at prices between Pounds 5 and Pounds 7; large-flowered cyclamen, with eight to 10 flowers and as many young buds, cost Pounds 3; small cyclamen persicum cost Pounds 1.50, also in full flower and bud; mistletoe costs Pounds 1, and you could throw in a few universal pansies if you really wanted them. Similar growers extend westwards through the former Vale of Evesham, and nobody would buy from them merely on impulse: you must have decided what you want from a plastic tunnel, even if you are then tempted to add something else. To plot the impulse index, you then follow the items eastwards into London. I begin with the simplest example. Mistletoe is simply mistletoe, on a two-pronged branch without any scope for debate about British Standards or quality guarantees. Now, two of the capital's leading garden centres are the Clifton Nurseries in Little Venice and the Chelsea Gardener in Sydney Street. Unlike me, they have to pay their staff, buy only the best and pay business rates on top. Which brings me back to mistletoe. In the wolds, it costs Pounds 1; in Oxford's garden centres, it sells for Pounds 1.40 upwards; but in the vibrant heart of London, at the Chelsea Gardener, it costs Pounds 5. The index really jumps when it comes to jasmine. There are plenty of buds on my two jasmines, 4ft high on their bamboo canes. I bought them last year for Pounds 5 apiece but I really should be touting them in London. White jasmine in Little Venice is selling at my size for Pounds 40 each, while in Sydney Street it costs Pounds 49.95. Naturally, you would want me to plot the impulse index for Christmas trees, but they have become as hard to follow as the subtle variations between fresh, freshly squeezed, pure and real orange juice. Clifton Nurseries issues a helpful guide to the options, reminding us - rightly - that the traditional Norway spruce is the first to drop its needles; that the Nordmann fir is a soft grey-green and less of a dropper; and that the thickly-branched blue spruce is the best at keeping its needles. In Oxford garden centres, a 4ft-high blue spruce costs Pounds 12.35; in Sydney Street, it is Pounds 32.95. A 7ft traditional Norway Dropper will cost you Pounds 7 in the wolds (the traditional pricing of Pounds 1 a foot still holds up farmers' driveways), Pounds 12 in Oxford, Pounds 21.50 at Clifton and Pounds 22.95 at the Chelsea Gardener. I am not sure that sourcing accounts for any of the Oxford-London differential as all the shops have left previous labels on their blue Norway spruces. These state that the trees have all been sourced from the same place - the Yattendon Estate, which flogs them off in a coniferous bit of Berkshire. Urban garden centres thrive on impulse and occupy extremely valuable sites, so who am I to wish them other than the best of luck? It must be fun putting the stickers on the big specimens which must set somebody's impulses racing: Pounds 152 for a standard holly at Clifton Nurseries; Pounds 99 for a bay tree in Chelsea. The latter tempted me mightily with some camellias with immaculate leaves and upper shoots about 6ft high: they cost Pounds 84 each for people who cannot wait. Londoners may be particularly impulsive, but the truth is that shoppers at garden centres anywhere will go over the top for a plant which looks upright and 'fully grown'. Why not trim the side stems of your shrubs and sell them off as standards at five times the price? In Oxford, an ordinary yellow-berried cotoneaster is costing Pounds 29.95 already in a standard shape. It might be worth running it up to the Kings Road in Chelsea on spec to see if you could palm it off on somebody for as much again. Are my fellow gardeners nits? From a nurseryman, Pounds 5.50 would buy you my top Christmas present for anyone who is keen and green: the cream and grey-green rhamnus, which will flourish on a south or west wall. It costs more in a garden centre; in Little Venice, it is Pounds 9.95, and in Chelsea it sets you back Pounds 14.95, with no variation in quality. Certainly, the nits are impatient: if you look on plants as interior decor which go in a 'room outside', perhaps it is not so nittish to go straight out and buy one which jumps the queue of two growing seasons and is needlessly big. I do, however, appreciate the nit traps. If bigger is better from the buyer's point of view, why not apply the principle and the index to anything which grows? At Clifton Nurseries, you can buy a lump of Alchemilla mollis, the unstoppably vigorous Lady's Mantle, for Pounds 6.95 in an above-average pot. You can add the cypress spurge which used to be such an invasive menace for farmers in East Anglia until the grain barons sprayed it. For Pounds 6.25, you can buy enough of a piece to run wild through a shaded flowerbed and give you stupendous growth on your investment if only you can find a Londoner who is willing to go over the top for too much of it. Christmas shopping is supposed to be bad for the nerves and even worse for the feet. Gardeners, I suggest, could enjoy a day's comparison from one shop to the next. We may be peasants underneath, but the impulse index livens up life even for country mice in towns.</p>

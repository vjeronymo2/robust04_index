			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks denote recorded passages] </F>   [Text] In parliament today Foreign Minister Javier Solana  criticized the leading role of Russia and the United States in  the international action for solving the conflict in former  Yugoslavia. According to Javier Solana, Clinton and Yeltsin's  policy of halting air strikes signaled a go-ahead to the Serbs,  implying that they could continue their actions in Gorazde.  Solana also said that the presence of Spanish soldiers in the  area depends on how the conflict develops.    [Correspondent Durban] Spain is willing for its blue helmets  to remain as long as the Bosnian, Croat, and Serb communities  are willing to live in harmony. This was stated by Javier  Solana today in parliament. It is interpreted as meaning that  Spain is still in favor of a political solution to the Balkan  conflict.    [Solana] "I think that the Spaniards have no reason to feel  humiliated by what is happening. Our role is being carried out  with dignity."    [Durban] Today the gradual replacement of the Madrid Group  went on with another 300 blue helmets leaving Seville for Bosnia.    [Colonel Pedro Brana of Cordoba Group] "The mission is the  same as the one that is being carried out right now. What can  change are the commitments, they change according to the  specific moment."    [Durban] "As was the case before, several women officers are  responsible for the health and psychological care of the  contingent."    [Lieutenant Iris Ruiz] "I belong to the psychiatric group. I  have a diploma in psychology, and we are going to provide  support for the troops and for all the personnel."    [Durban] A further 500 blue helmets will travel to Bosnia  over the next few days to join the Cordoba Group.</p>

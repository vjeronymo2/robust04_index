			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury weaken The prospect of stiffer competition in the cola market sent confectionery and soft drinks group Cadbury-Schweppes tumbling 12 to 438p, as 9.3m shares were traded, the highest daily total for four years. Confirmation that Tesco is to have exclusive rights to sell Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Cola for at least six months, appeared to be the trigger for the latest slide in the stock. The shares fell on Wednesday after an announcement that Virgin group is to launch its own brand cola. Market watchers first thought the new product, whose syrup is to be made by Cott Corporation of Canada, would be distributed largely through independent retailers, thus posing less threat to Cadbury's soft drinks market share. A joint venture between Cadbury and Coca-Cola bottles, cans and distributes Coca-Cola and Cadbury beverages brands in the UK. Analysts said the deal with Tesco was likely to give Virgin its target market share of around 7 per cent of the UK retail market. Miss Arabella Cecil, at Credit Lyonnais, said: 'If the Virgin cola meets Mr Branson's volume targets, Cott Corporation's products will achieve a 20 per cent market share in the UK.' Shares in Tesco hardened 2 1/2 to 239 1/2 p.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / German jobless at record 2.15m in May In spite of a slight seasonal decline in unemployment, the number of jobless in western Germany stood at a record 2.15m for the month of May, a 26 per cent increase on a year ago, Quentin Peel reports from Bonn. Overall, the number wholly unemployed in both east and west Germany was almost 3,245,000, with a jobless rate of 6.9 per cent in the west and 14.4 per cent in the east. The very modest decline during May confirmed fears that unemployment will rise by around 500,000 during the course of the year, as the current recession continues. Mr Bernhard Jagoda, president of the federal labour office, said the 'economic and structural strains' on the labour market were still apparent. Besides the wholly unemployed, there was a drop of 490,000 in the number of economically active job-seekers in west Germany, and a further 937,000 were on short-time working. Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democratic party in the ruling Bonn coalition, warned that an 'honest calculation' of unemployment would put it at around 5m. That was simply intolerable.</p>

Large amounts of rural labor force have moved into  rural nonagricultural businesses, and the employment structure  of rural labor force is becoming increasingly rationalized.  Presently Shanghai's rural economy has begun the transformation  from a planned economy into a market economy, and agricultural  production is also going through the change from traditional  agriculture mainly based on manual operations into modern  agriculture. The rural secondary industry is already of a  substantial size, and is changing from pursuing extensive  development into pursuing intensive development.    In this transformation process there have emerged some  problems which are affecting the further transfer and proper  placement of rural labor force. The main manifestations are:    1. Rural labor force, especially agricultural labor  force, is to a large extent characterized by low cultural and  technical qualities; thus there are only a small number of  employment opportunities available for selection, and getting  into high-grade industries is difficult. According to a  survey, in 1992 13.1 percent of Shanghai's rural labor force was  illiterate or semiliterate; 34.7 percent had received elementary  education; 43.8 percent had received lower secondary education;  8.4 percent had received upper secondary education or more; and  19.2 percent had received professional and technical training of  various kinds. The labor force engaged in agricultural  production had even lower cultural and technical qualities.    Currently rural secondary and tertiary industries,  especially  some high-grade industries, have very high demands on the  quality of labor force. Thus, in view of its present quality, it  is very difficult to transfer rural labor force to rural  nonagricultural businesses, especially to high-grade industries.    2. The capacity of township industrial enterprises to  absorb surplus rural labor force has weakened, and there have  even occurred relative surpluses in some regions. Before  1988 Shanghai's township industry mainly concentrated funds on  developing new enterprises. After the start of 1989 it began to  change from developing expanded reproduction mainly based on  extensive development into developing expanded reproduction  mainly based on intensive development through carrying out  enterprises' technological transformation and through renovating  equipments; township industry has changed from being  labor-intensive into being technology-intensive. As a result,  the capacity of township industry, the main actor which absorbs  surplus rural labor force, to absorb surplus rural labor force  has weakened, and the problem of transferring difficulty is  becoming increasingly prominent.    3. The rural tertiary industry is developing slowly,  and thus is unlikely to absorb surplus rural labor force on a  larger scale. In 1992, citywide 476,700 rural workers were  working in the tertiary industry, accounting for 19.5 percent of  the total rural labor force; however, if the 261,000 workers who  have left their native places are not counted, only 215,700  rural workers are actually working in the rural tertiary  industry, accounting for 8.8 percent of the total rural labor  force. In recent years, compared with the secondary industry,  Shanghai's rural tertiary industry has not developed quickly;  especially, the development of some relatively high-grade  industries has been slow, and is thus not meeting the demand of  comprehensive development.    4. The difference in comparative gains between  agriculture and rural nonagricultural businesses is growing,  leading to surplus rural labor force's unwillingness to engage  in farming. In recent years, as prices for agricultural  production materials have grown continually, agricultural  production leads to little gains or even losses; peasants'  interests have been harmed, and there is a widespread  agriculture-despising mentality.    Currently most of those working in the front line of  agriculture are female workers who are of low cultural qualities  and at the age of 35 or older. The long continuance of this  situation is sure to result in the decline of the quality of  agricultural production and economic returns, leading to a new  crises in agricultural production. As the difference in  comparative gains between agriculture and nonagricultural  businesses is growing, the surplus labor force is unwilling to  return to the front line of agriculture, although the phenomenon  of relative surpluses of secondary-industry labor force is  widespread in many regions where township enterprises are less  developed.    As proven by practice, the transfer of surplus rural labor  force is one of the important ways to make peasants become rich.  Finding ways to complete the transfer process through  rationally allocating rural labor force will be of great  significance not only to the steady growth of peasant income,  but also to the comprehensive development of the rural economy  as a whole.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 4 Apr (PL) -- Uruguayan President Luis  Alberto Lacalle met today with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina, who is on an official visit to this South American  nation as part of a regional tour.    Robaina met with the Uruguayan president at his private  residence, where the two men exchanged ideas on the upcoming  Ibero-American Summit to be held in Cartagena, Colombia, as well  as Cuba's economic changes.    During the meeting, the Cuban foreign minister explained to  Lacalle about preparations for the conference "The Nation and  Emigration," to be held in Havana from 22 to 24 April with the  participation of 200 representatives of the nucleus of people  who have emigrated from the island and settled in approximately  20 nations.    The foreign minister also met with Enrique Braga, director  of  the Central Bank of Uruguay, to discuss the possible payment of  the Cuban foreign debt, estimated at over $30 million.    Robaina indicated it was possible to find a favorable  solution for both nations after he explained that Havana could  supply Montevideo with specific items (medicines and medical  equipment). He announced the upcoming visit of high-level Cuban  banking officials to initiate negotiations.    Robaina also met with General Liber Seregni, president of  the  Coalition of the Broad Left Front, and legislators, who are  members of the Uruguayan parliament's foreign relations  commission.    According to the agenda, talks between the Cuban foreign  minister and his colleague Sergio Abreu will begin tomorrow.    On Thursday, Robaina will continue his tour to Ecuador,  Peru,  and Argentina. He will conclude his trip with an unofficial  visit to Paraguay, a nation with which Cuba does not have  diplomatic relations.</p>

In a  communique broadcast on the national radio, Ferdinand Leopold  Oyono, Cameroonian minister of foreign affairs, states that such  a withdrawal would be "a goodwill gesture." According to the  communique, Babagana Kingibe, his Nigerian counterpart "pointed  out that there was a variety of goodwill gestures that could be  envisaged."    Contrary to what was announced, the Nigerian foreign  minister  was not received by President Paul Biya during his visit to  Cameroon. Furthermore, the proposed summit between the two heads  of state is not mentioned because, according to informed  sources, President Biya conditions such a meeting on the total  and unconditional withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the Bakassi  Peninsula.    According to the communique, the two delegations stressed  "the importance assumed by the exchange of visits at heads of  state level at this phase of dialogue, as well as the need for  detailed preparations to enable such exchange of visits attain  the expected fruitful results." The communique stresses "the  need for urgent measures likely to create or increase the  confidence between the two countries and allow for the active  search of dialogue to this dispute.</p>

Also located in that building are the independent TURAN NEWS  AGENCY, Democracy Development Fund, Cultural Fund "Yurd", the  Independent Centre for Economic and Political Researches and the  International Centre "Polyglot".    During the past three days the police, armed with machine  guns, as well as employees of the Procurator's Office of the  republic, continued their searches of offices in the building,  and checked people entering and exiting the building.    Today the journalists of "AZADLYG" and TURAN NEWS AGENCY  held  a joint press conference and provided details about the  arbitrary lawlessness of the police to foreign diplomats and  journalists.    Having found nothing in the rooms and basements of the  building, the police and the employees of the Procurator's  office were compelled to leave. Earlier they had said that  "journalists hid weapons and ammunition in the rooms." But  having found nothing, the policemen seized several issues of  TURAN daily news reports and several issues of independent  newspaper, CHESHME ("MOSAIC").    Due to the lawlessness by the police, the employees of Turan  news agency and the remaining organizations located in the  building were unable to work for the entire day.</p>

			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: Japanese life insurers warned of challenges JAPANESE life insurers face significant challenges to their financial strength this decade, warns Moody's Investment Service, the US credit rating agency. It points to deteriorating asset quality and higher yields on maturing policies. The problems of Japanese life insurers come as Japanese financial institutions are being forced to cope with the aggressive growth of the 1980s. The agency said the ratings of Japanese life insurance companies were under downward pressure in the longer term. In the light of this Moody's said it was reviewing the financial strength rating of three leading life insurers, Meiji Mutual Life Insurance, Sumitomo Life Insurance, and Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance, for possible downgrades from their current ratings of Aaa. The sharp fall in the stock market has had an impact on insurers since the unrealised gains on their stock holdings, which served as buffers by absorbing losses on investments, has declined sharply. This has led them to cut sharply the level of new investments in high-risk products. The life insurance companies also have significant exposure to the faltering domestic property market, through loans to corporations and non-bank financial institutions. In addition to their problems in the 1980s, life insurers have increased investments in foreign securities and real estate, making portfolios vulnerable to foreign currency movements.</p>

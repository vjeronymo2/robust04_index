			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: DC Cook falls 69% but restores dividend DC COOK Holdings, the USM-quoted motor dealer and property developer, yesterday announced the resumption of its interim dividend in spite of a 69 per cent decline to Pounds 107,000 in pre-tax profits. Mr Derek Cook, the chairman whose family controls 40 per cent of the company, said he expected the full-year dividend to be increased in light of the group's confidence over trading in the second half. 'A profit for the year is almost certain,' he said. The interim distribution was restored at 0.2p. The Pounds 233,000 costs of establishing operations in Spain were responsible for virtually all of the profit fall in the six months to October 31. Turnover slipped from Pounds 63.7m to Pounds 56.9m. The motor division, which recorded losses last year, had been turned round to show an Pounds 810,000 profit in the first half. 'The total motor division is profitable,' Mr Cook said. During the first half, DC Cook integrated the operation's three arms - retail, service and finance - resulting in substantial cost savings. Mr Cook said new and used car sales had held steady, in spite of the generally depressed state of the UK new car market. The property operation, which develops petrol stations for oil companies, recorded a loss of Pounds 470,000 in the first half. However, Mr Cook said the division would return a profit for the full year, since several contracts had been agreed in the last month. The deregulation of the Spanish petrol sector provided significant opportunities for the group, Mr Cook said. 'The major oil companies are desperate for sites,' he added. In June, the company bought Norfolk Espana, a Spanish roadside developer, for a nominal sum and took on its Pounds 2m debt. Interest charges fell from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.13m, largely due to the Pounds 4.2m rights issue in October which cut gearing to about 70 per cent. Fully diluted earnings per share tumbled from 1.19p to 0.33p.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: THERMOMETERS THAT TAKE THE HEAT  </P> <P> In cooking procedures such as baking, roasting, candy making and deep-fat  frying, accurate temperatures are critical. Using a thermometer can mean the  difference between success and failure of a recipe.  </P> <P> There are two basic types of thermometers -- bimetal and glass-tube. "Cooking A  to Z" (Ortho Books: 1988, $32.95) explains: "Bimetal thermometers have a face,  like a dial, and a pointer. The pointer moves by action of a spring made of two  metals welded together, which react differently to heat. A change in  temperature causes the spring to wind or unwind and move the pointer around the  dial. Bimetal thermometers are less accurate than the glass-tube type, but the  dials are easier to read and they hold a temperature reading longer."  </P> <P> The book goes on to say: "Glass-tube models register temperature by the  expansion or contraction of a fluid -- mercury or a colored liquid -- trapped  in a thin column of glass." It notes that "Glass-tube thermometers are very  accurate and responsive, but are fragile and more difficult to read than a dial  type."  </P> <P> Some thermometers are multipurpose and have a wide temperature range (all  temperatures in this column are given in Fahrenheit). Others have a more narrow  range for greater accuracy and are intended for a single purpose, such as the  following:  </P> <P> Oven Thermometers -- Although conventional ovens have internal thermostats,  they may not always be calibrated accurately and sometimes become defective.  Ovens also tend to have hot and cold spots. A supplemental thermometer provides  an added check that the appliance is working properly and pinpoints problem  areas. Oven thermometers typically register temperatures up to 600 or 700  degrees.  </P> <P> In years past, oven temperatures were often expressed in words, but today the  use of exact degrees is standard. Here's a translation of the terms:  </P> <P> Very slow -- 250 to 300 degrees  </P> <P> Slow -- 300 to 325 degrees  </P> <P> Moderately slow -- 325 to 350 degrees  </P> <P> Moderate -- 350 to 375 degrees  </P> <P> Quick moderate -- 375 to 400 degrees  </P> <P> Moderately hot -- 400 to 425 degrees  </P> <P> Hot -- 425 to 450 degrees  </P> <P> Very hot -- 450 to 500 degrees  </P> <P> Extremely hot -- 500 to 525 degrees  </P> <P> Refrigerator/Freezer Thermometers -- Like their oven counterparts, these  thermometers are used to double-check the appliance's internal thermostat. The  recommended setting for refrigerators is between 32 and 40 degrees; freezers  should be kept at zero degrees.  </P> <P> Meat Thermometers -- Internal temperature is the best indication of doneness  for meats, poultry and game. Slow-response type thermometers register  temperatures up to about 200 degrees and are recommended for use in  conventional ovens. Insert the probe into the meat or poultry before cooking  and leave it in position throughout the cooking period.  </P> <P> Instant-read thermometers register internal temperatures between 60 and 220  degrees after being inserted into food for about 10 seconds. They are  particularly useful for taking quick readings of foods cooked by rotisserie and  microwave. Only plastic, slow-response thermometers should be used inside  microwave ovens.  </P> <P> These are the recommended cooking temperatures for meat and poultry, in  Fahrenheit:  </P> <P> Beef -- 125 to 130 degrees for rare; 140 to 145 degrees for medium; 160 degrees  for well-done.  </P> <P> Lamb -- 130 to 140 degrees for rare; 145 degrees for medium; 160 degrees for  well-done.  </P> <P> Pork -- 145 to 150 degrees for medium; 160 degrees for well-done.  </P> <P> Poultry -- 170 to 175 degrees for medium; 180 degrees for well-done.  </P> <P> Veal -- 140 to 145 degrees for medium; 160 degrees for well-done.  </P> <P> Candy-Making Thermometers -- An upper limit of approximately 325 degrees is  necessary to provide a margin of safety above the high of 310 degrees required  for some candies. Most are glass-tube types and have a clip so they may be  attached to the side of the pan.  </P> <P> Within this classification there are also thermometers designed especially for  chocolate. They measure temperatures from about 50 to 140 degrees in wide,  one-degree increments that are easy to read.  </P> <P> As with older baking and roasting recipes, candy temperatures are sometimes  described in terms of appearance rather than degrees. Here are the equivalents:  </P> <P> Thread -- 230 to 234 degrees  </P> <P> Soft ball -- 234 to 240 degrees  </P> <P> Firm ball -- 244 to 248 degrees  </P> <P> Hard ball -- 250 to 266 degrees  </P> <P> Soft crack -- 270 to 290 degrees  </P> <P> Hard crack -- 300 to 310 degrees  </P> <P> Deep-Fat Frying Thermometers -- To accommodate the high temperatures used for  frying, these thermometers typically have an upper limit of 500 degrees. Many  can be clipped to the side of the pan so they suspend in the fat without  touching the bottom.  </P> <P> It's common to find combination candy and deep-fat frying thermometers.  </P> <P>  Suggestions for column topics may be sent to Back to Basics, Food Section, The  Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

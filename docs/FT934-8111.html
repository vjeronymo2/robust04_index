			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Arts: The trouble with Berkoff . . . - Theatre Steven Berkoff is one great rampant ego. His energy is terrific, and every scrap of it is ploughed into showing off. Both in motion and in speech, he draws maximum attention to his own method of performance. Yet the more you attend to the way he performs, the harder it becomes to take in what he is performing. His current solo show, One Man - which has just opened (after its Edinburgh Festival Fringe outing) at the Garrick - consists of three different 'acts'. In none of them, however, has his style any depth. All is flashy, over-elaborate surface. Berkoff's art is one of cartoon-like over-emphasis. The point of his sketches, like Monty Python's, is that they go into overkill. But no Python performer was ever so self-regarding or relentlessly cynical as this. One of this evening's three sketches is The Actor, in which, like a failed actor keeping fit, he jogs into a whirlpool: a non-stop downward spiral of going to auditions, ringing his agent, losing his wife, visiting his parents, meeting fellow-actors and bitching about those in employment behind their backs. Parts of the audience are amused by this far from original vision of an actor's life as an endless round of malice, hypocrisy, envy, and panic. The dominant impression, however, is of the non-stop jogging-on-the-spot many-voiced virtuosity that Berkoff expends on it. His combination of technical bravura and spite is loathsome. Worse is the version of Edgar Allen Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart which forms the evening's opening half. Here Berkoff embroiders Poe's narration of furtive but gruesome murder and paranoia with an endless array of actorliness. He changes voice and accent several times in mid-sentence; he repeats the word 'stealthily' seven times while (a) diminishing it into silence (b) exaggerating the oral gesture of saying it; he demonstrates 20 different ways of laughing (in series); and so forth. When a police siren is heard outside the theatre, he incorporates that too into his act - with such relish, and in such a studied way, that you realise he welcomes such intrusions as a way of showing off further. Dog, with which Berkoff closes this programme, is the least irritating. Here he is a lager lout and his killer mastiff; and here at last his cartoon-type method has some comic success - mainly in the throttled rage with which he invests the dog. As long as he is busy alternating between personae, Dog keeps Berkoff out of his usual love of excess. But here too there are passages when Berkoff paints the lily, then gilds it, and finally then shoves knobs on it. These occur when Berkoff cannot suppress his naturally adolescent love of gruesomeness - as when he mimes vomiting until he mimes swimming through his own vomit; or (in Tell-Tale Heart) when he mimes hacking through each different fibre of the corpse. All that energy, and all of it pumping into a form of self-display both decadent (in its love of excess) and immature. At the Garrick Theatre, WC2, 071-494-5085</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by N. Zubkova: "On Behalf of the Parties"] </F>   [Text] And elections yet again. And not the last. But the  fate of the Supreme Council of Ukraine and the parliament of  Crimea will have been decided by Monday, 11 April. It is in our  hands. This page is devoted to it -- directly or indirectly. It  is an appeal of the electorate to those who have already been  elected, an attempt to analyze the results of the first round,  and an introduction of the candidates who have made it through  to the second round. In a word, think for yourselves.    KRYMSKIYE IZVESTIYA has received a statement of the SPRK  [Socialist Party of the Republic of Crimea] Political Council,  which says, in part, that the stage of the election campaign  which has been negotiated "was accompanied by violations of the  law of the Republic of Crimea `On Elections of the Supreme  Council of Crimea' and was conducted under conditions impeding  in a number of cases the free expression of the citizens," which  was a violation of articles 38 and 39 of the law, "and there was  frequently concentrated pressure on the electorate by activists  of the Russia bloc."    The party believes that the president interfered directly in  the election process by means of his initiative pertaining to  the organization of a poll of citizens of the Republic  simultaneously with the elections.    The party experienced direct threats and blackmail on the  part of the supporters of other political parties--this was  possible thanks to the policy of implacability toward different  political views: "I. Khodykin, candidate for deputy and member  of the SPRK Political Council, was subjected to armed assault  and battery, and the appearances of the SPRK candidates on radio  and television and in the press, obligatory by law, were  frequently aborted. All this culminated in the president's  appeal in his speech on television on 25 March for people to  shun the ballot for elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine  and to vote only for his associates, which should be considered  a direct violation of the constitution and the Election Act."    In this connection the SPRK Political Council deemed it  necessary to insistently demand that the Central Election  Commission "consider the elections null and void and, in  accordance with Article 64 of the law `On Elections of the  Supreme Council of Crimea,' schedule new elections within the  established timeframe."    In respect to the first demand the party is prepared to  present the Central Election Commission with all the necessary  papers confirming the instances of violations.    A statement of similar content was addressed by the Crimean  Tatar National Movement to the presidents of Crimea, Ukraine,  and Russia and the news media. The CTNM [Crimean Tatar National  Movement] evaluates the elections to the Supreme Council of  Crimea as "an act of the greatest outrage against the will of  the Crimean Tatar people."    As the statement says, "the three years of the fooling of  the  people by the state-run news media together with the most  flagrant violations of the Election Act... ensured the  co-optation into the Supreme Council of Crimea of the  "Kurultay-Majlis" cohort.    Consequently, the information working group of the CTNM  concludes, the imperial "Crimea without the Crimean Tatar  people" policy is hereby continued, and it places the  responsibility for the further development of events on the  leaders of the above-mentioned states.    The appeal of the Russia bloc says that it thanks Crimeans  for the support of President Yu. Meshkov and the candidates of  the Russia bloc in the first round of the elections. "This  support is very palpable: Of the possible 14 seats by party  slate, the Russia bloc obtained 11, that is, 78.57 percent.    "In addition, from the 66 single-seat districts in the first  round of voting, 12 deputies were elected from the Russia bloc,  and 48 candidates have gone on to the second round. The  elections were not held in four districts, unfortunately."    The Russia bloc called on the electorate to once again  support its candidates "so that the new parliament can begin  work and so that President Yu. Meshkov can obtain a legislative  base for realization of the program of the Russia bloc."</p>

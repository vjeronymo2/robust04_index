			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Insolvency law excludes silence IN RE BISHOPSGATE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT LTD MIRROR GROUP NEWSPAPERS AND OTHERS v MAXWELL AND OTHERS Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Dillon, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and Lord Justice Mann): January 29 1992 PRIVILEGE against self-incrimination is excluded by insolvency legislation, and accordingly a person questioned by provisional liquidators investigating company affairs cannot refuse to answer on the ground that to do so might expose him to prosecution. But the statutory exclusion cannot be invoked by a company which is not in liquidation, administration or receivership, and a former director or other fiduciary questioned by court order as an aid to Mareva relief in an action to account for monies transferred away from the company can avail himself of the privilege under the general law, and refuse to speak. The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing three appeals by Mr Kevin Maxwell and others against Mr Justice Hoffmann's decision that he must answer questions put to him by the provisional liquidator of Bishopsgate Management Ltd; and dismissing an appeal by Mirror Group Newspapers and others from the judge's decison that Mr Maxwell was entitled not to answer questions put to him by their directors on the ground that to do so might incriminate him. LORD JUSTICE DILLON said Bishopsgate was the investment trustee of a common investment fund established for the Mirror Group Pension scheme. Mr Maxwell was a director of Bishopsgate from February 1988 until he resigned on December 4 1991. Large sums of money which ought to be in the common investment fund were not there and had not been traced. Other parts of the fund had been traced into the hands of banks claiming security rights. Mr Maxwell was one of the most obvious persons for the provisional liquidators to question. As for the Mirror Group claims, Mr Maxwell was a director of Mirror Group before its flotation in May 1991, and from November 6 1991 until he resigned on December 3 1991. Even when not a director between May and November, he remained an authorised signatory on certain Mirror Group bank accounts. In the Mirror Group action, under court orders in aid of Mareva relief, the Group sought information about 26 transfers totalling Pounds 120m from Group accounts, from May 29 to November 29 1991. It appeared that some Pounds 50m represented a facility which Mr Maxwell helped his father to negotiate for the Group with Bankers Trust Co. The Group's present directors wanted to know the purpose of that facility, and of each of the 26 payments. Apart from his concern with the negotiation of the Pounds 50m facility, Mr Maxwell was one of the signatories who authorised two of the 26 payments. There was no doubt that, apart from the privilege against self-incrimination, Bishopsgate by its provisional liquidators, and Mirror Group, were entitled to receive from Mr Maxwell any information he had on the respective matters about which they sought to question him. It was conceded for the liquidators and for the Group that answering the questions might expose Mr Maxwell to prosecution on charges of conspiracy. Privilege against self-incrimination became established in the Common Law after abolition of the Court of Star Chamber. Parliament could abrogate the privilege by statute. Two recent decisions in which it had been held that the privilege was impliedly unavailable to a person questioned under a statute were London United Investments FT, January 17 1992, and Bank of England v Riley, October 17 1990, CA. The essence of both decisions was that if Parliament in the public interest set up investigatory procedures to find out if a company's affairs had been conducted fraudulently, or if there had been infringements of the Banking Act, it could not have intended that anyone questioned under those procedures should be entitled to rely on the privilege. The question in the Bishopsgate appeals was whether similar reasoning applied to the relevant sections of the Insolvency Act 1986. Section 235 of the Act provided that an officer of a company, required to answer the queries of an 'office holder' (administrator, administrative receiver, liquidator or provisional liquidator), 'shall' give him such information as he might reasonably require. Section 236 provided that the court might summon before it any officer of the company or other person thought capable of giving information concerning the company. In Levitt, October 29 1991, which Mr Justice Hoffmann followed, Mr Justice Vinelott said rightly that the provisions of the 1986 Act must be looked at as a whole to ascertain the purpose of an examination under section 236, and whether that purpose necessarily involved abrogation of the privilege. He said: 'To answer that question the court must ask whether the person whom it is sought to examine owes a duty to furnish information sought, and whether there is any public interest in ensuring that the inquiry was carried out thoroughly and expeditiously.' Part of the mischief in the old law was its apparent inability to deal adequately with dishonesty or malpractice on the part of bankrupts or company directors. That was a matter of public concern and there was a public interest in putting it right. As steps to that end, Parliament had by the 1986 Act greatly extended the investigative powers available to office-holders with the assistance of the court, and had expressly placed officers of the company and others listed in section 235(3) under a duty to assist the office-holder. In agreement with Mr Justice Vinelott's general approach, it was held that Mr Maxwell was not entitled to rely on the privilege. The Bishopsgate appeals were dismissed. With regard to the Mirror Group appeals, the Group was not in liquidation, administration or administrative receivership. Accordingly, it could not invoke the 1986 Act and had to rely on the general law. It submitted that under the general law privilege against self-incrimination was not available to a fiduciary, servant or agent. It relied on Green v Weaver (1827) 1 Sim 404, Robinson v Kitchin (1856) 21 Beav 365,8 DeGM &amp; G 88, and Chadwick v Chadwick (1852) 22 LJCh 329. Mr Falconer for the Group said that any person who by contract put himself into the position of fiduciary, servant or agent, impliedly contracted not to invoke the privilege. It was wholly unreal to suppose that when two parties, neither of whom was in probability thinking of privilege against self-incrimination, entered into a contract under which one became the other's fiduciary, servant or agent, they impliedly contracted that he could not invoke privilege. Several of the earlier cases which formed the background of authority to the three cases were so tersely reported and difficult to follow that it was not possible to derive any principle from them. The same could be said of Chadwick. In Green, where unqualified brokers held themselves out to be qualified, Hart V-C held they could not rely on the privilege. He deduced from the authorities that a man by contract or the effect of his own acts might exclude himself from the benefit of the privilege against self-incrimination. The facts in Robinson were similar and Green was approved. It was possible that Green and Robinson depended on some principle of estoppel. If so, they had no bearing on the present case. In Tate Access Floors v Boswell (1991) Ch 512 Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C held that Green and Weaver did not establish the wide proposition that a fiduciary impliedly contracted not to claim privilege. He doubted that the cases were good law today. Privilege against self-incrimination was so firmly entrenched in English law before Green, that it could not have been open to Hart V-C to carve such a substantial exception out of the privilege. The present court was not bound by Green and Robinson. It upheld the decision in Tate Access Floors, which Mr Justice Hoffmann followed. The Mirror Group's appeal was therefore dismissed. Any decision to curtail the privilege or make it unavailable was a matter for Parliament. Ther Lordships gave concurring judgments. For Mr Maxwell: Gavin Lightman QC, R Alun Jones QC, Michael Briggs and Philip S Marshall (Peters &amp; Peters). For Bishopsgate: Philip Heslop QC and John Brisby (Stephenson Harwood). For Mirror Group: Charles Falconer QC, Martin Moore and Lexa Hilliard (Lovell White Durrant).</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S PICK: LA RONDE  </P> <P> Mas Ophuls' 1950 all-star French film of the Arthur Schnitzler play takes us  back to an elegant and melancholy turn-of the-century Vienna as our narrator  (Anton Walbrook) tells us of a merry-go-round of romance, which begins and ends  with the picking up of Simone Signoret's young and slim streetwalker. Much  bemused acceptance of the human foibles of infidelity and self-deception. Also  stars Simone and Serge Reggiani (pictured).  </P> <P> KCET Saturday at 10:35 p.m. Kevin Thomas  </P></p>

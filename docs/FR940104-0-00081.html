In the case of a dependent graduate student, the total amount the student may borrow for any period of study for the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program and Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program is the same as the amount determined under paragraph (a) of this section, less any amount received under the Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program or Federal Stafford Loan Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional eligibility under the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In addition to any amount borrowed under paragraph (b), an independent undergraduate student, graduate or professional student, or certain dependent undergraduate students may borrow additional amounts under the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan Program. In order for a dependent undergraduate student to receive this additional loan amount, the financial aid administrator must determine and document in the school's file, after review of the family financial information provided by the student and consideration of the student's debt burden, that the student's parents likely will be precluded by exceptional circumstances (e.g., the student's parent receives only public assistance or disability benefits, is incarcerated, has an adverse credit history, or his or her whereabouts are unknown) from borrowing under the Federal Direct PLUS Program or the Federal PLUS Program and the student's family is otherwise unable to provide the student's expected family contribution. A parent's refusal to borrow a Federal PLUS loan or Federal Direct PLUS loan does not constitute an exceptional circumstance. The additional amount that such a student may borrow under the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program, in combination with Federal Unsubsidized Stafford loans, for any academic year of study is_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) In the case of a student who has not successfully completed the first and second year of a program of undergraduate education, may not exceed_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) $4,000 for enrollment in a program of study of at least a full academic year in length;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) $2,500 for enrollment in a program of study of at least two-thirds but less than a full academic year in length;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) $1,500 for enrollment in a program of study of at least one-third but less than two-thirds of an academic year in length.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In the case of a student who has successfully completed the first and second year of an undergraduate program, but has not completed the remainder of the program of study, may not exceed_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) $5,000 for enrollment in a program of study of at least a full academic year;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the student is enrolled in a program of study with less than a full academic year remaining, a prorated amount that bears the same ratio to $5,000 as the remainder of the program measured in semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours bears to one academic year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In the case of a graduate or professional student, may not exceed $10,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Invergordon bid Whyte &amp; McKay finally made its long-awaited offer for Invergordon Distillers following the purchase of a 13.5 per cent stake from Robert Fleming Investment Management to take the US group's holding to nearly 55 per cent. Whyte &amp; McKay has been sitting on a 41.3 per cent stake in the Scottish whisky company for two years since its failed hostile bid at 275p a share. Yesterday's renewed offer came at 300p a share, although market sources hinted that some institutions approached previously by Whyte &amp; McKay had been holding out for a higher bid. However, the US group said yesterday's Pounds 382.4m offer was final. Most drinks analysts believed the price to be a fair one, particularly in light of the dull global spirits market and the threat of a Christmas price war brewing. Invergordon rose 3 to 297p. The telecoms sector once again saw strident price moves, although it took the arrival of US investors late in the day to fuel the bulk of the moves. After almost a week of profit-taking, Vodafone jumped 15 to 561p, while Cable and Wireless added the same at 963p. Dealers said the latter had been helped by a Mercury pres-entation at Kleinwort Benson. Reports of a stock overhang and a broker's downgrading in Inchcape brought a sharp retreat for the shares. They were finally off 18 at 512p in trade of 3.5m, following a press report that a seller of around 4 per cent of the company's shares had found few takers. Sentiment was further hit by reports that James Capel had reduced its current year forecast by Pounds 13m to Pounds 278m, and lowered the following year's figure by Pounds 30m to Pounds 320m. Water issues generally underperformed, with Credit Lyonnais Laing among those advising a pause for breath ahead of the latest Ofwat report early next month. North West dipped 5 to 554p, Severn Trent 7 1/2 to 559 1/2 p and Wessex 9 to 665p. Preferred instead were selected regional electricity stocks (Recs), among which, London advanced 6 to 599p and Manweb 6 to 653p. Allied-Lyons moved ahead 12 to 599p, spurred on by renewed enthusiasm from Kleinwort Benson. Hoare Govett, meanwhile, was said to be equally bullish over Bass as a 'quality yield stock'. The shares added 10 at 491p. Hoare and Henderson Crosthwaite were also recommending Grand Metropolitan, up 4 at 423p. The Bundesbank cut produced a strong performance by building stocks with large exposure in Germany. Redland moved up 10 to 555p, while RMC added 16 to close at 838p. Reflection and comment over hints from WH Smith on Wednesday that it was considering restructuring its share system saw further gains, mainly in the high-voting 'B's. Smith has indicated to stores analysts that reforming the two-tier structure was more likely to happen the higher the premium in the 'B's over the 'A's. The 'B's closed 6 ahead at 104p and the 'A's a penny up at 480p. Hopes of a UK interest rate cut, together with good retail sales figures, which had lifted several stores stocks in the previous session, impacted on some of those left behind yesterday. Next rose 4 to 199p, Sears 2 1/2 to 116 1/2 p and Stylo 6 to 197p. Results from Albert Fisher disappointed market expectations and the shares fell back 5 to 75p on big turnover of 9.9m. Food manufacturing analysts trimmed their forecasts back to below Pounds 50m for next year amid cautious remarks from the company. Following a couple of high-profile sell notes against ICI, the stock put up a strong fight to finish unchanged on the day at 709p after slipping in early trading. Strong support was seen late in the session and one analyst said that persistent buying showed that investors were looking optimistically at the company's long-term performance. Bearish sentiment has surrounded its third-quarter figures, which are due to be announced next week. BOC was out of favour and receded 11 to 660p. The company announced that it was to reorganise its joint venture with Dow Chemical. Enfranchisement plans helped Parkland Textiles to leap from 260p to 365p, with the 'A' shares advancing 48 to 221p. A good recovery in profits also provided a large amount of power behind the jump. The failure to win in the European Cup on Wednesday hit Manchester United, off 22 at 560p. Thorn EMI rallied after its recent drift, ending 12 better at 921p. A stock overhang combined with continued worries of a cut in defence spending in next month's Budget hurt Vickers. The shares shed 5 to 146p. International mining group RTZ strengthened 12 to 678p after a presentation at Kleinwort Benson on Wednesday. Fears that a win by the opposition in the Canadian federal election could lead to the cancellation of a lucrative helicopter order weakened Westland Group. The stock lost 4 at 216p. BM Group edged a half-penny forward to 21p after its 75 per cent holding in British Building &amp; Engineering Appliances of around 16m shares was placed with institutions by broker Albert E Sharp.</p>

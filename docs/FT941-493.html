			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Pension transfer proposal criticised Reforming valuation of lump sums transferred out of occupational pension schemes and presentation to potential investors should be carried out more quickly than City regulators intend, the National Association of Pension Funds said yesterday. In advance of today's debate in the Commons on private pensions and financial regulation, the association urged the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, to move more quickly than it has proposed in improving this aspect of of pension transfers. The association said that the report from SIB on improving standards in this area of business - which was published last week - was an important step towards ensuring that people were given proper advice. But Mr Tom Ross, NAPF vice-chairman, said the system of fixed-rate projections 'which produce huge estimates that ignore inflation, should be ditched for transfer value business. This should not be delayed until September 1995 as SIB proposes'. He added that it would be vital for the Personal Investment Authority - the new regulator to protect the private investor - to set and monitor high standards 'which are externally recognised for the selling of personal pension business and which will restore consumer confidence'. In today's debate, however, some backbench MPs are expected to express doubts about the PIA's ability to deliver high standards of investor protection. The new regulator received some support yesterday from Autif, the trade association for the unit trust industry. It issued a statement saying that it backed the PIA as 'the only way to improve the position of the public in the short term'. At the same time the association would like to see 'a leavening of commercial expertise' among the PIA staff. In the PIA's organisation plan, published yesterday, three senior members of the existing regulators will be responsible for the legal, policy development and member relations departments. A firm of headhunters is being hired to find a fourth executive to deal with finance.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hemp ban lifted - but for paper not drugs THE UK Home Office is to allow farmers to start commercial production of hemp for the first time in more than 100 years. The fibres can be used for manufacturing top quality paper. Growing hemp was banned in the UK under the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) as it is the source of tetra hydra cannabinol (THC), or cannabis. The Home Office said yesterday that growers would be 'subject to strict licensing controls' to make sure that only varieties with no potential for drugs are grown. However, varieties containing very low amounts of THC are already covered by a long-standing EC regime and are grown in France and Spain. UK farmers will be able to claim an EC grant of about Pounds 250 an acre. Hemp used to be grown in the UK before it was undercut by imports in the days of the British Empire, according to Mr Melvyn Askew, head of crops and horticulture at Adas (the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service). He believes it could once again become a useful crop for UK farmers, who are having to set aside some of their land under the CAP reforms. From a seed the size of wheat, it quickly grows to 4m tall. 'It's annual and easy to grow,' he said. 'It has a very long fibre, which can be used for paper as well as linen, lace and ropes.' He believes the paper market has big potential. Hemp fibre contains only a small amount of lignium, the yellowing agent which needs expensive and environmentally damaging bleaching treatment in wood pulp.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Arts Council saves face with a stroke of genius - Off the Wall Have they got away with it? Will the men who masterminded the biggest debacle in the famously accident prone Arts Council survive in their jobs? It looks like it. On Wednesday the Council ignored the evidence of Sir Leonard Hoffmann's committee into the funding of the London orchestras; disregarded the advice of its own music department, and decided that all four orchestras should receive support in 1994-95 miraculously close to their grants in the current year. The Council's long cherished dream of two super orchestras in London matching in quality the best of Vienna and Berlin goes on ice - at least for another few years. But the solution was a stroke of genius. An absence of victims made it a non-story for the blood-seeking media, and the orchestras were so relieved that, with the exception of the hard done by Philharmonia, they turned into pussycats. Months of turmoil and heartache, of indecision and double dealing, to say nothing of defence costs of at least Pounds 100,000 accumulated by the three orchestras in the firing line, have come to nothing. At least Anthony Everitt, secretary general of the Arts Council, had the grace to say that the orchestras might receive compensation for their trouble. Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Council, could be indicted for pushing the super orchestra idea beyond the call of duty; Anthony Everitt, for pretending to be the innocent messenger between the Council and the music panel; Ken Baird, head of music at the Council, for allowing his recommendation that money should be switched from the LPO to the Philharmonia to be over-ruled by the Council; and Bryan Magee, head of the music panel, for allowing his colleagues to break ranks, resign, leak to the press, and generally behave like musicians. There is one other man who must be lighting candles this weekend: Nicholas Snowman, director of the South Bank Centre, who was languidly ticked off by Sir Leonard for pushing too hard for the LPO, the resident orchestra at the Centre, in his evidence to the Committee. It could be that Hoffmann came out, marginally, in favour of funding the Philharmonia at the expense of the LPO because of such pressure. If the Arts Council had gone with the Philharmonia, as it was morally bound to do, Snowman would have been in an impossible position, with an under-funded resident orchestra with a locked in five year contract, and the prospect of coming to terms with the Philharmonia, with which it has strained relations. One thing has been gained: an excellent report by Sir Leonard Hoffmann into the London music scene, which is available, gratis, from the Arts Council, to anyone interested. The report contains some depressing details. The LPO, the Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic all have worrying deficits; the South Bank, the main London showcase for all three, is suffering from a serious decline in its audience for orchestral music, from an average paid attendance of 81 per cent in 1970-71 to 60 per cent in 1992-93. Any dispassionate observer might say there are too many orchestras in London; perhaps the Arts Council should look into the matter. But, despite the ironies, the final messy compromise is probably the least damaging. Everyone knows that, most nights, there is nothing to choose between the playing quality of the four orchestras (adding in the LSO at the Barbican). Subsidy is a small and declining part of their income. Let the market place decide their future. This week end the RPO can celebrate the prospect of Pounds 500,000 in sponsorship support from Classic FM; the Philharmonia, the public acknowledgement that, along with the LSO, it is perhaps London's premier orchestra; and the LPO its confirmation as resident at the South Bank, with funding intact. The Arts Council hardly deserves such a happy result. There was little merriment at the antique dealers' parties this week. Flamboyant gallery owner Roy Miles for once summed up the general mood: 'we are entering the final death throes of the London art market'. Yet the cause of this gloom, the imposition, at last, of VAT on works of art imported into the UK from non-EC countries, had been hailed by the other half of the market, the auctioneers, as a minor triumph. 'The net effect of these new proposals is minimal' oozed Christie's. 'We are pleased the present uncertainty has ended', adds Sotheby's. On the surface the imposition of VAT at 2 1/2 per cent is scarcely lethal. Christie's was quick to produce a table which showed that an imported item from Australia, say, or the US, which sold for Pounds 100,000 in the auction room, would now cost the buyer Pounds 770 more. The levelling of VAT on the gross price produces an extra cost just marginally higher than the previous payment, which included 17.5 per cent levied on the buyer's premium: the final price would be Pounds 114,287 as against Pounds 113,512. A non-EC buyer who then exports the antique outside the EC would actually pay less since he could get a VAT refund. The auction houses says the dealers are crying wolf. They have been given a valuable lollipop in an extension from six months to two years in the imposition of the tax. If a gallery importing, say, a painting from New York sells it to a collector outside the EC within two years there is no VAT. The big dealers have galleries in the US so if they are unable to find a buyer within two years the picture can be exported to the sister gallery with no tax burden. Of course the real worry is that after five years the VAT will be raised to 5 per cent or more. This is the genuine concern of the dealers. The government has it in its power, at minimal cost, to make things easier for them. They have to accept an EC imposed import tax for the first time, but they still pay 17 1/2 per cent VAT on works of art painted since 1973 while dealers in EC countries pay around 5 per cent. Reducing VAT to the EC level would give a great fillip to contemporary art and provide the dealers with hope for the future. The UK's oldest public picture gallery, at Dulwich, has secured its future by getting an aimable divorce from its previous Trustees, the governors of Dulwich College and Alley's School, and gaining an impressive new board, headed by Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover and including the generous, and rich, Mrs Vivien Duffield and Christopher Brown, chief curator of the National Gallery. The new board is seeking an endowment of Pounds 5m-Pounds 8m. This will ensure that the Gallery no longer suffers from a persistent annual shortfall in revenue of around Pounds 200,000. It will also enable it to open at lunch time, improve the lighting, promote itself, and, eventually, build on a cafe, and space for temporary exhibitions.</p>

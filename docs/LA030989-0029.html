			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SAUGUS BATTLES CRESPI TO A TIE BUT ADVANCES ON BASIS OF TOTAL BASES  </P> <P> Total bases.  </P> <P> Saugus High totaled 23 to Crespi's 18 in Wednesday's third-round game of the El  Segundo tournament.  </P> <P> Why the concern over total bases? Because based on the five-base edge, Saugus  will advance to the fifth-place bracket of the tournament, while Crespi drops  into the running for ninth.  </P> <P> The game at Saugus was halted because of darkness with the score tied, 1-1,  after nine innings. Coaches Scott Muckey of Crespi (1-1-1) and Doug Worley of  Saugus (1-1-1) agreed that the outcome would be recorded as a tie but that the  Centurions would advance by virtue of most total bases.  </P> <P> Neither coach agreed, however, on when the game should have been halted. Muckey  argued with the home plate umpire that Saugus should not have been allowed a  final at-bat in the ninth inning. "He said, 'This is it after this  half-inning,' " Muckey said. "I said, 'If you're going to call it, call it  now.' "  </P> <P> With dusk settling in, Muckey took it upon himself to offset any edge that  Crespi may have had. The umpire handed Crespi catcher Kevin Walsh a bone-white  baseball in the ninth inning, but before the ball reached pitcher Pat Bennett,  Muckey gave it a shampoo with dirt from the first-base line.  </P> <P> "They were throwing in nice, new, white balls," Muckey said. "I'm not going to  let them do that."  </P> <P> While the sun shone, so did Saugus senior right-hander Roger Salkeld who, two  days past his 18th birthday, truly is the man on the mound.  </P> <P> Salkeld (1-0) struck out a school-record 19 and walked two while pitching a  three-hitter for his second complete game. Salkeld struck out the side three  times -- needing only 10 pitches in the first inning. He had eight strikeouts  after only 37 pitches.  </P> <P> "I'm pleased," Muckey said. "Anytime you get a chance to stay in there with  Roger Salkeld . . ."  </P> <P> Salkeld was a strike away from posting a shutout with 14 strikeouts. But third  baseman Trevor Rice's unsuccessful attempt at a diving catch of Don Calabria's  low pop fly on the infield grass in the seventh allowed Chris Romero to score  from second.  </P> <P> "That was my fault," Salkeld said. "I should have had that one."  </P> <P> Crespi starter Chad Nichols went 5 1/3 innings before he was replaced by  Bennett with the bases loaded in the sixth and the game scoreless.  </P> <P> Bennett threw a wild pitch, allowing pinch-runner Andy Nolan to score from  third, before pitching out of the jam.  </P></p>

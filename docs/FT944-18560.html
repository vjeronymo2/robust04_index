			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Aeromexico board launches probe The board of Aeromexico, Mexico's largest airline carrier, is investigating alleged financial irregularities by the former management of the company that may prevent it from covering some of its financial obligations, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. Shareholders were informed that Dollars 50m of company funds could not be accessed, because of possible 'irregular conduct' involving the alleged use of the money as collateral to buy shares or receive a loan. A senior government official confirmed that the authorities were looking into alleged illegal use of the company's funds by previous management. The announcement follows last month's resignation of Mr Gerardo Prevoisin, the former chief executive. Mr Prevoisin had been unable to reach agreement with banks over rescheduling of debt of Mexicana, the airline that Aeromexico took over last year.</p>

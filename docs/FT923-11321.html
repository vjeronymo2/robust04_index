			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: TSB petitions for George Walker bankruptcy TSB Bank lawyers confirmed yesterday that they had applied to have Mr George Walker, the deposed chief executive of Brent Walker, declared bankrupt. The petition, based on a debt of just over Pounds 9m, will be heard in the High Court on August 5. The solicitors said they expected him to be adjudicated bankrupt on that day and a trustee in bankruptcy appointed by his creditors to take control of his affairs. The trustee will take over Mr Walker's compensation claims arising from his dismissal from Brent Walker. He alleges that he was wrongfully dismissed.</p>

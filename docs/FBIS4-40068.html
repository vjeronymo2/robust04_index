			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "North Korea: Imposition of Sanctions </F> Is Matter of Time"]    [Text] The imposition of sanctions on North Korea is  already settled and merely a matter of time. This was stated by  Madeleine Albright, U.S. permanent representative to the United  Nations. "We are making progress in this area at the necessary  rate," she said. "But the main thing in this problem is to take  the measures, and not the speed with which this is done."    According to her the United States will proceed with the  imposition of sanctions on Pyongyang for its refusal to allow  International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors access to its  nuclear facilities, even if China refuses to cooperate in this  sphere. At the same time Albright expressed the hope, based on  the experience of dealings with Chinese diplomats at the United  Nations, that "Beijing realizes that the emergence of a nuclear  North Korea is not in its interests."    "A week after Washington stated that it would seek the  imposition of economic sanctions on North Korea, the  administration of President Bill Clinton is still working  intensively on a plan of such actions," THE NEW YORK TIMES  writes.</p>

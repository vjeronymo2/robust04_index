			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From John Kohut in Chengdu] </F>   [Text] The number one political job in China's most  populous province is a lot less glamorous than it may sound:  the pay is terrible, the work is full of headaches, and even  the pettiest of details sometimes have to be handled by the man  at the top. "Actually, China is the most democratic country in  the world," jokes Sichuan's Governor Xiao Yang, an ebullient,  grand-fatherly figure of 62 who took office last February and  has made a name for himself as one of China's most reform-minded  leaders.    When the expressway between Chongqing and Chengdu opened,  for  example, Mr Xiao had fences put up to prevent pigs and dogs from  trying to skip through the traffic. Two days after the fences  went up, peasants dismantled them. "They thought it was  inconvenient." When stock prices drop or people have a gripe  about a corrupt local official, they write to the Governor, who  personally responds to the most important of the 300 written  petitions he receives from ordinary folk each month.    Such are the everyday problems Mr Xiao faces. Far more  pressing, for his own political as well as his people's future,  is the threat of peasant riots; controlling the birth rate of a  province which, at 110 million people, is the most populous in  China; preventing inflation from going out of control; and above  all, transforming Sichuan from relative poverty to something  approaching the prosperity of the coastal areas.    After more than a decade of the central government pampering  the coastal areas with economic reform prerogatives, it finally  looks as if hinterland provinces such as Sichuan will be getting  a bigger share of the pie. Last year, the central government  invested 30 billion yuan (about HK$27 billion [Hong Kong  dollars]) in Sichuan. This year, the figure will probably reach  40 billion. A big portion of the money will go into  infrastructure.    Foreign investment in Sichuan last year soared to U.S.$2.6  billion (HK$20.2 billion), double the amount of the previous  year. The bulk of this investment has been small-scale,  low-technology ventures, but the province is now trying to  attract big infrastructure projects. Mr Xiao said Sichuan hoped  to sign an agreement with AT&amp;T this year to set up a  telephone  switching joint venture which would produce about one million  telephone lines per year. And the province has started up an  electricity generating equipment plant with General Electric of  Canada.    In urban areas, a big problem this year will be controlling  inflation, which was eight or nine percent last year, well below  the national average, but gaining momentum. The provincial  government wants to contain inflation to about 10 percent this  year, "but I can't be certain we can accomplish this," Mr Xiao  said. When prices soared last year, the government stepped in  and sold grain from its reserves to calm the market. Guangdong  recently set price controls, but Mr Xiao said there were dangers  in tampering with the free market. "If you want to build a  socialist market economy, then it isn't appropriate that prices  not move," he said.    By the Governor's account, inflation hits hard at a lot of  people, in particular the province's 400,000 retired Communist  Party cadres, three to four million retired workers, and  tottering state- run enterprises employing four or five million  people. Including dependents, that runs to 20 or 30 million  people, roughly a quarter of the provincial population. To  buffer them against these price spirals--and thus ensure against  worker demonstrations--Mr Xiao hopes to introduce a policy which  will adjust workers' wages to increases in the cost of living.  He is now waiting for the central government to approve the  proposal.    Mr Xiao says one of his biggest problems is population  control. A campaign is currently in progress to improve  contraception and get people to obey China's  one-child-per-family law. The Governor estimates his province  probably has several million more people than reported in the  national census. "Some areas report that they haven't produced  (children), but in fact they produced a lot," Mr Xiao said.</p>

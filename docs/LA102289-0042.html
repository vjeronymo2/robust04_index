			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELING IN STYLE;  </P> <P> MEANWHILE IN CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> California has historically bred superlatives, so it's no surprise that they  can be applied to the latest in the Far West world of skiing, too.  </P> <P> For openers, Squaw Valley, celebrating its 40th anniversary (and the 30th  anniversary of the Olympic Winter Games held there), now has the largest number  of ski lifts -- 32 -- of any resort in the Western Hemisphere. It also has the  greatest uphill capacity, and can deliver 47,370 skiers an hour onto the high  ground. That should "un-wait" a lot of lift lines.  </P> <P> One of its five new chairlifts (two were replacements) is the Squaw Peak  Express, a detachable quad 7,618-feet long that will rise 2,000 feet and carry  3,040 skiers an hour.  </P> <P> Squaw Valley is not California's lone flag-bearer. As a matter of fact, the  second-largest lift network, at Mammoth Mountain (30 lifts, 43,000 rides an  hour), and the third, Heavenly Valley (24 lifts, 31,000 an hour) maintain  California's superlative hemispherical lead.  </P> <P> Such pace setting tells the world the Golden State is a skiing state despite  all its other attractions. And nowhere else does such a mix of choices await a  snow-going visitor.  </P> <P> From Lake Tahoe's ring of playgrounds and night excitement to Southern  California's ski-and-surf-same-day possibilities; from Royal Gorge (North  America's largest cross-country destination resort) and Yosemite's quiet  grandeur to the close-to-100-m.p.h. night speed-skiing at Snow Valley and the  half-pipe snow boarders at June Mountain and Snow Summit; from the gentle ski  school spawning grounds that induce beginners to stay in the sport to the  extreme steeps that magnetize the most daring, the sporting challenge and the  pursuit of pleasure lead to the sale of some 7-million lift tickets a year.  </P> <P> That figure, according to the California Ski Industry Assn., is second only to  Colorado, which has some 50 fewer lifts.  </P> <P> Squaw Valley, with its $15-million expenditure last summer and a groaning  drawing board of projects, isn't the only ski area with new toys. Southern  California this season gets its first high-speed detachable quad -- the  state-of-the-art in chairlifts -- with a $2.5 million Doppelmayr shuttle at  Mountain High East. Compared with old Chair 7, it will carry four times as many  riders from the bottom to the top in less than half the time.  </P> <P> Northstar-at-Tahoe is getting two of these. Alpine Meadows and Sierra Ski Ranch  each are getting one. Mammoth Mountain, which focused this year on trail  upgrades, has emplaced five quads in its $40-million expansion program  (including the purchase of June Mountain) of the past four years.  </P> <P> Resort retailers love the high-speed quads. Often by mid-afternoon the skiers  are so burned out that they spend their remaining energies shopping.  </P> <P> Growth can come in several forms. For example, while Bear Mountain, at Big Bear  Lake, has made pronounced improvements in its Learn-to-Ski Center and in trail  design, one of its major thrusts is to train the visitor. A free Ski Evaluation  program will have an instructor videotaping skiers, then critiquing the  immediate on-screen "replay" and issuing a card rating the performance. This  can be an introduction to a $17, 45-minute tips class limited to three students  per instructor. Also, Bear Mountain will be the pilot area for a video  presentation to lift lines, covering updates on conditions and a vast array of  educational topics related to skiing.  </P> <P> Snow Summit, confident that it can provide a good experience, continues its  "Skier Satisfaction" guarantee. Anyone unhappy after one run -- for any reason,  from conditions to a hangover -- may exchange the lift ticket for a voucher  good for another visit. Other Snow Summit innovations include considerably  increasing the size of the beginners' area, storing repeat rental customers'  statistics in computers for quick access, and establishing a parents' "hot  line" to the expanded day-care center from two chairlift locations.  </P> <P> Snow Valley is launching a Midweek Club that offers members free lessons, free  rentals, ski shop discounts and other privileges during the week (except on  holidays) all season long for a one-time fee of $5.  </P> <P> No matter how good the facilities and the service, however, the vital  ingredient is snow. Good natural snowfalls mean big crowds in California. In  the last several years, though, the science of snow-making has made the  presence of carpet almost a certainty. For example, in nine of the last 10  years, Snow Summit, Snow Valley and Goldmine (now Bear Mountain) have opened  the weekend before Thanksgiving, whether or not natural snow had been  sufficient to cover the runs.  </P> <P> A leader in this field is Heavenly Valley, which has the world's largest  snow-making system coating great sections of its 12,800 acres. Now, the  capacity has been increased, and Heavenly Valley can offer skiing off all its  lifts on the California side, as well as off five lifts on the Nevada side,  without natural snow.  </P> <P> To sum it up, it isn't difficult to find an adjective to describe California's  skiing resources.  </P> <P> Superlative.  </P></p>

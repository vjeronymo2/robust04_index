Williams is among four independent candidates who have been  allocated electoral symbols for the poll. He has chosen the  hand as his symbol and will be vying for the South Windward  constituency which he has represented in Parliament since 1984.    Williams, a former minister in the office of Prime Minister  James Mitchell, resigned from government two weeks ago telling  journalists he wanted more time to devote to his constituency.    However, a release issued theough the Government Information  Service quoted Williams' resignation letter to Governor-General  Sir David Jack as saying he was no longer going to tolerate  Mitchell's contempt and disrespect towards Vincentians.    Mitchell later said Williams' resignation was prompted by  the  party's decision not to field him as a candidate for the  February 21 general election.    The former minister has been on the campaign trail since he  announced his resignation. Election officials said they have  allocated symbols for three political parties and four  independent candidates, one of whom is a younger brother to  Williams.    Candidates are expected to make an EC500 dollar (one EC  dollar - 37 cents US) deposit and be nominated by six registered  voters in the constituency to have a valid nomination.    A preliminary list shows there are 66,793 persons registered  to vote compared with 61,091 in the last poll of 1989.</p>

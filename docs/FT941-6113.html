Legislation is one reason for growth in this market in Europe. In a survey of 300 environmental technology companies in the UK, by Environmental Policy Consultants, a London-based research group, nearly two-thirds said European legislation was the main reason customers were buying 'green' technology.

He says the size of this market has been exaggerated, because there are no agreed definitions and because the sector has been abused by manufacturers defining products as 'environmental' for marketing reasons.

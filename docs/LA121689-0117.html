			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVATIVES, LIBERALS IN U.S. HAIL RELIGIOUS CHANGES IN SOVIET UNION;  </P> <P> REFORMS: THERE HAS BEEN SURPRISING OPTIMISTIC UNANIMITY ON GORBACHEV'S  POLICIES. BUT EXPERTS POINT OUT THAT HE STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO.  </P> <P> Was Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev sincere when he joined hands with Pope  John Paul II on Dec. 1 and pledged to continue to lead his country down the  path of religious reform?  </P> <P> And are the religious reforms burgeoning under Gorbachev's policies of glasnost  and perestroika more than a passing phenomenon?  </P> <P> On both counts, conservative and liberal monitors of religion in the Soviet  Union are answering "yes," displaying a surprising degree of unanimity on  questions of politics and religion which, under most circumstances, could be  expected to spark strong disagreement.  </P> <P> In both camps, Gorbachev and his reforms appear to be scoring high points, even  though much of the praise is qualified by observations that religious reform in  the Soviet Union is still in its infancy.  </P> <P> In interviews conducted during the days following Gorbachev's historic meeting  with the Pope, those sentiments were voiced by representatives of religious  organizations well known for their staunch opposition to communism, by  officials of the liberal National Council of Churches and by a rabbi who heads  an interfaith organization founded to promote religious freedom around the  world.  </P> <P> Kent Hill, director of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, a  Washington-based organization noted for its relentless critique of communism,  warns that new religious openings in the Soviet Union may overshadow what he  believes is continued persecution of believers in some quarters.  </P> <P> Despite those misgivings -- and recent events that appear to support them --  Hill said in an interview that he believes Gorbachev is sincere in promising to  continue charting a route to religious reform. He said the Soviet leader  appears to be calling for reform not simply to curry favor with the West but  because he really believes it is "not necessary" to cultivate "anti-religious  attitudes."  </P> <P> The author of "The Puzzle of the Soviet Church" (Multnomah Press), Hill said he  believes long-promised changes in the Soviet laws on religion will ultimately  come about.  </P> <P> Those views are shared in large measure by the Rev. Robert Hawley, another  inveterate critic of communism who heads Open Doors-U.S.A., a  nondenominational, California-based group that distributes Christian literature  in restricted countries, including the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "Gorbachev has finally allowed people to express their faith without fear of  repercussions," said Hawley. "For the first time in communist history, they  (communist leaders) have acknowledged and recognized the church as a viable  institution in their society."  </P> <P> The reforms have gone so far already -- and seem to have such support -- that  it is unlikely there could be any significant rollback, Hawley said.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's policies have led to the reopening of hundreds of closed houses of  worship and unprecedented distribution of religious literature under communist  rule.  </P> <P> In one of the most remarkable turnabouts, Soviet officials in the Ukraine  announced during the Rome meeting between the Pope and Gorbachev that they  would begin registering congregations of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, which  in 1946 was forced to merge with the officially recognized Russian Orthodox  Church.  </P> <P> Father Leonid Kishkovsky, the newly elected president of the National Council  of Churches and the first Orthodox Church person to hold that post, said the  Soviet reforms reflect "a readiness of the society . . . to see the positive  contributions of religious life for the moral strength of society, and all of  that is for the good."  </P> <P> Kishkovsky, whose paternal grandfather was an Orthodox priest in what is now  Poland, characterized Gorbachev's sincerity as a recognition that it "makes  sense for him to appeal to all the positive forces in his society."  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is so far down the road to reform, Kishkovsky said, that it  will be "impossible to roll things back to the ideological rigidity" that  characterized the Soviet approach to religion historically.  </P> <P> Like other observers, Kishkovsky said he anxiously awaits the new law on  religion that Gorbachev has promised will codify many of the administrative  reforms already taking place.  </P> <P> Kishkovsky said he saw one of several drafts of the new law during a recent  Moscow trip. He called the draft a "distinct improvement" over current laws  which, among other things, limit the ability of parents to provide religious  education for their children and deter the spreading of religious faith openly.  </P> <P> For Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, an  interfaith religious rights organization, reforms under way in the Soviet Union  represent a dream long shared by him and his colleagues.  </P> <P> "Basically, Gorbachev needs allies for the restructuring of Soviet society," he  said. "Certainly, with the communist ideology falling apart, the religious  community can be a very important harnessing point for a people who are  searching for an anchor of faith, . . . a way to cope with all the changes that  are being introduced."  </P> <P> Speaking of the possibilities of a "renewed identity" for all believers in the  Soviet Union, Schneier said, "I'm grateful to God that I lived to see it."  </P></p>

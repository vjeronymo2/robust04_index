			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "Uniform Standards for Securities Firms </F> Urged"]    [Text] The nation's top securities regulator has urged  listed companies to standardize their operations in accordance  with national regulations and laws.    Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory  Commission, said that as the country's stock market matures the  role of public companies in the development of the securities  industry gains importance.    He said the companies, which are pioneers in China's  shareholding reform and the establishment of a modern corporate  system, must strictly obey regulations because their every  action can arouse great attention from the public.    "Standardized operation of the listed companies is the  foundation for a stable and healthy development of the stock  market," he said.    Liu said that if a stock market pays little attention to  companies' illegal practices, serious speculation will appear  and endanger the stability of the market.    "To a certain degree, the quality of the public companies is  of vital importance to the future of China's stock market and to  the confidence of shareholders," he said.    Meanwhile, Liu pointed out that standardizing the operations  of public companies is also a prerequisite for access to the  international securities markets.    With more international financial institutions shifting  attention to China, there are more opportunities for Chinese  enterprises to enter the international securities markets.    But this also requires companies to improve their  performance  and bring their operations in line with international practices,  he said.    In addition, Liu said standardized operations also represent  a basic way for listed companies to establish a good image among  shareholders, raise their credibility and improve market  competitiveness.    He said that although listed companies have done much  already, many problems persist, such as:    -- Rights and responsibilities among companies'  shareholders,  directors and senior managers are not defined clearly;    -- Some companies blindly expand their shares and capital to  mask poor management;    -- Some companies, unaware of disclosure requirements, don't  release information properly;    -- Some even make major decisions without authorization.</p>

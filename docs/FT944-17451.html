			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / German Elections: Poll onslaught bemuses Leipzig Five years ago tomorrow, some 70,000 people of Leipzig took to their grimy city's streets in open defiance of a massive deployment of riot police, army and militia, to demand reform, democracy and civil rights. 'We are the people]' was their cry, in a confrontation with the authorities which they feared would become another Tiananmen Square. Against all the odds, it ended without bloodshed. It was an heroic anti-climax which opened the door for East Germany's peaceful revolution. This week, they have been finding out just what they were prepared to lay down their lives for: the full force of parliamentary elections, west German-style. And the people of Leipzig are clearly a little baffled by the experience. First came Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the man who seized the opportunity for German unification after those extraordinary events of 1989. He called for their thanks, their loyalty and their votes for his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on a cold, rain-soaked evening in what used to be Karl Marx Square. And then in strode Mr Rudolf Scharping, his arch-rival from the Social Democratic Party (SPD), to preach a different gospel on the old Market Square in front of Leipzig's restored medieval town hall: that the 'unity chancellor' had got it wrong, that he was to blame for their job losses, their bitter unemployment and soaring rents. They should vote, instead, for a change, he said. The crowds are a sharp contrast to the massive rallies which marked the peaceful revolution. Back in 1990, Mr Kohl pulled in an estimated 300,000 on the renamed Augustus square, in front of the city opera. Last week, the figure could not have been much more than 3,000, including a raucous knot of jobless demonstrators, who braved a squally night to hear his speech. The city of Leipzig is already a dramatically different place to the one which saw those Monday demonstrations in October and November, 1989, spilling out from the prayer sessions in the Nikolai church, under the shadow of Karl Marx University. Western stores, sleek shoe shops and bustling supermarkets dominate the cleaned up streets of the city centre, cranes swing on all sides over the skyline, and fast food from Movenpick and McDonalds has replaced the soggy fare from half-empty state restaurants. There is still a slightly scuffed and hang - dog look to the passing pedestrians, still sporting cheap, colourless clothes left over from the old regime. But no one is too scared to shout their protests at the disappointments of unification, or even sling a solitary egg at a poster of the chancellor. They carried crosses for each local factory which has been forced to close in the harsh privatisation process which followed economic and monetary union between the two halves of Germany, and countered the loyalists' chant of 'Helmut] Helmut]' with a barrage of whistles and cries of 'Kohl must go]'. The chancellor was unmoved. He looms over the microphone under a massive party slogan - 'Vote CDU to make sure it goes on getting better' - and bellows his message through loudspeakers - 'I am the man who brought you unification. Vote me.' Most of his speech is pure history: recounting those heady days when he thrashed out the deal with President Mikhail Gorbachev, which set the seal on German unity. This is Kohl the statesman, the man of history, the man they owe. He rounds on the demonstrators with a fury which suggests that he cannot understand their ingratitude: they are the communists who, with the Nazis, brought down the democracy of the Weimar republic, he declares. They are the ones who would do it again. And he castigates the Social Democrats for any hint that they might be prepared to use communist support to defeat his coalition government in Bonn. Mr Scharping is another animal. He is full of facts and figures, of jobs lost and policies mishandled. His rival promised that unification would be all but painless, and he lied, he says. He reels off all the tax rises, the soaring rents and prices, the unemployment and the squeeze on social spending. He promises more social justice, and more cash payments for children, as well as a fairer distribution of the tax burden. It is all a bit lost on his audience, until he comes to questions of housing, rents and property. That is what they understand: the uncertainty of living in homes which might suddenly be sold, and the shock of paying western rents on eastern wages. Mr Scharping says he will freeze the rents, and ensure that former property owners get compensation, not restitution. 'I like what he is saying,' says a severe-looking middle-aged lady in a yellow overcoat. 'But I'm not sure he can deliver it.' A grim-faced worker is quite sure where his vote does not lie: 'That Kohl is shameless,' he insists. 'I'm 59 and unemployed. He cost me my job.' But the electors of Leipzig are learning fast. 'That's all electioneering,' says a leather-jacketed motor mechanic, highly suspicious at being questioned for his views. 'You've got to take it with a pinch of salt. I'm just happy that I've got a job.'</p>

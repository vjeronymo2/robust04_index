			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Foreign groups fight for Polish TV channel Several western media companies, including Bertelsmann of Germany, Companie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion (CLT) and Time Warner of the US, will compete for control of Poland's first commercial TV channel. Applications for the licence, which is to run for 10 years, are to be heard in a series of public hearings by the Radio and TV Council, a regulatory body, starting on Friday. A decision on the licence is expected soon after. The channel will require an initial investment of up to Dollars 100m and will operate alongside the two Polish state channels which carry advertising. The new station will be competing for advertising revenues estimated at about Dollars 100m a year. Initially, the station aims to reach about half of Poland's population of 40m. Foreign ownership of the broadcast media is limited to 33 per cent, and the foreign companies involved had to find local partners. Bertelsmann, which has said it will invest Dollars 200m, is linked with the state-owned Polish Development Bank and the Warta insurance company. CLT, working with Reuters Television, has ITI, a local video and screen distributor. Time Warner, CNN and Capital Cities ABC are linked to a number of journalists from the soon-to-be-closed Radio Free Europe. The journalists are led by Mr Marian Terlecki, a former head of state television. The other main contender is NTP Plus, a group of journalists with roots in the Solidarity movement. They are backed by CEDC Media Enterprises, which has a broadcast licence in Prague and is controlled by Mr Mark Palmer, a former US ambassador. Canal Plus, the French pay-TV channel, is backing another Polish group. Kinnevik Media International of Sweden is competing, as is Polonia 1, a chain of stations controlled by Mr Nicola Grauso, a Sardinian media owner.</p>

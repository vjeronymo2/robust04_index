			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / SBC sacks 6 for unauthorised trades Swiss Bank Corporation has sacked three foreign exchange dealers and three of their supervisors from its Zurich trading centre for unauthorised trades that turned sour and could cost the bank up to SFr100m (Pounds 47m). The punishment is unusually harsh and rapid for a big Swiss bank, but Mr Georges Blum, appointed SBC chief executive a year ago, has made clear that he aims to tighten management controls throughout the bank. Swiss banks have had a reputation for handling staff lapses gently. SBC acquired a reputation for slack management in the early 1990s when it got caught out with large bad loans to several prominent collapsed groups, including Maxwell, Olympia &amp; York, Omni and Polly Peck. Mr Blum said sacking was the best way to handle infractions of dealing limits set by the bank's directors. 'We have a big trading machine, and the culture in that field is different from that in investment banking or private banking,' he said. It was not just the traders but also their supervisors who had to bear the responsibility for limits being broken, he said. The irregularities occurred in common spot and forward foreign exchange contracts, not in the exotic future and option products which have been attracting the concern of central banks and other regulatory authorities. SBC is one of the largest and most successful international banks in the derivatives field. The foreign exchange transactions in this instance were made with a troubled Turkish bank a few months ago. When it came time to settle the contracts, SBC fulfilled its payment obligations. Because of the time difference between the two centres where the deals were made, it was unaware that the Turkish bank would not complete its side of the deals. An SBC spokesman confirmed that the failed deals could cost the bank up to SFr100m, but Mr Blum said it was too early to talk about specific figures. The bank has been in discussions with the Central Bank of Turkey for two months aimed at achieving a satisfactory settlement, he said. Even in the worst case, the loss would not be particularly damaging to SBC. It achieved profits before taxes and provisions last year of SFr4.5bn, and indicated in April that it expected the business trend for the remainder of this year to be satisfactory.</p>

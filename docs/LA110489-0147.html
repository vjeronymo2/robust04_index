			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> ARGUMENT ESCALATES INTO FATAL SHOOTING  </P> <P> An argument between a barmaid and a patron escalated into the fatal shooting of  one man and wounding of another early Friday at a Santa Ana tavern, police  said.  </P> <P> After the two argued, fistfights broke out among the customers at the My Place  bar on South Standard Avenue. When the bartender ordered the rowdy patrons to  leave, one of the customers apparently opened fire on the others outside, said  police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas.  </P> <P> The wounded man, Toribio Silva Santillan, 33, of Santa Ana, managed to stumble  back into the bar to call police despite a chest wound.  </P> <P> Santillan then went outside again, where police found both him and another man  who had been shot in the abdomen.  </P> <P> Santillan was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he underwent  surgery. The other man, whose identity was unknown to police, was pronounced  dead at United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> SRI LANKA RADICALS KILL 18  </P> <P> Sinhalese radicals shot and killed 18 people, including a high-ranking Buddhist  priest, in a series of attacks in southern Sri Lanka, officials said. Gunmen  from the People's Liberation Front stormed a Buddhist temple in Colombo, the  capital, and killed the Rev. Kotikawatte Saddhatissa Thera, who had endorsed an  offer by President Ranasinghe Premadasa to negotiate with the Sinhalese radical  group. The other killings included nine people slain by Sinhalese gunmen at the  home of United National Party legislator P. D. Abeyaratna, who was not at home.  The nation's Sinhalese majority feel Premadasa has made too many concessions to  Tamil rebels seeking autonomy. The bloodshed came as India and Sri Lanka held  talks for a sixth day on a timetable for withdrawing Indian peacekeeping  troops.  </P></p>

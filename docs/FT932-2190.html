			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Travel: Watch out for brigands, goats and hunters - Calabrians don't ask where the train stops; they ask where it 'dies' IN THE innocent days of Italian TV it was always good for a laugh. 'He met a terrible death in Calabria, brigands tied him to the railway track.' 'He was run over?' 'No, he died of starvation waiting for the train to arrive.' Descending on Cosenza at a crawl, the passengers grow anxious. 'Can't you go any faster? There's a girl here going into labour.' The driver says pregnant women should have more sense than to board this train. 'When I boarded it,' the girl whimpers, 'I wasn't pregnant.' It is recorded that the FCL (Ferrovia Calabro-Lucane) company directors' first act on being incorporated was to invest in enough uniforms, epaulettes and swords to last 200 years. That was 80 years ago, shortly after a solid-tyred Ansaldo motor-wagonette had first woken the Calabrian highlands from their long sleep with the splutter of its petrol engine. The FCL soon drove it off the road. The railway, furnished with rack-and-pinion arrangements for the steep sections, poked and probed at the massifs from both sides of the peninsula. The company performed miracles of civil engineering in this land where mountains rise to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft)within a mile or two of the coast and torrent valleys fall in gradients of one-in-10. The Calabro-Lucane system never became a network. It remains to this day a group of disconnected routes (excluded from State Railways' timetables) on which short trains of diesel-electric railcars twist and turn through gorges, cross high slim viaducts and burrow under geological monstrosities to achieve high altitudes . . .tand expire. Calabrians don't ask where the train stops; they ask where it 'dies.' Wayside stations bear the names of far-distant villages. Travel writer Norman Douglas in Old Calabria found a hamlet 33km (20 miles) from its station. We located one more distant than that. We left the train at the halt called Roccabernarda. The mountains were piled around us and so was our luggage. Where was the transport into town? The station simpleton indicated his wooden clogs. How far, then, on foot? He showed us the signpost. It pointed up the sort of track which makes mountain goats' hairs stand on end and it said: 'Roccabernarda 43km.' In Cosenza, a provincial capital, the houses of the Old Town scramble up the hill like frightened sheep. At their feet the red-and-brown coaches of the train to Catanzaro emerge from the station, cross the dry bed of the Busento (beneath which the grave of Alaric the Goth still awaits discovery), and start stitching their way across the face of the mountain en route for the Sila forests. Long ago this was the train which 'never left Cosenza and never arrived at Catanzaro' - but now it does the journey every day. It is running the FCL's flagship route of more than 100km, in the course of which it will penetrate 90 tunnels and soar over 76 viaducts. Scale the whole thing down to the dimensions of a model railway and you would admire its creator's imaginative fancy, never dreaming it could be a real-life system. The railcars have speeded up the timetable but the trip still takes about six hours. Eventually, during ther journey, I went to sit beside the driver. His sign said 'Do not Talk to the Driver,' but he talked all the time, mostly about dreadful accidents when brakes failed and packed railcars jumped the rails and fell into ravines. From his vivid accounts you might have supposed these events occurred last Friday. I established that they had happened once, in the year he was born. A frail old lady carrying a crown of rosemary to the Easter procession at Tiriolo weighed in with tales of Calabrian brigands, the last of whom surrendered on Aspromonte in 1928. Her dialect was impenetrable and I picked up perhaps one word in five, but I gathered that the brigands were a bunch of Merry Men, well-disposed to the peasantry and given to paying with gold coins for small favours. She was moving on to horror stories of wolves when we arrived at Bianchi, the principal intermediate station. Bianchi, a prosperous little settlement on the watershed, is named for the local boy who, on Mussolini's behalf, led the March on Rome. Here is the coincidenza, where the single track briefly becomes double and northbound and southbound trains cross. From Bianchi it is all downhill. You career through gorges, your driver steering with his finger-tips. You need sharp eyes for the scenery: gorgeous ribbons of fruit blossom, bougainvillea bursting out over stone sheds and roofs of broken marsiglia pantiles. Crossing the Corace you glimpse a baroque church, islanded in the middle of that destructive torrent - an earthquake changed the course of the river but spared the house of God. You brake hard for lonely outposts where huntsmen come on board, festooned in bandoliers, dragging spaniels which look none too happy about the events of the day, the first of quail shooting. At Sorbo-Fossato a dainty parish priest in white lace with a silver rod sprinkles holy water on the train from a basin held by his crippled acolyte. Somewhere else boxes of gladioli are loaded. 'The earliest in Europe,' says the driver. 'Calabria first, San Remo second.' At Catanzaro the train empties. I watch driver and conductor engaging the cogs and I jump aboard again for the slow drop through a 300m cliff to the valley floor. You have to hang on to something, otherwise you find yourself hurdling over the seats in front. After the tunnel there is one more stop to allow the conductor to rob an orchard. He returns with pockets stuffed full of lemons the size of young grapefruit. 'Calabria is the garden of Furope,' he tells me. 'The finest soil, the cleanest air, the purest water. With such riches around us,why do we remain poor?' Now it is dark. The terminus, a large hut in a field on the sea's edge, is lampless and lifeless. Tired of waiting for the train, the one-man station staff has gone home. It needs all available hands to uncouple the leading car and spin it on the turntable. We re-couple, making the last coach the first coach, transforming today's point of arrival into tomorrow's point of departure. Throughout their history the Ferrovia Calabro-Lucane lines have been under threat of closure or amalgamation with the State system. Those which survive in Calabria are: Cosenza-Catanzaro Lido, 113km; Cosenza-San Giovanni in Fiore, 69km; Soverato-Chiaravalle Centrale, 23km; Gioia Tauro-Cinquefrondi, 32km; Gioia Tauro-Sinopoli, 27km.</p>

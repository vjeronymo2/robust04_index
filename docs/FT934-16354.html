			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Brussels probes state aid to Bull computer group THE European Commission yesterday announced that it had opened a state aid inquiry into a FFr2.5bn (Pounds 290m) capital injection granted to the French state-owned Bull computers group. The inquiry will focus on the cash which was advanced to Bull by the previous French government in February. But it could be extended to take into account subsidies included in a restructuring package presently being finalised by Bull. The French Industry Ministry said that the plan, aimed at stemming losses of FFr15bn at Bull over the past three years, should be completed within the next week. Bull has demanded a capital injection of FFr9.2bn as part of the plan. A spokesman for Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC's competition commissioner, said yesterday that the Commission's latest inquiry would consider any new restructuring proposal once it was submitted. 'We are looking only at the FFr2.5bn at the moment, because that's the only advance which has been made by the French government,' said the spokesman. Under the EC's state aid rules, the Commission can clear subsidies which are aimed at restoring the viability of a company, provided they do not distort competition within the EC. It is the second time in the past two years that Brussels has investigated state subsidies to the troubled French computer group. In July last year, the Commission approved FFr6.6bn of government aid to Bull aimed at funding research and returning the group to profitability. French officials say they are optimistic that the EC will regard favourably its proposals to restructure the computer group. They describe the proposals as a necessary and final step in the group's reorganisation. The restructuring package, which has been under negotiation since the new centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur took office in March, is expected to include 6,500 job cuts, a reorganisation of the company's management and the formation of strategic alliances with other groups. It may also involve an increased participation in Bull's share capital by NEC, the Japanese computer group, and IBM of the US. The two companies presently hold stakes of 4.4 per cent and 5.7 per cent respectively.</p>

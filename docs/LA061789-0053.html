			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT AMUSED BY CLAY  </P> <P> Earlier this year I saw Andrew Dice Clay at a comedy club in New York. I'm no  prude, yet I was unprepared for Clay's routine, 40 of the longest and most  upsetting minutes I've experienced.  </P> <P> His act sickened me not simply because of the grossness of obscenities, the  misogyny or the homophobia (unfortunately, Clay isn't the only regular female-  and gay-bashing performer). No, Clay was frightening to see because of the  hatred that lay behind every vulgarity. His claim, "Hey, I make funna  everybody," somehow made it acceptable for him to vilify blacks, Latinos,  Asians, homosexuals, women -- and I'm sure I've overlooked a few. Clay did not.  </P> <P> It doesn't surprise me that Lawrence Christon describes the crowd at Clay's  show as "amazingly charged" ("The Feat of Clay: A Tough Guy's Stand-Up  Comedian," June 3). So, I would imagine, were the Nazis when listening to  Hitler.  </P> <P> The fact that Clay is acceptable and popular is sad. The fact that a reviewer  would consider his act only "amiable goofin' on a very low level" is  disturbing. But the fact that Clay plays to a sold-out house at the Universal  Amphitheatre is somehow the most horrifying of all.  </P> <P> BRIDGET CARPENTE  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ukolov: "Government Officials Have Turned </F> to the North, but They Cannot Face It"]    [Text] The FITUR held its fourth conference on the  issues of northerners. According to speakers, if it were not for  the support of the trade unions, neither the issues nor the  northerners would exist.  <H5>  How the Law Was "Frozen" </H5>   Sometimes numbers are more eloquent than lengthy  descriptions, and enough of them were cited at the conference.  What does the North mean to Russia? It produces more than 75  percent of Russia's oil, 92 percent of its gas, 100 percent of  its gold and diamonds, and 70 percent of its timber and wood  products--in all, one-fifth of its treasury revenue. Each  northerner provides the state with three times as much income as  the "average" Russian.    Here is another statistic: Residents of the North represent  9  percent of the laboring public but are responsible for 60  percent of the country's foreign currency receipts.    In spite of this, they are in need! They have been  humiliated  and offended. Conference speakers remarked that Sakhalin was  once a tsarist labor camp and has returned to that state.  Speakers from Vorkuta made references to the Stalinist camps....    Excuse me, I wanted to ask the speakers, what about the  labor  heroism of the past, the taming of the wild oil fields, and the  development of the gas deposits? All of this was not a delusion;  it was not communist propaganda--it was a fact. There are  witnesses and participants right here in this auditorium.    When FITUR Chairman Mikhail Shmakov called the conference to  order, he did not make disparaging remarks about the past or  malign the innocent intentions of people, as today's ideologists  are so regrettably inclined to do. He used statistics to make  his point.    Whereas just 5-10 years ago the North was the recipient of  10-20 percent of all annual state capital investments, the  transition to self-financing drove enterprises there to the  verge of ruin. Capital investments decreased by 11 percent in  1991, 40 percent in 1992, and more than 20 percent last year. We  are killing the goose that laid the golden eggs. This metaphor,  incidentally, was used by several speakers.    Emissaries from Sakhalin, the Komi Republic, Tyumen and  Magadan oblasts, and Norilsk spoke at the conference. They  brought the grievances of their people to Moscow: Conscientious  workers are not being paid the money they have earned, and the  rise in the cost of living is choking them and driving them away  from the North. The hostages cannot even reach the "mainland,"  however, because they do not have the money to make the trip,  and their own state has not bothered to provide them with  shelter.    Under pressure from trade unions, several decrees, laws, and  edicts were passed for the protection of the northerners, but  everyone knows what they were worth. The Law on Guarantees and  Compensation specified allocations of 560 billion rubles last  year, but the government could only part with 158 billion.  <H5>  No Need for Panic </H5>   There have been several reports in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on the  trade unions' stance on the northern regions. It was interesting  to hear the government's side. One of the speakers at the  conference was First Deputy Minister for Nationalities Affairs  and Regional Policy Vladimir Kuramin. He is not a neutral party;  he took part in developing the northern oil and gas resources of  the Tyumen region. He did not dodge the issue or embellish the  facts: He admitted that the recession was more severe in the  North last year than in the Russian Federation as a whole.    If the situation is not corrected soon, V. Kuramin went on  to  say, this region with its unique resource potential will become  a factor contributing to the rapid disintegration of the Russian  economy.    Nevertheless, even for the sake of a good story, we cannot  say that the northerners have been completely abandoned to the  whims of fate. Housing is being built, for example, in 22  oblasts in central Russia for people who have worked in the  North for 10 years or more.    The provision of the North with food, consumer goods, fuel,  and other material and technical resources is a matter of  special concern. Delivery goals were essentially attained last  year and the year before.    The Law on State Guarantees and Compensation has also  provided northerners with some advantages: additional vacation  time, a shorter work week for women, and the recalculation of  labor and social pensions.    Reimbursement for the cost of regional wage differentials  and  bonuses became the stumbling block. The Ministry of Finance  categorically objected to this. The financiers were horrified by  the total amount of these expenditures--51.7 trillion rubles.  They seemed to have forgotten, however, that these expenditures  are covered not only by the republic budget, but also by the  pension fund, the social insurance fund, the state public  employment fund, and local budgets. According to estimates, the  state's additional expenditures will amount to only 1.3 trillion  rubles, and the ministry will try to enter this sum in the  budget as a separate item.    Russia's "Northern policy" would be more effective if the  state were to play a stronger role. The support of the North,  which is now expressed in isolated impulses, should take the  form of a comprehensive system of state oversight of the life,  activity, and development of this promising region. The plans  for this system have already been drafted and submitted to the  government.  <H5>  The Compass Needle </H5>   True to form, Kuramin laid a solid foundation for the  debate:  Government agencies, labor collectives, and trade unions are all  worried about the future of the North. Unfortunately, all of  them frequently confine their concern to a search for culprits,  mutual accusations, and a variety of demands. A concerted search  for constructive solutions is much more important today.    This is what conference participants attempted. The  suggestion of Chairman Dmitriy Lukashenko of the Komi Republic  Federation of Trade Union Organizations to "shut down the  pipelines in the event of trouble" and his appeal for worker  solidarity in this endeavor did not seem to win any support.    Federal Assembly deputies who took part in the discussion of  northern issues redirected the debate into the channel of  equitable legal direction of the life of northerners.  Trade-union leaders insisted on the resolution of urgent  problems, especially those connected with survival.    Furthermore, once a person has decided to return to the  "mainland," his ability to do this should be guaranteed.    Just as the needle in a compass always points to the north,  all of the participants in the trade-union conference agreed  that GREAT RUSSIA HAS NO FUTURE WITHOUT THE NORTH.</p>

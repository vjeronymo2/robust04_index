			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Toyota sees sales recovery TOYOTA Motor, Japan's largest car maker, yesterday said the Japanese automobile market had hit bottom and predicted increased sales in the months ahead as government measures to stimulate the economy took effect. The prediction by one of Japan's largest industrial companies marks an important change in attitude that contrasts with the widespread gloom among Japanese manufacturers, who have been struck hard by the slowdown in the Japanese economy. A recovery in automobile demand could mark a turning point for the economy as a whole, given the industry's size. Automobile sales led the economy down last year, along with housing, which has since shown signs of recovery. The upbeat prediction came as Toyota revised its domestic sales projections for the calendar year downward by 4 per cent to 2.36m units, roughly the same as last year. The entire decline, however, came in the first half of the year, when sales fell by 4 per cent to 1.17m units. Toyota expects sales to rise by 5 per cent year-on-year in the second half of the year, to 1.9m units. Mr Soichiro Toyoda, Toyota president, pointed out that industry-wide sales had increased year-on-year in June for the first time in 14 months. Mr Toyoda's upbeat remarks came as Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor, said that Nissan was considering whether to slash its capital spending plans in the current fiscal year, which began in April, in response to poor sales. Sales of Nissan cars fell by 5.3 per cent to 288,232 units in the April-to-June quarter. Nissan had budgeted Y240bn (Pounds 1bn) for capital spending this year, Y30bn below last year. Meanwhile, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, acknowledged that the clearing of excess inventories, which has depressed manufacturing activity, would take longer than originally expected. But he predicted, based on reports from branch managers of the central bank who met on Monday, that this process would be completed in the fourth quarter of the year.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Sony and Philips braced for battle with video-CD rival Sony and Philips, two of the world's largest consumer electronics groups, yesterday fired the opening salvo in the battle to specify the format for the next generation of compact discs, which will play films as well as music. The electronics industry has for years been developing a more sophisticated version of the audio-CD, which would replace the video cassette and provide some of the data storage capacity of interactive CD-ROM discs. The new discs will be played on special machines, which will also play audio-CDs. Sony and Philips, which liaised successfully to launch the original audio-CD in 1982, are anxious that their proposed format should become the industry standard, thereby enabling them to earn royalties from licensing the technology to other companies. They face strong opposition from Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company which has designed its own disc format in conjunction with the Time Warner entertainment group. The rivalry raises the threat of a repetition of the 'video war' in the 1980s when Sony lost a battle to impose Betamax as the standard format for video cassettes against the VHS format devised by the Matsushita group. An early version of the discs with video capacity, or 'video-CDs', is already available in Japan. They have had limited success as they only run for 72 minutes (the same as audio-CDs) and are therefore unsuitable for feature films, which have a minimum length of 90 minutes. Some companies, including Philips, have addressed this problem by developing multi-disc players, which can play films or operas by running from one disc to another. However, multi-disc is seen as an interim solution, before the industry moves on to more advanced CDs. The format proposed by Sony and Philips is for a 12cm-wide disc (the same size as an audio-CD) with the capacity to store five times more data. It will play 135 minutes of video, enough for most feature films. Sony claims that its new format offers 'superior' visual quality to video cassettes and sound 'at least as good as audio-CD'. It says that production costs will be 'reasonable', as it can use its existing capacity to manufacture the new hardware and discs. However, next month Toshiba plans to launch the prototype of a disc that can store data on both sides and up to 270 minutes of video. It claims it offers superior visual images to the Sony format.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Yemeni News Agency, SABA' has learned from a  responsible source in the general secretariat of the Council of  Ministers that brother Dr. Muhammad Hasan Makki, first deputy  prime minister, in a letter to Prime Minister Engineer Haydar  Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has commented [words indistinct] that the  implementation of the pledge and accord document requires, first  of all, that the constitutional state bodies meet, particularly  the Presidential Council which represents the country's  political will. The accord document in the last paragraph of  its last page stipulates that the implementation of the document  requires a united political will.    Second, on the basis of the coalition government and  parliamentary coordination document under which the present  government was formed, and in accordance with this document the  commands of the coalition parties should hold meetings in case  [words indistinct] on the topics intended to be discussed at the  Council of Ministers to [word indistinct] an agreement in this  [word indistinct]. From this premise, it is important in this  case to expedite holding a coalition command meeting to discuss  the litigious draft agenda proposed by you.    Third, the present circumstances in Aden, permeated with  [words indistinct] and media clamor do not contribute to the  prevalence of a suitable atmosphere for the convocation of a  cabinet session.    Fourth, while [words indistinct] their readiness to exert  all  efforts to implement the document of pledge and accord starting  from the provisions of the document itself, we believe that your  proposals on the draft agenda are in violation of the document  and based only on the paper submitted by the Yemeni Socialist  Party concerning the measures of implementation of the document.  This paper [words indistinct] accepted by the Political Forces  Dialogue Committee.    Fifth, the bylaws of [word indistinct] Council of Ministers  stipulates the need to send the documents on the agenda of the  Council of Ministers to the ministers five days before the date  set for the meeting. This was not respected [words indistinct]  current Council of Ministers. In addition, the Council had  agreed to hold two sessions in Ramadan on the basis of the rule  that is annually followed. These were actually held. [Words  indistinct] an extraordinary meeting only and such a meeting is  held only to discuss [words indistinct].    Sixth, in view of the fact that no party within the  coalition  can unilaterally propose the Council's agenda [word indistinct]  the document of pledge and accord, we propose the following:    1. Holding an extraordinary Council of Ministers session in  the capital Sanaa not later than 5 March to discuss one topic  only in accordance with the Council of Ministers bylaws. This  topic is to issue decisions on matters stipulated in the  document and which are urgent and cannot be postponed; namely,  the plan to arrest the accused who are at large and issuing the  decision on withdrawing the Armed Forces from the area that used  to be called the border areas, in addition to the decision that  enables the Political Forces Dialogue Committee to carry out its  follow-up tasks as enunciated in the document.    2. As for the other provisions of the pledge and accord  document, we once again emphasize that the adoption of  timetables for their implementation and the formation of  committees for this is is a joint responsibility to be assumed  by the coalition members and which no party can carry out alone.    Out of our concern over [words indistinct] expeditious  agreement [word indistinct] the Council of Ministers following  the blessed 'Id al-Fitr holidays, we propose that the prime  minister and his deputies hold meetings during the period that  remains from the blessed month to agree on these plans and  implementation measures in accordance with what is stipulated in  the document.</p>

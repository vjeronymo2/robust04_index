			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Weakness in the Tokyo stock market is expected to underpin the bond market this week. Profit-taking by overseas fund managers before the year-end settlements is depressing share prices while stock buying has so far been limited to public funds. With an increasing number of analysts expecting the Nikkei 225 index to breach the psychologically important support level of 19,000, long-term interest rates are expected to see underlying support. The bond market may see a brief rally as a result of increased trading from the new securities house subsidiaries of the commercial banks which start operating on Thursday. Meanwhile, there has been an increase in straight bond issues with longer maturities and an easier yield curve at the longer end is prompting companies to turn to debt with maturities of over five years. Until recently they preferred to issue bonds with maturities of less than five years because long-term yields were expected to decline and to attract retail investors. Although companies may revert to short-term debt to attract retail investors ahead of the winter bonus season, a rise in demand for long-term bonds with higher coupons among institutional investors is likely to support the case for a continued increase in long-term debt.</p>

The brother president was apprised of the progress of the  committee's work, and of the outcome of its field activities.  He was also briefed on the positive and gladdening results it  has achieved in terms of ending military escalation and making  preparations for the implementation of the military provisions  enshrined in the accord document.    During the meeting, agreement was reached on a timetable for  the withdrawal of Armed Forces units from contact lines to the  pre- crisis positions they occupied before 19 August 1993,  beginning with the western area in Bab el Mandeb, the central  axis, and up to the eastern axis of Shabwah, Ma'rib, Hadramaut,  and al-Mahrah, in implementation of the provisions enshrined in  the accord document, and within the context of the authorization  document the Joint Military Committee has received. The  authorization document was signed by the brother Presidential  Council chairman, who is the supreme commander of the Armed  Forces, and the brother vice president. This agreement is meant  to spare our Yemeni people any bloody armed conflicts that could  put the homeland and its unity in jeopardy. It is also designed  to thwart the efforts of warmongers, advocates of secession, the  enemies of unity and democracy, and all enemies of the Yemeni  homeland. Similarly, it is meant to defeat all attempts to  undermine the homeland's security and stability and push our  country into the furnace of a destructive war. This agreement  also seeks to frustrate the endeavors of those who, while  engaged in oneupmanship, seek to capitalize on national issues  at the expense of the people, promote selfish and parochial  interests, build personal glories at the expense of the  homeland's higher interests, and return our people to the period  that preceded 22 May 1990.    The brother president and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces asserted his constant support for the Military  Committee's work. He indicated that he instructed the commands  of both the Ministry of Defense and the Army General Staff to  provide all possible facilities and extend every possible  assistance to the committee to enable it to accomplish its  mission, halt and eliminate all effects of the military  escalation, and supervise the withdrawal of all units to their  pre-crisis positions. He underlined the need for all to commit  themselves to national constants, and also to the provisions  enshrined in the accord document. He also underscored the  importance of the speedy implementation of the provisions  enshrined in the accord document without any delay or  procrastination.    Salih emphasized that our Yemeni people will not condone any  circumvention of the document or any encroachment on their  national gains, especially unity and democracy. He called on  all the political and righteous forces in Yemen and all our  people to cooperate effectively with the armed and security  forces to help them carry out their sacred national duties in  defending the country's sovereignty and independence and in  pooling efforts to build the 22 May Homeland [reference to the  1990 Yemen unity date] on firm and strong basis and in a spirit  of national responsibility.    The brother president said that the armed and security  forces  belong to the people. They are the walls of the homeland and  its impregnable fortress. They will never be a tool to destroy  the country and its gains or a means of oppression, terror, and  domination for the sake of a group whose only care is to ensure  its remaining in power; a group which rejects submission to  people's desire and opposes democracy and the principle of  peaceful exchange of power.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Flexibility wins friends: Pressure is growing for a compromise on Hong Kong Hong Kong is daring to hope. Conciliatory comments by both Chinese officials and Governor Chris Patten have raised expectations that a compromise over the colony's political development might be achievable. The stock market - the most visible indicator of the colony's mood - in the first weeks of the year has recouped much of the losses it sustained in December, when China suggested it might not honour business contracts in the colony that span the transfer of sovereignty in 1997. Mr Allen Lee, leader of Hong Kong's main conservative political grouping, who this morning will meet Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, says that the atmosphere in the colony has improved markedly since the beginning of the year. In today's talks, he will press Mr Major to amend Britain's proposals for increased democracy in the colony to make them more acceptable to China. A more flexible stance by Mr Patten is one of the reasons for the colony's increased optimism. While maintaining his 'principles' - that arrangements for the colony's 1994-95 elections have to be fair, open and acceptable to Hong Kong - he has indicated a greater willingness to consider alternatives to his plans. Last week he even reminded the members of the Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's lawmaking body, that political reforms in the colony must be acceptable to China. Beijing, for its part, has restrained its personal attacks on Mr Patten. It has also adopted a softer tone on political matters. Mr Lu Ping, Beijing's most senior official involved in Hong Kong affairs, has played down reports that China would set up a shadow government in Hong Kong if Mr Patten persisted with his proposals. But there are also fears that what looks like accommodation on both sides is simply a change in tactics, designed to make their respective positions more appealing to an increasingly divided population in Hong Kong. 'What I am afraid of is the continuation of a stalemate - a situation where Mr Patten introduces his package, pushes it through LegCo, and China decides to go its own way,' says Mr Lee. 'We cannot afford to live with four years of China not co-operating with the UK.' This view, widely held in the colony, is most strongly felt in the business community. Mr William Fung, managing director of Li &amp; Fung, a trading company, says: 'When the Basic Law (the mini-constitution, published in 1990 by Beijing, for Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese sovereignty) came out, people thought it was a broadly acceptable basis for Hong Kong's future. Why, then, has the governor decided to upset the apple cart?' Mr Chan Wing Kee, managing director of the Yangtzekiang Garment Manufacturing Company and chairman of the Hong Kong Exporters Association, suggests the direction of Mr Patten's reforms is misplaced. 'The 1995 elections are not the most important thing facing us,' he says. 'What is important is the first chief executive (CEO) of the Special Administrative Region and how he will work for Hong Kong and China. We still live in a place where who is in charge is more important than the system. If you push China into a corner, the CEO may not be the best one for Hong Kong.' But the 'system' is where the fate of Mr Patten's proposals will be decided. LegCo will receive the governor's legislation towards the end of next month, and it will then initiate the process of legislative review by which it is ratified. The process promises to be protracted. 'The legislation will be scrutinised clause by clause and many amendments will be made; it will be messy and time consuming,' says Mr Simon Ip, the legal profession's representative in LegCo. Mr Ip is one of the increasingly influential group of independent LegCo members who do not belong either to the main conservative group, headed by Mr Allen Lee, or to the democrats, headed by Mr Martin Lee, who support Mr Patten's proposals. The independents hope that LegCo can produce legislation that manages both to preserve Mr Patten's democratic intent - a broadening of the franchise - and to go some way towards answering China's concerns. But achieving both will be difficult. China has always regarded Hong Kong's political development as an issue to be settled between itself and Britain. Beijing has been dismissive of LegCo, referring to it as only a consultative body. Moreover, in the current row China has said that its objections to Mr Patten's proposals are less to do with democracy than with honouring past Sino-British agreements. It charges Mr Patten with repudiating a 1990 understanding between the UK and China concerning the 1995 LegCo polls. Mr Patten's proposals, it says, violate the 'spirit' of past agreements in two ways. According to one proposal, the 'election committee', which will appoint 10 of the 60 LegCo members in 1995, would consist of 250 popularly elected local officials. In 1990 Britain gave provisional endorsement to a body that would have a narrower franchise. His plans for nine new 'functional' constituencies have also angered China. The 21 functional representatives in the current LegCo are drawn from and elected by specific professional and business groups, such as doctors and lawyers. Mr Patten's nine additional seats would be filled from a broader constituency, encompassing all workers. Many LegCo members hope that, if they can amend Mr Patten's political reforms along the lines of the 1990 'agreements', China may acquiesce. In particular, support is gathering among independents to preserve the existing system of functional constituencies and to devise an election committee that is more consistent with the Basic Law. 'We are all looking for a way out,' says Mr Vincent Cheng, Hongkong Bank's chief economist and an appointed legislator. There is also growing support for an amendment, first suggested by Mr Jimmy McGregor, an independent democrat, to limit electors to voting for one member of LegCo. 'If we can implement one man, one vote, then how the new functional constituencies are drawn up is a secondary issue,' says Mr Cheng. He points out that, under the current system and the one proposed by Mr Patten, a single elector, who has a recognised profession and is a company owner, could have three votes: one for his professional affiliation, one through his membership of the chamber of commerce, and one for a geographical constituency. Such an amendment, which would end Mr Patten's plans for nine democratically elected functional seats, could please Beijing. But whether the amendments that emerge from LegCo's negotiations can provide the basis for a compromise between Mr Patten and China will be clear only after the talking stops. For now, and not before time, local politicians will be given a greater say in the process of transition to Chinese rule and the political system which will follow. Beijing may find it harder to reject their judgments than those of the final British governor.</p>

Hata told a news conference  "such criteria run counter to Japanese Government efforts to  promote deregulation."    Trade negotiators from Japan and the United States who met  in  Washington last week made little progress on the critical issue  of how to measure the progress of foreign access to Japanese  markets.    Speaking at a news conference after the day's cabinet  session, the foreign minister suggested that U.S. and Japanese  automakers hold negotiations to break the impasse in bilateral  auto trade talks over the share of U.S. cars in the Japanese  market. Hata said talks among those directly involved would be  more effective than government-level meetings in solving  problems and suggested that the private sectors of both sides  hold discussions.    Noting that Japanese automakers in the United States have  tie-ups with local repair shops, Hata said that through such  private-level talks, the U.S. firms wanting to sell cars in  Japan might be able to seek alliances with Japanese makers. He  cited as an example foreign beer companies selling their  products through Japanese brewers.    The Japanese auto market, which Washington maintains is  biased against imports, is the main focus of current U.S.  efforts to cut down its trade deficit with Japan by increasing  the sales of U.S. goods and services in key Japanese market  sectors.    Japanese and U.S. negotiators on auto trade are deeply  divided on how to quantify "tangible progress" in foreign access  to the Japanese market, which the U.S. views as the core of the  framework trade talks.</p>

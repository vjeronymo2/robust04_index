			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING Q &amp; A: REASONS FOR FLAT-TASTING MELONS  </P> <P> QUESTION: Last year, our muskmelons had a flat taste. We grew them near  cucumbers, and we wonder if the cucumbers crossed over and gave the melons a  bad flavor.  </P> <P> ANSWER: Cucumbers cannot cross with muskmelons, watermelons, or squash. There  is no way for the bitterness of cucumbers to get into the melons. Flat,  tasteless melons can be due to a lack of magnesium or boron in the soil. It has  been found that such fruits can be sweetened by giving them a dose of Epsom  salts and borax. For home garden use, use about 6 1/2 tablespoons of Epsom  salts and 3 1/2 tablespoons of household borax, all added to five gallons of  water. Spray the plants when the vines start to run and again when the fruits  are between one and two inches in diameter. Weather can also affect flavor.  Rainy, cold days cause flat, tasteless melons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bark Mulch Can Help Enhance Tree Growth  </P> <P> Q: As we drive by homes we often see trees ringed with a bark mulch of some  sort. Is this a good thing to do?  </P> <P> A: Yes, it's good business for various reasons: 1 -- Grass around a tree is  highly competitive with tree roots. Killing the grass removes this competition.  2 -- The bark mulch makes an environment more favorable to root growth. 3 -- It  also prevents "bang bang" disease -- lawn mowers banging against the bark. 4 --  The mulch is attractive. 5 -- It helps retain soil moisture, keeps weeds out  and creates a friendly environment for soil organisms. Make the mulch mound at  least 2 or 3 feet in diameter and not over 6 inches thick. The practice of  building up a mound 12-inches high is not prudent because these materials, in  the decay process, liberate toxic materials which can injure the bark. Leave a  depression around the trunk so the bark will not come in contact with the  mulch.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Double-Flowering Geranium Worth a Try  </P> <P> Q: I read about a new geranium variety called Floribunda, described as double  and having stocky stems. Have they been around long, and are they worth  growing?"  </P> <P> A: Your garden center probably has the new Floribunda geraniums. These are  double-flowering and are available for the first time this year. We are growing  them in hanging baskets, window boxes and patio planters, all for the first  time. They make a stocky plant, are heat tolerant and aren't as messy as some  geraniums. By all means try some. They take the same care as regular geraniums,  and in a hanging basket, you can use about three small plants per 10-inch  container.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hitting Tree With Bat Won't Produce Nuts  </P> <P> Q: We have a walnut tree, which produces hardly any nuts. Someone said that if  you pound on the trunk with a ball bat, it will cause the trees to bear nuts.  True?  </P> <P> A: False. This is an old wives' tale. Nut trees fail to bear nuts because of  bad weather, lack of pollination, age of trees, etc. All the beating in the  world won't force a tree to bear nuts. By the same token, driving nails into  the trunk of a tree will not make it fruit or bear nuts.  </P> <P> The Abrahams cannot answer questions individually. Those of general interest  will be addressed in this column. Write to Doc and Katy Abraham, Los Angeles  Times, P.O. Box 579, Naples, N.Y. 14512.  </P> <P> </P></p>

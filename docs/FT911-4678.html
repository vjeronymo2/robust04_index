			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Italian bank rule easing prompts 2,562 new outlets THE Bank of Italy's liberalised rules on bank branching, introduced at the end of March 1990, have resulted in the green light for 2,562 new bank outlets in the first year alone. According to the central bank, which previously kept new branch openings in Italy under very tight control, 1,225 of the new outlets are already operative. Despite the relaxation of the previous system, under which the Bank of Italy would adjudicate on requests for new branches at roughly four-year intervals, around a quarter of the applications it received in the past year have been rejected. Of the 3,789 cases of banks informing the Bank of Italy that they wanted to open new units, the central bank blocked 912. A further 315 requests were still under consideration as at end-March, it said. As expected, the bulk of the failed applications came from small banks with expansion plans which the Bank of Italy has judged to be too grandiose in relation to their size and resources. Jafco, the Nomura Securities subsidiary which is Japan's leading venture capital investor, is taking a 1 per cent stake in Sofipa, the Italian venture capital group. The investment, Jafco's first initiative in Italy, will come via a capital increase at Rome-based Sofipa, which is raising its fully-paid up share capital to L120bn. Sofipa, set up in 1982, has investments with a book value of L79bn. Two of the companies in which it has invested have gone public in recent years.</p>

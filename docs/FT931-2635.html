			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Vestel falls 25% after poor sales in final quarter VESTEL Elektronik, the consumer electronics subsidiary of Polly Peck International which is listed on the Istanbul exchange, reported pre-tax profits down 25 per cent in 1992 to TL55.9bn (Pounds 4.1m). Turnover increased by 16 per cent to TL1,523bn, underlining a sharp drop in dollar terms, given inflation running at about 70 per cent. Analysts were surprised by the results, having forecast sales closer to TL2,150bn. They said sales in the last quarter were sharply down. PPI's administrators are trying to sell Vestel, with the proceeds going to PPI's creditors. The results, however, underline Vestel's financing problems since PPI was forced into administration in 1990. Interest charges more than doubled to TL462bn as PPI letters of credit facilities have dried up. Vestel achieved about Dollars 70m (Pounds 49m) in exports. The company sold 25 per cent of its white goods arm to Merloni Elettrodomestici, the Italian group best known for its Ariston brand. The sale realised Dollars 8.5m extraordinary income. Merloni is expected to take up its option to become the 51 per cent majority owner. The administrators are also in negotiations with a number of interested parties to buy PPI's 86 per cent stake in Vestel. Vestel's AGM yesterday elected Mr AN Kubali as chairman. His predecessor, Mr Tashin Karan, who was credited with building up the company, retired.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Telecom NZ chief announces resignation DR Peter Troughton, who transformed Telecom New Zealand from a government department into a profitable public company, announced his surprise resignation as managing director last night, half-way through his five-year contract. There had been reports of differences with the company's leading shareholders, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech. The American owners who control 56 per cent of the company, were said to be unhappy with the way he was handling growing competition from Telecom NZ's main rival, Clear Communications. Dr Troughton began work in London as an apprentice engineer. He joined British Telecom and held a series of senior management positions, becoming director of BT Enterprises. In a statement Dr Troughton said he was resigning to explore other challenges and opportunities in New Zealand.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD EXTENDS BUILDING MORATORIUM  </P> <P> The Inglewood City Council on Friday night extended for 10 1/2 months its  moratorium on high-density apartment and condominium development after hearing  pleas from residents to limit the city's growth.  </P> <P> The moratorium, which passed unanimously, bans development in areas zoned for  R-3, R-4 and P-1 multifamily housing, or about 20% of the land in the city.  </P> <P> Last year the city tightened development standards for multifamily units  through stricter height, setback and density requirements. But residents  complained that those measures have failed to prevent developers from buying up  single-family homes and replacing them with apartments and condominiums.  </P> <P> "I heard the people loud and clear," said Councilman Jose Fernandez. "There is  a correlation between high density and crime, traffic and overcrowded schools."  </P></p>

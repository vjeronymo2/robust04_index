			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIP OF THE WEEK: HORSING AROUND IN THE DESERT  </P> <P> Riding in a golf cart isn't the only way to enjoy the outdoors in this desert  resort town.  </P> <P> Visitors can saddle up for leisurely horseback trips on trails that wind  through unspoiled landscape to America's most magnificent palm oases.  </P> <P> Although Palm Springs' rustic dude ranches have been replaced by golf courses  and luxurious hotels, Smoke Tree Stables still keeps a corral of horses near  the pristine Agua Caliente Indian canyons.  </P> <P> Smoke Tree is the last public stable in Palm Springs. Would-be cowboys and  cowgirls have been renting horses there since 1929, and city fathers recently  gave owner Rod Johnson permission to keep his stable open for at least 10 more  years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Horse Trails  </P> <P> The area has about 135 miles of horse trails that offer visitors close views of  desert plants and wildlife. Hourlong rides go through mostly dry Palm Canyon  Wash at the base of Smoke Tree Mountains.  </P> <P> But longer and more interesting outings lead to streams and shady palm groves  in remote Andreas, Murray and Palm canyons. You can stay in the saddle for two  or four hours on the canyon rides, all guided by wranglers from the stable.  </P> <P> To get to Smoke Tree from Los Angeles, drive east on Interstate 10 to the Palm  Springs turnoff, California 111.  </P> <P> Follow the highway (also called Palm Canyon Drive) south through town. Soon  after it swings east, turn right at Sunrise Way. Take La Verne Way and then go  left on Toledo Avenue to the stable entrance at No. 2500, where the street  meets Murray Canyon Drive.  </P> <P> (Don't turn in at Smoke Tree Ranch, a residential development.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Riders of All Ages  </P> <P> Smoke Tree Stables welcomes riders of all ages. Parents can ride with a small  child in the same saddle. Hours are 8 a.m. until dusk. One-hour rides are  offered on the hour for $15; no reservations required.  </P> <P> More popular are the two-hour trips to Andreas Canyon that depart at 8 a.m. and  10 a.m. and at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. They cost $33.50, including the equestrian  entry fee to the Indian reservation.  </P> <P> Depending on the experience and desire of the riders the horses will walk, trot  or lope along the trail at the command of the wrangler who guides the trip.  </P> <P> From the stable the path enters a sandy wash between Smoke Tree Mountain and a  flood-control dike bordering the Canyon Country Club golf course. Then it  narrows and crosses a couple of streams that carry the runoff of melted snow  from higher elevations before entering Agua Caliente tribal land.  </P> <P> After stopping at a booth to pay the admission fee, the wrangler leads horses  and riders through a landscape of palo verde trees, creosote bush, jumping  cholla and other cactus. Willow leaves rustle in the desert breeze and birds  flit from their hiding places at the sound of hoofs striking rocks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Into the Canyons  </P> <P> The trail twists toward a canyon of California fan palms, botanically named  Washingtonia filifera in honor of the first President. Many have survived for  several centuries, including some with blackened trunks from a fire in 1980.  </P> <P> The horses usually pause to drink from an icy stream that nourishes the oasis  of palms, cottonwoods, sycamores and thick undergrowth. There's not much time  to linger before heading back to the stable, but you may find Indian caves and  grinding rocks near the picnic tables.  </P> <P> On a four-hour horseback excursion to Murray Canyon, another oasis on Indian  land, riders can dismount for a bring-your-own picnic lunch among the palms. An  option is to forgo lunch and continue on a longer trail that circles back to  the stable.  </P> <P> The Murray Canyon trip must be arranged in advance and requires four or more  riders. It costs $63.50 each, including admission to the reservation. For the  same price, horsemen can mount up with a wrangler for a four-hour outing to  Palm Canyon, the area's largest palm oasis.  </P> <P> For more information on Palm Springs trail rides, call Smoke Tree Stables at  (619) 327-1372.  </P> <P> Before or after your equestrian adventure, take an even closer look at desert  plant life by visiting Moorten Botanical Garden. This is the 50th anniversary  of a remarkable collection of desert plants that has grown to 3,000 varieties.  </P> <P> From the stables, follow Murray Canyon Road west to South Palm Canyon Drive,  then turn right (north) to No. 1701.  </P> <P> Pat Moorten and her late husband, known as Cactus Slim, established the garden  around their home as a result of botanical and geological expeditions that  began in the 1930s. They collected plants locally, in Mexico and overseas.  </P> <P> A walk around the grounds is like a world tour, with specimens from a Baja  boojum to an African thorn tree. Especially fascinating in the enclosed  "cactarium" are plants with names such as "Snowball," "Old Man's Whiskers,"  "Mink Tail" and "Devil's Fingers."  </P> <P> The thick vegetation has turned the property into a bird sanctuary, especially  for about 200 mourning doves. Also look for the white temple doves from Egypt  that are part of wedding ceremonies held frequently at the garden.  </P> <P> Pat and her son, Clark, welcome visitors every day. Admission costs $1.50 and  includes a map for an informal tour of the grounds. The garden opens at 9 a.m.,  Sundays at 10 a.m. Some of the Moorten's home-raised cactus plants are for  sale.  </P> <P> Two blocks north is California 111, which you can rejoin to reach Interstate 10  for the trip back to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Round trip from Los Angeles to Palm Springs is 230 miles.  </P></p>

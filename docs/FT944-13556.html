			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Royal Commission on the Environment: Business slams heavy burden Business and motoring organisations criticised the report for suggesting measures which would place too heavy a burden on drivers and the haulage industry. The Confederation of British Industry warned that the proposal to raise fuel duty and cut road spending would do little to reduce road congestion - but would damage British competitiveness. The confederation said the present roads programme had to be maintained if the UK was to overcome years of neglect and catch up with its competitors elsewhere in Europe. 'The fear is that the short-sharp-shock treatment proposed by the commission will make road transport very expensive but offer little in terms of realistic alternative ways for individuals to travel and for businesses to transport their goods and services,' said Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general. The Freight Transport Association, which represents 12,000 hauliers and shippers, described the report as 'unrealistic and potentially damaging to the economy'. Increasing fuel duty would increase inflation instead of transferring freight to rail, it said. A high-quality environment depended on a strong, competitive economy which would not be achieved by pricing traffic off the roads, warned the British Roads Federation, which represents many companies that ship goods by road. It called for higher investment to remove through traffic from towns and villages. The Automobile Association said private motorists were being faced with penalties to force them to leave their cars 'for non-existent or inadequate alternatives'. It called for improvements to public transport before motorists could be expected to leave their cars behind. Four out of five drivers would continue to use their cars even if the price of petrol were doubled over the next 10 years, an AA survey has showed. The Royal Automobile Club said the fuel-price mechanism was 'a crude, cruel and ineffective lever' which would hit the elderly, the disabled, women, and people living in the country the hardest. However, Transport 2000, a campaign group in favour of public transport, backed the report. It called on the government to use the Budget to make the switch from roads spending to devoting resources to trains, buses, cycling and traffic-calming measures.</p>

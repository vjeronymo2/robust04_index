			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem -- Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim  last night signed a protocol whereby Brazil adheres to the OAS  Convention on Human Rights and the Abolition of Capital  Punishment, which was signed in Asuncion, Paraguay, in June  1990. Brazil was the sixth country to sign the protocol, thus  reaffirming its commitment to refrain from adopting the death  penalty.    Amorim said that in addition to strengthening democracy, the  protocol ensures peaceful coexistence among countries and  respect for human rights. The protocol still requires approval  by the Brazilian Congress. The protocol will not become  mandatory until the congresses of two-thirds of the OAS member  countries have ratified the convention.    Amorim said that the Brazilian Constitution states that  capital punishment will not be applied in the country except in  case of a declared war. He said: "Brazilian legislation is in  line with the highest principles of respect for human life and  rights."    Amorim concluded his speech by lauding OAS Secretary General  Baena Soares, noting that his performance "will leave an  indelible mark on the history of this hemisphere in terms of his  success in promoting democracy and human rights."</p>

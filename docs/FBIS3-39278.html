			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "f.gui.": "Moderates Seek To Conquer the </F> South"]    [Text] Rome -- The other half of Italy has yet to be  conquered. After the northern pact between [Forza Italia leader]  Berlusconi and [League Secretary] Bossi, the moderate alignment  is closing the pincer of alliances in the south, too. The  National Alliance, Forza Italia, and the Christian Democratic  Center [CCD] will field joint candidates and symbols with a view  to winning 195 seats in the lower house (out of a total 630),  295 of them in single-candidate constituencies. An agreement  has also been reached for the Senate, where, as the law  requires, only one symbol will be used -- Forza Italia at the  top, the National Alliance at the bottom, and the CCD in the  middle.    The agreement was reached after a week of negotiations in  Rome and Milan. In the evening the three forces' mediators  would go to the via Veneto. It was in fact at the Majestic  Hotel that they laid the foundations for a compromise that  seemed to be within reach but that at the last moment threatened  to collapse because of the former Christian Democrats' tantrums.  But now in Lazio, and elsewhere too, anti-progressive voters  will find their candidates associated with no less than five  groups -- National Alliance, Forza Italia, CCD, Center Union,  and Teso's Pact group, that is, the dissidents who broke away  from [Pact for Italy leader] Segni.    It all started on 10 and 11 February, as IL GIORNALE is in a  position to reveal. The first meeting on via Veneto was  attended by [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini and  Altero Matteoli for the Alliance and Domenico Lo Jucco and  Marcello Dell'Utri for Forza Italia. When they met and spoke  together the two sides realized that an agreement was possible.  Together, they set out the guidelines for a possible agreement  -- the prime need to defeat the PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left], the reaffirmation of national unity, and the defense and  reaffirmation of Western values. It is not difficult to see  that these issues focus the chances of an agreement between  those who believe in economic liberalism and those aiming at a  form of Gaullism, naturally within the context of Western  democracy.    The most difficult thing immediately proved to be the  technical aspect of the agreement: Where and how are the joint  candidates to be fielded? This, particularly since the accord  has to be extended to the former Christian Democrats of Casini,  Mastella, and D'Onofrio; Costa's Liberals; and Teso's reformers,  disillusioned with Segni. The obstacle was surmounted by using  as an example the Lazio region, where political and electoral  interests converge. The subsequent meetings were attended, in  rotation, by "Diakron" expert Gianni Pilo, Forza Italia Chairman  Berlusconi himself, and the CCD's three representatives, Casini,  Mastella, and D'Onofrio, always inseparable.    But two men went the whole distance -- Matteoli and Lo  Jucco.  The agreement was placed in jeopardy as late as Thursday, when  the CCE [expansion unknown] protested because it considered its  strength to have been "underestimated." It was late and the  meeting was adjourned until the next day. Another intervention  by Berlusconi resolved the conflict and opened the final, very  long day -- from 1000 hours to 0200 the following morning. The  MSI [Italian Social Movement] representatives shuttled to and  from their National Directorate meeting in a state of shock,  being in a clear minority. Everyone --from Casini to De Luca,  from Biondi to D'Onofrio, and dozens of provincial and regional  councilors -- came and went, either out of curiosity or seeking  a place in the sun. There was agreement even on disagreements:  Each force will compete on its own account in the  constituencies of Benevento, Caserta, and Avellino.    Thus the National Alliance can avoid being accused of having  included the former De Mita supporter, Mastella, on its list.  The latter will compete probably only under his own symbol and  that of Forza Italia. It is said that during the negotiations  several representatives of Segni's Pact and of Martinazzoli's  Popular Party either put in an appearance or spoke, frightened  by the emergence of a center-right alliance. According to MSI  members, "the Pact's Michelini was one of the most frightened."  On the whole it was not possible to divide the pie strictly  according to relative numbers. But, significantly, the National  Alliance has 55 percent of the seats, Forza Italia 35 percent,  and the CCD and the minor allies the rest. The percentages  change from region to region. The Alliance is strong in Puglia,  but weak in Sardinia, to cite just one example. Among other  things, over half the Alliance's candidates will be not MSI  members but individuals entering politics for the first time.    As though to "consecrate" the agreement, Berlusconi and Fini  will run in Rome. The former will be a candidate on the  proportional list in Naples and Palermo too, and the latter in  Trieste and Bologna. What about Bossi? According to MSI  sources, "When we registered our joint candidacy with Forza  Italia at the Interior Ministry, the League's Patelli blanched  and asked us: Does Umberto [Bossi] know about this?" Now the  real election campaign is starting. Fini's spokesman, Francesco  Storace, is wasting no time and has accused Segni of fielding  Andreotti's son-in-law, Marco Ravaglioli, in Rome "in the name  of rejuvenation."</p>

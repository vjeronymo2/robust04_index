			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- The State Duma's amnesty  decision was not called in question either by the collegium of  the procurator-general's office, or by its former head Aleksey  Kazannik, because "the procurator's office is not a debating  club, and its duty is to carry out the parliament's decisions."    Nevertheless, Kazannik told a meeting of the Council of the  Federation here today that he had received a written instruction  from the president not to carry out the amnesty. Considering  that Kazannik, as he said, did not have any constitutional  guarantees in the form of a decision of the Council of the  Federation, appointing him to the post of procurator-general, he  decided to resign and announced his decision during a press  conference at the procurator- general's office on February 26.    Kazannik also said that he was asking nothing from the  Council of the Federation and that he was "satisfied with the  fact that the Council of the Federation was discussing this  issue."    Kazannik told journalists during a break in the  deliberations  of the Council of the Federation, which is to pass a decision on  the appointment of a procurator-general, that he was hatching  plans to set up his own party, made up of law-abiding people.  "If such a party is set up, I would prefer to call it a party  of concord and national progress," Kazannik said. He told  journalists also that he was receiving offers from Omsk,  Yekaterinburg, and Novosibirsk to head various associations.  Most of them came from intellectuals.</p>

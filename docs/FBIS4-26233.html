			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 17 (CNA) -- Taipei on Friday [17 June]  responded coolly to Beijing's call for a high-level meeting to  promote cross-strait dialogue and rapprochement.    Kao Kung-lian, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs  Council,  told a press conference that "there is no need for Taiwan to  immediately respond to the mainland's urge to hold high-level  talks or the fifth round of negotiations...because Taiwan's call  for special negotiations to work out ways to safeguard Taiwan  tourists on the mainland has been snubbed by Beijing."    "Taiwan on several occasions urged the mainland to talk over  compensation for the 24 Taiwan tourists killed in March 31's  Qiandao Lake crime, but ARATS [Association for Relations Across  the Taiwan Strait] has yet to respond to our request," Kao said.    Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, faxed a message to C.F. Ku,  president of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on  Thursday recommending the two meet either in Taipei or a third  place to tackle cross-strait issues.    ARATS again raised the proposal in another fax to the SEF on  Friday. The two semi-official organizations are authorized by  their respective governments to handle private exchanges between  the two sides in the absence of official contacts.    Ku and Wang met in Singapore in April 1993 for the first  time  to lay a framework for SEF-ARATS exchanges. Several agreements  were signed during the historic meeting.    Cross-strait relations have been severely strained due to  the  killings.</p>

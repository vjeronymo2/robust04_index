			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (YONHAP) -- China opposes any  military exercises or missile deployment in South Korea which  could be detrimental to the easing of tensions in the region,  Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin said Thursday.    Responding to reporters' questions about the deployment of  Patriot missiles in South Korea and the U.S.-South Korean joint  military exercise `Team Spirit,' Wu said China opposed any  military activity that might exacerbate strains on the Korean  peninsula.    Wu emphasized that stability and the easing of tensions in  the region are also in the interests of neighboring countries,  reiterating China's position that the North Korean nuclear  problem should be solved through dialogue.    Asked whether Beijing would send a delegation to North Korea  for President Kim Il-song's 82nd birthday on April 15, the  spokesman replied, "China has never sent any delegation to  Pyongyang in connection with Kim's birthday."</p>

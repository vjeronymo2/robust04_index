			<p>`Neoimperialism'   <F P=102>   944Q0408A Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian 28 May 94 p 4 </F> <F P=103> 944Q0408A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Igrunov, deputy chairman of the State </F> Duma Committee on CIS Affairs and Relations with  Fellow-Countrymen: "Come Out of Egypt As We Are"]    [Text] My first reaction to the publication of Zatulin's  interview was the desire to immediately write a rebuke and raise  in the Duma the question of dismissing K.F. from the position of  chairman of the Committee on CIS Affairs and Relations with  Fellow-Countrymen. A phone call from Sochi arrived just in time,  however, promising to give a refutation, time dragged on, and  ... it seems, I am now forced to dispute the viewpoint, not of  Zatulin, but of his interviewer.    No, it is not that I changed my attitude toward Konstantin  Fedorovich's views -- I considered, and still consider them to  be ruinous and tremendously damaging for Russia. It is not that  I doubted the authenticity of the interview -- in private  conversations the "well-known politician" had uttered the  precise words that were conveyed on the pages of NG, even those  which were not confirmed by tape recording. The point is that in  I. Rotar's article, "Rossiyskiy neoimperializm" [Russian  Neoimperialism], I detected depressing cliches and a distressing  superficiality, born, perhaps, in the heat of polemics and  excusable for a current-affairs commentator, but bitter in the  texts of such a thoughtful researcher and ethnic-political  scientist as Igor Rotar.    First of all, I should like to touch on a few  generalizations.    It is extremely hasty to identify Mr. Zatulin's revelations  with "the position of official Moscow" and even of the PRES  Party. Zatulin does not even express the position of the State  Duma, which can be seen from the votes on its proposals. The  fact that he is the chairman of the committee reflects,  unfortunately, not the Duma's orientation in Commonwealth  affairs, but the merely formal assignment of duties in the  parliament, which was approved as a package. The striking  divergence between Zatulin's authority and the status that he  has acquired once again emphasizes the depravity, under our  conditions, of the method of impersonal allocation of seats to  appease the powerful extremist wings in parliament.    Igor Rotar's "high-ranking collocutor" obtained his post  because, in the allocation of seats, the position of chairman of  the Committee on CIS Affairs fell to the lot of PRES, and not  because his program most adequately reflected the mood in the  Duma. In turn, Mr. Shakhray offered this post to Konstantin  Fedorovich, not because the latter has great prestige in the  faction or reflects the point of view of its leader, but because  it was necessary to settle accounts fittingly according to  pre-election obligations. I assure you, Mr. Rotar, the faction  and Sergey Shakhray are scarcely delighted about this.    Of course, the very fact of Zatulin's presence in such an  important seat attests to the level of responsibility of the  Duma and certain specific leaders and political factions, but  this is nothing more than a politically conscious position on  cooperation within the framework of the Commonwealth (or  imperial politics, if you like).    Whatever the Duma's position was, however, today it plays a  negligible role in the real foreign policy of the state. More  important here, for example, is the position of the MID  [Ministry of Foreign Affairs]. Here the author of the article  "Rossiyskiy neorealizm" [Russian Neo-Realism] alludes to the  pronouncements of Vadim Kuznetsov on the "constructive relations  that have been formed" with Zatulin. It was perceived as a  sensation, however. This attests only to the fact that in his  official utterances, Mr. Zatulin behaves with much greater  restraint, and in general, much more judiciously. Being not so  much Mr. Zatulin's opponent as his antagonist, I am often forced  to express my solidarity with his position, not because I am  myself an imperialist, but because Zatulin knows how to take  into consideration in his speeches the opinion of other members  of the Committee and the atmosphere of the encounters and moods  of the collocutor. All this is done in a very talented way, so  that many of those who were shocked by Zatulin's revelations  were sometimes delighted by his speeches. Nothing is so natural  to people as the ability to be easily deceived. Zatulin's  successful "diplomacy," therefore, must not be identified with  the position of the MID or even of Mr. Kuznetsov.    Let us put aside the perpetrator of the scandal, however,  because he provides only the grounds for I. Rotar: the article  contains an interesting analysis of Russian politics. The  accusations here are better-founded and more serious.    Not only the author of the article, but also a tremendous  number of political scientists and journalists are now pumping  out the myth of a new Russian imperialism. Not that there are no  grounds for it: the Soviet people form a policy with Soviet  mentality, poisoned, moreover, with industrialized nationalism.  This tendency to decide how best to "build up" Russia or the new  abroad from Moscow will remain for a long time yet (and  institutional and ideological counterbalances to this will have  to be worked out), because nothing is so conservative as human  culture and psychology. Is this, however, a basis for declaring  any integrationalist movement imperialist?    Cultural expanses and economic associations, just as other  self-organized systems, have mechanisms of the homeostasis of  self-renewal. These mechanisms are a powerful force in history.  In the middle of the first millennium, the Persians created a  world empire which existed for three centuries. This was enough  so that two centuries after that the unified space was  reintegrated time after time within approximately the same  limits. Just as many characteristic integration features are  perceptible in the history of Europe, beginning with the days of  the Roman Empire. What is more, Russia inherited the tremendous  integration potential of the Mongolian Empire. Not all  integration or reintegration, however, follows the course of an  empire (we will not discuss the imperial legacy itself in such a  short piece of material). For example, the integration of modern  Europe is completely non-imperial in nature. The creators of  anti-Russian rhetoric relate the unification of the monetary  systems of Russia and Belorussia [Belarus] as evidence of a  neoimperialist policy, even though it is obvious that here the  initiative does not at all stem from an imperialist center. This  does not mean, by the way, that we are guaranteed against the  restoration of vassal relationships, but this possibility does  not stem directly from Russia's readiness to go halfway to meet  Belorussia, Armenia or Tajikistan. In order to avoid the  restoration of an empire, we must show what is unjustified in  the integration mechanisms and suggest alternatives, not fight  against integration itself as a potential for the Fall.    Critics of neoimperialism, however, do not as a rule go  beyond the limits of the label. This can also be seen in the use  of terms such as "former metropolitan state." Can one speak of  Russia this way? If there was a metropolitan state in the USSR,  it was by no means Russia, but rather, Moscow within the limits  of the MKAD [Moscow Ring Road]. A Ukrainian resident enjoyed no  fewer rights in the metropolitan state than did a resident of  Saratov or Nezhniy Tagil. In general, the USSR was an organism  organized in a very complicated way, in which citizens were  divided into a multitude of types according to a whole set of  criteria, and the striving to convert the Russians en masse into  an "imperial nation," Russia into a metropolitan state, and the  14 other republics into a colony is therefore no more than an  ideological cliche. Fit, alas, only for destruction.    Thus, I insist that, it is by no means only the motive of  bringing back imperial grandeur that is present in the striving  toward reintegration, but also the natural motive of ensuring  economic prosperity, observance of human rights, cultural  self-realization, etc., etc. This striving does not just come  from Russia and not just from the Russians. Not being foisted on  us from without, and being voluntary, this striving is building  a new, integrated world, which will inevitably retain the  features of the old centralized state, with its imperial  mentality for some time, but will not be blanketed by them. The  alternative to this "stained" shadow of past integration,  however, will be only disintegration and degradation, which can  be alleviated in some cases, but cannot be overcome.  Decivilization, which has already assumed unprecedented rates in  the expanses of the Soviet Union, is the only real alternative  to integration. But did not those who strove to destroy the USSR  really do this out of a striving to ensure human rights? A  worthy emergence into world civilization? (I am not speaking of  those who used anti-Sovietism as an instrument of struggle with  Russia -- any Russia, totalitarian or democratic).    If these aspirations are sincere, however, just how can one  indict Russia for its concern with the rights of the Russian  people in the new near abroad? This is its duty, which is  inscribed in the obligations of all civilized peoples to ensure  adherence to human rights, regardless of race, religion or  nationality. Why should concern for the rights of the Estonians  (expressed in granting independence to Estonia) run counter to  concern for the rights of the Russians (expressed in the  striving to acquire citizenship in our own native land)? And why  does the use of economic levers seem, a priori, terrible? Were  economic sanctions not applied against the USSR, which had  violated human rights? Or against Serbia? Or against the UAR?  The liberals, who almost go into a coma at the mention of  Russian economic sanctions, supported and are supporting  sanctions of another type. Why such a double-faced moral? Other  things aside, economic levers can be not only negative, but also  positive. Both constitute the customary practice of democratic  states. It is therefore superficial to reject a certain specific  instrument without considering the specific forms of its  application. Otherwise, we will be dealing, not with politics,  but with hysterics.    The possibility of retaining military bases in Tajikistan,  Georgia or Moldova inspires us with horror. What will happen,  though, if there is no other way to ensure stability and safety?  I am not talking about thrusting our bases on them forcibly, but  is military intervention in the Tajikistan of which I. Rotar  writes, really more forcible in nature than in Somalia? Bosnia?  Etc., etc.    As for what certain politicians say, they are using the same  old cliches, which correspond fully to their troglodytic  mentality. Alas, our country has no other politicians or other  people, and we should come out of Egypt as we are, in order to  step on the soil of Jericho just 40 years later, and if we do  not want our Jericho to be a repetition of our Egypt, we must  not reject the path through the desert but, stubbornly going  toward our goal, should cast our riches upon the fire every day.</p>

All of the commenters objected to restricting the use of depositions to those instances in which testimony might not otherwise be available. One commenter argued that the States' right to due process at the administrative appeal level was in jeopardy. Another commenter noted that by categorically prohibiting the use of depositions other than to preserve testimony, FNS has seriously compromised the States' ability to challenge error-rate penalty claims. This commenter also argued that by preventing the ALJ from using discovery depositions as one tool of litigation management, FNS has compromised the ALJ's ability to preside over the taking of evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department has considered these comments but has not adopted them. It is the Department's position that the use of depositions should be restricted to those instances in which the witness may be unavailable to testify at the hearing. The Department believes that the discovery procedures provided in the NPRM for interrogatories, admissions, request for production of documents, and depositions, as well as the prehearing conference, provide adequate discovery tools for the parties to prepare for the oral hearing or to submit cross motions for summary judgment pursuant to &sect;283.30. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Department believes that permitting discovery depositions would result in substantial costs and delay in the appeals process. The Department recognizes that a significant goal of the amendments to the Act by section 603 of the HPA was to create a more efficient appeals process. The House Report states that an objective of section 603 of the HPA was to ``streamline[] the appeals process of the quality control system.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' H.R. Rep. No. 828, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 32 (1988). Further, Representative Panetta stated during debate of the HPA, ``(a) third set of changes aims to speed the resolution of financial claims against State agencies for excessive error by streamlining the appeals process and providing for the payment of interest.'' 134 Cong. Rec. 20,982 (1988). Representative Emerson reiterated this same intention. 134 Cong. Rec. 20,984 (1988). The Department believes that restricting the use of depositions to those instances in which the witness may be unavailable to testify at the hearing is in keeping with the stated intent of Congress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interrogatories and Admissions: In &sect;&sect;283.12(b) (1) and (2) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the parties be limited to fifteen interrogatories and admissions, including subparts, unless additional questions were authorized by the ALJ. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department received five comments on these provisions. All of the commenters objected to limiting the number of interrogatories and admissions. One commenter noted that given the ALJ's authority to limit discovery, it would be more efficient not to impose an arbitrary limit on the number of interrogatories and admissions. The commenter argued that the responding party could request a protective order from the ALJ if it felt that the requests were burdensome. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department has considered these comments and has revised &sect;&sect;283.12(b) (1) and (2) to permit twenty-five interrogatories and admissions, including subparts, unless additional questions are authorized by the ALJ. The Department continues to believe that a limit on the number of interrogatories and admissions available without approval by the ALJ is reasonable given the authority of the ALJ to authorize an increase in that number. The Department disagrees that it should be the responsibility of the responding party to pursue a protective order if the scope of the discovery is burdensome. Rather, it is reasonable to place the responsibility on the requesting party to justify why the ALJ should authorize an increase in the number of interrogatories and admissions. This limit is also consistent with congressional intent to streamline the appeals process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Production of Documents: In &sect;283.12(b)(3) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that any party to the appeal may serve a request for the production of documents that are in the possession or control of another party. The Department also proposed that the requested documents would be provided upon payment of fees for search and duplication of the documents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

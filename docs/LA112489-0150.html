			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GARRISON KEILLOR: FROM PRAIRIE RADIO TO THE N. Y. JUNGLE  </P> <P> It's been more than two years since Garrison Keillor left gentle Lake Wobegon,  but public radio's favorite storyteller says he's not worried about stepping up  to the microphone again, even if the stage is in rough-and-tumble Brooklyn.  </P> <P> "I hope to become nervous, you know, at the right time. I count on it," said  Keillor, who returns to the airwaves with a new weekly program. "But I hope  that it doesn't raise the pitch in my voice. I think I'm counted on to sing  bass parts."  </P> <P> "Garrison Keillor's American Radio Company of the Air," which premieres on  public radio stations Saturday will once again feature Keillor's soft voice --  "I'm going to sing just ever so slightly less than people would like me to."  </P> <P> But he insists the new, live show will not be a spinoff of "A Prairie Home  Companion," which attracted 4 million listeners each week on American Public  Radio.  </P> <P> "What I'm doing is taking 13 years of experience doing one kind of live radio  variety show in one place and I'm using that to create a different one, a  different one in a different place," he said in a recent interview, sitting  behind a desk stacked with books at his Manhattan office.  </P> <P> Keillor's plans for this season's 20 shows include "classic American music of  all kinds." Singer Eileen Farrell, pianist James Tocco and opera star Marilyn  Horne are scheduled to guest star.  </P> <P> And the 47-year-old humorist says his monologues will return, but with less of  a focus on the Midwest.  </P> <P> "I've a lot of things I want to talk about, some of which have to do about New  York," he said. "But I don't have any need to do a routine on New York."  </P></p>

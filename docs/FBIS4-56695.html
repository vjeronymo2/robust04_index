			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hector Hernandez M.: "'94-'98: A More Open </F> Market, But Implemented Better"]    [Text] The main business associations intend to tell the  new president what our development priorities for the immediate  future must be. The revaluation and lack of innovation are their  main concerns.    Our country's best development option is to open the market,  but major adjustments will have to be made by the next  government, particularly in terms of implementation.    If we are to battle crime and guerrilla-backed violence, we  shall not only be forced to consolidate justice, but to  strengthen the government's ability to maintain law and order.  Nor can the possibility of negotiating with armed groups be  ruled out.    This the view which the country's main business associations  take of national development priorities in the years lying  ahead. By June of this year, the National Council of  Associations (CNG) will have finished drafting a program  containing proposals to be presented to the next president-elect  on how to handle the country's economic, political, and social  issues.    The DIARIO ECONOMICO obtained a copy of the second draft of  the associations' program. In it, they express great concern  over the process of revaluing the peso, a process that "may be  stepped up in the future."    The associations believe that it is important for the  government to intervene in markets, but solely for the purpose  of correcting distortions. However, with respect to  technological innovation and social management, they hint that  it should take more direct action than it has heretofore done.    The program says that in the future, it will be of exceeding  importance to use concerted action as a tool to consolidate  democracy. It announces that business associations will  participate in the various legally constituted councils and  commissions in order to reach agreement with the government on  such issues as maintaining high rates of growth and employment,  lowering inflation, and achieving better planning.  <H5>  Better Execution </H5>   "In the debate on the future role of the Colombian  Government  and its priorities, rather than questioning its active role in  areas such as infrastructure, education, science and technology,  law enforcement, the adoption of market reforms, and the need to  give top priority to reaching the poorest population groups, it  would be more appropriate to question how this redefinition of  the method and field of government action has been expressed in  practical terms," one draft says.    Concerning the new system of overall social security, it  states that an attempt must be made to apply it "as a key policy  in order to provide stability for the model of development."    It admits that while so-called social spending as a  proportion of the gross domestic product has gradually begun to  climb again in the 1990's, "it is still below levels reached in  the mid '80's and remains far below national needs."    This and other problems remain unsolved: inadequate  execution  of the budget and weak, uncoordinated social institutions,  combined with a lack of coherent medium- and long-term programs.    With respect to how the exchange rate is to be handled, the  production associations say, "it has been observed that because  of its constitutional mandate to oversee the purchasing power of  the currency, the new monetary authority (the board of directors  of the Bank of the Republic) is not in a position to impede this  process affecting the behavior of the production of salable  goods. It will have to take an in-depth look at future trends of  the macroeconomic variables having the greatest impact on the  price of the currency and propose policies preventing any spread  of the so-called "Dutch disease."    They agree that because of problems besetting agriculture  such as climatic changes and sudden variations in foreign prices  for agricultural products, subsidies must be instituted for the  sector, but of a type that will not "weaken the ability to  compete with other related activities, if one wants to avoid the  cost of extending protection to the rest of the productive  system."    The draft exhibits a tendency to give priority to the  conservation of natural resources over their indiscriminate  exploitation aimed at improving the economic situation.    "If it is to be consolidated in long-range terms, the new  model of development will require policies making it  sustainable. There is increasing awareness of the need to face  up to the depletion of natural resources, put a stop to alarming  pollution, and adopt a different type of urban development that  will halt the decline in the quality of life in our cities and  make it possible to accommodate the projected population  increase without undue trauma."  <H5>  Justice, Lack of Safety, and Violence </H5>   In order to face the challenge of violence and crime, the  National Council of Business Associations maintains that not  only will it be necessary to consolidate justice as democracy's  instrument par excellence for solving social conflicts, but also  to strengthen the government's ability to maintain law and  order. "Colombia is one of the most violent countries in the  world and has in recent years been forced to face a resurgence  of what experts call "organized violence," which is linked to  guerrilla movements, drug trafficking, and organized crime."    The various methods "will therefore require complex  solutions  in terms of their options, including a possible attempt on the  part of the government to engage in negotiations that might lead  armed groups to disarm."    "In terms of daily violence," the document says, "in  addition  to strengthening the police, we must undertake more complex  action aimed at countering its causes, which include a lack of  flexible legal means to resolve conflicts, weapons possession,  the use of alcohol and drugs, inadequate monitoring of the  conduct of administrative officials, and the lack of educational  and recreational facilities."    Finally, the business associations are not attacking the  Gaviria government, but rather, trying to project their own  model into the future.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORPORATE MIND?  </P> <P> KKBT general manger Jim de Castro is a college-educated anti-intellectual whose  remarks (and those of his staff) consist of yuppie-oriented non sequiturs and  reflect a lack of taste.  </P> <P> Equally offensive is De Castro's attitude. He not only feels no remorse in  having eliminated one of the longest-operating classical radio stations, but he  actually thinks he has something to offer that the other rock stations don't.  </P> <P> ROBERT S.

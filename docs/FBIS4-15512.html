			<p>BFN     [Text] Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich did not  rule out the possibility that Belarusians would be polled on  economic integration with Russia on 23 June when the  presidential elections are held.    In an exclusive INTERFAX interview in Minsk Friday Kebich  said that he had initially proposed such a move at the meeting  of the government presidium Tuesday, 5 April and the idea was  supported by all cabinet members.    Kebich said that, according to sociological research, an  absolute majority of Belarusian citizens supported a union with  Russia.    Kebich said that Belarus was a stable country and the  economic union treaty that had been ratified by parliament  contributed to the stability. He thought, however, that a poll  would indirectly enhance the long-term stability of that treaty,  whatever the political situation in the country.</p>

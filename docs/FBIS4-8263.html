			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prague, April 10 (CTK) -- President Vaclav Havel  did some explaining during his regular Sunday radio address  today. He said that he had signed the new labor law amendment  into law on Saturday because it did not hurt employees nor  conflict with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms or  any international agreements.    He said he'd received numerous letters asking him not to  sign  the law "from various unions, the Helsinki Committee, and other  institutions," but decided he "could sign this law with a clean  and peaceful conscience."    Union objections, he said, would unleash "mistrust in the  independence, self-awareness, and responsibility of people, of  employees," and added that collective agreements between  employees and employers existed to further protect workers'  rights.    Havel also pointed out that this was the 17th amendment to  the labor law overall and already the tenth since November 1989,  "so that if this or that one doesn't pass the test, it can be  changed with the help of more amendments."

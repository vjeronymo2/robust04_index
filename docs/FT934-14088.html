			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Defiant Names claim prospect of victory REPRESENTATIVES of loss-making Names plan to meet Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, this afternoon, as they press for compensation before tomorrow's crucial vote on the issue of admission of corporate investors to the insurance market. Members of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party, which links 37 action groups, hold proxy votes on behalf of their members. They believe they may be able to win the vote at the extraordinary general meeting and could attempt to block moves to invite corporate capital if Lloyd's refuses to offer acceptable compensation for their insurance losses. 'We certainly have enough votes to force some issues,' said Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the working party. At a meeting yesterday representatives of the loss-making Names also discussed calling for an adjournment of Wednesday's vote to allow time for settlement negotiations to take place. 'There is no doubt that a settlement is the real issue,' said Mr Stockwell. 'The council have got the cart before the horse.' Meanwhile, a separate group of loss-making Names are threatening to repudiate their contracts and sue Lloyd's for fraud if the insurance market draws down on their deposits to meet losses. The Lloyd's Action Group for Restitution and Deposit Defence alleges that Names - the individuals whose assets support the market - have been victims of 'false accounting' and a 'false market (that) has existed within Lloyd's since as long ago as 1981 and perhaps earlier'. The action group has collected Pounds 75,000 from about 300 Names so far but hopes to persuade more to join it and to help finance its action. Mr Clive Francis, chairman of the group, said its aim was to ensure that 5,000 loss-makers 'do not get left behind' as the market seeks new corporate investors. The group claims to have 'astonishing evidence' and was 'absolutely certain of its case'. The action group's solicitors have written to the chairman and corporation of Lloyd's detailing their instructions to file writs in the commercial court 'which should shortly be served on you, seeking, amongst other things, an order preventing you from further drawing down on Names'. The letter invites Lloyd's by October 21 'to agree and undertake not to draw down further on Names until the issues relating to criminal conspiracy, fraud and the creation of a false market within Lloyd's have been determined'. Mr Francis has lost Pounds 2.1m.</p>

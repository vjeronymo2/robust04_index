			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Sanko and Ruslan Sakirov: "Davydov </F> Proposes Benefits for Investors; Duma Assumes Strict but  Constructive Position"]    [Text] The visit of Minister of Foreign Economic Relations  Oleg Davydov to Spain, Morocco and Great Britain has been  concluded.    In Spain, Oleg Davydov was a member of the delegation  accompanying Boris Yeltsin during his official visit, and in  Morocco he took part as an Russian observer in the concluding  meeting of the Uruguay round of the negotiations within the  framework of GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]. In  Great Britain he conducted talks with his English colleagues and  business circles, reports POSTFAKTUM.    During his numerous meetings with foreign colleagues from  Spain, Israel, Brazil, Uruguay, Great Britain and other  countries, and with the business circles of Spain and Great  Britain, Oleg Davydov called upon them to actively cooperate  with Russia in trade as well as in economic investment.  Recognizing the difficulties of work by foreign investors in  Russia under conditions of a most difficult crisis, high  inflation and, mainly, the absence of legislation to guarantee  the effectiveness and ensure protection of foreign capital  investments, Oleg Davydov noted that at the present time Russia  is taking definite steps to stabilize the economy. Inflation has  been reduced, although it has been impossible to overcome the  inertia of economic decline. To support the continued movement  of reforms, the government is developing proposals for creating  beneficial conditions for foreign investors, specifically in the  sphere of the light and food industry.    To expand its foreign trade, Russia, according to Oleg  Davydov, intends to bring its foreign trade legislation in line  with the conditions of GATT, which it intends to join in the  near future. For this purpose, there will be a gradual  liberalization of foreign economic ties in accordance with the  conditions of the transitional period. On the road to GATT, a  reduction in export duties is envisioned, with their subsequent  total repeal in the future. The list of goods subject to quotas  and licensing is being reduced, certification of import goods  has been undertaken and a system of certification of export  products is being created, and the preferential financing of  import is being repealed.    Oleg Davydov stressed that Russia intends to adhere to the  right to intellectual property in accordance with the principles  of the Uruguay agreement. While speaking out in favor of a free  and open Russian market, Russia will nevertheless implement a  policy of rational protectionism, without violating GATT  principles.    Noting that British enterprises are most prepared for  cooperation with Russia, Oleg Davydov called upon them to  consider the fact that "in the next century Russia and China  will define world economic development," reports POSTFAKTUM.    Upon his return to Moscow, the minister will meet with harsh  criticism, as expressed in the recommendations of the Duma, "On  Foreign Economic Activity."    Specifically, the Committee on Economic Policy headed by  Davydov's former chief, Glazyev, is recommending to the  president that the 12 presidential edicts on customs benefits be  "brought into line with the legislation" (in essence, repealed).  To the government it is recommending that it submit to the State  Duma a draft of a federal program for the development of export;  step up work on repayment of debts of foreign states to Russia;  develop measures for preventing economic crimes in the sphere of  foreign economic activity; introduce openness into the  registration of exporters of strategically important raw  material goods, and improve the system of management of foreign  economic activity in the interests of national industry. For  this purpose, it should examine the question of uniting the  functions of the state administration in the sphere of foreign  economic and industrial policy within the framework of a single  department (ministry) on the basis of the MVES [Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations], Goskomprom [RF State Committee on  Industrial Policy] and subdivisions of the Ministry of Economics.</p>

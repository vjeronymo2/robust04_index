			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Reuters raises dividend as cash increases REUTERS HOLDINGS, the business information and news group, dipped into a growing cash pile to increase its dividend for the year by 24.7 per cent, in spite of difficulties which continue to affect its main financial customers. The group's pre-tax profits grew 12.6 per cent to Pounds 383.2m in the year to December 31. Net cash balances rose by Pounds 206.9m to Pounds 709.8m. A 29 per cent increase in the final dividend to 15.9p from 12.3p gives a total for the year of 21.2p (17p). Mr Peter Job, chief executive, said: 'Market conditions are favourable enough to sustain growth across all our product lines. Problems affecting the financial community in some of our major markets, such as Japan, will probably mean that the rate of increase in our underlying revenue is not as fast as we would like.' About 80 per cent of Reuters' revenues are designated in non-sterling currencies, so the devaluation of the pound is likely to boost revenues, although the full benefits will only flow through to earnings as currency hedges unwind. Mr Job said: 'Our cash position is strong enough to allow us to pursue new investment ideas and, at the same time, to recommend an increase in dividend well ahead of earnings growth.' Earnings per share grew 2.3 per cent to 56p, but this was depressed by an extraordinary charge of Pounds 24.6m relating to an Australian tax settlement. Before the extraordinary item, earnings were 12.9 per cent higher at 61.8p. Reuters' revenue grew 4.5 per cent, adjusted to exclude the effect of currency movements. The Americas turned in a record performance, assisted by the rapid growth of Instinet, the subsidiary which runs an equities transaction business. The American contribution to profits was Pounds 15m, compared with a loss of Pounds 5.2m last time. Revenue grew 13.6 per cent to Pounds 259.4m. Strong revenue growth in eastern Europe and the China region was offset by continuing weakness of the financial services sector in several main centres. At actual rates of exchange the revenue of Europe, the Middle East and Africa grew 5.9 per cent to Pounds 952.8m, and the contribution to profits rose 9.7 per cent to Pounds 334.7m. Revenue from the Asia-Pacific region rose 6.4 per cent to Pounds 297m and the contribution to profits rose 6.1 per cent to Pounds 131.8m. Mr Job was satisfied with the progress of two new products, Dealing 2000-2, which offers automated foreign exchange dealing, and Globex, which provides a similar service for futures and options. Operating profit before interest grew 8.9 per cent to Pounds 316.5m, and interest receivable rose 33.8 per cent to Pounds 66.3m. Capital expenditure was 24.9 per cent higher at Pounds 198.7m.

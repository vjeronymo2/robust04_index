			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: GEORGE BURNS: BOOKED AGAIN WITH 'ALL MY BEST FRIENDS';  </P> <P> COMEDY: THE VETERAN FUNNYMAN TALKS A GOOD BOOK, AND HIS LATEST IS A COMPENDIUM  OF ANECDOTES . . . 'MOST OF WHICH ARE TRUE.'  </P> <P> One of the innumerable jokes about George Burns -- this one from Henny Youngman  -- is that Burns is so old that when he orders a three-minute egg, the  restaurant makes him pay in advance.  </P> <P> No one likes the joke more than Burns himself, who will be 94 in January.  Sipping cups of tea in his Hollywood office and enjoying the first of the day's  several cigars, Burns said this week: "I've got to keep working; I just bought  a new toupee."  </P> <P> He was supposed to be starting one of his regular engagements at Caesars Palace  in Las Vegas this week, but he canceled out, refusing to cross the musicians'  picket line. Next week he flies off to do a one-nighter in Lafayette, La.  </P> <P> A thought struck him as he mentioned the engagement. Hollering to an assistant  in the anteroom, Burns said: "Call Lafayette and get the name of the oldest  theater in town."  </P> <P> "It's a joke," Burns explained. "I'll say I played the theater 51 years ago and  I must have done all right, because here I am back again."  </P> <P> The renascence of George Burns, which began when he did "The Sunshine Boys" and  won an Academy Award in 1975, is one of the pleasing wonders of show-business  history. The role led to another triumph as God in "Oh, God!" two years later.  </P> <P> "All the kids like me from the 'God' movies," Burns says. "They came to see  John Denver and decided they liked me, too. The old people came to see me and  fell in love with John Denver. John and I stole one another's audiences."  </P> <P> The films, most recently "18 Again" in 1988, led to eight best-selling books,  which is more books than he has read, Burns likes to say. "I left school in the  fourth grade and started in show business when I was 8," he points out.  </P> <P> "I don't write books, I talk 'em," Burns says. The first ones he did in  collaboration with his manager and longtime friend Irving Fein. "Gracie -- A  Love Story" sold 230,000 copies in hardcover and was on the New York Times  best-seller list for 22 weeks. Like his new book, "All My Best Friends," it was  written with (or talked to) David Fisher.  </P> <P> "All My Best Friends" (G.P. Putnam's: $17.95) was officially published only two  weeks ago but has 390,000 copies in print and has already shown up on both the  Los Angeles Times and New York Times best-seller lists. It is a marvelous  succession of anecdotes, presented with the charming disclaimer, "Most of what  I say is true, the rest is show business."  </P> <P> The stories might or might not hold up in a court of law, but they are  enchanting, none more so than the one about Harpo Marx acquiring a small pouch  of fake diamonds, going into Tiffany's, asking to see a tray of loose diamonds  and then dumping the fakes in with the real ones.  </P> <P> "One night," Burns remembered the other day, "the Marx boys' father was in the  theater catching their act. A guy sitting near him said, 'Harpo really can't  talk; he's deaf and dumb.'  </P> <P> ' "Harpo can talk,' the father said.  </P> <P> " 'He can't talk,' the guy said; 'I know him.'  </P> <P> "The father says, 'Harpo can talk.'  </P> <P> " 'I got 25 bucks that says he can't talk,' the guy says.  </P> <P> " 'Lay me some odds and you're on,' Harpo's father says."  </P> <P> Burns has just finished a new set of commercials with Betty White for the  Southern California Gas Co. He recently played Atlantic City for six days and  regularly works Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas. Not long ago he and Bob Hope did a  comedy concert before a sold-out crowd in Madison Square Garden, and there are  plans to do it at least twice more.  </P> <P> The evening wasn't taped. "Never!" Burns exclaimed. "It's my vaudeville act;  it's got to last me the rest of my career, another 40 or 50 years."  </P> <P> Actually, Burns says, "If you asked me just to stand up for a half-hour, I  couldn't do it. But on stage I can do it for an hour, because of all that love  that comes flowing up over the footlights from the audience. I come on and  people stand up and clap; they say, 'Look, he can move.' "  </P> <P> As part of the act with Hope, billed as "180 years of comedy," Hope borrowed a  lady's hat and they did some George and Gracie routines. "My uncle was held up  on the way home." "For how much?" "All the way." And the tale about Gracie's  Aunt Bessie, whose canary was trying to hatch an ostrich egg. The canary wasn't  big enough for the egg, so Aunt Bessie sat on the egg and held the canary in  her lap. Rim shot and start the music.  </P> <P> "Gracie," Burns says, "didn't tell jokes; she explained them."  </P> <P> Burns remembers all the reviews, including an early one in Oklahoma City, where  the critic said: "There's no telling how far Gracie Allen could go -- if she  worked alone."  </P> <P> Burns has said he only had to know two lines in their act: "Gracie, how's your  family?" and "Your uncle what?" But the truth is that Burns was and is a master  of comedy construction, having learned every hard lesson vaudeville had to  teach. He learned to check the air currents on the stage, to be sure that  Gracie was always upwind from his cigar smoke.  </P> <P> "You couldn't touch Gracie; the audience wouldn't stand for it," Burns says.  "I've always smoked cheap cigars. Good cigars don't stay lit; they're too well  packed. And you can't be re-lighting cigars when you're on stage."  </P> <P> Burns has his own pantheon of favorite comedians: his friend Jack Benny atop  the list; Bob Hope, Milton Berle, Lou Holtz, George Jessel.  </P> <P> "Jessel once wired a pal and said, 'Desperate. Emergency. Send me $1,500.' The  pal did and later Jessel explained that he had just made up with his wife of  the moment, Florence Courtney, and he'd bought her a bracelet with the $1,500.  The guy said, 'That was the emergency, you had to buy a bracelet?' Jessel said:  'Listen, would you have sent the money if I'd said bracelet instead of  emergency?' "  </P> <P> Burns was asked if audiences differ from place to place. "Not for me," he said.  "Everybody knows me. Everybody calls me George.  </P> <P> "I'm having a heck of a time. I don't believe in dying. It's been done."  </P></p>

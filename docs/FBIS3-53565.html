These are the positions to restore balance to  the peace process and open a new chapter to which we attach  importance toward achieving the just, lasting, and comprehensive  peace for which we all hope.    Al-Hariri said the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon  formed  a basic part of the talks, in which President al-Asad adopted  serious and honorable positions that are certainly appreciated  by the Lebanese people and Government. He added: In my name,  and on behalf of the Lebanese Government, I salute President  al-Asad, who made UN Resolution 425 a main topic on the agenda  of the historic summit.</p>

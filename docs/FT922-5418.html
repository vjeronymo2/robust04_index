			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Deal offered on lease for pit BRITISH COAL yesterday agreed provisionally to lease the mothballed Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh to Monktonhall Mineworkers, a consortium of miners which will be granted a 10-year licence to operate the pit. If, as seems likely, the agreement is completed, Monktonhall will become the first full-scale deep mine in the UK to be operated by a private-sector company since coal was nationalised in 1947. At present private-sector operators run only small or open-cast mines. Monktonhall Mineworkers has been negotiating with British Coal to take over the mine since last December, when the consortium was declared the preferred bidder. Earlier this month British Coal said it was reopening negotiations with Caledonian Mining, a privately owned company based at Newark in Nottinghamshire, after the mineworkers' consortium appeared unable to provide the necessary finance. In the past few weeks, however, at least 100 members of the consortium have each agreed to invest Pounds 10,000 in the company, compared with the original stake of Pounds 2,000. The Life Association of Scotland, a life assurance company, has offered individual members of the consortium loans to help them pay for their shares. Last night Caledonian Mining said it was 'surprised' that British Coal had decided to negotiate an agreement with Monktonhall Mineworkers. It said it would still be available to take on the pit if the deal with the consortium ers fell through. Monktonhall Mineworkers has faced considerable opposition from Labour-controlled local authorities, which have questioned the consortium's ability to operate the mine and cast doubt on its sources of finance.</p>

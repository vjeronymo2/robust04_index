			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Queens Moat lenders agree on way forward Lenders to Queens Moat Houses, the struggling hotels group, appear close to resolving the stalemate that has held up completion of the Pounds 1.3bn debt restructuring for several months. The talks have been stalled for some time over treatment of Queens Moat's leasing obligations on six of its better hotels, as well as by tough negotiations with secondary debt lenders. The main lenders are understood to have felt that the lessors should make compromises, for example by agreeing to a standstill on leasing payments, to ensure the survival of Queens Moat. The lessors, which include Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland and Hambros, are thought, for their part, to have been unwilling to compromise their position, given the quality of the hotels. Queens Moat sold and leased back the hotels in 1991 in a Pounds 66m deal. The company has a 30-year lease on the properties and the lessors were at the time guaranteed rent increases from Queens Moat of 7 per cent a year. However, it is now believed that a financial arrangement has been welcomed by all parties which opens the way for a restructuring to be completed next month. This could mean that the shares, which have been suspended since March 1993, might resume trading just before Christmas or at the beginning of the year. Even so, there remain difficulties with at least one lender who purchased a substantial amount of debt in the secondary market. Queens Moat refused to comment on the details of any arrangements. However, it said it was encouraged by progress. 'It is a great deal better, but there is some way to go,' the company said. Queens Moat has been in restructuring talks for the last 18 months. Most of the company's 74 lenders have agreed restructuring proposals - which include a substantial debt-for-equity swap.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 19 (CTK) -- Seventy-one percent of  people in the Czech Republic would go to the polls if elections  to the Czech Parliament were held now, according to a poll  conducted by the Institute for Public Opinion Research (IVVM) on  March 28-April 6.    The poll of 1,544 respondents with the right to vote  revealed  that 37 percent of the electorate were certain they would vote,  34 percent said they probably would, and eight percent said  "probably not." Ten percent of those surveyed replied with a  "resolute no" and 11 percent had not decided. The higher the  level of education, the less frequent was the answer "I do not  know" and more frequent the intention to go to the polls, the  survey showed.    Twenty-eight percent of the electorate would vote Czech  Premier Vaclav Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS), 12 percent  Milos Zeman's Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), and 11  percent Deputy Premier Jan Kalvoda's Civic Democratic Alliance  (ODA).    More than five percent of those polled supported the  Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) and the Assembly  for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC). Four  percent were in favor of the government coalition Christian  Democratic Union- Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL).    The Left Bloc (LB), former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister  Jiri  Dienstbier's Free Democrats (SD), the Green Party (SZ), the  Farmers' Party (ZS), the government coalition Christian  Democratic Party (KDS), and the Czech-Moravian Center Party  (CMSS) all received less than four percent.    Twenty-three percent of the voters did not know which party  they would support.    Compared with last month's figures, the ODS has dropped in  popularity and the CSSD, the KSCM, and the SPR-RSC strengthened  their positions.</p>

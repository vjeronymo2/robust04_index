			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Spanish prices jump on hopes of lower interest rates SPANISH bonds jumped by more than a point yesterday as increasing confidence in the new government and a spate of European interest rate cuts led to hopes of an easing in Spain today. In the futures market, the September contract was 1.15 points higher at its peak. Then, profit-takers took the contract down to close at 93.25, a gain of 0.90 on the day. Also, the yield spread against German bunds moved under a historic support level of 350 basis points to 347 basis points. Rate cuts in the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal and Ireland, as well as the significant easing in the French intervention rate, have encouraged the belief that European central banks have no problem in easing independently of the Bundesbank. AN ANNOUNCEMENT that today's German repo would be variable appeared to set the seal on any hopes of a significant rate cut and sent German bond prices lower. Bund futures for September delivery fell 12 basis points to 95.18. The repo rate has been stuck at 7.6 per cent since early May and there were expectations that the Bundesbank might cut by as much as a quarter-point following the French cut on Monday. However, those hopes were eroded by high money supply growth figures and were dealt a further blow by the continuing strength of the US dollar against the D-Mark. The dollar touched DM1.70 in intra-day dealing in London yesterday. FRENCH government bonds paused for breath yesterday following their recent surge, as some investors wondered if the yield spread against bunds had narrowed far enough. The spread for April 2003 benchmark bunds and OATs widened slightly to 12 basis points. THE GILTS market started brightly, but an early quarter-point gain was eroded on the latest auction announcement, with September UK gilt futures easing  1/8 point to 106 1/32 . The Bank of England is to auction Pounds 3.25bn of 8 per cent Treasury stock due 2003 on June 30. There was little surprise at the auction details but they gave an opportunity to take profits after a solid rise prompted by the announcement of sharply lower UK inflation and helped by the French rate cut. In the cash market, the benchmark 9 per cent Treasury stock maturing 2008 fell  3/32 to 107 13/32 , although at the shorter end the five-year dated March 1998 gained  5/32 points to 101 5/32 . IN THE remaining high yielding European markets, Italian government bonds were volatile. They rose in early trading on the prospect of a half percentage point interest rate cut, but prices slipped later in the day on concerns over a vote of confidence called by Mr Carlo Ciampi, the prime minister, and closed 0.27 point lower at 102.08. Portuguese bonds were strong, buoyed by investor confidence that the escudo will remain stable and local money rates will continue falling. Two state banks followed up Monday's quarter point cut in the Bank of Portugal's key money market rates by announcing a further cut of up to half a point in the prime rate. US TREASURY prices firmed slightly at both ends of the maturity range yesterday after a modestly successful auction of two-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 104 1/2 , yielding 6.768 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up 1/32 at 100, to yield 4.107 per cent. Trading was relatively subdued throughout the morning, especially at the short end of the market, as investors and dealers prepared for the afternoon sale of Dollars 16bn of two-year notes and today's auction of Dollars 11bn of five-year notes. Comments from Mr Wayne Angell, a Federal Reserve governor, had little impact on sentiment. He said the Fed was ready to tighten monetary policy if inflation revived. In his testimony before Republican members of the Congressional joint economic committee, he reiterated the importance that the Fed should 'continue to focus in all circumstances on price level stability,' but also expressed optimism on the prospects for low wage price inflation. Mr Angell's comments came just a week after May data revealed that inflation was not as threatening as investors and dealers had originally feared. In the afternoon, the auction, which met solid investor demand, passed uneventfully, although short-covering lifted prices across the board. The only economic news - the report of a 0.1 per cent rise in store sales for the third week of May - left prices unmoved.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Allies deliver ultimatum to Iraq over no-fly zone: Deadline of 48 hours for removal of missiles THE US, France and Britain delivered an ultimatum to Iraq yesterday demanding that it withdraw its anti-aircraft missiles and radar from the protective zone set up by the United Nations in the south of the country. The Gulf war allies, backed by Russia, issued their demand to Mr Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador at the United Nations, yesterday evening, insisting on the removal of the batteries within 48 hours. Iraq was told the allies would 'respond appropriately and decisively' if it failed to comply. President George Bush briefed congressional leaders on the latest battle of wills with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and White House officials said the US was considering 'various options' for enforcing the UN resolutions against Iraq. Allied officials have been in close consultations over the past 10 days since US fighters shot down an Iraqi aircraft which had encroached on the no-fly zone established by the UN in August south of the 32nd parallel to protect the Shia population. Pentagon officials said Iraq had been moving missiles along the 32nd parallel - not in itself prohibited by the UN resolutions - and 'teasing the line' by flying near or just into the the no-fly zone. They said they could not confirm any incidents of allied aircraft being 'painted', or targeted by anti-aircraft radar. Mr Bob Hall, a Defence Department spokesman, said 'painting' would be regarded as putting US pilots at risk, and would not be tolerated. 'We have made it very clear to the Iraqis that we are determined to enforce the no-fly zones, we will enforce the no-fly zones, we will do it in the safest possible way for our pilots and we will not allow them to be put at risk,' he said. Mr Hall said no significant activity had been observed in the no-fly zone established north of the 36th parallel to protect the Kurdish population. The test of wills between Iraq and the west is the latest in a sequence of confrontations since Mr Saddam capitulated to the UN's ceasefire conditions at the end of Operation Desert Storm. So far, Mr Saddam has backed down after pushing the western allies to the brink, in a pattern that US diplomats describe as 'cheat and retreat'. In April, US, French and British diplomats issued an ultimatum to Iraq's UN ambassador demanding the withdrawal of Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries from the northern no-fly zone after battery radars had 'painted' allied aircraft. In July, the allies again threatened a military strike in a showdown over Mr Saddam's refusal to allow UN weapons inspectors access to the agriculture ministry in Baghdad, believed to house documents on Iraq's ballistic missile programme. It is not clear whether the movement of missiles is an attempt to test the resolve of the incoming administration of Mr Bill Clinton.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA DESIGNERS;  </P> <P> OBJETS D'ARTISANS;  </P> <P> THE JEWELRY DESIGNS THAT ARE MAKING NEWS ARE ONE-OF-A-KIND PIECES OF MINIATURE  ART  </P> <P> THEY BEND wire, pound silver, shape gold and set diamonds. Some dig for  treasure in hardware bins and junk shops.  </P> <P> Others fashion eccentric pieces for clients who demand anonymity. All work in  isolation, developing styles free of one another's influence.  </P> <P> In converted garages, downtown lofts and back bedrooms, Southern California's  one-of-a-kind jewelry designers are creating striking and singular pieces that  are more like artwork than decoration: spear-like brooches that appear to have  washed up on shore, hand-woven silver bracelets festooned with marbles,  textured-gold hairpins resembling bridge abutments.  </P> <P> Southern California's growing passion for wearable art is reflected in thriving  galleries, enthusiastic collectors and the crowds that attend exhibits of new  work. Local jewelers' designs appear regularly on the ears, arms and bodices of  actresses such as Mary Steenburgen, Carol Kane and Susan Sarandon, according to  gallery owners.  </P> <P> "They know that I have things that are special," says Jo Wilder, owner of  Wilder Place on Melrose Avenue, a gallery featuring unique and unusual jewelry.  "They come here looking for visual candy."  </P> <P> Gallery owners agree that because the best one-of-a-kind jewelry stands as  miniature sculpture, buying it is an attractive and affordable way to collect  modern art.  </P> <P> Until recently, Southern California jewelers worked in the shadow of New York  and Northwest artists, but that is changing. Consumers with an eagerness to  embrace new ideas and money to spend have created a thriving demand for unique  jewelry.  </P> <P> "L.A. has found its style, and it's eclectic -- anything goes," says Carol  Sauvion, owner of Freehand, an innovative West 3rd Street gallery specializing  in one-of-a-kind arts and crafts.  </P> <P> Selected after interviews with dozens of jewelers, gallery owners and  collectors, the six jewelers featured here reflect the amazing diversity of  local talent. Their work ranges from sophisticated, sculptural brooches by  Valerie Mitchell and Debra Stoner to Yves Kamioner's classic gold-and-diamond  pieces.  </P> <P> Between the avant-garde and the classical lie the whimsical marble-and-glass  beaded bracelets and earrings of Diane Komater; the delicate, symbolic work of  Melissa Tucker, and the Southwest-flavored creations of Ted Cavagnaro.  </P> <P> DIANE KOMATER  </P> <P> Diane Komater, a pixie-like former painter, shuns both gold and gems. Instead,  she painstakingly wraps black or silver wire around beads and marbles to create  bracelets that are a cross between opulent religious objects and '40s kitsch.  The heavy bracelets bulge with deep-hued beads, some featuring faces or  abstract swirls.  </P> <P> "I probably have the largest marble collection in the world," says Komater with  a laugh. The 33-year-old artist works in a tidy garage behind a neighbor's  apartment building east of the Fairfax area. Komater moved from Berkeley to Los  Angeles about three years ago. She says she is not influenced by any other  jewelers and is even reluctant to hire anyone to help her, fearing their ideas  would spoil her work.  </P> <P> Beyond making the bracelets, earrings and brooches that are now selling well  enough to pay the bills, Komater dreams of being a fine artist and "creating  big, wire sculptures."  </P> <P> Lois Lambert, director of Santa Monica's Gallery of Functional Art, which sells  Komater's work, says Komater's jewelry appeals to all kinds of collectors --  "from the young and hip to the conservative."  </P> <P> Komater's bracelets sell for $200; earrings, about $65, at the Gallery of  Functional Art, 2429 Main St., Santa Monica.  </P> <P> YVES KAMIONER  </P> <P> Yves Kamioner has perfected a design signature that he calls "the crack." He  creates fissures in gold and paves the openings with tiny diamonds nestled  beneath the surface.  </P> <P> The Belgian-born third-generation jeweler recalls peeking out from behind the  curtains in his family's jewelry shop as a little boy, watching as his father  bowed to kiss the hands of royal clients.  </P> <P> Kamioner, 33, rarely kisses his clients' hands, but he willingly agrees to  create anything they wish in precious metals and stones.  </P> <P> "When my client leaves the studio, I know exactly what she has in mind," says  Kamioner, whose pristine white studio features an illuminated showcase filled  with his newest work.  </P> <P> Although he has designed 400 pieces for Tiffany and is currently working on a  line of jewelry for the new Giorgio boutique in Beverly Hills, Kamioner still  relishes the challenge of one-of-a-kind commissions.  </P> <P> In recent years, he has crafted a $34,000 miniature treasure chest filled with  precious gems; a $12,000 brooch depicting the Los Angeles skyline in gold and  diamonds, and a $100,000 gold cane encrusted with diamonds.  </P> <P> Kamioner's clients, who buy his work through the Freehand gallery, 8413 West  3rd St., include the rich and famous, who order elaborate and expensive custom  pieces, and a local judge who recently commissioned a set of elegant,  intricately designed wedding bands.  </P> <P> MELISSA TUCKER  </P> <P> Melissa Tucker, 30, a motion picture makeup artist and self-taught jeweler from  Sydney, Australia, crafts intricate pieces in sterling silver and copper. Many  pieces feature rabbits (because her parents never let her have one as a pet)  and fish, which she likes because they are "sleek and sculptural."  </P> <P> "I want people to make no mistake that my work is about making a connection  with the animals and the earth," Tucker says.  </P> <P> In addition to 14-karat gold and sterling silver, Tucker uses accents of  copper. Because she refuses to use ivory out of respect for elephants, she  substitutes a type of milky white plastic. For special clients, she creates  custom-made sculptures festooned with feathers and bits of bone and metal. The  sculptures, which she started making as gifts for friends, serve as  eye-catching brooch holders.  </P> <P> Tucker, who works in a back bedroom in a San Fernando Valley house, says some  of her work was strongly influenced by a recent trip to Australia, where she  met aboriginal elders and other representatives of tribal people.  </P> <P> Tucker's clients, who include actresses Jodie Foster and Rae Dawn Chong, buy  her work at Freehand, 8413 West 3rd St., or Wilder Place, 7975 1/2 Melrose  Ave., both in Los Angeles. Earrings cost $90 to $120, and brooches sell for  $140 to $165.  </P> <P> VALERIE MITCHELL  </P> <P> IN A downtown loft workshop that's as tidy as a medical research lab, Valerie  Mitchell creates abstract, avant-garde jewelry that's inspired by architecture  and sculptural forms as simple as a canoe. Her hair ornaments and brooches are  reminiscent of bridge abutments, and in a new line of brooches, she fills the  spaces between metal sections with lightweight cement. One unforgettable  shoulder decoration resembles a kayak and is titled "Raft."  </P> <P> "I try to apply three-dimensional, sculptural forms to my jewelry," says  Mitchell, a 34-year-old graduate of the prestigious Rhode Island School of  Design. "My work also has an artifact quality, like objects that once had a  usefulness, or things you might find in an old barn."  </P> <P> Mitchell is an expert at electroforming, a process used to create hollow metal  shapes that look heavy but feel light. She places a wax form in a chemical bath  with copper bars, then runs an electrical current through the bath, which  forces the metal to come off the bars and attach to the wax. The wax melts,  leaving a copper shell.  </P> <P> For some pieces, Mitchell treats the metal with secret mixes of raw chemicals  or enamels, creating antique-looking surfaces of henna, ocher and verdigris.  For others, Mitchell covers sterling silver with 24-karat gold vermeil.  </P> <P> She divides her energy between creating limited-edition pieces for sale in more  than 100 museums and shops and one-of-a-kind pieces for galleries and private  collectors.  </P> <P> Novelists Isabel Allende and Martin Cruz Smith are among admirers who collect  her work.  </P> <P> Mitchell's sophisticated designs command a high price, with some brooches  retailing for $600 or more. They are sold at M Gallery, 8649 Sunset Blvd., and  Sculpture to Wear, 8441 Melrose Ave., both in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> DEBRA STONER  </P> <P> DEBRA STONER, 31, crafts weathered, dangerous-looking brooches in rusted steel  and copper and primitive-looking bracelets that look as though they were found  in an archeological dig. Often she uses ivory, pottery shards or glass she  picked up on the beach.  </P> <P> Stoner, who is an artist-in-residence in the metals department of the Oregon  School of Arts and Crafts, went against the typical jeweler's evolution from  working with non-precious metals, such as copper and brass, to gold and silver.  She received a master's degree from San Diego State University's art  department, and began her career as a goldsmith and gallery manager in Davis,  Calif.  </P> <P> "I have figured out that I can work in most any material," says Stoner, who is  going back to her goldsmith roots to design a new line.  </P> <P> "The material is not really the most important thing anymore," she continues.  "It is the design."  </P> <P> Stoner's top-of-the-line brooches and bracelets, which range in price from $150  to $240, are sold through the Gallery of Functional Art, 2429 Main St., Santa  Monica.  </P> <P> TED CAVAGNARO  </P> <P> Ted Cavagnaro's silversmithing is reminiscent of the traditional, heavy silver  jewelry produced by Southwest American Indians.  </P> <P> Cavagnaro, 60, of Venice, is a self-taught artisan who adds his own flair to  the silver that he hammers and forms with tools he makes himself.  </P> <P> His simple, uncontrived belt buckles and hammered silver beads are classic  examples of the silversmith's craft.  </P> <P> Although his work has a distinct Southwestern flavor, Cavagnaro says he was  doing Southwestern-style jewelry long before the look became popular.  </P> <P> Cavagnaro fashions his silver pieces by hammering and bending, rarely soldering  anything together.  </P> <P> "Jewelry making is a series of acquired skills," says Cavagnaro, who spends  most weekdays working in a tiny annex to his garage. "I am not a skilled  draftsman or a great artist."  </P> <P> In fact, Cavagnaro was a chemical engineer and photographer before he started  melting silver coins and hammering them into various shapes about 13 years ago.  Of the hundreds of pieces he's produced, his favorite remains a sensuous strand  of hand-stamped silver beads that he made years ago and is still reluctant to  sell. His whimsical potato masher and whisk earrings are perennial favorites.  </P> <P> Most of Cavagnaro's jewelry sells for under $200 and is available from his  studio at 2241 Prospect Ave., Venice.  </P></p>

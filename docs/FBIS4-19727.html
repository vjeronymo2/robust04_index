			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 22 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe said Friday [22 April] that NATO should issue an  ultimatum to Serbs to halt their offensive against the Moslem  enclave of Gorazde or face airstrikes.    "It's the same thinking as in Sarajevo," Juppe said,  speaking  of an earlier warning by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  to bomb Bosnian Serbs if they continued to shell the Bosnian  capital.    "NATO should force compliance with the UN Security Council  decision, including issuing an ultimatum," he said.    Juppe was speaking to reporters shortly before NATO was to  meet in Brussels to discuss a possible extension of air strikes  in Bosnia in the wake of a UN Security Council resolution  calling on the Bosnian Serbs to observe a ceasefire around  Gorazde and pull their forces back from the town.</p>

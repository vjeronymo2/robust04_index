			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'COOK': GROSSNESS FROM GREAT TALENTS  </P> <P> Whenever pretentious filmmakers want to defend their excesses on the screen,  they invariably cite Shakespeare or -- better yet -- lurid Jacobean tragedy as  a whole. That's where England's Peter Greenaway found his alibi for the  repulsive "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover" (selected theaters).  </P> <P> "Jacobean drama was excited by sheer corporeality," Greenaway is quoted in the  film's attending publicity. "It took high risks with taboo, melodrama, violence  and sexual darkness. I wanted to engage in some of the excitements of  unrestricted license."  </P> <P> Unrestricted license, yes. Excitement, no. Greenaway's "Cook" is full of gross  behavior and jolting images, but its effect is not engaging, and since the film  is only occasionally amusing, it is not even cathartic. Miramax, the film's  American distributor, has refused the MPAA's X rating (the ratings board  reportedly said they wouldn't know where to suggest cutting it), and the film  is being released unrated.  </P> <P> The film doesn't even justify itself on intellectual grounds. It is pointless  self-indulgence, more likely to bore sophisticated audiences than shock or  titillate them. If Greenaway, the coldly brilliant maker of "The Draughtsman's  Contract," was exorcising some personal demons in making this film, good  riddance to some very bad demons. But audiences should know going in that  they're going to be sharing pain, not pleasure.  </P> <P> The film is deliberately theatrical, to the extent of opening and closing with  a proscenium curtain. The principal setting is an immense, posh, four-star  restaurant decorated in lush period formality in dark blood red and dominated  by a copy of Frans Hals' 1614 painting "Banquet of the Officers of the St.  George Civic Guard." The officers' uniforms in turn have inspired the outfits  of the restaurant's most regular customers, the Thief (Michael Gambon) and his  henchman.  </P> <P> At least Greenaway lets us know what we're in for as soon as he draws aside the  curtain to reveal a couple of trucks filled with garbage flanking the  restaurant's entrance -- and attracting a pack of howling dogs. An unfortunate  man in debt to the Thief has been stripped and smeared with excrement; as a  final touch, the Thief urinates on him before proceeding into the restaurant  for an evening of serious gluttony. (Had enough? The last reel introduces  cannibalism.)  </P> <P> Sadist, bully and boor, the Thief revels in endless talk about bodily functions  at the top of his voice and in physically abusing his companions. Soon, his  browbeaten Wife (Helen Mirren, working nude or in her knickers throughout most  of the film) becomes attracted to a pleasant-looking man (Alan Howard) dining  alone with his stack of books. He becomes her Lover and, between courses, the  couple slip off to the restroom or the kitchen, where the Wife shows as grand  an appetite for sex as the Thief has for food.  </P> <P> Eventually, the Wife and her Lover are discovered and, with the Thief and his  thugs in pursuit, they go into hiding.  </P> <P> What is the symbolism of all this gluttony, and what does its Grand Guignol  consequences tell us about human nature that we do not already know? Greenaway  has said that his film can be seen as "a morality tale about greed" and that he  has "tried very hard with this film to make the violence solid and serious and  adult so that it cannot be avoided" in comparison to the "deodorized and  sanitized" violence of most movies.  </P> <P> Yet how puny are Greenaway's grotesque, patently fake tableaux in comparison to  the horrors chronicled in countless Holocaust documentaries. So much balderdash  in defense of so much balderdash.  </P> <P> What is disturbing about the film is not what we hear or see but rather that it  is so clearly the work of an important and original talent performed  masterfully by a first-rate cast and realized by such greatly gifted  contributors as cinematographer Sacha Vierny, production designers Ben Van Os  and Jan Roelfs, costume designer Jean-Paul Gaultier and composer Michael Nyman  (whose weirdly insistent score is a match for Vierny's ominous images).  </P> <P> Greenaway is a man of distinctive ideas and insights who this time out has  expended his abilities and perceptions -- and those of many others -- on an  exercise in grossness that depresses rather than enlarges the human spirit.  "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover" (Times-rated mature) is  sensational, all right, but hardly entertaining.  </P></p>

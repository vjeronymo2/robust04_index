			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Ford incurs pre-tax loss of Pounds 353m in UK FORD of Britain, the leading vehicle maker in the UK, suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 353m last year, its second successive loss in its core Ford car and light commercial vehicle operations. The Ford parent company has been forced to pump in Pounds 330m in new equity to shore up the balance sheet of the UK subsidiary in the face of continuing heavy losses. The UK operation was hit last year by a further decline in car sales, forced production cuts, and heavy marketing and restructuring costs as well as exchange rate losses of about Pounds 100m. The company remained in loss in the first quarter of this year and it warned yesterday that it was uncertain whether it would return to profit in 1993. Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain chairman since January 1 last year, has been forced to take a sharp cut in pay compared with his predecessor. He earned Pounds 94,129 last year according to the Ford of Britain annual report published yesterday. Mr Derek Barron, his predecessor earned Pounds 158,454 in 1991 and Pounds 214,086 in 1990. Ford of Britain's board has been streamlined and cut from 10 to six members. The outlook for a return to profit in 1993 has deteriorated in the face of the steep decline in new vehicle demand in continental Europe in the first four months this year, Mr Bill Brooks, finance director said yesterday. About 41 per cent of vehicles from Ford's UK assembly plants were exported last year. Ford of Britain still expected to achieve a substantial financial improvement this year after two years of heavy losses, Mr Brooks said. The parent company's injection of Pounds 330m in new equity into Ford of Britain last year follows its provision of Pounds 390m of new capital in 1991 - Pounds 100m in new equity and Pounds 290m through the transfer, at an inflated price, of the ownership of Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, from Ford of Britain direct to the US parent. Ford of Britain made losses of Pounds 935m in 1991 and Pounds 274m in 1990 however these were heavily influenced by losses from Jaguar. Excluding these, Ford of Britain incurred a loss of Pounds 487m in 1991 and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 61m in 1990, on a comparable basis with last year's pre-tax loss of Pounds 353m. This figure included a Pounds 68m restructuring charge for redundancies. Details, Page 25</p>

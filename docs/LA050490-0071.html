			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DISTRICT WINS PRELIMINARY FUNDING OK FOR 2  SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Los Angeles school district officials seeking land for desperately needed  classroom space are making plans to build elementary schools over a county  flood control channel in Arleta and in a section of Exposition Park.  </P> <P> The proposed schools would incorporate state-of-the-art technology, such as the  replacement of student desks with computer stations, said school district  facilities planner Philippe Yancey-Piens.  </P> <P> The school district has won preliminary approval from the state Allocation  Board for its application to receive special construction funds to pay for the  two new schools, district officials said. But carrying out the plans is  contingent on the availability of the land in Arleta and the approval of the  museum's board at the Exposition Park site.  </P></p>

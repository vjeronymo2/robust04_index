			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Observer: Twin feats Not just one, but two feathers in its cap can be claimed by the outplacement consultancy, Coutts, a subsidiary of the DC Gardner Group. The first - helping to find new jobs for about 1,400 ex-employees of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International - is a fair feat in itself, considering that no less than former CIA director Robert Gates publicly rechristened BCCI 'the Bank of Crooks and Criminals International'. But the second achievement is surely greater. According to DC Gardner's chairman, Sir Kit McMahon, Coutts has been paid in full for the work by Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan - which is more than can be claimed by most of BCCI's disgruntled creditors.</p>

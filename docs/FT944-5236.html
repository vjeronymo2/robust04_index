			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / This Week: FT Guide to World Trade Organisation Why is the WTO being created? To strengthen management of the world trade system and global economic integration. The WTO will have a more formal structure, bigger powers and a wider remit than the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has operated on a 'provisional' basis since its inception in 1947. WTO members must also accept all the organisation's provisions, whereas Gatt allows countries not to subscribe to some of its agreements. How many countries will belong to the WTO? All Gatt's 124 members, once they have ratified the Uruguay Round world trade agreement. More than 20 other countries want to join, including China, Russia, Taiwan, Ukraine and Vietnam. Who will head the WTO? Gatt members are supposed to choose this week between three candidates: former Mexican president Carlos Salinas, former Italian trade minister Renato Ruggiero and South Korean trade minister Kim Chul-su. However, political wrangling may delay a decision until next year. In that event, Peter Sutherland, Gatt's outgoing director-general, might stay on as a temporary caretaker. How much will it cost to run? A SFr105m budget is proposed for next year, a small rise on the current budget of the Gatt secretariat, whose roughly 400 employees will staff the WTO. Gatt is lean compared with other international bodies, and most governments want the WTO to stay that way. That is one reason why they decided recently to keep it out of the clutches of the United Nations. What will the WTO do? Its immediate priorities will be to implement the Uruguay Round agreements and complete outstanding negotiations on issues such as liberalising trade in services. Its longer-term agenda may include the treatment of foreign investment and links between trade and environment, competition policy and possibly labour standards. These are all complex and politically controversial subjects, which impinge directly on countries' domestic policies. How will it take decisions? Like Gatt, the WTO plans to operate by consensus. However, this may become harder as the centre of global economic gravity continues to shift from the US and Europe, which have traditionally held sway in Gatt, towards developing countries, notably in Asia. China's entry, in particular, is expected to have a far-reaching impact on the WTO. What new powers will the WTO have to enforce international rules? It will have stronger and speedier mechanisms for settling international trade disputes. An important innovation is that WTO dispute panels' rulings will apply unless there is a consensus to reject them - the reverse of Gatt practice. So US critics are right to say that control over national trade policies is being handed to faceless bureaucrats? No more so than under Gatt. The WTO cannot compel members to accept rulings they disagree with, though it can authorise other countries to retaliate in such cases. Disputes panels' authority will depend heavily on establishing confidence in their fairness, integrity and judicial rigour. In any case, WTO members are free to withdraw from the body at six months' notice. Will WTO members still be able to resort to unilateral trade measures? The US and the EU say they reserve the right unilaterally to press for concessions from countries which are not WTO members, or in areas where there are no clear WTO rules. Will there ever be any more big world trade rounds? No one is sure. Exhausted by the eight-year Uruguay Round marathon, many Gatt members hope the WTO will end such ordeals by developing into a permanent negotiating forum. But some think it may be hard to make big breakthroughs without the political momentum and scope for trade-offs which omnibus rounds generate. What will happen to Gatt? It will continue temporarily, but governments are expected to agree soon on a deadline for winding it up after the WTO gets into its stride.</p>

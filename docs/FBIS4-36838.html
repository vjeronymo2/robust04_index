			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 14, IRNA -- A morning daily here  Tuesday wrote that the fresh Amman-Tel Aviv agreement to iron  out differences has been inked upon the U.S. pressure on Jordan.    `TEHRAN TIMES' said in its editorial that apparently Jordan  has been spurred by the recent U.S. Congress decision to grant a  financial aid to Israel and by the U.S. white charter to lift  economic sanction clamped on Israel.    "Obviously, the U.S. is determined to resolve the problems  and challenges it faces in the Middle East before stepping into  the next century," said the paper. This is of paramount  significance for the U.S. in view of the fact that Europe, in a  centrifugal move, created propitious ground to gain independence  from the U.S. in the post cold war epoch. Now the U.S. strives  to establish absolute sway over the Middle East in a drive to  recompense for having lost its grip on Europe, the article noted.    "In tune with this strategy, Washington has hastily embarked  upon accelerating the domino effect of compromise in the Middle  East," it said, adding "Washington fails to realize that such  strategies serve only as tranquilizer rather than remedies for  U.S. allies in the region."    Stressing that the Middle East problems can be solved  through the concerted efforts of all regional peoples, the paper  concluded by saying that Israel has never been able to conceal  its true face in the Middle East's political scene no matter  what mask it has worn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin welcomes Boris  Yeltsin's decree on urgent measures to protect the population  from banditry and other organized crimes as a vitally important  act. He told journalists on Saturday evening that many  countries had resorted to similar or even tougher measures. As  an example, he referred to the program proposed by Roosevelt,  which allowed the U.S. to pull itself out of the Depression and  fight crime.    He noted, however, that if Yeltsin had submitted a draft law  on amending and enlarging Russia's Criminal Code a day before  the decree was passed, there would not have been any friction  between the president and the State Duma.    He said that although a decree implies immediate  implementation, the Criminal Code might also be amended very  quickly.</p>

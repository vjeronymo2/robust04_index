			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Letter: The best of reasons Sir, I am sure than Mr Brian McEvoy (Letters, July 11) and your readers will wish to know the real reason for the extended journey time for trains from Bristol Parkway to London. He is wrong in claiming that the changes are designed to help us meet the Passenger's Charter targets. The few extra minutes allowed in the summer timetable reflect the delays arising from the temporary reduction in the number of tracks available on the approach to Paddington station, made necessary by the scheme completely to replace track and signalling. This Pounds 40m-plus project will improvement reliability and speed and open the way for a new generation of services, including the Heathrow Express electric trains. The slightly longer journey time is for the best reasons - the long term benefit of passengers. We intend to reinstate the shorter journey time next year.

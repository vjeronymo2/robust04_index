			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Netherlands boasts cut in deficit THE Netherlands boasted yesterday that it was one of the few countries managing to put its state finances in order despite the international slowdown in economic growth, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. Unveiling its budget for 1993, the centre-left government of Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers said that the state's financing deficit was expected to fall to 3.75 per cent of net national income - or about 3.4 per cent of gross domestic product - ' from an expected 4.25 per cent in 1992. This puts the Dutch government on target for meeting the deficit-cutting goals formulated when it took office in late 1989. In absolute terms, the total financing deficit for 1993 is projected at Fl 47.4bn (Pounds 15bn), down only slightly from Fl 47.9bn in 1992. However, in terms of net national income, the decline is larger because the Central Planning Office yesterday forecast that GDP would rise by 2.25 per cent next year compared with 1.75 per cent in 1992.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> WORKING OFF THEIR CRIMES;  </P> <P> SENTENCES: INSTEAD OF SITTING IN JAIL, AT A COST TO TAXPAYERS ESTIMATED AT $70  A DAY, OFFENDERS PAY TO LABOR OUTDOORS FOR A VARIETY OF AGENCIES.  </P> <P> Scores of people are paying Ventura County $12 apiece today for the chance to  pull weeds, rake sewage sludge, clear ditches or pluck litter from roadsides.  </P> <P> They say it beats jail.  </P> <P> "Two hours in that holding cell was enough for me," said John MacFarlane, 28,  recalling his arrest on a reckless-driving charge that led to his conviction  and a 20-day jail sentence.  </P> <P> Like most of the 300 or so minor offenders who enter the program each month,  MacFarlane chose work release over jail. An X-ray technician, he gets to spend  nights at home, do his time according to his own schedule, work outdoors and --  as he put it -- "do something constructive."  </P> <P> The county and other public agencies, meanwhile, get cheap labor and save jail  space for serious offenders.  </P> <P> "I personally believe that misdemeanants are the largest untapped resource in  our society," said Tom McCarthy, who supervises the program. Instead of sitting  in jail, at a cost to taxpayers estimated at $70 a day, inmates work for  agencies such as Ventura County, Caltrans, the city of Ventura, the state  Department of Parks and Recreation and several school districts.  </P> <P> "It's hard to gauge how much this saves taxpayers, because a lot of it is work  that otherwise wouldn't be done," said Richard Humeston, division manager for  the county's Corrections Services Agency.  </P> <P> Ventura County government is the largest user of the program, with about 4,000  man-hours a month, or the equivalent of 24 full-time employees to clean  drainage ditches, clear brush from hillsides and landscape county buildings,  among other things. The California Department of Transportation is next with  3,000 man-hours, mostly devoted to picking up litter on weekends.  </P> <P> Before the program began two years ago, a lot of landscaping went undone, said  Kathleen Van Norman, personnel officer for the county's General Services  Agency. "Little things like raking, we could do only when we had a moment," she  said. "Now we can schedule it regularly. I think the improvement is obvious."  </P> <P> Officials stress that the intent is not to take away anybody's job, and Van  Norman said she hasn't heard any complaints from fellow employees at the County  Government Center. "In fact, they are all very anxious for this place to look  good," she said. "Now they can do more important things."  </P> <P> The Conejo Valley Unified School District started using the program three  months ago at a number of schools. Supt. William R. Seaver said that officials  are very pleased and that some of the work will save the district a lot of  money.  </P> <P> "We have a large ditch at Newbury Park High that they're keeping debris out  of," Seaver said. "We had to spend $70,000 a few years ago to clean it out."  </P> <P> Conejo Valley and other agencies that rely on the county to transport and  supervise the inmates have to pay $18 per person per day. County government  agencies and Caltrans, which provides vans and supervisors, pay nothing.  </P> <P> Ventura County judges have authorized greater and greater use of work release  in the past two years, Humeston said, with about 300 people entering the  program each month. Even so, he said, "public agencies are waiting in line to  get this labor." He said he expects more inmates to become available as the  county struggles with jail overcrowding.  </P> <P> The county considers work release a break-even program. The $12 daily fee that  inmates pay covers administrative costs. Occasionally, the fee is waived for  someone who cannot afford the fee but who meets the program's qualifications --  basically, a sentence of less than 30 days for a nonviolent crime, McCarthy  said.  </P> <P> Most participants have been sentenced to less than 10 days for offenses such as  drunk driving, petty theft, probation violations or failure to appear on a  traffic citation. About 80% are men.  </P> <P> "They're very decent people who made a mistake," said Joan Stokesbary, a  corrections employee who was supervising workers at the Santa Clara Landfill  near Oxnard one day this week.  </P> <P> That's how Donna Manning described her theft of three cartons of cigarettes  from a Vons store -- a first offense that got her 12 days and a trip to the  dump for weed-raking duty.  </P> <P> "It was the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life," Manning said of her  crime. "I don't know what possessed me."  </P> <P> Although Manning, who lives in Oxnard, would "rather be having coffee at home,"  she said the work-release supervisors treat her well. At 58, Manning was the  oldest of the people working at the landfill that day, and supervisors said  they treated her accordingly.  </P> <P> "This is not like a chain gang busting up rocks," supervisor Richard Berlin  said.  </P> <P> Manning is doing her time one day a week. She and other participants said they  like that flexibility.  </P> <P> "There's no way I could go to jail," said Tom Militello of Thousand Oaks, who  was sentenced to 11 days for a probation violation. "I'd have lost my  business."  </P> <P> Instead, Militello, 27, does his time two days a week and takes care of his  landscaping accounts on the other days. On Tuesday, he planned to go from  raking the landfill to tending his customers' yards.  </P> <P> The program operates seven days a week, with up to 50 people on weekdays and  more than 100 on Saturdays and Sundays. Participants have no say in where they  are assigned. They show up at the program's office at the Camarillo Airport at  8 a.m., and after a review of the rules they head off to their work sites, 10  to a van plus a supervisor. Workers get two 15-minute breaks and half an hour  for lunch, which they must bring from home.  </P> <P> Officials said they emphasize safety by issuing written rules and reminding  workers of them each morning. Until recently, nobody in the county program had  been seriously injured. On Sunday, however, Amadita Ramirez of Santa Paula was  hit by an out-of-control van while picking up litter along a Ventura Freeway  on-ramp. She had a punctured lung and other injuries.  </P> <P> Unlike offenders who are ordered to do community service -- which can be  fulfilled a number of ways, without manual labor -- participants in work  release have been sentenced to jail. They simply have the option of working  instead.  </P> <P> Sometimes people don't feel like working. "I had a guy who told me it was too  hot to work," McCarthy recalled. "I 'cuffed him and took him to jail."  </P> <P> But officials said most participants have good attitudes.  </P> <P> "You have to get rid of the anger before you come here," said MacFarlane, the  X-ray technician convicted of reckless driving.  </P> <P> "I had three speeding tickets before that," he said, as he broke up dirt clods  with a dusty rake. "I thought I was above the law."  </P></p>

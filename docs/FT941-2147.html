			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Green light close for Brazilian gas bonanza Within the next couple of weeks, Royal Dutch Shell will sign an agreement with the Peruvian government that is expected to lead to the development of the huge Camisea natural gas fields discovered by the company in 1986. Earlier attempts to sign an exploitation contract under the left-of-centre Alan Garcia regime foundered for political reasons. Now, with a new hydrocarbons law in place, a liberal economic regime and renewed investor confidence, the chances of real agreement look bright. Development of Camisea - located in the south-eastern jungle in Cuzco department - will increase Peru's current reserves position almost sevenfold. 'Our interest in developing Camisea has never lapsed,' said Mr John Auger, Shell's representative in Lima, at the weekend. Under the new agreement, Shell - together with Peruvian experts - will carry out a feasibility study, expected to take some fourteen months. By late May 1995, the company should be negotiating a development contract which, in turn, should be signed by December 1995. Camisea is Peru's biggest ever find and, when developed, will represent the largest single investment in the country's history. Probable reserves amount to 11 trillion (million million) cubic feet, or the equivalent of 1.7bn barrels of oil. In addition, according to Mr Auger, the three deposits in the Camisea field already identified contain some 500m recoverable barrels of liquid petroleum gas. 'And there's the possibility of finding yet more in the same area,' said Mr Auger. Development of Camisea has become a matter of some urgency for Peru. For lack of exploration over the past decade, oil reserves have slumped to about 350m barrels and the country has been forced to import some of its light crude requirements. The national electricity deficit is variously estimated at between 300MW and 500MW. One of the options Shell will be considering is the installation either in Lima or in the Camisea area of thermal power stations to generate electricity from Camisea's gas. Another option is to lay a gas pipeline hundreds of miles across the Andes to Lima. If eventually built, this would be the highest in the world. Mr Auger was reluctant to speculate on the scale of possible future investment, although earlier studies would indicate something between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 2bn. In the 1980s, Shell invested over Dollars 200m in initial exploration work. It seems likely that it will seek consortium partners for Camisea's eventual development.</p>

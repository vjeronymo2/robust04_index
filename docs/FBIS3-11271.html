			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Colombian Minister of Mines and Energy Guido Nule  reiterated the decision of the Colombian Government to sell  15,000 to 20,000 barrels of oil daily to Cuba as agreed during a  recent visit by Nule to Havana. Nule stated: The deal stands,  and the only thing missing is for Cuba to present the  corresponding guarantees because we are talking about a business  deal as any other where there is a buyer and a seller.    Minister Nule pointed out that Colombia sells oil to anyone  who pays for the oil in cash and at international prices. Nule  dismissed threats by Cuban emigre extremists in Miami, who  threatened to boycott Colombian products in the United States in  retaliation for selling oil to Cuba.</p>

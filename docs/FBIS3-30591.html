			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jozef Belcak, economic and commercial </F> counselor at the Slovak Embassy in Warsaw, by correspondent Jan  Bereza; place and date not given]    [Text] [Bereza] What changes took place in Polish-Slovak  trade relations after the creation of an independent Slovak  Republic?    [Belcak] In past years our cooperation was conducted within  the framework of the CEMA bloc. The decline in foreign trade  turnover during the period of transformation of a centrally  steered economy into a free market system is a phenomenon that  is not exclusive to our countries. It is found throughout  Central and Eastern Europe as a consequence of developments that  extended far beyond the creation of two independent states: the  Czech Republic and Slovakia. The value of trade exchange  between Poland and Slovakia fell from $397 million in 1991 to  less than $228 million in 1992. In the first quarter of 1993  the value of exports from Slovakia to Poland was $23 million,  while that of imports from Poland to Slovakia was $15.4 million.  The current state of affairs in this field was the subject of  talks between our respective deputy premiers in July last year.  During the current visit [to Poland by Slovak President Kovac]  we aim to attach much importance to economic questions. This is  evidenced, among other things, by the personal composition of  the Slovak delegation, which includes the chairman of the Slovak  Industry and Commerce Chamber, the Minister of the Economy, and  representatives of 11 individual companies. The schedule of the  visit includes a meeting between President Michal Kovac and  Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, chairperson of the Polish National  Bank. President Kovac will also meet with Polish businessmen,  while yet another meeting at the Ministry of Industry and  Commerce will be attended by ministers-heads of the following  departments: Foreign Economic Cooperation, Transport and  Maritime Economy, and the Central Planning Office.    [Bereza] What are the reasons responsible for the poor  condition of Polish-Slovak economic cooperation to date?    [Belcak] I believe that the main reason is the lack of  efficient exchange of information concerning our respective  cooperation potential. We often import goods from distant  places which we could easily be buying from one another--and  that would involve lower transportation costs. We should not  forget, either, that in certain parts of both Poland and  Slovakia it is much easier to transport goods from across the  Carpathian mountains than to carry them in from the more distant  parts of our own respective countries. We share a very long  stretch of state border--altogether 520 km--but there are only  three border crossings along its entire length that have been  adapted to cargo transportation. We should be offered more  favorable terms of mutual trade exchange within the framework of  the Visegrad Group and the GATT agreement. The present terms of  our mutual trade exchange cannot possibly be viewed as  satisfactory by either side. I hope that the trade turnover  between Poland and Slovakia will double its value within the  next two to three years.    [Bereza] How does Slovakia encourage potential foreign  investors to invest their capital within its borders?    [Belcak] We offer a variety of incentives and preferential  terms to foreign investors because we need their capital to make  good use of our existing industrial enterprises and our highly  trained professional cadres. To give you an example, in the  parish of Banska Bystrica a bank with an input of foreign  capital is entitled to a longer tax holiday than banks in other  regions of the country. These matters are regulated centrally  by means of parliamentary acts. For the time being, according  to data for the first half of 1993, the value of foreign capital  invested in Slovakia came to $320.4 million. The highest share  in that amount is represented by Austrian investors (25.8  percent); these are followed by Germans (18.2 percent),  Americans (14.5 percent), Czechs (12 percent), and French  (upward of 9 percent).    [Bereza] What can be done to enable Poles to join that  group of leading investors? Following the announcement that  interest rates will be raised in Poland, some businessmen are  beginning to consider moving their companies to your country.    [Belcak] There is extensive unused potential in many areas  of our economy: not only in industry but also in agriculture  and the food economy. Work is currently in progress on setting  up a joint Polish-Slovak chamber of industry and commerce, to be  situated in Krakow, a city close to the Slovak border and also  easily reached from other regions of Poland. Dynamic  involvement on the part of specific enterprises is essential if  we are to develop effective cooperation between corresponding  economic entities in both countries. We see much evidence of  individual companies' interest in such cooperation as we answer  some 20-30 telephone requests for information on the subject  every day.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Zvornik, Bratunac, 19 Apr (TANJUG) -- Muslim  attacks and armed provocations against the republic of Srpska  (RS) were evidently less intense and widespread today in  comparison with the situation in recent days, a TANJUG reporter  has found out from republic of Srpska army sources. The same  sources interpret this as a consequence of direct activities by  the international Contact Group, which held talks in Sarajevo  yesterday with representatives of the Muslim leaderhip. Reasons  for the reduced level of combat activity by the Muslim units lie  in the international efforts to bring about a four-month  cease-fire, something which had been demanded by the Muslim  leadership in Sarajevo, Serbian military sources point out. This  is explained by the need to provide a let-up for the Muslim  formations, which also gives them enough time to prepare new  wider attacks against the RS, some of which are already under  way.    Serbian military sources say that republic of Srpska army  units yesterday completely crushed an extremely strong two-day  attack by the Muslim artillery and infantry units, mainly on the  Mackov Vrh-Javorak-Neokrinje line in the Vlasic area.

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Japan's new ship charts a vague course: First political party in 40 years is big on pzazz and short on ideas Japan's biggest new political party in nearly four decades, the New Frontier party, adopted a nautical identity for its launch at the port city of Yokohama on Saturday, but charted only a vague course. Thousands of curious party supporters filed into the convention hall to face a cardboard sail suspended above the podium. They were handed canvas pouches marked 'my bag, my party' and imprinted with an eight-spoked ship's wheel. A stirring inaugural poem spoke of fixing Japan's broken compass and all rowing together. Later, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who masterminded the party's creation, pledged to do his best at the start of this long voyage. The NFP has promised to shake up the old political system, dominated by party factions, and to make parties more responsive to voters' aspirations. Yet its audience was left with a suspicion that the NFP was straining to define newness. The NFP provides the first serious opposition to the conservative Liberal Democratic party, which has governed Japan for all but one of the past 39 years. The new party, the result of the merger of nine small opposition parties, also simplifies Japan's previously fragmented opposition politics. But what the NFP really stands for is unlikely to make waves among voters. The NFP's policy document promises 'ceaseless reform and responsible politics, aimed at bringing about a Japan that is free and wide open to the world'. Other policies include working for world peace, a 'lively welfare society', better education and a party in which all citizens can participate. This blandness may be unavoidable, given the need to bring on board all members of a heterogeneous crew, from religious right, through mild conservative, to social democrat. They need to unite to survive a new electoral system which takes effect on December 25 and favours large, well-organised parties over small ones. So policy is, for the time being, secondary. Yet the platform confirms that the NFP will find it hard to differentiate itself from the ruling LDP. Mr Kazuo Shii, secretary general of the Japan Communist party, the only opposition group not to have joined the NFP crew, argued yesterday that the new party merely confirmed the division of the LDP over the past 18 months into two blocks. One is the NFP - former LDP members supported by Buddhists; the second is the existing LDP, kept in power by the Socialist party. Certainly, the new party's leadership will be familiar to followers of old-style politics. Mr Toshiki Kaifu, NFP president, and Mr Ozawa, his number two, have worked together as LDP prime minister and secretary general respectively, when they helped the LDP to victory in the 1990 general election. Over the weekend, Mr Kaifu showed no rush to oust his former LDP colleagues, pledging to work with the government, so long as it 'moves towards the creation of a good society.' The other challenge facing Mr Kaifu is to assert his own leadership. He used to be taunted by the press as LDP prime minister for being a 'remote control' leader, allegedly directed by Mr Noboru Takeshita, then in charge of the LDP's strongest faction. In one of his first joint television interviews with Mr Ozawa since becoming NFP leader, Mr Kaifu had to tick off the interviewer for addressing questions first to Mr Ozawa. The big question now is whether Mr Kaifu will be able to assert himself and so lend the NFP a vote-winning identity.</p>

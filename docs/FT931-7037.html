			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Arts: Romantic views of nature - Susan Moore admires the landscapes of JC Dahl Johann Christian Dahl's heroic landscapes, of thundering waterfalls and mountains majestically rising under brooding skies, established him as a leading Romantic painter and the founding father of the Norwegian school. In carefully orchestrated canvases such as the 9ft-wide 'View of Stalheim', it seems as if the gentler natural dramas of Ruisdael and Everdingen have been transferred to the untamed North. 'A landscape must not only show a particular country or region, it must also represent the character of this country,' he wrote in 1841: 'It must speak to the sensitive beholder in a poetic way.' What we find in an imaginative loan exhibition opening at the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester, is the more intimate work of Dahl and his protege Thomas Fearnley. Their oil sketches, watercolours and drawings are little known outside Scandinavia, but they are immediately familiar. For Dahl and Fearnley are revealed to belong to that mainstream of early 19th century European painters - from Constable in England to Corot in France and Dillis in Munich - who sought truth in Nature by scrutinising and recording her often fleeting effects in the open air. This relatively modest show triumphantly places another piece into the still unfinished jigsaw of European naturalism. At a time when nationalistic impulses prompted most European landscape painters to focus their attention on their native land, Dahl was obliged to go into artistic exile. Although recently freed from Danish control, Norway had no formalised system of art education and no means of providing a living for an ambitious artist. Copenhagen, the cultural capital of Northern Europe, was an obvious first stop, a Wanderjahre in Italy essential. Dahl was to settle finally in Dresden, becoming an intimate of Caspar David Friedrich. He returned to Norway only five times, making study trips that resulted in the earliest paintings of the country's most remote and dramatic regions. He appears to have painted outdoors almost from the start. 'View near Presto' of 1816 - which he described as a 'study from nature' - seems an attempt to reconcile the landscape style of the Dutch masters with the new directness of the widely admired plein-air oil studies sent back from Paris and Rome by the Danish master CW Eckersberg. The precise handling of the foreground vegetation is echoed in the careful, scrupulously observed graphite and wash drawings here of rocks, trees and boats. It is the experience of Italy, of working in oils directly before Nature in the time-honoured tradition of the resident foreign artists, which seems to have liberated Dahl's art. Faced with the heat-hazy panorama across the Bay of Naples, for instance, he instinctively lightens his palette and improvises with his brush in an attempt to seize the limpid atmospheric effects. In a prospect of Ischia his fluid touch is assured. The unusual 'Scene from the Villa Malta' in Rome shows this ever-changing artist harking back to the classical lucidity and heightened colour of the Italian oil studies of de Valenciennes and Thomas Jones. For all his directness, Dahl cannot resist introducing favoured Romantic devices. We are encouraged to take a subjective view of nature either by looking through open windows or through the eyes of isolated foreground figures who stand, backs towards us, silhouetted against the gloaming. Dahl may not invest his landscape motifs with symbolic meaning like Friedrich, but it is tempting none the less to detect a reverence in the face of God's creation - and some significance in, say, his decision to record the salvos of cannon shot fired at dawn on Easter Day. No one could dispute the immediacy or the emotive power of the astonishing small moonscapes and cloud studies painted in and around Dresden. These alone make the exhibition a must. The latter beg comparison with the closely observed skies of Constable, 14 years his senior. Revealingly, Constable - like Turner - applied the lessons learnt in the field to the working practices of the studio and in so doing developed an entirely new and dynamic pictorial language. For Dahl and the majority of the early 19th century plein-air painters, oil sketching remained an entirely independent activity, a personal response to nature painted for its own sake. The even less known and more peripatetic Thomas Fearnley, the grandson of a Yorkshire merchant's representative who settled in Norway, proves a markedly different artistic personality. His works are confident, deliberately monumental and theatrically Sublime - he is another Francis Danby of Romantic art. Dahl dubbed him the 'Professor of Effect Landscape Painting'. His oil studies are none the less joyous, remarkably facile, sumptuously rich and freely painted. A visit to the show amply reveals why Dahl advised the Nasjonalgalleriat in Oslo to buy these nature studies rather than the finished paintings. 'Nature's Way: Romantic landscapes from Norway' continues at the Whitworth Art Gallery, University of Manchester, until March 27, and shows at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, April 20-June 20</p>

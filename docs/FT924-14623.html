			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz car sales fall 7% MERCEDES-BENZ car sales worldwide in the first nine months of the year fell by 7 per cent to 397,000, the company said yesterday. The turnover of the car operations rose, however, by around 3.5 per cent, or DM1bn (Dollars 700m), to DM30bn thanks to higher sales of Mercedes-Benz's top-of-the-range S-Class luxury car, which is in its first full sales year worldwide. Mercedes-Benz car sales in Germany have dropped by 18 per cent in the first nine months this year to 176,000. The company is being affected by falling demand for its smaller 190 series, which will be replaced by a new generation model early next year. For the first time, Mercedes-Benz is expected be out-sold in western Europe this year by BMW, its arch-rival. Mercedes-Benz forecast that its retail car sales would regain some lost ground in the final quarter, however, and for the full year would total around 550,000 worldwide, a drop of less than 1 per cent from 554,000 in 1991. Sales in western Europe (excluding Germany) fell by 4 per cent in the first nine months to 114,000, with declines in Italy and France but a rise of 7.7 per cent in the UK. Sales in the US rose by 9 per cent to 47,600, helped by increased leasing sales. Mercedes-Benz car sales in the Far East (excluding Japan) have jumped by 65 per cent in the first nine months to 15,000. Sales for the full year in the region are expected to total 20,000, and the company expects to double this total by the mid-1990s. Mr Jurgen Hubbert, managing director of the Mercedes-Benz car division, said yesterday that the company had no immediate plans to raise its car prices in the UK in the wake of the devaluation of the pound against the D-Mark, as its sales revenues were largely hedged until the end of the year. The company has already raised its prices by an average of 5 per cent in Spain, and other German carmakers such as Volkswagen and BMW have also raised their prices in Italy. Volkswagen is expected to be the first German carmaker to raise its list prices in the UK, with an increase of just under 5 per cent. Mr Hubbert said Mercedes-Benz had increased investment in its car operations by around 10 per cent this year to more than DM2.6bn. Investment would total some DM13bn in the next five years, most importantly for the development of new products. He claimed that productivity in the final assembly operations of its new Rastatt car plant had been increased by 20 per cent, compared with the company's existing plants at Sindelfingen and Bremen. Of the 10,500 jobs being cut by Mercedes-Benz in Germany this year, some 6,500 are being shed by the group's car operations and 4,000 from the commercial vehicles business, he said.</p>

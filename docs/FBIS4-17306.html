			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Kartashkov report: "Marriages of Convenience. </F> Special Services Reach Agreement"]    [Text] The Russian president's Security Service and the  Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] signed an agreement on  cooperation 20 April.    To all appearances, the agreement is a provisional measure.  Cooperation between Russian secret services has always been  based on oral agreements between "cloak and dagger knights,"  which has often caused conflicts over trifles. Despite all  reorganizations, the FCS, which was proclaimed the legal  successor to the Russian Security Ministry, still has the most  extensive logistic base, which any former KGB department would  be eager to use. As a matter of fact, the FCS budget includes  money for logistic support, medical service, and training for  all other special services.    First of all, the Security Service and the FCS agreed to  cooperate and to exchange information on terrorism "instigated  and carried out by foreign special services" and "aimed against  the Russian Federation president and the state's security." And  also on "unconventional forms of operations...by foreign special  services" (the conventional forms include recruitment and  technical intelligence, while the unconventional ones are  exemplified by the hullabaloo over "red mercury"). To this end,  the Security Service and the FCS undertook certain obligations.  The FCS will help the presidential security service to screen  those suspected of conspiring to carry out terrorist acts and to  organize certain operational-technical (bugging, hidden video  filming) and operational-search measures. In addition, the FCS  will take part in the search for "means of technical penetration  into Security Service facilities" and help the Security Service  train its personnel in its educational and training  institutions. The Security Service will be able to use the FCS  library and computerized data bases free of charge.    The Security Service's obligations are much more modest --  first of all it must inform the FCS about persons who are  reported to harbor "criminal intentions." A separate paragraph  stipulates that when receiving compromising information about  any FCS member the Security Service is obliged to pass this  information to Lubyanka. The FCS, however, does not have to hand  over to the Security Service information about presidential  bodyguards suspected of committing a crime, because the Chekists  deal with corrupt officials ex officio.    The agreement is not limited in time, but any of the  contracting parties may abrogate it by sending a written notice.  This confirms that the creation of a community of Russian  special services under the president's aegis is still possible.  For the time being, however, the special services prefer to  conclude agreements between themselves. A week ago, the FCS  signed a similar agreement on cooperation with the Russian  Foreign Intelligence Service.</p>

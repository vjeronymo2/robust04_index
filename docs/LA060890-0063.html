			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST LADY'S SPEECH  </P> <P> I have never actually had much interest in Barbara Bush but her refreshing  speech at Wellesley College's commencement really impressed me (Part A, June  2).  </P> <P> As a university student, she reassures me that my values are set straight. She  emphasizes her desire for women in the '90s to help create a better society.  Also, she speaks of her passion for life (which shines through in this vital  speech). But most of all, she urges the need for compassion for one another. I  would be quite fortunate to follow in her footsteps. There is, after all, a  heart in the White House.  </P> <P> RANIA NAGULB  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton  </P></p>

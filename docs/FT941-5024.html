			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Venezuelan taxes to be reformed The Venezuelan cabinet yesterday sent a series of tax bills to Congress aimed at cutting the public sector deficit, which last year reached 3.6 per cent of gross domestic product. The bills cover several areas. A general sales tax, covering imports and other activities at the wholesale level, is planned to replace a value added tax brought in in October 1993. The maximum rate for corporate and personal income taxes is being raised from 30 per cent to 34 per cent. At the same time the number of income tax deductions is being reduced. Two new taxes are being proposed: a levy on all debit transactions at banks and a luxury tax of 10, 20 or 30 per cent, depending on classifications to be issued by the government. Venezuela's motor industry is bracing itself for lower sales, expecting the luxury tax to raise prices considerably on its profitable, high-priced vehicles. The government is proposing some changes in existing tax laws, for example lowering high fees established last year for certain government services and introducing stricter penalties for tax evasion. It plans to set up an independent agency to collect taxes and reduce tax evasion, put at 70 per cent in recent years.</p>

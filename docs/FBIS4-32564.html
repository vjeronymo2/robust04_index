			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Karel Kriz: "Socialism Even Without Meciar"] </F>   [Text] Almost one and a half years have gone by since the  breakup of the federation, and Slovakia still cannot show a  single economic indicator that has improved. Precisely the other  way around. The past as well as the present government--after  all, they both share credit for the independent state--are thus  faced with a basic problem: how to explain to themselves as well  as to the nation the escalating bankruptcy. And how to achieve  the promised growth.    After the Moravcik government was installed, it may have  appeared for a while, especially under the influence of Rudolf  Filkus's statement, that the new Cabinet will respond with a  solution conforming to market conditions: appreciable  devaluation that would slow down imports and at the same time  promote export and economic growth. But a different tendency  prevailed: Meciar's rate of exchange from the beginning of the  year was affirmed in the end, and the Slovak economy is  therefore gradually barricading itself from the world. The  introduction of quality certificates--meaning, administrative  barriers to imports--are merely one of the manifestations of  this tendency.    To tell the truth, the communist influx into the economic  departments could hardly have led to anything else in  Bratislava: Weiss's people took the office of deputy prime  minister for economy (B. Schmognerova), as well as the Ministry  of Economy (P. Magasi) and the Ministry of Agriculture (P.  Koncos). In this configuration, there is nothing left to liberal  Filkus but to try and find the money to cover the budget  deficits.    No matter how specific the position of the new Slovak  Government is, one thing is certain: On the banks of the Danube,  they began once again to "manage" the economy; they placed their  subjective rationality above the objective rationality of the  market. According to this approach, the customs union is good  when it suits, and vice versa. In the future, not customers but  officials will make decisions about imports: One barrier after  another will go up, exactly the way the Slovak producers will  pressure their officials to do it--or even pay them for doing it.    But let us leave the consequences of this policy--that is,  increasing prices and declining competitiveness--to the Slovaks  themselves. The dilemma of our government is this: keep the  customs union or rescind it? And, if so, when? The complexity of  the answer stems from the fact--and the Slovaks are taking  advantage of it--that we will necessarily also pay for the  dissolution of the common economic zone, although substantially  less than Bratislava itself. The macroeconomic view advises (for  the time being) us to grit our teeth. But what will the specific  Czech producer say about it, who cannot sell on the Slovak  market, while, at the same time, the way in the opposite  direction is open?    Making concessions never leads anywhere, it seems to me.</p>

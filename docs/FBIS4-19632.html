			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Josef Hufelschulte article: "Blackmailers in a Friendly </F> Country"]    [Text] The meeting place is the highway exit north, to the  left of the first traffic light behind the bridge. Time: 1130  hours, Sunday. Mustafa Sari is careful. Instead of his private  address, he has given only a telephone number -- if we miss each  other.    The man is chain-smoking. Mustafa Sari, 45 and holder of a  diploma in economics, is nervous. His hands shake, he talks  without interruption. The topic: the Turkish intelligence  service, MIT for short. Sari reports how the MIT gave him a  grilling.    Changing places, a hotel in Bonn. Loud music in the piano  bar, understanding each other is difficult. Nevertheless,  journalist Fatih G. repeatedly lowers his voice when he talks  about the Turkish National Information Agency -- which is the  official name of the MIT. The topics are dubious figures,  blackmail, and dirty tricks in a friendly country.    One does not joke about the MIT; it is best to have nothing  to do with the MIT. For the 2 million Turks in the FRG, the MIT  is as sinister as the Stasi used to be for GDR citizens.    Germany is the number one area for operations: Here, in  large cities like Berlin and Cologne, the Turkish surveillance  apparatus sees the invisible frontline in the war against  militant separatists. MIT agents are spying on the supporters  of the terrorist Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). However,  they also intimidate other opposition members and, for instance,  threaten asylum-seekers with reprisals against relatives in  Turkey.    The MIT does not do anything obvious. The German authorities  have kept silent for years. The reason: The MIT is classified  as a friendly intelligence service of NATO partner Turkey. The  result: If the spies from Ankara become too active, "one slaps  their wrists at most instead of making everything public," as is  casually noted in Bonn security circles.    Hartmut Ferse, director of the Hesse Office for the  Protection of the Constitution, is an exception. In the  discussion about Kurdish demonstrators he frankly accused the  Turkish intelligence service of illegal activities on German  soil.    The Bonn Interior Ministry, which officially does not want  to  say anything about the MIT, also knows quite well what Ankara's  agents are doing in Germany.    One example: Employees of the Turkish Consulates in Hamburg  and Stuttgart wanted to recruit spies from Turkish opposition  circles in 1990. The alleged diplomats, who were uncovered as  MIT agents by the constitutional protection office, threatened  and blackmailed their would-be spies -- this is clearly proved  by monitored telephone conversations.    As a result, 15 Turkish intelligence agents were silently --  as is usual among NATO partners -- expelled from the country --  an icy period between Ankara and Bonn. At the time.    By July 1992 at the latest, everything had been settled  again. State Minister Bernd Schmidbauer, coordinator of the  intelligence services in the Chancellor's Office, Federal Office  for the Protection of the Constitution President Eckart  Werthebach, and Federal Intelligence Office (BND) chief Konrad  Porzner went on a secret visit to central Anatolia. There,  while tea, pastries, and good raki [Turkish liquor] were served,  new oaths of loyalty were sworn on cooperation between the  German and Turkish services.    Cooperation has always been intensive.    The Berlin Administrative Court was convinced that an asylum  procedure (file VG 19 A 329.82) clearly proved that the BND from  Pullach near Munich regularly passed on information from the  files of Turkish dissidents to Ankara.    The result: After returning to Turkey, rejected  asylum-seekers are arrested and confronted with their statements  made in Germany about political persecution in Turkey.    "If the Turks had their way, we would have to arrest and  deport 100 Kurds per day," an official of the Federal Office of  Criminal Investigations (BKA) describes the zeal of the German  MIT section.    However, even without energetic help the Turkish  intelligence  service manages perfect surveillance.    The listening posts are the approximately 700 state mosques  in Germany. According to research done by FOCUS, the imams, who  are paid by the consulates, are obliged as spiritual leaders to  write a detailed report about the inner workings of the Turkish  communities every four months. In case of "matters pertaining  to internal security," the operation, codenamed Prosperity,  demands that the respective consulate is to be notified  immediately.    The MIT is taking the offensive in time: Via the daily  HURRIYET of 29 September 1992, teachers and doctors who live in  Germany were called upon to take secret photos of suspicious  Turks and to send three copies of the pictures to information  attache Ulvi Yavuz in Ankara within 15 days.    If national security is involved, the Turkish intelligence  service does not stop with Germans, either, according to  reliable information obtained by FOCUS: Dossiers are  painstakingly compiled about journalists, who, in the view of  MIT, report all too critically about the government in Ankara.    The secret files about Ankara's alleged enemies in Germany  are kept in a safe place. The mosque in Venlower Strasse in  Cologne is considered to be the MIT headquarters in the FRG.  About 30 controllers of agents pursue their covert work on the  second floor there. The MIT residency in Berlin has an equally  perfect cover -- from the fourth floor of the state agricultural  bank, Ziraat Bankasi, the scene in Kreuzberg is being spied on.    The Turkish intelligence service, which is always looking  for new unofficial employees, is able to take its pick in  Germany. Many desired candidates speak German better than  Turkish, work at banks and airlines, in travel agencies and  offices. Most of them are more familiar with Hamburg-Altona or  Cologne-Ehrenfeld than Istanbul.    The intelligence service already takes advantage of that  when  it recruits people.    Any young Turk, regardless of whether he was born or grew up  in Germany, is drafted into the military service by Ankara. For  a sum of at least 10,000 German marks, he can, quite legally,  reduce his military service from the actual 20 months to four to  eight weeks until his 38th birthday.    Several FOCUS informers report concurrently that at Burdur  barracks near Antalya young Turks from abroad are gathered  together and approached by the intelligence service.    Economist Mustafa Sari, who came to Burdur at the age of 31,  remembers his first MIT contacts: "We were about 1,200 soldiers  in the barracks. One day we got questionnaires. We were told  to write down which Turkish groups we knew and who is against  the government. We were supposed to give names, blacken people."    Journalist Fatih G. also learned that the young recruits  were  thus writing their first spying reports. Back in Germany after  the brief military service, the MIT does not loosen its grip on  them.    Anyone who wants to get out is intimidated. One does not get  his passport extended for staying in Germany, another is  suddenly suspected of supporting terrorist circles -- which  might lead to arrest in Turkey. Beatings on order in Germany  come from the fascist Gray Wolves, who, according to  constitutional protection findings, are clearly controlled by  the MIT.    Mustafa Sari, who publicly pilloried the MIT practice in  lectures after his military service, is convinced that he was  subjected to the toughest measures: During a visit to Ankara an  unknown man fired at him -- the bullet injured two innocent  people in the street.    An MIT operation might also be behind the sudden  disappearance of Turkish opposition members from Germany -- such  incidents had been hitherto unknown.    According to investigations by FOCUS, four members of  Devrimci Sol (Revolutionary Left), a party that is persecuted in  Turkey, requested political asylum in Stuttgart and Frankfurt in  1982.    In 1986 MIT agents lured the opposition members into a trap.  During a dinner in Stuttgart among alleged comrades, the four  Dev-Sol activists were reportedly anesthetized and taken to  Ankara on a passenger flight of Turkish Airlines.    Relatives say that only in 1988 did they receive any  indication that the missing persons were still alive. They were  in the feared Mamak military prison in Ankara; according to  official reports, they had been arrested during a raid in  Turkey. The sentence: 17 years in prison for each of them.    Two men have meanwhile been released from prison. Hakan  reportedly squealed to the MIT about his comrades. Ibrahim was  no longer fit to be in prison -- Mamak prison caused him to end  up in a wheelchair.</p>

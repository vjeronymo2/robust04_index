			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Adia returns to black and raises forecast Adia, the Swiss temporary employment agency group controlled by Mr Klaus Jacobs, returned to profit in the first half following two years of losses. It raised the forecast net income for the full year to SFr20m (Dollars 14.3m). Mr John Bowmer, chief executive, said net income in the first half reached SFr8.3m compared with a loss of SFr31.6m in the same period last year. Total revenues rose 10 per cent to SFr1.65bn, reflecting a similar rise in hours sold. Improving demand for temporary help in continental Europe was a sign of the beginning of an economic recovery. Revenues and profits continued to grow in the US, Australia and the UK, he said. Mr Bowmer forecast in April that 1994 net income would reach SFr5m after losses of SFr127m in 1993 and SFr219m in 1992. Meanwhile, Adia said it had suspended negotiations on acquiring the 19 per cent of Adia Services, its quoted US subsidiary, which it does not already own. It had been unable to reach agreement with a special committee of the US subsidiary's board on terms.</p>

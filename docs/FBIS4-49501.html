			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 7 (XINHUA) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) said today it will not send an inspection  team to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to  observe the refueling of the country's main nuclear reactor.    "We received a letter from the DPRK a short while ago, but  it  does not constitute the basis for sending an inspection team to  the DPRK," a spokesman for the Vienna-based agency said.    Therefore, the spokesman said, "The IAEA will not send an  inspection team."    The DPRK's letter was a reply to one sent Tuesday [3 May] by  the IAEA to the DPRK's Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam insisting  that its inspectors carry out safeguard tests during the  refueling.    Earlier, the DPRK had invited the IAEA to send inspectors to  watch the replacement of spent uranium fuel rods at its main  five-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, but stressed the IAEA could  only observe the operation.    But the IAEA insisted that its inspectors make tests at the  reactor to ensure that no radioactive fuel had been diverted  into the making of nuclear weapons, as suspected by Western  countries.    The DPRK says its nuclear facilities are for peaceful  purposes only.    The IAEA spokesman also said that "Refueling the reactor  without IAEA inspectors and permission for them to carry out  safeguard inspections constitutes a serious violation of the  safeguard agreement."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/147: "Commission Opens Free </F> Trade Talks With the Baltics"]    [Text] The European Union [EU] yesterday held its first  round of talks with the Republic of Latvia, following the recent  decision by EU foreign ministers to instruct the Commission to  negotiate free trade agreements with the Baltic states.    The delegations were chaired by Mr. Olgerts Pavlovskis,  state  minister for external trade and relations with the EU in the  Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Mr. Daniel Guggenbuhl,  head of unit in the European Commission's directorate-general  for external economic relations.    This first round of negotiations was held in an open and  constructive atmosphere. The parties had a general exchange of  views on the various aspects to be covered by the agreement.  Both delegations shared the view that the envisaged new trade  agreement will be a further important step for the integration  of Latvia into the European Union and that the negotiations  should be concluded as soon as possible.    The Copenhagen Summit had invited the European Commission to  submit proposals for developing the existing trade and  cooperation agreements between the EU and the Baltic states into  free trade agreements. The Commission presented its proposals  on 1 December 1993. On this basis the Council adopted the  negotiating directives for the three countries on 7 February  1994. The negotiations with Estonia and Lithuania will start  tomorrow and on 28 February.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / War with trade unions is over says Shephard THE GOVERNMENT is no longer at war with the trade union movement and believes unions can have a valid role, according to Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary. She told journalists yesterday that she was not interested in 'talking to the unions in a hostile way'. She added that the Trade Unions Bill, which introduces a number of further restrictions on the unions and is likely to go before parliament in October, was only a 'tidying up exercise'. 'I don't see this as part of a war against the trade unions. There was a war in the 1980s but that is now over,' she said. These comments are the first attempt by Mrs Shephard to distance herself from the more aggressive stance of her predecessor, Mr Michael Howard. She has made few changes to Mr Howard's bill, which includes restrictions on strike action and on the automatic 'check-off' of union dues by employers. However, she has added an element of her own which underlines her different priorities. The new element is a move to shake up the schools Careers Service by insisting that the service, currently run by local authorities, is put out to tender. 'We must free up the provision of careers advice,' Mrs Shephard said. A recent survey of employers showed that the service was not widely used. A Department of Employment official said the service had been seen by employers as trapped in the educational establishment. Mrs Shephard also emphasised that she was concerned about the number of young people who were not getting a place on the Youth Training scheme, in spite of a government guarantee of a place for all. She added that she would be getting monthly reports on the problem. 'The trouble is that the machinery bringing together the young person and the training place is not always there,' Mrs Shephard said. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour employment spokesman, said up to 200,000 young people could be missing out on a training place. Mrs Shephard's more emollient attitude to the unions will be viewed with some suspicion by union leaders. Although she is viewed as an improvement upon Mr Howard, they would like to see the new style translated into policy. Some union leaders hope she may block the abolition of the remaining Wages Councils which set minimum wages for 2.5m people. The government is in principle committed to abolition of the Wages Councils and Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, is known to be a keen supporter of this although Mrs Shephard's position is less clear.</p>

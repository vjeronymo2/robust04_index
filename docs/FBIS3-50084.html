			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle by </F> Djurdjica Klancir in Ljubljana; date not given: "I Am Not For  Slovenia's Implementing the Hammer Policy Against Croatia"]    [Text] In the last several months, Slovene Foreign  Minister Lojze Peterle has been putting up with severe criticism  in the Slovene Parliament: He is being reproached for being too  soft, too naive in negotiations with Croatia. His political  opponent, Dimitrij Rupel, is particularly vociferous. "No, I do  not want to polemicize with him. When he was a minister he did  not know how to protect the Slovene fishermen, whereas now, for  every single problem he has the best and the only possible  solution...," Peterle ironically comments on the diplomatic  achievements of his predecessor in the informal part of the  interview.    In this moment, Croato-Slovene relations are really in a  crisis. Only a day after our conversation with Minister Peterle,  one of the most critical problems between two states -- the  Krsko nuclear power plant -- reached a climax again: Croatia  was disconnected from the power grid after the station was  overhauled! Nevertheless, calmly and composedly, Minister  Peterle claims that the problem, just like all others, can be  solved in a peaceful and civilized manner, to the satisfaction  of both sides.    [Klancir] Recently you stated to the Viennese KURIER that  the Slovene-Croatian relations had been broken up completely.  Which political moves -- on the Slovene or Croatian part -- do  you think are to blame for such a situation?    [Peterle] No, the KURIER journalist did not understand me  well. The relations between Slovenia and Croatia have never  been completely broken up at any time. Some contacts always  exist. The truth is, however, that the relations between the  two states are not developing as quickly as we would like them  to.    [Klancir] Have the activities of the expert groups been  interrupted, who are working on the maps regarding some delicate  issues of territorial demarcation?    [Peterle] Those activities have not been completely  interrupted. It is true that the mixed diplomatic commission is  not working for the time being, because the Croatian side has  not yet designated the new chairman, a successor of Mr. Rudolf,  which prevents the commission to work normally. Right now we,  the Slovene side, are preparing a response to the Croatian  attitudes regarding the border in the bay of Piran. As for the  Ljubljanska Banka and the Krsko nuclear power plant, the  attitudes are going through the process of harmonization, while  one can say that the agreements on trade and the cultural  cooperation are ready to be signed. The agreement on trade [as  published] is also ready to be signed.... Which is to say, if we  were to "open" the package of agreements, some of them could  certainly be signed that very moment. However, all those  agreements are dealt with as a whole, rather than individually.  That is, we are working, we are making progress, but not as  quickly as we would want to. If one insists on assessing  failures, then it can be said that both sides have failed to  improve the mutual relations, rather than only one side.    [Klancir] In a confidential document of the Slovene Foreign  Ministry, which was partly brought out by the Slovene REPUBLIKA,  a more severe Slovene attitude in future negotiations with  Croatia is announced. What is that more severe attitude  supposed to be like?    [Peterle] Personally, I do not use such words in diplomatic  endeavors.... No goal is accomplished by severeness. I think  that a much better term is -- consistency. So, I think that, in  the relations with Croatia, we have to be consistent.  Concretely, as far as borders are concerned, we shall continue  our efforts to reach the agreement on implementing the first,  general criterion regarding the demarcation. We are still  proposing that one should start from the criterion of land  registry districts. However, if both sides agree that such a  criterion is not applicable, we shall pick a new one, or perhaps  some additional criteria. We shall be consistent also in our  insisting on the agreement on borders that was reached after the  declarations of independency of both states, which is to say, we  shall demand that the state of affairs as it was on 26 July 1991  be observed. In that respect one needs no severity --  consistency will do, whereas sometimes we cannot be consistent  without a high tone.    [Klancir] How will the Slovene severity reflect itself in  the case of Krsko?    [Peterle] The Slovene attitude should also not be marked by  severity in that case. That case is above all about a business  relationship, rather than about politics. If the nuclear power  plant produces power for both the Slovene and Croatian  consumers, and the Slovene consumers are paying for it much more  regularly than the Croatian consumers, the protests on the part  of Slovenia are quite justifiable. The question is raised: Why  are we crediting the Croatian consumers? So, the issue is about  a purely business relationship. Both sides ought to pay their  bills, and one should not make interstate problems out of  that.... I personally insist, despite all the criticisms, on  constructive talks, rather than on the hammer policy. I have  agreed with [Croatian] Minister Mate Granic that we should be  creating a constructive atmosphere, without tension, in which we  shall be able to settle all problems more easily. A different  issue is the question of a new legal arrangement of relations  regarding Krsko, where many questions are still open.    [Klancir] REPUBLIKA has written that, in the aforementioned  document, the sincerity of the Croatian side in the negotiations  is called into question. Why is the Croatian sincerity called  into question?    [Peterle] We do not need REPUBLIKA. Let us put it this way:  While Mr. Franjo Greguric was prime minister, we signed the  agreement on economic cooperation with him. However, the  Croatian Parliament did not ratify that agreement, although  Greguric's party, that is the Croatian Democratic Community  [HDZ], has a great majority in the parliament. It was a slap in  the face for the Slovene side....    We also have a fresher example of Croatian inconsistency in  the policy on Slovenia. I was personally at the HDZ convention  this year. In the contacts with many politicians, I got the  impression that the Croatian side was seriously working on the  improvement of Croat-Slovene relations. Many nice things were  said.... However, as soon as I left Zagreb, the problem with  the accommodation of refugees in Slovene resorts [in Istria]  broke out, although we agreed quite concretely that we shall  settle the issue in cooperation and as carefully as possible.  That problem resounded in the Slovene public very negatively.  It was all the same to the Slovenes whether the accommodation  of refugees in the resorts was ordered by the Croatian defense  minister or somebody else -- they felt that somebody made fools  out of them (still, the situation is much better now).    [Klancir] You have just said that you were at the HDZ  convention. Rupel assessed your attempts to make progress in  Slovene-Croatian relations through meetings of the two parties,  that is your Christian Democrats and the HDZ, as completely  unsuccessful.    [Peterle] Rupel will have to get used to the fact that  democratic changes in two states bring about such contacts as  well. That is nothing unusual. In Croatia, the HDZ is the most  powerful political party, whereas in Slovenia the Christian  Democrats are the second strongest party. The foreign ministers  of those countries are members of those two parties, and it is  logical that they cooperate, and communicate.    [Klancir] When the Commission for Interstate Relations in  the Slovene Parliament proposed, for the first time, as a new  phase of Slovene-Croatian negotiations, a top-level meeting,  that is with Milan Kucan and Janez Drnovsek on one side, and  Franjo Tudjman on the other side, you refused. Why?    [Peterle] So long as we have not worked out any concrete  solutions on the expert level, I think it is senseless to listen  to the principled assessments and good wishes regarding  Slovene-Croatian relations. Which is to say, it is the experts  who should be given priority, and only then a confirmation on  the highest level. Drnovsek shares that opinion.... Until we  arrange the balance of the Ljubljanska Banka, until we work out  a solution for the nuclear power station -- it makes no sense to  listen to the statements saying that we should by all means get  down to solving those problems. After all, that has already  been said before....    [Klancir] In your interview with KURIER, you presented the  problem of the border in the bay of Piran as a serious matter of  conflict. Do you think that is the most difficult problem in  Croat-Slovene relations? Are there any new suggestions for the  settlement of the problem?    [Peterle] I am not sure whether I would place that problem  on the top of the list of our problems, that is to say, whether  I would define it as the most difficult. Perhaps.... It is  certainly difficult -- because the Croatian and the Slovene  concepts of the solution are quite different. Slovenia rejects  the model of condominium in the bay. The Slovene attitude is  clear -- one ought to start from the borders defined by land  registries. One cannot expect Slovenia to agree to a limitation  of the rights it had before. Slovenia has the right to free  access to the sea that it had in former Yugoslavia.    [Klancir] How high is the problem of Krsko ranked on the  list of problems?    [Peterle] There are really no reasons for Krsko to be a  stumbling block in political negotiations. What is necessary is  to prepare the foundations in the newly-created legal  circumstances for a new agreement, that is, one ought to settle  the question of ownership, debts, prices, nuclear waste. Yet,  there are no reasons for the consumers not to pay for the power  they are obtaining from Krsko. That is a matter of the business  relationship.    [Klancir] If many agreements are almost ready to be signed  -- as you yourself say -- why are not they signed then? Where  are the obstacles to be found?    [Peterle] After the Slovene-Croatian meeting in Bizeljsko,  the work on the expert level did not start developing at the  expected pace. On the Slovene side the opinion prevails that  the Croatian side is slowing down the process, that it is not  responding quickly enough to our proposals. Of course, it is  possible that the Croatian side will say that the problem lies  in Slovene slowness. Perhaps the Croatian negotiators have  counted a much faster Slovene response to the latest Croatian  idea regarding the settlement of the Piran Bay issue. However,  we are preparing a very comprehensive respond to the proposal.  Besides, it is clear that Croatia has some other priorities in  foreign policy -- for instance, the problems in  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- so that it cannot engage itself in  relations with Slovenia as much as we would like it to.    [Klancir] So, you have understanding for the fact that  Croatia is in a state of war....    [Peterle] The opposition reproaches me that I have too much  understanding for Croatia!    [Klancir] In his interview with GLOBUS, Rupel expressed a  sort of threat. He said: "It is clear that Slovenia might just  as well inflict a lot of harm to Croatia on the international  stage."    [Peterle] That could perhaps have happened during Rupel's  mandate, who stated before that he did not want Croatia to be a  millstone around his neck (excuse me, but Rupel does not  represent the entire Slovene people). The political relations  with any neighbor cannot be arranged in that way.... I am  against any threats or blackmails in Slovene-Croatian relations.  Croatia will certainly advance in its getting involved in the  work of various international organizations.... All those  organizations have certain criteria for the admittance, and if  Croatia fulfills them -- it will be admitted into those  organizations. The same applies to admittance to the European  Council. It is pretentious to claim that the European Council  will take into consideration whether Slovenia is for or against  it.    [Klancir] How do you comment on the results of a public  opinion poll that was carried out in Slovenia, showing that  Slovenes view Croatia as being their greatest enemy, and that  they are not excluding the possibility of a war? A similar poll  in Croatia shows that Croats do not hold such a view of Slovenes.    [Peterle] I admit, I got seriously worried about the results  of that public opinion poll. If it is authentic, those are  quite alarming results. It is difficult to develop the  relations between two countries if a considerable part of the  population views the neighboring country as being the greatest  enemy. If we are trying to find out any rational reasons for  such a view, perhaps we can find them out in the steps that the  Croatian Government has made with regard to the Slovene resorts  in Istria, and even with regard to the Buzet brewery. That has  caused a considerable revolt among the Slovenes. Many of them  have vacation houses in Istria, and the fear has been provoked  that they might be soon taken away from them.    [Klancir] What is being concretely undertaken in order to  improve Croat-Slovene relations?    [Peterle] We have to bring the work on the expert level to a  conclusion. That is to say, we are awaiting the settlement of  the problem of Ljubljanska Banka. In several days we will hold  a meeting with the representatives of all sectors whose  relations with Croatia are problematic. Tomorrow I am having a  meeting with Zagar, the Croatian ambassador.... Besides, a  written proposal made by Slovenia regarding the settlement of  the Piran Bay issue is supposed to be finished soon. The  experts are still working on it. I hope that the negotiations  about the nuclear power station of Krsko will also advance;  State Secretary Sovic has just told me that some new ideas are  being worked out -- ideas that might bring about a satisfactory  solution for both sides. Which is to say, we are constantly  working on it.... The Croatian side will probably designate the  head of the diplomatic negotiating group. And then, quite  calmly, we could go for the signing of certain agreements.</p>

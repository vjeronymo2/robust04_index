			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Emission Requirements Prior to January 1, 1998  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to mandatory use of the complex model on January 1, 1998, the requirements of section 211(k)(8) of the Act will be met by requiring that the annual average exhaust benzene emissions of a refiner's conventional gasoline not exceed its baseline exhaust benzene emissions. The exhaust benzene emissions due to conventional gasoline can be determined using the simple model discussed in Section III. Only the effects of fuel benzene and fuel aromatic content on exhaust benzene are included in this model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the simple model is used for compliance, the annual average sulfur, olefin and T90 values of a party's conventional gasoline cannot exceed its baseline values of those parameters by more than 25 percent. These limits will provide some additional assurance that conventional gasoline emissions of toxics and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  will not rise prior to use of the complex model. EPA does not expect the levels of these parameters in conventional gasoline to naturally increase due to the reformulated gasoline program, since the simple model for reformulated gasoline simply caps these three fuel parameters at their baseline levels and does not require their reduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A refiner may also use the complex model for determining compliance prior to its mandatory use. Because all of the fuel parameters affecting exhaust benzene emissions are part of the model (benzene, aromatics, RVP, sulfur, olefins, E300, E200, and oxygen) there is no need for separate ``caps'' on fuel parameters as associated with the simple model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A refiner's baseline exhaust benzene emissions are determined by evaluating the refiner's baseline fuel parameter values in the model chosen by the refiner for compliance. At the end of a compliance period, the average fuel parameter values of a refiner's conventional gasoline over that period are evaluated in the same compliance model used to determine the refiner's baseline emissions. The resulting emission values are then compared to the baseline emission values to determine if the party is in or out of compliance with the anti-dumping requirement. While there was general support for the regulatory approach taken by EPA, several commenters suggested specific revisions to the emissions requirements. EPA's responses are discussed in the RIA. However, none of the comments caused EPA to change its proposed requirements, and all of the above provisions are being promulgated essentially as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA had proposed that while a refiner may choose to use either the simple model or the complex model prior to January 1, 1998, it must use the same model for both the reformulated gasoline and the anti-dumping programs. Several commenters disagreed with this last restriction. EPA is, however, promulgating this requirement as proposed because the anti-dumping and reformulated gasoline provisions are inherently tied together. The specific model used to certify reformulated gasoline will affect which fuel components are likely to be dumped. To avoid incentives to dump, the effect of these components on conventional gasoline emissions should be evaluated on the same basis as the reformulated gasoline emissions. Otherwise, incentives will exist to shift dirty components to conventional fuel areas using whichever model predicts the lowest emissions increase due to those components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Emission Requirements Beginning January 1, 1998  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Beginning January 1, 1998, the requirements of section 211(k)(8) of the Act shall be met by requiring that the exhaust toxic emissions and the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions of a party's conventional gasoline not exceed that party's baseline exhaust toxic and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions. Compliance with this requirement shall be determined using the complex model described in Section IV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exhaust toxics emissions requirement under mandatory use of the complex model includes all five pollutants defined in section 211(k)(10)(C) as toxics. These are exhaust benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene and POM. Benzene emissions occur in both exhaust and nonexhaust emissions, and accordingly, section 211(k)(10)(C) does not limit the toxic air pollutant benzene to exhaust benzene. However, as stated, EPA is only promulgating regulations applicable to exhaust benzene. Nonexhaust benzene emissions will be effectively controlled by the summertime volatility controls applicable to conventional gasoline. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 73 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The sum of the baseline exhaust emissions of each of the five toxics is the value that must not be exceeded by the sum of the exhaust emissions of these toxic pollutants due to a refiner's or importer's annual average conventional gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 73 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  No credit can be taken nor penalties received under the anti-dumping program for nonexhaust benzene reductions, or increases. Nonexhaust benzene emissions decrease due to RVP reductions, which are a VOC reduction strategy already considered under the anti-dumping program as the reason for not explicitly controlling VOC emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from conventional gasoline use are also controlled beginning January 1, 1998. Although EPA is concerned that high oxygenate levels may contribute to increased NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions, the Act states that any NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions increase in conventional gasoline due to oxygenate use can be offset by VOC, CO and toxic emission reductions. EPA is addressing this provision of the Act by allowing compliance with the anti-dumping NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission requirement to be determined on either a nonoxygenated basis or an oxygenated basis, as discussed further in paragraph C.5.e of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Requirements for Individual Baseline Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance under section 211(k)(8) of the Act is measured against an individual baseline (comprised of individual baseline fuel parameter and emission values) which is determined for each refiner if sufficient data exist from which to determine a baseline representative of that refiner's 1990 gasoline. Additionally, the Act states that if no adequate or reliable data exist regarding the gasoline sold by a refiner in 1990, the refiner must use the statutory baseline gasoline fuel parameters <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 74 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as its baseline fuel parameters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 74 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The statutory baseline gasoline for anti-dumping purposes is discussed further in paragraph C.3.e of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The government has been studying the move as a means to help  absorb excess shares in the market and boost sluggish share  prices, they said.    The surplus shares, issued during the "bubble economy"  period  in the late 1980s, have been blamed for keeping the stock prices  depressed.    According to the government's plans to revise the commercial  code, companies hoping to buy back their own shares will be  first required to change their articles of association with  approval from more than two-thirds of their shareholders.    So far, such a change has required approval from all the  shareholders, a rule that has served as a major obstacle.    Then they will have to put a buyback proposal to another  vote  that would require approval by more than half of the  shareholders.    The shares to be bought back will have to be purchased on  the  stock market with the companies' own funds. No borrowing will  be allowed for that purpose.    Up to 3 percent of the outstanding shares is the ceiling set  for such purchases.    In addition, the shares so bought cannot be sold to third  parties and must to be sold to in-house shareholding  organizations of employees within one year, the sources said.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity prices slip back after promising start - Market Report The final few minutes of what was a relatively subdued trading session on the London equity market saw share prices succumb to bouts of unease over the short term direction of global interest rates. The FT-SE 100 Index of leading UK stocks finished 0.1 off at 3,142.2, easily outperforming a FT-SE Mid 250 Index which had been dragged down towards the close of trading in the session by a late sell-off in the regional elec-tricity stocks. But senior traders in the City were by no means dismayed at the start of what promises to be a tension-filled week across global markets, with the US Federal Reserve meeting today to deliberate on US monetary policy and the Bundesbank council scheduled to meet on Thursday to formulate Germany's next moves on interest rates. Analysts said the market would also have to contend with a long list of crucial economic statistics from the US, Japan and across Europe. Trading in London got off to a good start, with dealers encouraged by reports in the weekend press that the Bundesbank council could well move to lower German rates on Thursday, and also by positive commentaries on the better than expected interim profits and dividend performances of many leading UK stocks, such as Barclays and Royal Insurance. Aiding the initial improvement in equity prices was a solid showing by international bonds, which took heart from a firm performance by US markets last Friday. The closure of many European bourses and financial centres for the Assumption Day holiday had only a minimal impact on trading, dealers said. The FT-SE 100 reached the day's best level, 3,156.5, within an hour of the opening, with talk of at least two medium-sized and a number of small programmes weighted to the buy side said to have been partly responsible for the early strength in share prices. No real selling pressure was evident over the lunchtime and early afternoon period but sentiment began to falter in mid-afternoon as most international bond markets, especially in the US and Germany, began to tick off, taking UK gilts with them. Yesterday's US economic news on industrial production, manufacturing output and capacity utilisation gave no real lead to the markets. Today will bring data of US housing starts. Turnover in London reached 463.1m shares, a figure regarded as creditable by dealers, who pointed out that many institutions were reluctant to take new positions ahead of the US and German decisions on interest rate policy. Activity in non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounted for 277.3m, or just short of 60 per cent of total business. The head of trading at one of London's leading integrated securities houses said the market had already factored in a rise in the US Fed Funds rate of at least 25 basis points, with a 50 basis-point increase also a possibility. But he emphasised that any rise could well be delayed, possibly to the end of the week. He added that the chances of a German rate cut were 'much less than evens'. Bank shares attracted plenty of keen interest, with HSBC shares slipping back as the market pondered the lack of progress in the group's underlying banking profits as opposed to sharply reduced provisions against bad debts. National Westminster Bank shares, which have suffered badly recently as institutions switched into other banks, were among the FT-SE 100's best performers, as were the international drug stocks, such as Glaxo and Wellcome. The regional electricity issues came in for a sharp bout of profit-taking, with some institutions said to be shifting allocations to some of the other high-yielding areas of the market, such as banks.</p>

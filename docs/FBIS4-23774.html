			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 14 Jun (PANA) -- Two federal courts in Lagos  on Tuesday [14 June] gave separate rulings ordering Nigeria's  military government to produce a civil rights activist and a  newspaper editor detained over the country's current political  crisis.    In one of the cases, Justice Victor Egbedon ruled that Beko  Ransome-Kuti, detained chairman of the anti-military pressure  group, Campaign for Democracy (CD) must be produced before the  court on 22 June, the day he fixed for the case's next hearing.    The CD called a largely ignored week-long sit-at-home  strike,  which began on Monday as part of pro-democracy moves to force  the military to surrender power.    Beko's lawyer, Gani Fawehinmi, submitted in court that his  client's arrest and detention on 19 June was a violation of his  constitutional rights. He also described as illegal, the  security search carried out in Beko's residence, adding that the  court should allow a doctor to see his client.    In the other case, Justice Tajudeen Odo o, of another  federal  high court in Lagos, ordered the government to produce in court  on June 20, Bola Bolawole, the detained editor of  privately-owned PUNCH newspaper.    The suit was filed on behalf of Bolawole by the same Lagos  lawyer Fawehinmi, who also urged the court to declare illegal,  the sealing off of the PUNCH newspaper premises by security  agents last Saturday.    The Nigerian police have accused some local newspaper houses  of "storing arms". The second newspaper organisation, Concord  Press, shut down over the political crisis, has also filed a 1  billion naira (22 naira: 1 U.S. dollar) suit challenging the  government action. Hearing in the case was fixed for 27 June.    The CONCORD is owned by millionaire Moshood Abiola, who is  wanted by the Nigerian police after he proclaimed himself  president last Saturday, based on the 12 June 1993 presidential  election, which was annulled by former military ruler, Gen.  Ibrahim Babangida. Abiola claimed he won that election.    A number of pro-democracy activists have been arrested,  released or charged [word indistinct] government activities in  the past week in the West African country.    In another court case Tuesday, Justice Babatunde Belgore of  a federal high court in Lagos, [words indistinct] senators of  Nigeria's aborted Third Republic. The judge said the  prosecution had failed to prove to him that his court had  jurisdiction to try the accused persons for the alleged offense.    Former senators Maconyemechi Nwalu, Onyeka Amadi Okorafor  and Abu Ibrahim, were arraigned on two-count charges of felony  and alleged "intention to remove the head of state, Gen. Sani  Abacha, through unconstitutional means". The three pleaded not  guilty to the second charge and were later granted bail. Their  case was adjourned until 22 june.</p>

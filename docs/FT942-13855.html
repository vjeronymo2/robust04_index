			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Four Seasons sale by year-end Four Seasons Hotels, the Canadian luxury chain, says it has had over 50 initial inquiries from buyers interested in acquiring the group, and expects to conclude a deal by the end of the year, writes Michael Skapinker. Four Seasons is seeking a buyer because Mr Isadore Sharp, its founder and controlling shareholder, wants to loosen his ties with the group over the next three to five years. Mr Sharp and his family own 18 per cent of the group's shares, but control 70 per cent of the votes.</p>

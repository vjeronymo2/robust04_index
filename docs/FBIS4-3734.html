			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "China May Open Up its Power Industry"] </F>   [Text] The Chinese Government is considering allowing  foreign investments in the manufacture of large electrical  generators.    Westinghouse Electric Corp of America and Siemens AG of  Germany reportedly desire to co-operate with Chinese  manufacturers.    For years domestic production of large power generators has  failed to meet demand.    China, which expects its economy to grow by 8 to 9 per cent  over the next seven years, needs to add more than 12 million  kilowatts of capacity each year.    Capacity is expected to increase from the present 181  million  kilowatts to at least 300 million kilowatts by the year 2000.    However, State planners predict that the manufacture of  large  power generators over the next seven years will be short of  demand by a big margin.    Large generators representing more than 3.2 million  kilowatts  of capacity were imported last year. Imports this year will  account for 4 million kilowatts.    Between 1990 and last year, generators of about 47.2 million  kilowatts were installed. About 30 per cent, or 13.75 million  kilowatts worth, were imported.    China now has the ability to turn out 9 million kilowatts of  generators each year. Three-quarters are machines above 100,000  kilowatts.    Power industry officials point out that insufficient  production of generators jeopardizes the government's long-term  economic goals.    One industry official said manufacturing large power  generators with investment and advanced technology from overseas  would benefit the country. The official said foreign-funded  ventures are expected to fill the gap between production and  demand.    Economists say the growth in power production should at  least  match that of the economy. That means a large number of big  power plants must be built.    Production of generators above 300,000 kilowatts has been on  the rise over the past several years. Stimulated by rising  demand, production of small machines, or those below 25,000  kilowatts, has also been increasing.    In 1991, some 230 small generators with combined capacity of  1.36 million kilowatts were manufactured. In 1992, production  increased to 256 generators with 1.4 million kilowatts.    Industry officials predict that production will continue to  increase so that it will eventually surpass demand.    However, the official said more large generators will have  to  be imported to ensure enough new power plants are built to  support the booming economy, the official said.    In China, large power generators are produced by plants  controlled by the Ministry of Machinery Industry. They are to  be used by the Ministry of Power Industry, which oversees  construction of new power stations.    Foreign-funded power plants in China are usually equipped  with imported generators. In large joint ventures, both the  Chinese and foreign partners prefer imported machines.    By the end of l992, China had signed some $12 billion in  power-related contracts with international banks and foreign  governments, enterprises and businessmen.    Several pump-storage power plants are under construction,  including projects in Guangzhou, Tianhuangping in Zhejiang  Province and Shisanling in Beijing. Key equipment for the  plants is to be imported.    Still, more pump storage power plants are planned.</p>

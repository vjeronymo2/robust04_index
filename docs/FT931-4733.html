			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Turkey and Azerbaijan sign oil pipeline accord TURKEY and Azerbaijan yesterday agreed to build a pipeline from the Baku oilfields to the Turkish Mediterranean. The deal, signed in Ankara by Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkish prime minister, and Mr Sabit Bagirov, Azerbaijani oil minister, ends months of uncertainty about the route of the proposed Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 980m) pipeline to take Azerbaijani crude to western markets. Yesterday's accord envisages a route via Iran and the small Azerbaijani enclave of Nachievan before ending at Ceyhan on the Turkish Mediterranean, using the existing twin Iraqi pipeline now closed because of UN sanctions against Baghdad. Last month a consortium of Botas, Turkey's state-owned pipeline company, and Azerbaijan's state oil company, together with BP and the US oil and engineering groups Pennzoil, Amoco and McDerm-ott, concluded a feasibility study of three possible routes, through Georgia or Russia to the Black Sea, or the Araz valley to the Mediterranean. The agreement leaves the door open for Kazakhstan, an important oil producer, and Turkmenistan, a large gas producer, to join. The 1,060km pipe will have 40m tonnes capacity, Azerbaijan accounting for 25m tonnes, with the balance used by Kazakhstan. Azerbaijan's output is estimated at 10m-12m tonnes, but is projected to increase to 40m tonnes by 1996-97. Kazakhstan is planning to export its production via a pipeline to Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossysk. Last month the Turkish Foreign Ministry signalled its disapproval of the Kazakh plan. Under the 1936 Montreux convention, ships have unhindered passage through the Bosporus. But Turkey has warned that the increased tanker traffic could impede shipping, already congested with the opening of the Danube-Rhine Canal and the growing demand from the new Black Sea states.</p>

According to sources very close to the Oran governorate, 12  dead were reported yesterday around 1800, while the injured  numbered 46, including four in critical condition who were taken  to the Oran University Hospital Center where special medical  teams were formed.    On the other hand, yesterday at 1327, press agencies  reported  15 dead and 62 injured.    In addition, civilian rescue services estimated at 130 the  number of housing units that were completely destroyed, and  close to 400 buildings in the area are in danger of collapsing.    For its part, the crisis center set up at the Oran DEC  [expansion not given] indicated that two people who were buried  under the rubble were found alive and rescued yesterday, early  in the afternoon. Following the landslide, the Ras El-Ain region  was declared a disaster area and a civil emergency plan was  therefore decreed.    The buildings destroyed did not withstand the landslide  because they were built on a hillock: "It is a difficult clay  soil that can be cleared only with shovels and cranes for fear  of touching neighboring buildings."    Another information from local officials indicated that "all  the buildings involved were illegal constructions." Add to this  the very violent wind that blew in the area and contributed to  the collapse of some buildings.    Since Saturday evening, two crisis centers have been set up,  and two land sites have been cleared to relocate  disaster-stricken families, who were also provided with tents  and food.    Soon afterward, we learned that yesterday morning the  Orolait  Company distributed 1,500 liters of milk and 1,050 rations of  pasta with cheese to the victims of the disaster.    In closing, we would like to mention that, in the middle of  the night, the Oran governor visited the site of the disaster  where rescue operations were still in progress.</p>

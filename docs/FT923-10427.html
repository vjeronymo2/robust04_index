			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Observer: Moving mouths Memo to ambitious public relations types: First, when you've no good news to push, lie low - the bearer of bad tidings is apt to get shot. Second, and more important, be sure to back a boss who is a winner. Anyone doubting the wisdom of said advice need only look at a couple of developments yesterday. James Poole, who has done well beefing up Barclays Bank's PR department, will soon be out of a job. He was close to chairman Sir John Quinton, who retires at the end of a troublesome year for Barclays, and Poole's face doesn't suit the post-Quinton planners. Instead of renewing his contract, Barclays is replacing him with a career banker. Meanwhile 38-year-old Howell James, one of the few outsiders on the BBC's management board, is off to be the official mouthpiece of his old mentor, Cable and Wireless chairman and former cabinet minister Lord Young. James, who made his PR mark during TV-am's turbulent launch, is hoping to work the same sort of magic on Young's private-sector image as he previously did on the public-sector equivalent. It should be an easier task, always provided that Young doesn't lose his job. Even so, it's a strange move. Running the PR machine of a utility should be nowhere near as exciting as nursing the BBC's image in the run-up to the renewal of its charter. Could it be that Howell has decided C&amp;W is a safer job?</p>

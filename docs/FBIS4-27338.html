			<p>CSO     [Text] Nippon Seiki has started to move into development of  the instruments business in China, further increasing the  overseas production ratio of the company. Along with  globalization of the auto industry, China has been added to  Japan, the United States, and Europe for the production bases of  the company, making it a quadripolar system, but with the effect  of the high yen, a phenomenon of deindustrialization at home is  beginning with a move of facilities from the Takami plant in  Nagaoka city to a U.S. plant. For this reason, the company has a  policy of aggressively promoting restructuring with the opening  up of new market sectors as the pillar.    China is promoting a policy to cultivate the auto industry,  the "Three Large and Three Small Projects," and the U.S. Big  Three and Japanese automakers are accelerating their China  strategy with an eye to the future. Nippon Seiki also began  providing technology to the Beijing Auto Instrument and Meter  Plant of the Beijing Auto Industry Federated Corporation Group  in 1992, and is proposing instrument production technology for  the "Cherokee" jeep which the Beijing group is producing in a  joint venture with Chrysler of the United States, but their  China strategy will be moving greatly forward with this direct  expansion.    At the same time, domestic deindustrialization  countermeasures are also surfacing as a issue, which will  progress further in the future. The company is building  production bases in the United States and Europe in response to  the overseas expansion by automakers who are their clients, and  the overseas production ratio is beginning to expand due to the  advance of the high yen. In the past, expansion of local  production meant increasing capability, but a drop in domestic  competitiveness was behind the decision to move the production  line of the Takami plant to a U.S. plant in December 1993.    For this reason, the company is promoting business  diversification, and its policy is to boost fields other than  the instrument business to occupy 50 percent of total sales. It  is thinking of proceeding with a focus on electrical equipment  for general living such as liquid crystals and remote controls,  and on special machinery such as food packaging, and it can be  said that such restructuring holds the future of the company.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc may sell US unit Shares in Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the US drugs company, jumped 11 per cent early yesterday on a statement from majority owner Rhone-Poulenc of France that it is considering alternatives that include a sale of the business. The news came after last month's purchase of Syntex, another US drugs group, by Roche of Switzerland. The deal sparked speculation about other drugs company deals. RPR said in a filing with the US's Securities and Exchange Commission, that its French parent was considering 'several alternative transactions involving RPR . . . including transactions relating to business combinations, mergers or transfers or assets of securities involving RPR'. The statement was made in connection with a standstill agreement signed by Rhone Poulenc when it acquired the majority interest in Rorer in 1990. Under that, the French company agreed not to raise its stake until after July 31, 1997. The French group owns 68.34 per cent of RPR and can only change the terms with the support of a majority of RPR's non-executive directors. In New York, the news pushed RPR shares up Dollars 3 1/2 to close at Dollars 38 5/8 . RPR's sales have been static as a result of pressure from buyers to reduce drugs costs, particularly in the US. The company's income was depressed in dollar terms as 72 per cent of its sales are made abroad. RPR's sales in its first quarter were down 5 per cent from a year before, at Dollars 870m.</p>

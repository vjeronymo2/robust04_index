			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Japan's jump start The Japanese government's latest cure for its sick economy certainly spurred the stock market. But then a Pounds 76bn package of measures could hardly pass unnoticed, however heavily it had been trailed in advance. What remains unclear is whether the government is administering the right medicine. Conditions must remain tough enough to make industry sweat through some painful restructuring, while not being so tight that companies collapse into the black holes in their balance sheets. The measures to extend government agency loans to small businesses and house buyers suffering in the banks' credit squeeze work usefully toward that end. But the Y8,500bn-worth of fiscal expansion may be feeding cream buns to a corporate sector which still badly needs to diet. Nor is it entirely clear that consumers will now leap enthusiastically back into the shops, or that companies have the right capacity to respond to government pump-priming. Japanese GNP will expand by an additional 1.5-2 percentage points this year. That, however, is entirely courtesy of the government, and there will be an anxious wait for the reaction of the private sector. If companies use this excuse quietly to jettison plans for painful cuts, then the medium-term rebound in profits may be feeble, weakening the economic recovery. Not that the equity market is overly concerned with such niceties. A combination of foreign buying, the prospect of huge government stock purchases, low interest rates and the return of small investors should keep the pot boiling. Ironically it may be the flow of foreign funds into Japan which forces up the yen and keeps the pressure on Japanese companies to restructure. That would validate the market's rally to heights which still inspire vertigo in those who judge by fundamental value.</p>

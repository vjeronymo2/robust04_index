			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow 7 April, TASS -- The commanders of nine units  of the Black Sea Fleet have lately received letters signed by  leaders of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists who  threatened them with physical reprisals, the Black Sea Fleet  press centre said.    The press centre described the letters as a form of  psychological pressure on the Black Sea Fleet Command.    Commanders of a training unit of one of the fleet bases were  warned that "in the event of combat activities or hostilities"  their unit will be subject to "extermination by sabotage and  fire." Other letters demand that Russian servicemen leave  Ukraine under threat of physical revenge.    The letters correctly name the numbers of all military units  and their phone numbers.</p>

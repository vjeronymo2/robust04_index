			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Observer: Nominally ministerial 'He that filches from me my good name . . . makes me poor indeed.' Could Othello be the next Japanese folk hero? About 4.5m Japanese, who are facing a government edict to alter the way they write their names, could echo his plaintive words. The Justice Ministry wants to computerise its list of 45.4m officially registered family names, all of which are written, as is usual for Japanese signatures, in kanji, using Chinese characters. But 10 per cent of the names take irregular kanji forms, and the ministry's software can't cope. The oddballs must be 'corrected' - with or without their owners' consent. Parents who carefully select the kanji for their offspring's name, preferring a lucky number of brush strokes to dictionary correctness, are not best pleased. 'I wonder if the ministry has the right to exercise such discretion to change names,' linguistics professor Susumu Ohno ponders from his tower at Gakushuin University meanwhile. And the ministry? Not surprisingly, in some quarters its name is mud.</p>

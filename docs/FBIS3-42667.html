			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Korotkova: "Importers of Goods Subject </F> to Excise Tax Are Facing New Problems: The New Directive of the  Customs Committee"]    [Text] Development of mechanisms for the  implementation of the Customs Code provisions, which is  currently being actively worked on by Russian GTK [State Customs  Committee] specialists, unfortunately most often results in a  considerable worsening of the export-import operations  environment. The point is that despite good intentions--to  ensure maximum budget revenues from customs duty--all documents  that are being issued complicate considerably customs paperwork,  which in practical terms nullifies the effectiveness of foreign  trade deals. The Russia GTK's Order No. 549, "On Ensuring  Payment of Customs Duties With Respect to Goods Subject to  Excise Tax," the distribution of which to Russian customs points  began yesterday, is no exception.    In keeping with the Russian GTK's new instruction, importers  of goods subject to excise tax are required practically before  the contract is fulfilled to transfer to the escrow account in  the customs where the shipment eventually will be processed a  deposit in an amount equal to the value of the expected customs  duty. After the necessary amount is deposited with the internal  customs, this information is to be sent to the customs point  where the shipment will be crossing the border. Without this  exchange of information between customs services, the goods will  not permitted to enter Russia. Everything would seem to be  clear. The goal that is pursued in this is to preclude the  possibility of an import shipment "disappearing" on the way from  the border to the customs clearing point and, correspondingly,  to safeguard the treasury from loss of revenue.    This is where, however, the problems begin, which stem from  the document provisions being insufficiently thought through and  as a result nullifying all good intentions. First, the new rules  for imports of goods subject to excise tax extend not only to  regular imports, but also to re-export and transit. While with  respect to re-export everything is more or less clear--the  problems here mainly involve temporarily tying up the money,  there is confusion with respect to goods coming through in  transit. For instance, it is not clear how to treat the goods  that are on consignment. Since the document does not cover at  all the possibility of goods being delivered in the internal  customs transit mode not only from the border but also from the  customs warehouse, it turns out that whether to process or not  to process the goods subject to excise tax under the new rules  depends entirely on the individual customs inspector.    The necessity of ensuring that the route of goods delivery  from abroad goes only through a specific border point where the  permission to enter has been sent will create additional  complications for importers. It is not always possible to  foresee in which particular place some shipment or other will  cross the border of Russia. One of the factors affecting this  may be that a foreign company with whom the contract is signed  may ship the goods, for instance, from one of its warehouses  abroad. In addition, transport companies that make international  deliveries plan their delivery route taking into consideration  the interests of several clients simultaneously. Finally, the  point of permitted border entry may be "wiped out by an  avalanche" or end up in a war zone. But the simplest obstacle  that makes this document virtually unworkable is customs itself,  because of its imperfect system of operational record keeping  and control over arriving goods, as well as poor training of  customs officers. One way or the other, it is obvious that Order  No. 549 and a number of recently issued documents regarding  entry of goods subject to excise tax will reduce the number of  their importers, which will have a detrimental effect both on  retail trade and the state budget.    [Box, p 2]  <H5>  From the Russian GTK's Order No 549 </H5>   --Money with respect to goods being shipped shall be  deposited in the escrow account of a customs organs in  advance--before the goods actually cross the customs border of  Russia, but no later than 10 calendar days before the expected  date of the goods actually crossing the customs border of  Russia. Money with respect to transit goods shall be deposited  in the escrow account of a customs organ before transit goods  actually cross the customs border of Russia.    --In the event that the customs organ at the departure point  is not in possession of information permitting delivery of  goods, or in the event that the amount of the security bond  shown in the delivery control document (DCD) exceeds the amount  actually deposited with the internal customs organ, the goods  entering the country shall not be sent to the internal customs  organ until the difference is deposited with the internal  customs organs, with the exception of instances when the  difference between said amounts results from a change in the ECU  exchange rate.

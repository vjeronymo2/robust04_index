			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Liability under section 1592 is based upon a finding of culpability and is not limited to the importer of the goods. The penalty provisions reach importers, brokers, manufacturers, shippers, and the like, and may also include aiders and abettors of violations. These penalties serve to punish violators and deter future violative conduct but they do not serve to compensate the Government for harm. It is inapposite to impose standards of reasonable care promulgated by the Mod Act to a bond violation situation. Customs does not believe that the proposed regulation is in conflict with the Mod Act and therefore sees no reason to modify or withdraw the proposed rule based on this comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters suggested that imposition of liquidated damages equal to three times the value of merchandise which is not redelivered serves to punish rather than compensate when the violation involves illegal transshipment of textile merchandise. These commenters noted that an importer could be found to be negligent and incur a 1592 penalty but pay considerably less than a three-times-the-value-of-the-merchandise claim assessed as liquidated damages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Customs response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Illegally transshipped textile merchandise, while prohibited in nature, does not cause a health or safety hazard to the general public. Accordingly, Customs agrees with the thrust of this comment and, therefore, the regulatory text as set forth below, has been redrafted to limit any liquidated damages assessment for transshipment violations to the value of the merchandise involved in the breach. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, for the above reasons, Customs has determined that the proposed regulatory changes should be adopted as a final rule, subject to the textual modifications to the proposed regulatory text as discussed in the above comment analysis and as set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), it is certified that the regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Establishment of a conditional release period for textiles and textile products, which is necessary for law enforcement purposes, will affect only the relatively small percentage of importers who import such merchandise contrary to law. Accordingly, the amendments are not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 19 CFR Part 141 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Bonds, Customs duties and inspection, Entry procedures, Imports, Release of merchandise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Amendments to the Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, Part 141, Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 141), is amended as set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

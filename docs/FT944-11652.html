			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supply tightness grips LME's copper market The London Metal Exchange's copper market was gripped yesterday by extreme tightness and buyers were having to pay a large premium for metal for immediate delivery. 'Anyone who needs copper between now and November 16 is going to have to pay dearly for it,' warned Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Company. Another analyst, Mr William Adams, at Rudolf Wolff, said that LME copper stocks had fallen to a level - representing only 5 1/2 weeks of consumption  -where there was a shortage of physical metal and the backwardation (premium for immediate delivery) was justified. Yesterday at one stage the premium for cash copper over metal for delivery in three months reached Dollars 55 a tonne. At the close the premium had eased back to Dollars 50 as the cash price ended at Dollars 2,754.50 a tonne, up Dollars 41.50, and three-month metal was Dollars 2,704.50, up Dollars 12.50. Mr Bielski pointed out that the cash price had risen sharply in the past two weeks - by Dollars 200 a tonne since October 19 - and 'it seems that some people are short (of metal) and are being squeezed and will have to pay up'. However, he insisted that there was a fundamental shortage of copper and LME prices indicated the supply tightness went out as far as December next year. Mr Bielski said LME stocks were not only relatively low but also in the wrong places - mainly in Europe and not the US where demand was heaviest - and so 'there is no reason why the copper price should not continue its merry way upward'. The price might reach 135 to 140 cents a pound (Dollars 2,975 to Dollars 3,086 a tonne) in the present quarter and go to 150 to 160 cents (Dollars 3,306 to 3,526) early next year, he said. Wolff's Mr Adams suggested that, although the copper price was due for a correction, any dip in the price encouraged more buying. 'There is a lot of financial and non-trade interest in copper and the market is ignoring everything else. People are getting nervous in case this powerful buying continues.' He suggested that it was likely to continue for some time. While the market fundamentals justified a rise in the copper price, Mr Adams added, the investment fund and non-trade buying had accelerated the process 'and we are seeing prices today that we would not otherwise have seen until next year'.</p>

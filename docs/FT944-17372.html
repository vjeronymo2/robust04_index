			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Dartmoor Investment Tst launches bid for Sphere Dartmoor Investment Trust yesterday launched a bid for Sphere, a split capital investment trust due to be wound up in a year's time. Sphere is treating the bid as hostile and has recommended that shareholders take no action as yet. However, Dartmoor appears to have a majority in favour of its offer, which values the shares and warrants in question at Pounds 52.45m. It owns 7.01 per cent of the income and residual capital shares; other funds run by the same manager, Exeter Asset Management, own a further 22.51 per cent, and have indicated acceptance of the offer. Indications of acceptance have also been received from Abtrust Fund Managers, which owns 22.94 per cent of the shares. This would give Dartmoor 52.46 per cent of the shares, but the acceptances are not yet irrevocable. The bid is only for one class of share - income and residual capital - and the warrants. It offers eight new Dartmoor ordinary shares for every 20 Sphere shares, and one new Dartmoor warrant for every four Sphere warrants, which at October 6 prices values the Sphere shares at 42.7p and the warrants at 5.5p. The October 6 mid-market prices were 42.5p and 5.5p respectively. Sphere shares are trading at about asset value, and yield about 10 per cent, while Dartmoor shares are trading at a premium of about 25 per cent, and yield about 11 per cent. The offer would give Sphere shareholders a continuing, increased income stream but possibly a lower capital value. Dartmoor is not bidding for Sphere's zero dividend and cumulative preference shares, which account for about Pounds 100m of the Pounds 150m fund. The board of Sphere announced several months ago that it was looking at options to extend the life of the trust but it has not yet made any proposals. The bid will put pressure on it to do so. The deal would allow Sphere's managers, Marathon Asset Management, to retain the contract until the wind-up.</p>

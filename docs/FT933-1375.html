			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Property: SPOTs that fail to leave a mark - Turning debt into securities 'Securitisation . . . has its appeal. It removes financial assets from the balance sheets of institutions, reduces property exposure, and potentially frees up capital for new lending . . . At the retail end, we could soon see the fuller development of those vehicles that had begun to emerge in the late 1980s, such as SAPCOs, APUTs AND PINCS . . . the debate on SPOTs continues' Pen Kent, associate director of the Bank of England This endorsement of securitisation - the transformation of property debt into a tradeable security - has struck a chord. It is a subject receiving close attention from property financiers attracted by the prospect of offloading some of the Pounds 36bn of debt outstanding to the industry; of injecting more sophistication into the market; and, not least, of its potential for generating fees. There have been several securitisations in the UK; Rosehaugh Stanhope Development, raised Dollars 180m in 1991 in the US commercial property market to refinance one of its Broadgate developments, while the BHH Group issued the first bonds backed by UK commercial property mortgages to be sold in the Euromarkets in 1990. The scale of UK commercial property securitisations is small compared with the US, where the savings and loans debacle in the 1980s, generated the securitisation of Dollars 20bn of commercial mortgages. One difference between securitisation in the UK and the US may be attitude of banks; US banks, faced with tougher regulators, have been more willing to crystallise their losses. Another obstacle in the UK is the higher costs involved in structuring the deal. 'There seems to be an idea that the costs are prohibitive,' says Mr Mark Burton of United Bank of Kuwait, who heads a working party on securitisation for the Association of Property Bankers. He remains optimistic that the problems can be overcome. The related debate on unitisation - the process of splitting the equity in a building into marketable parcels - has also provoked enthusiasm, tempered by some scepticism. For the enthusiasts, the upturn in the market and the buoyancy of equities provide fresh opportunities for unitisation. They believe there is untapped demand for property from investors who do not want the management problems of direct ownership and who believe property shares are an inadequate alternative to owning property outright. But the sceptics doubt the possibility of breathing new life into vehicles such as Single Asset Property Companies (SAPCOs), Single Property Ownership Trusts (SPOTs), Authorised Property Unit Trusts (APUTs) and Property Income Certificates (PINCs), which were devised in the 1980s to improve the liquidity of property. The sceptics believe these vehicles are too complex and their credibility damaged by their failure in the 1980s. The only innovative instrument from the 1980s still trading is the APUT, but even their progress has been feeble. Since September 1991 two APUTs have been launched: Barclays Unicorn Property Trust and Norwich Union Property Trust. Commercial property's recession-stained image has deterred potential investors, although the recent upturn in the market has increased enthusiasm. In August, the Norwich Union Property Trust received Pounds 300,000 from private investors, a 10-fold increase on its monthly average. Other unitisation vehicles of the 1980s have been even less successful. A SAPCO was launched in 1988 by Billingsgate City Securities but it provoked only indifference and was taken off the stock market in 1989. PINCs have been equally disappointing. One of their problems was their complexity. 'We were designing the BMW when people were going around in horse and cart,' says Mr Stephen Barter of Richard Ellis, property advisers. But PINCs' main problem was one of bad timing. In the two years that PINCs took to win approval from the Department of Trade and Industry, market conditions deteriorated, making any launch of a property vehicle unattractive. SPOTs, another 1980s' unitisation instrument, also failed to make their mark, largely because they were not tax efficient. Mr Colin Vaughan of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, property advisers, still believes in SPOTs. 'Were the government to take the bit between its teeth and make minor tax changes and were someone to market it, the conditions would exist in which it could be successful.'</p>

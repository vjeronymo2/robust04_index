			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian president's envoy on the matters associated  with the settlement in Nagorno Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov,  left on Saturday night Baku for Yerevan where he will continue  the talks he started in the Azeri capital on the materialization  of the Russian plan for settlement of the Armenian-Azeri  conflict.    It's a matter of removing obstacles on the way for the  signing of a military-technical protocol and a larger political  agreement, said Kazimirov in an interview to Interfax in Baku.    He believes that each side of the conflict has its own  proposals for the Russian settlement plan and now it is  necessary to draw closer the positions. Kazimirov said that  Baku urges for the earliest withdrawal of the Armenian forces  from the Azeri territories they occupied. For its part, the  Armenian side insists on the beginning of the negotiations on  the status of Nagorno Karabakh.    Kazimirov is expected to return to Baku from Yerevan.    The three-stage plan for the settlement of the Karabakh  conflict envisages the establishment of a lasting ceasefire, the  withdrawal of the troops from the occupied territories, the  exchange of POWs, hostages, the remains of the killed, the  resumption of operation of transport and energy communications,  the return of the refugees and political talks on the future  legal status of Nagorno Karabakh.</p>

According to  the Interior Ministry, this is proof of the effectiveness of  pollice measures regarding aliens.    A total of 160,394 people were turned back at the border,  approximately 49,000 more than in 1992. The number of  expulsions rose from 1,723 to 3,846. The number of deportations  -- 8,857 (plus 1,501) -- almost reached the level of 1991.    Only the number of people who were sent back to the country  where they were previously fell from 8,221 to 5,437. This  refers to people who enter the country illegally and are sent  back to the country where they were previously within 14 days.    The reason the number decreased by so much is mainly because  the number of illegal border crossings recently has been  steadily declining. Romanians, in particular, who used to  attempt to cross the border illegally in relatively large  numbers are not entering the country illegally as often anymore.  The reason for this is relatively simple: Hungarian checks are  much stricter now, and the route through the former Yugoslavia  is largely blocked by the war in Bosnia.</p>

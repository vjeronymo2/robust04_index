			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Gold shares Preparatory work for the new FT Gold Mines index, to be launched later this year, has shown how markedly yields on South African gold stocks have fallen in 1993. From a high of almost 11 per cent in January, yields fell below 4 per cent in July as bullion surged above Dollars 400 an ounce. Even more importantly, the yield gap between South African gold shares and other producers has also narrowed substantially. South African gold shares tend to yield more than North American or Australian stocks, because they work on a fixed mining site and are returning capital to shareholders as the mine becomes exhausted, while others tend to retain the money in the business for further prospecting. The political risk in South Africa also adds to the yield. In part the narrowing of yield is a natural response - gold shares are a geared play on the bullion market. As the highest cost producer, South African mines benefit disproportionately from a rising bullion price. Besides, South African stocks were particularly depressed at the start of the year, so the rise is somewhat unrepresentative. Since the index is compiled in dollar terms, any rise in the bullion price which pushes up the rand will tend to inflate its South African component. Yet since bullion has fallen back, yields on South African shares have only risen slightly. That implies some easing of the political risk premium, which may be further reduced as sanctions are removed. The floundering bullion price will, however, prove the final arbiter.</p>

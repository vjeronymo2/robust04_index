Spokesmen for the Colombian Association of Civilian Pilots  (Acdac) have said, concerning the Barranquilla incident, two  reconnaissance airplanes overflew the city's central zone for  five hours, causing problems in commercial air operations  entering and leaving the Atlantico Department capital.    Meanwhile, the Colombian Defense Ministry and Air Force have  confirmed joint operations with the United States DEA on the  Caribbean coast.    It was learned the military airplanes from Howard Air Force  Base in Panama that overflew Barranquilla on 15 January were  involved in control operations with other FAC [Colombian Air  Force] aircraft.    Air Force spokesmen have said the operations were executed  at  22,000 feet for more than one week.    Following these explanations, civilian pilots have agreed  that these types of operations may take place, provided the  control towers are notified of the aircraft's presence and  positions.    "We reject the fact the authorities, specially the FAC, do  not require U.S. pilots to report their position and avoid  creating chaos as it occurred 15 January in Barranquilla, when  two reconnaissance airplanes overflew the city the entire day  and only at dusk established contact with the control tower,"  said an Acdac pilot.    Moreover, presidential candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano,  currently on tour in Barranquilla, was visibly displeased and  upset by the presence of U.S. airplanes on the northern coast.    Samper has said he shares the people's views, because he  considers as untimely this type of maneuvers in our territory.    He has said President Cesar Gaviria's government should  explain the military maneuvers executed 15 January near  Barranquilla.    Furthermore, Congressman Samuel Moreno Diaz, a member of the  6th Senate Commission, which is in charge of aeronautical  affairs, has said this new incident proves once again there is  no control or coordination between the Civil Aeronautics Board  and the FAC in Colombia.    He has said, generally speaking, the flight plans recorded  for U.S. planes are false and a result of the flight crew's whim  rather than the type of operation they are executing, thus  endangering the lives of hundreds of passengers and--what is  even sadder--violating our airspace, because Colombia lacks the  organization to protect and exercise our sovereignty.    "We have reported often that the FAC has no control  whatsoever over our airspace, and what happens many times is  that the flight controllers in most of the country's airports  unsuccessfully try to contact the foreign planes, yet they have  no flight plans, and no one really knows what they are doing in  Colombian airspace," Senator Samuel Moreno has said.</p>

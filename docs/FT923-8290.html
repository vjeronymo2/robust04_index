			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Personal View: Why dividend cuts are a last resort Dividends and dividend cuts are back in the headlines after last week's announcement by BP. This prompts the question: how much do dividends matter? Over the long haul, they matter a great deal. Ignoring dealing costs, a tax-exempt investor who put Pounds 1,000 into a broad portfolio of UK equities in January 1955 would today have a portfolio worth Pounds 157,000. If the dividend cheques had instead been torn up, the portfolio would be worth only Pounds 25,000. The difference is attributable to dividends and dividend growth. This explains why long-term investors care about dividend growth, and hence about dividend prospects and announcements. Dividend announcements provide important information about the future. This follows from the ground rules companies use to set dividends. First, companies 'smooth' dividends, with changes tending to follow shifts in long-run sustainable earnings. Transitory changes are seldom allowed to affect dividends. Second, companies take future prospects into account, and since managers generally have better information than investors, dividends provide an important communications channel. And third, companies try to avoid dividend cuts at (almost) all costs. These ground rules help ensure that dividends provide a simple, highly visible signal about future prospects. This signal has built-in credibility because it is backed up by hard cash. Evidence confirming the importance of dividend announcements is provided by a recent London Business School research study. This examined nearly 6,000 dividend announcements by UK companies from January 1989 to April 1992. Announcements were divided into five groups: larger increases (more than 25 per cent), modest increases, maintained, cuts and omissions. The left-hand graph shows the cumulative abnormal returns for each of these sub-groups from 20 days before the announcement to 20 days afterwards. Abnormal returns are defined simply as actual returns (capital gains plus dividends) less the returns on a control group of companies of similar size. The share-price reaction to the announcement is consistent with both the direction and magnitude of the dividend change. There are also significant abnormal returns over the 20 days beforehand, and these too are consistent with the subsequently announced dividend. But in the 20 days afterwards there is, on average, little further reaction. The same chart also shows that there is a marked asymmetry between dividend increases and reductions, with reductions conveying the most (and worst) news. In the month leading up to and including the announcement date, the abnormal returns for larger increases, modest increases and held dividends were +3, +1 1/2 , and -  1/2 per cent respectively. Dividend cuts and omissions experienced price falls of 7 and 12 per cent. The study also examined longer-term returns from a year before until a year after the announcement. The most striking finding was the pattern of returns during the year beforehand. For companies which subsequently announced larger increases, modest increases and maintained dividends, the prior-year abnormal returns were +19, +9 and - 5 per cent respectively. In contrast, companies which cut or omitted their dividends showed prior-year abnormal returns of - 26 and - 37 per cent. Once again, however, post-announcement performance is broadly neutral. The second graph focuses on dividend cuts, extending the time frame to a four-year window centred on the announcement. It provides the strongest evidence yet that companies which reduce their dividends have been performing very poorly, and that much of the bad news has been discounted prior to the announcement. Thus over the two-year pre-announcement period, companies which reduced their dividends showed an abnormal return of - 39 per cent ( - 33 per cent for cuts and - 46 per cent for omissions). The larger companies in the sample showed an even greater abnormal return of - 46 per cent, ie: in relative terms they had lost nearly half their value. The right-hand chart also shows that the market's reaction to dividend cuts is not a short-term emotional over-reaction, since, on average, there is no subsequent 'price correction'. For dividend reductions, the two-year post-announcement abnormal return was - 5 per cent, while for larger companies it was -  1/2 per cent. This approximately neutral performance suggests that, on average, the market's assessment was broadly correct when the dividend was announced. Although dividend reductions became far more prevalent in the second half of the period covered, particularly in 1992, research indicates that the share-price reaction to cuts has in no sense mellowed. Companies contemplating dividend cuts can draw a simple lesson from these findings, namely that the market interprets cuts as a powerful signal of bad news. Investors know the ground rules companies follow, and they reason that companies will not cut dividends unless they have to. They also recognise that cutting the dividend has, until now, placed companies in a fairly dubious club of poor performers, with many notorious corporate casualties as fellow members. Many argue that companies should change their ground rules, and make dividend cuts more frequently. One suggestion is that they should maintain a constant pay-out ratio, automatically lowering dividends when earnings fall. This, however, would result in volatile dividends, and would impose costs on investors who have chosen particular stocks for their income requirements. It would also mean that companies could no longer use dividends as signals. Even more importantly, it could let management off the hook. For as long as dividends are viewed as a quasi-commitment, this maintains the pressure on management to find ways of cutting operating costs and improving efficiency. Companies concerned with their shareholders' interests would therefore be well advised to adhere to the conventional ground rules, and adopt a consistent, long-term dividend policy which is appropriate for their clientele of investors, and compatible with the cash needs of their business. But what if the policy ceases to be consistent with the company's cash needs? The worst action companies could take would be to cut back on profitable investment projects, or otherwise to jeopardise the future of the business. This would be short-termist indeed. The choice such companies face, however, is not one of dividends versus investment; potentially they can do both by seeking external financing. Such companies should view this not as a dividend problem per se but as a financing problem. A dividend cut would be one possible solution but, in general, it should be embarked upon only if the situation is truly bleak.

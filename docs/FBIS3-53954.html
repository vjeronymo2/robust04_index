			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This week a two-day seminar devoted to studying the  development process in Central Asia and the Caucasus was held in  Tehran, during which regional and international experts from 17  countries discussed the reasons for and obstacles to development  in Central Asia and the Caucasus.    Qoroqi, one of our political correspondents, has prepared  the  following report on the development process in the Central Asian  republics and the Caucasus:    [Begin recording] [Qoroqi] Economic development in the  republics of Central Asian and the Caucasus cannot be a  phenomenon that is independent from the multifaceted  socio-political-security aspects in these countries. The  obstacles to these republics' development are linked with their  past. Contrasts between the way the people and the government  feel about the implementation of economic projects, as well as  cash-flow shortages are among the main obstacles to development  in these republics.    (Formin), a specialist on regional affairs from Russia  talked  about the obstacles to development in Central Asia and Iran's  role in the development of these countries:    [Formin, in English with superimposed translation into  Persian] Obstacles to the industrial and economic development of  Central Asian countries are extremely extensive and diverse.  The most significant of these obstacles is the economic  instability in these republics and the complete dominance over  these industries by the Russians. Because of their strong  dependence on Russia for technological know-how, these countries  are not able to sever their economic relations with Russia. The  Islamic Republic of Iran's economic cooperation with these  countries is of special importance to them because to them Iran  is like a window to the free world through which they can expand  their relations with the world.    [Qoroqi] Kazem Sajjadpur, a professor at the International  Relations College, also commented on the same topic and said:    [Sajjadpur] Generally speaking, the unspecified nature of  the  security situation in these countries on all levels--on the  individual, national, and regional levels--is the biggest  obstacle to development. In addition, there is the economic  element and the fact that their economic systems are extremely  dependent on Moscow because of the former economic structure,  which cannot be easily changed. At any rate, we should also  view matters from a positive perspective too -- there is some  interest in solving security problems and in moving toward  development in these areas. In other words, it is not a matter  of obstacles only. There is also an interest in solving these  problems. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW: THE BEACH AND REGGAE CROWD  </P> <P> What's better than beach music in a surf bar? Reggae and ska, say the operators  of Toes Tavern in Canoga Park.  </P> <P> The nightspot is part of a three-club chain with a decided beach motif.  Surfboards hang from the ceiling. Pictures of waves and surfers cover the  walls. The DJ booth is a lifeguard stand.  </P> <P> And at a pre-Fourth of July party Tuesday night, the ocean theme will crest  with the giveaway of a $500 long board.  </P> <P> But the music that night won't be from Beach Boys or Jan and Dean.  </P> <P> The group Jah Bone will play songs by Bob Marley, the English Beat and UB40.  </P> <P> "It's fun music, party music," said Jah Bone drummer Ken Kobel. "It's more  danceable than beach music because you get more of a back beat that people can  pick up."  </P> <P> Tuesday night's performance will be Jah Bone's debut at the 55,000-square-foot  Toes Tavern in Canoga Park, which opened in January. But the six-member group  is a veteran of the sister clubs in Redondo Beach and Pasadena.  </P> <P> "In Redondo we get the beach crowd," Kobel said, "and in Pasadena it's more of  a college crowd. They seem to enjoy the music the most. From what I hear, the  Valley crowd is like the one in Pasadena, so I expect we'll have a good time."  </P> <P> Bar manager Dave Radanovich said Toes Tavern draws a young clientele.  </P> <P> "They're 22 to 30 or 35," he said. "It's the white-bread crowd."  </P> <P> The Jah Bone instrumental lineup consists of guitar, bass, drums, keyboard,  saxophone and trombone.  </P> <P> "Some of us were in a group called the Generals for three or four years," Kobel  said. "We played all around Redondo -- the Lighthouse, beach parties, the Toes  club there."  </P> <P> Toes Tavern owner John Stafford said the nightclub chain is named after Toes  Beach in Playa del Rey, which in turn was named for the long-boarding  expression "toes over."  </P> <P> He said reggae music in a surf club "really gets the people moving."  </P> <P> That's gnarly, Marley.  </P> <P>  Jah Bone will play at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday at Toes Tavern, 7230 Topanga Canyon  Blvd., Canoga Park. No cover or drink minimum. Information: (818) 347-7668.  </P> <P> MIKE WYMA  </P></p>

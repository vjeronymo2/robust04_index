			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Letter: Game's up Your economics correspondent is incorrect (''Wise man' attacks wisdom of fellow economists', March 6) in his judgment that 'the authority of the government's new panel of economic advisers . . . has been thrown into doubt . . . by Professor Tim Congdon'. It was thrown into doubt in the first place by the appointment of two ultra-monetarists to the panel. The Treasury cannot be pleased now that Mr Congdon, displaying a political touch equal to his grasp of economics, has given the game away. Christopher Joubert, 48 Haydon Park Road, Wimbledon, London SW19 8JY</p>

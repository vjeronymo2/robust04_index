			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, CPC Central  Committee general secretary; Li Peng, State Council premier; and  Qiao Shi, National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee  chairman, recently gave important written instructions on  comprehensive management of public security in rural areas and  for a national meeting in Suzhou on the comprehensive management  of public security in rural areas.    Jiang Zemin's written instructions were: Public security in  rural areas has an extremely important effect on their stability  and develolpment, and even on the whole country's stability and  development. The current meeting held by the Central Committee  for Comprehensive Management of Public Security [CCCMPS] is very  important. Party and government leaders at all levels should  earnestly carry out all measures laid down by the meeting,  address themselves to practicing comprehensive management of  public security in rural areas, and strive to noticeably improve  public security situations in rural areas within a relatively  short period.    Li Peng's written instructions were: Ensuring good  comprehensive management of public security in rural areas is an  unshirkable responsibility of governments at all levels,  particularly governments at the county and at the township and  town levels. Governments at all levels should strengthen  leadership and endeavor to carry out the CCCMPS's struggle aimed  at improving public security in rural areas; they must make  unremitting efforts to achieve practical results. All  government departments concerned should actively participate in  the work and provide necessary manpower, financial, and material  support, to create necessary conditions for rural economic  development and for the people to live and work in peace and  contentment.    Qiao Shi's written instructions were: To ensure good public  security in rural areas, we must adhere to the principle of  comprehensive management. In particular, we should rally the  enthusiasm of party members, cadres, and peasants in rural areas  and step up our efforts to promote democracy and the rule of law  in rural areas. I hope the CCCMPS will make the current meeting  successful and ensure that all decided measures are truly  carried out.</p>

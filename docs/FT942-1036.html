			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Markets expect banks to support dollar again Financial markets expect central banks led by the US Federal Reserve to repeat early this week - possibly today - their action to lift the dollar against the D-Mark and the yen. Shortly after the Tokyo opening today, bankers reported the Bank of Japan buying dollars at around Y100.1. On Friday the currency closed in New York at Y100.525. The yen's upward assault caused Tokyo stocks to post early losses of about 335 points, or 1.62 per cent. Despite the prospect of support, market analysts were sceptical last night about whether a re-run of Friday's widescale intervention would be enough to boost the US currency. If such action failed, it would encourage market speculation about an imminent rise in US interest rates. A European monetary official warned yesterday that after years in which US government officials had displayed a lack of concern about the dollar, the Fed might be forced into monetary tightening. 'Last Friday the US authorities showed they care (about the dollar) - a bit,' he said. The dollar purchases at the end of last week by 17 central banks including the German Bundesbank failed to lift the currency, which closed on Friday in New York at DM1.584. Traders in New York and London were confident at the weekend that intervention would continue but said this would provide a selling opportunity for those wanting to offload the currency. Mr Stephen Flanagan, of New York stockbrokers PaineWebber, said: 'There is no question that there is an overwhelming amount of bearishness built up against the dollar.' Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland in London, said any further intervention would have to be 'aggressive and concerted' to stop the dollar falling further. But he said selling of the dollar so far this month, during which it fell sharply against the D-Mark and yen, 'has been a long way from an avalanche', with most large institutional investors on the sidelines. The Fed is thought to be preoccupied with helping the US economy to recover, making it less than keen to consider an imminent rise in the short-term federal funds rate, now 4.25 per cent.

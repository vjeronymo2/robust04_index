			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Fed intervenes as yen strengthens THE US Federal Reserve intervened twice on foreign exchange markets yesterday, buying the dollar, after the currency continued to come under strong selling pressure against the Japanese yen. However, the intervention failed to stop the dollar falling to a new low close against the yen in London of Y107.80, from a previous Y108.60. The Fed's intervention followed similar action by the Bank of Japan in Thursday's Asian trading. For the second day running, Mr Lawrence Summers, the US treasury undersecretary for international affairs, was quoted as saying that the US was not trying to manipulate the yen-dollar rate. According to Mr Mark Austin, economist at Midland Global Markets in London, the yen could rise further against the dollar because of perceptions that Japanese life insurance companies are still long of the US currency. However, Mr Mark Brett, economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, believes the yen buying is an over-reaction by dealers. 'The market does not understand that the US is also interested in reducing the Japanese trade surplus by bringing down trade barriers and stimulating demand in the Japanese economy,' he said.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Book Review: A surplus of gloom JAPAN: THE COMING COLLAPSE By Brian Reading Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson. Pounds 18.99. 310 pages Contemporary western writing about Japan tends to fall into a number of distinct genres. There is the American school of Japan-bashing, which relates Japan's unrelenting quest for world economic domination and, in extreme manifestations, how this will lead to war between Japan and the US. At a somewhat subtler level are the revisionists, who seek to describe how Japan organises its economic and social affairs and why this leads it to indulge in unfair international trading. Conversely, there are those writers who simply marvel at the phenomenon that is Japan's economy and want to learn from its success. Japan: The Coming Collapse is, as its title suggests, none of the above. It falls into another genre which appears to be just coming into vogue: the doomsday scenario. The startling thesis advanced by Brian Reading, a former economics editor of The Economist, goes like this: the massive deflation of asset values in the Tokyo stock and real estate markets of the past two years is merely a taste of worse to come; the banking system is on the point of collapse; growing trade friction with other industrialised countries will help to tip the economy into a protracted recession. Worse yet, he argues, governments will fail to produce the necessary political, economic and social reforms, and Japanese politics will move from its current consensual paralysis to a state of confrontation and anarchy. In short, in the book's words, 'this is no economic superpower bent on world domination. It is a hara-kiri economy set to self-destruct.' Reading's analysis is as beguiling as it is compelling. Not the least of its attractions is that it appears to point to a conclusion in which many of us secretly want to believe: that the Japanese economy is so fundamentally flawed that it will soon collapse under the weight of its own contradictions, and in the process become a less daunting competitor. There is only one problem: it is far from clear that the analysis will come true. To be sure, the Japanese economy is not in the best of health right now. Japanese banks are labouring under a bad-debt burden that will take years to sort out. Bankruptcies are at record levels. The stock market is punch-drunk, and property is still going south. The once-invincible carmakers and electronics companies are struggling. The trade surplus is soaring again and Japan's trade partners are looking for weapons with which to lower it. The question is whether this all adds up to Reading's apocalypse, or to a transformation that is less cataclysmic, more complex, and - dare one say? - less susceptible to description in publisher-pleasing one-liners. Reading is at his most plausible and interesting when he is seeking to diagnose what is demonstrably wrong with Japan's economy and society: the defects in its tax system, which suffers rampant evasion and has long failed to collect adequate revenues for the government; the absurdities of its land-use policy, whereby most Japanese city-dwellers are forced to live in little boxes, while urban farmers are subsidised for growing rice on minuscule plots next door; the ills of money politics, and the failure of the political system to cater to the needs of Japanese consumers as well as producers. Where he is less convincing is in suggesting that Japan's problems in these respects are of a different order from those of many other industrial countries.  And where he is not convincing at all is in predicting that all these factors will inevitably combine with the hangover from the 1980s boom to produce an economic and, finally, political mega crisis. The injection of a superficial chapter covering Japan's history, from the beginning to 1945, does not help. Nor does the repeated misspelling of the name of the Federal Reserve chairman, Paul Volcker. The troubling fact is that signs of the meltdown Reading describes are hard to discern in Tokyo. Yes, there is a severe economic slowdown, and yes, the economy probably is in for a prolonged period of slow growth even when it starts to recover. Yes, the financial system is in trouble and will not be a source of cheap and easy credit again for many years to come. Yes, the political system is corrupt - probably irredeemably so. But Japan's is scarcely expected to be the only slow-growth economy in the 1990s, and it will continue to benefit more than some others from its high level of capital investment and savings. And while it is true that investment yields have been miserably low in Japan for years, largely as a result of expectations of never-ending capital growth, it is not automatic that the end of rising share prices will cause investors to demand a quantum leap in yields, as Reading suggests. In short, like all polemicists, Reading overstates his case. This is a shame, because among the prophecies of doom are some telling points about the way Japanese society is changing and in some respects becoming more like the rest of us. The task of writing an authoritative and considered economic history of post-war Japan in English has yet to be accomplished.</p>

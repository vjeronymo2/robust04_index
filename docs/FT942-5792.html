			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (3): Yen for the yen hits dollar  -The strong Japanese currency has upset business The recent trade friction with the US has been highlighted by the Japanese media as the main reason for the yen's rise, but a closer look indicates that there may be more technical forces at work. The capital flows into and out of Japan provide some explanation for the recent trend of a rising yen and a weakening dollar - Japanese investing less in overseas bonds, shares, and golf courses, and foreign investors buying yen to purchase Japanese shares. During the economic 'bubble' of the late 1980s, Japanese institutional investors were the largest suppliers of capital in the international markets. According to the Bank of Japan annual net outflow of long-term capital averaged Dollars 110bn between 1985 and 1989. This fell sharply in the 1990s and in 1992 there was a total outflow of Dollars 28.5bn while last year the outflow was Dollars 78.3bn. The ratio of overseas securities to total investment assets at Japanese life assurers, the country's leading institutional investors, for instance, fell to 9.2 per cent at the end of last year, down from 15.7 per cent in 1989. The customary repatriation of funds during the January-March quarter, the final quarter of the business year, when institutions sell their foreign securities holdings to shore up dwindling profits, has also put downward pressure on the dollar and pushed up the yen. The liquidation of US real estate assets has had the same effect. Last year, Japanese corporations sold or partially disposed of Dollars 17.59bn of US properties, nearly a quarter of the total US property portfolio built up by the Japanese institutions since the start of the investment boom in 1985, according to Kenneth Leventhal, the US accountancy firm. Japanese investors have also reduced the purchase of US financial assets this year because of a tightening of US interest rates. During the final quarter of last year, Japanese institutions bought Dollars 37.5bn of US shares and bonds. That figure declined sharply to Dollars 3.5bn for the first two months of this year. Meanwhile, the buying of Japanese shares by overseas investors has also helped boost the yen. The Bank of Japan says overseas investment in Japanese stocks was a record Dollars 34.5bn during the first quarter, the demand coming mainly from US pension funds. The strong yen has triggered an outcry from the business community, because it affects severely the competitiveness of Japanese companies. The Economic Planning Agency estimates that Japan's export industries are on average competitive at Y117 to the dollar. The Keidanren, the business leaders' federation, reckons each 5 per cent rise in the yen-dollar rate knocks 0.3 of a percentage point off annual gross domestic product growth. But while capital flows may influence the underlying strength of the yen, much of the latest volatility has been caused by speculators. The breakdown of the US-Japan bilateral trade talks - the US is pressurising Japan to cut its large current account surplus by stimulating demand and improving market access - prompted expectations that the US will use the currency market to curb Japanese exports, triggering aggressive buying of the yen against the dollar. But in late April, when the dollar looked like falling to a record low, below Y100, the US Federal Reserve and other central banks stepped in to support the US currency, not least because of the destabilising effect of dollar weakness on the US bond market. Central bank intervention in itself is normally insufficient to support a currency, but some analysts believe that the recent rise in US interest rates, and the easing of short-term money market rates in Japan, will widen interest rate differentials enough to curb the further rise of the yen. Shrinkage of Japan's current account surplus, and lower capital inflows, would assist further. With the US administration seemingly adopting a more moderate stance towards Japan, Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, believes that the yen's appreciation has entered the final phase. 'Over the next few months the yen is expected to weaken toward an exchange rate of Y110 to the dollar,' it says. Others, however, believe the market may yet test the Y100 level before weakening. With both US and Japanese trade officials making positive noises on bilateral trade, the volatility on the currency market which accompanied the breakdown of the talks in March will probably be reduced. Although comprehensive tax reforms may be delayed, due to the minority government, an announcement of a continued income tax cut into next fiscal year is expected to be acceptable to the US. A key issue is when Japanese institutions will start investing overseas? Keeping funds in the domestic markets will not yield attractive returns. The central bank has eased short-term interest rates to historical lows of less than 2.1 per cent, and the domestic bond market offers little better returns, with the compound yield at around 3.8 per cent. However, fears of suffering currency losses on overseas investments as the yen appreciates has kept most investors cautious. The sharp decline in unrealised profits due to the stock market plunge has also wiped out the cushion for possible investment losses, and eroded the Japanese institutions' ability to take risks.</p>

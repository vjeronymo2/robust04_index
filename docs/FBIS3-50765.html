Riquelme, chairman of the ANR's  [National Republican Association -- Colorado Party] Executive  Board took an unexpected turn on 5 January when the latter  disclosed lurid details of the executive head of state's  candidacy.    Riquelme acknowledged that Wasmosy's candidacy had been  imposed on the ANR. His verbatim remarks reveal information  that could have unsuspected implications in shedding light on  Wasmosy's controversial victory, first in the ANR's presidential  primaries and then in the general election.    Riquelme said: "[Wasmosy's] presidential candidacy was  imposed on me. It was imposed on me one evening while he was  present there. I cried because it was an imposition, which was  not prompted by him but rather by the Colorado Party. It is a  long story. He has to give me credit for that event, namely  that I was obliged to accept a candidate whose acceptability on  the part of my fellow party members, the people, was going to be  difficult for me to obtain."    He added that Colorado Party members who accepted this  situation "did everything possible" so the imposed candidate  would stand a chance in the elections.    "We worked our fingers to the bone and we won the elections.  We won the elections but he never says Riquelme helped me, but  rather `he shed tears when my candidacy was imposed on him.'  Wasmosy lacks the virtue of standing up for us. If I were to  disclose everything that was done to win, but I would not like  to discuss that," he stated.    The Colorado Party chairman also warned that this "is the  most serious crisis of all, and is sure not to be the most  serious or the last one because others may occur."  <H5>  The Brother-in-Law's Affair </H5>   With regard to the dismissal of his brother-in-law, Jose  Luis  Yanez Zelada, who was an adviser to Antelco [National  Telecommunications Administration], Riquelme stated: "That is  the excuse those gentlemen have got hold of to justify my  annoyance. All the ministers and people close to (Wasmosy) are  the ones to blame for this. They have voiced this opinion just  to make their boss happy, to give him satisfaction."    "This situation (of friction with the head of state) did not  happen overnight," he said, adding: "It has been dragging on  for a long time -- since the beginning, even since the first  appointments (of ministers) that were made within the new  administration, and Colorado Party members are well aware of  this."    Riquelme added: "The replacement of Antelco's administration  had already been agreed upon in early December. I spoke to Mr.  Wasmosy because I am the chairman of the Colorado Party, which  props up his political stability."    "I told him that he had to exercise extreme caution  concerning Antelco because its managers -- and the financial  statements speak for themselves -- have done a great job of  administration, a very positive one, which generated a  700-percent surplus," he added.    "But after many comings and goings, yesterday (4 January), I  asked the president to produce some evidence that would explain  why he was concerned about Antelco's management and support his  contention that the company's management was an utter failure.  I told him the management was not a failure, that to the  contrary, it was good. Long after, when he was ready to fire  that gentleman, I telephoned him at 1030 (on 4 January) and told  him that I wanted to talk to him about loyalty, a loyalty I do  not know whether I will continue to have to him. He told me to  see him at noon, and I arrived on the dot," he said.    "I told him: Mr. President, you did something I had not  expected. And he answered me: But Riquelme!, you have been  misinformed. It is Kishi [Colonel Eduardo Kishi, the chairman  of Antelco's Board of Directors] whom I have given the sack. I  have not sacked your brother-in-law," noted the Colorado Party  chairman.    Riquelme added: "I answered him that my problem had nothing  to do with my brother-in-law but rather that it lay in a party  issue, a national one, and that Antelco's managers were working  in an honorable way and the problem was that Kishi was being  laid off on the grounds that he was a bad manager and that was  not true."    "Furthermore, Wasmosy said he was going to privatize Antelco  and the Colorado Party was against it. I do not oppose the  privatization of deficit-ridden state enterprises, but I do not  understand why we should privatize a company that is doing well,  is yielding good returns, and has a good manager, for whom I  would go to the stake. I challenge them to prove I am wrong,"  he said.    Riquelme added: "Kishi is a loyal man. When Wasmosy planned  to become president, Kishi was one of the people who helped him  come to power."    Riquelme stated: "This is why I am angry. It is not on  account of my brother-in-law's dismissal. That excuse has been  concocted by the gentlemen (the ministers) who do not know a  thing about politics and who have climbed so high that now they  are fighting tooth and nail to remain in their posts. They want  to justify what is unjustifiable. They want Riquelme to leave,  they want to get rid of him so the Executive Board will be at  the beck and call of one person's whims, of one person's bad  character (like Wasmosy's). It is precisely against this state  of affairs that I am struggling."  <H5>  The Top Leader Says He Will Not Resign </H5>   Concerning the controversy with President Juan Carlos  Wasmosy, Colorado Party Chairman Blas N. Riquelme on 5 January  categorically stated that he will not resign from office and  asserted that he will keep battling on and "enduring whatever  may happen" to defend the ideals of the party he heads.  Riquelme said it is most regrettable that the president had  crossed Antelco's management out with a stroke of his pen  because he suspected they were dishonest.    "I will have to put up with whatever happens because we are  in a democracy and the president has the right to manage  institutions the way he thinks fit," he said.    "After all, sooner or later we will have to hold talks again  in order to govern the country because I am the chairman of the  party that politically buttresses and guides the government," he  pointed out. "In short, I will surely continue here at the  Executive Board and will continue struggling along because those  people, those close to the president, who ill advise him, are  seeking to make Riquelme sever his connection with the Colorado  Party, but that will not happen."    With regard to the latest controversy with Wasmosy, Riquelme  said: "The list of things that I have publicized is something I  had been putting up with for a long time because I have  prostrated myself at his feet to keep him (Wasmosy) company, to  plead with him, to go to his home, to greet him and offer him  solidarity. And to cap it all, he fires a cannon ball at us. I  do not say that he should not do these things, but he ought to  tell us, Colorado Party members, so we can come to a decision by  consensus."    Riquelme told the executive head of state: "You are  responsible for the government and, as you say, have your own  fountain pen and you are the owner of your fountain pen, but  don't you think you can drop your own fountain pen if the party  withdraws its support?"</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: NZ Telecom advances 21% TELECOM Corporation of New Zealand yesterday unveiled a 21 per cent rise in net profit to NZDollars 402.3m (USDollars 216.1m) for the year to March 31, slightly above the target of NZDollars 401m set during last year's international share float. Mr Peter Shirtcliffe, chairman, said the result was achieved despite sluggish economic conditions and increasing competition. He forecast the company would post another record year in the coming year. Telecom lifted revenue 5.6 per cent to NZDollars 2.57bn, with the biggest growth coming from the sale of directories and the provision of cellular and other new services. Combined revenue from these operations jumped 26 per cent to NZDollars 671m, boosted by new 'smart phone' and free national dialling 0800 numbers. Competition from rival Clear Communications held growth in revenue from national calls to 1.1 per cent, or to NZDollars 548.6m. The company handled 10 per cent more national calls during the year. Telecom's revenue on local services fell 11.5 per cent to NZDollars 840.7m. It maintains it must subsidise these services as increases in charges are limited by the 'Kiwi share' agreement with the government. Mr Tom Burns, acting chief executive, said the company was 'sitting on a gold mine' of cost reductions based on new technology introduction. He said Telecom would cut a further 1,200 jobs in the 1992-93 year, after a 9 per cent drop from 13,562 in the past year. Telecom's operating expenses rose by 22.6 per cent to NZDollars 1844m. Maintenance costs dropped seven per cent, while depreciation was up nine per cent. Telecom ended the year with a cash surplus of NZDollars 76m after two years of deficits. It is to pay a final dividend of 6.5 cents a share, making a total 13 cents for the year.</p>

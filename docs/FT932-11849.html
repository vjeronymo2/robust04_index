			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Bonds: Bupa makes its Euromarket debut with Pounds 100m offer BUPA, Britain's biggest private healthcare group, made its debut in the Eurobond market yesterday with a Pounds 100m, 25-year issue aimed primarily at UK institutional investors. The deal, which is subordinated, has a coupon of 10.5 per cent and is callable at par after 20 years. Mr Edward Lea, finance director at Bupa, said the money would be used to provide additional capital 'so that we can continue the development of our private medical insurance business'. Bupa has seen a turnround in its financial position, reporting a 1992 pre-tax surplus of Pounds 36.5m last month, against a 1991 surplus of Pounds 1.3m and a 1990 loss of Pounds 38.2m. Mr Lea said the deal complied with the new EC third non-life insurance directive, under which an insurance company can count long-term subordinated loan capital for solvency margin purposes. The solvency margin will rise to 50 per cent from 45 per cent as a result of the fund raising, according to lead manager Samuel Montagu. The deal was generously priced to yield 185 basis points over the 9 per cent gilt due 2012 and the spread later tightened to 183-184 basis points. The lead manager looked at several recent subordinated debt deals for banks and building societies in order to establish a price for Bupa's first offering in the capital markets. For example, earlier this year, the Leeds Permanent Building Society launched a Pounds 150m issue of subordinated bonds due 2018 which was priced to yield 140 basis points over the comparable gilt, and whose yield spread has narrowed to 134 basis points. The Royal Bank of Scotland launched a Pounds 150m 20-year issue of subordinated bonds at around the same time, priced to yield 140 basis points more than the comparable UK gilt. The spread on these bonds has narrowed to around 118 basis points. Bupa, which is a provident association, lacks a credit rating but is likely to seek one soon. Elsewhere, British Gas tapped the Eurolira market yesterday with a L150bn, 10-year issue. The bond, which has a 10.75 per cent coupon, was swapped into sterling to give attractive sub-Libid money (Libid is 12.5 basis points below Libor). Deutsche Bank, which owns the lead manager BAI, said the bonds were priced at 101.71 and traded outside the full fees at 99 5/8 on the bid side, blaming the weakness of the Italian market. The Eurobond market continues to see the launch of more collared floating-rate notes which have been a regular feature of the market in recent months. New deals were launched yesterday for the Mortgage Bank of Denmark and Credit Commercial de France. The Dollars 100m deal for Mortgage Bank of Denmark, lead managed by Kidder Peabody, pays 30 basis points below six-month Libor and has a floor of 5 per cent and a cap of 8 per cent. The deal was swapped to provide sub-Libor funding for the borrower, which is state-owned and has a AA1/AA+ credit rating.</p>

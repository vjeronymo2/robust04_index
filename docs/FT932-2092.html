			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / BR compensation below estimates COMPENSATION paid to British Rail passengers since the Passenger's Charter was introduced has slumped by far more than was estimated last month, figures published by BR show. The total paid in the year to March was Pounds 1.9m, compared with BR's estimate of more than Pounds 3m last month and a figure of Pounds 7m for the last full year before the charter was introduced. BR said discounts for season-ticket holders had applied for only a small part of the year.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Arts: A disappointing La Boheme - Opera The new English National Opera Boheme is an occasion of several notable firsts: first new production of the opera in London for 15 years; first new production of the 1993-94 season and of the Dennis Marks-Sian Edwards ENO administration; first Coliseum new production to be conducted by Miss Edwards; first ENO collaboration of Steven Pimlott (producer) and designers Tobias Hoheisel (sets) and Ingeborg Bernerth (costumes); house debuts of the American soprano Roberta Alexander (Mimi) and the Welsh baritone Jason Howard (Marcello); first outing for the new Jeremy Sams translation. It is, as it happens, not the first Boheme to have left me utterly untouched  -uncharmed in the early acts, unmoved in the later - but it is one of the most completely disappointing. While evidently much hard thought and concern for practicability went into its preparation, the total effect, as executed on Wednesday, is of a strained, fitful ingenuity circumscribing the opera's emotional amplitude. That the music seems to be offered in exact parallel - with bright moments in the orchestral delivery and passing pleasures of vocal utterance but with no overall unity of style or command of dramatic paragraph - hardly helps. Pimlott and his team have updated the opera to Paris in the 1950s (even if period detail seems vague, sometimes contradictory). Their more widely publicised novelty is to have joined up the four acts without interval and presented them in a single set - a large, cold, ugly 'studio space' divided down the middle by columns, capable of responding to different scenic demands at speed though seldom with any gain in real dramatic fluidity (the Barriered'Enfer roll-call makes no sense whatsoever). In a programme note the producer suggests that doing the opera this way might permit a fresh concentration on ENO at the London Coliseum, St Martin's Lane, WC2: in repertory until October 27; production sponsored by The IIR Group. the opera's 'labyrinth of relationships', a fresh illumination of the distinction between the everyday and the poetic in its dramatic unfolding (underscored by Hugh Vanstone's fidgety lighting plot). I understand the point he hoped to make. I find little evidence that he has actually done so. The Left Bank revelry is a Big Number - Musetta, a tall, svelte Crazy Horse siren as embodied by the handsome, warm-voiced Cheryl Barker, strips to her gaine-combinaison atop a table - indicating that Mr Pimlott's success in West End musicals has a heavy influence. Even here, however, a joyless pseudo-efficiency blights the scene's simpler pleasures (apart from an indomitable, word-relishing Alcindoro from Donald Adams, which he doubles with Benoit). Most of the time the production is a Boheme graph-analysis rather than a full-blooded Boheme experience. There are exceptions to this rule: the precisely touched-in details of the Bohemians' domestic life and their different psychological roles therein (Christopher Booth-Jones's prissy, super-sensitive Schaunard and Andrew Slater's Colline, surface-fuzzy but razor-sharp beneath, are two of the show's plusses), and Marcello's exuberant, volatile temperament (Jason Howard, in spite of intermittent excesses of unvaried loudness, is the evening's star). For once, unfortunately, Jeremy Sams's skill as deviser of new and witty English rhyme-schemes and word-plays comes across as fearfully self-conscious, and so the mood of the domestic encounters tends to be compromised. Miss Edwards's first ENO Boheme veers between galumphing boisterousness, with word-covering and voice-drowning a perpetual threat, and swoony sentimentality. She is alive to the beauty and exact purpose of Puccini's Act 3 scoring; her reading will surely develop beyond this erratic, unfocused start. She needs to cherish her Rodolfo a good deal more - John Hudson, pure-toned, small-scaled, inexperienced - and likewise cosset Miss Alexander's 'difficult' (and on Wednesday sometimes fugitive) top register. As an admirer of this soprano's heartbreaking Glyndebourne Jenufa and, in general, of her distinctively colourful vocal style, I admit to a special disappointment at the curiously blank quality of her ENO Mimi. She has been invited to underplay the illness, a good idea that - like the staging as a whole - seems to have gone badly wrong somewhere between rehearsal room and opening-night performance.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Recall standards. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The key premise of the enhanced in-use compliance recall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program is that vehicles meet their certified emission levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout their entire useful life. The standards which will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply under the enhanced in-use compliance recall program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LDVs, LDTs and MDVs will be those in the tables presented above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Section A.(2). Calculation of composite NMHC emissions will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be according to the equation also presented in Appendix I.A.2.a.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Consideration of maintenance, tampering, and abuse. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For 49 state vehicles, CAA section 207(c) limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers' responsibility to those vehicles that have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``properly maintained and used.'' Manufacturers are able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclude vehicles that do not receive such care or cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proven to have received such care from the recall testing pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or, if they believe that such vehicles have been included,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge the validity of any findings made. Due to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitation, EPA generally only tests vehicles that have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained and used in strict accordance to the owner's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance manual. It is particularly difficult to find older  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles with sufficient documentation or to prove ``proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care.'' The current program, therefore, provides little incentive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the manufacturer to design and build vehicles with durable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions performance under normal or typical maintenance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As mentioned in the introduction in Section 2.d of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble, the primary goal of the enhanced in-use compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program is to ensure that vehicles remain in compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions standards in use over their full life under normal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating conditions. If motor vehicles are to cease to be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major source of ozone-related emissions and noncompliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NAAQS for ozone, manufacturers must make greater efforts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure continued in-use emissions performance. Therefore, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes not to exclude vehicles from recall testing unless they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been subject to obvious abuse or tampering. Obvious abuse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or tampering includes: (1) Less than one half the recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level of oil in the engine, (2) the deliberate removal of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalyst or evaporative canister, (3) the turbocharging of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> naturally aspirated engine, and (4) damage to the engine or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission controls resulting from a vehicular accident. EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to exclude such vehicles from recall testing because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such actions can severely affect vehicle emissions and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer has no reasonable way of controlling or limiting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of these items on emissions. EPA requests comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other specific items that would meet these criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, EPA will not perform a vehicle ``tune-up'' or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform other emission related repairs or maintenance before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing. EPA believes that pre-recall maintenance would defeat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the purpose of the enhanced in-use compliance recall program,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is to further encourage durable designs. Even hoses whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proper connection is critical to acceptable emission performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be designed to be unlikely to disconnect during normal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance and use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with current recall testing, EPA will inspect vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to testing to determine if obvious abuse or tampering has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred. As is current EPA practice, the vehicle manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be present at time of vehicle procurement and testing to help  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that vehicles are appropriately screened for obvious abuse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and tampering problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is also important to point out, as will be discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more detail in the next section, that only vehicles which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the new enhanced I/M program are candidates for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced in-use recall testing. Participation in this  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I/M  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program should encourage owners to perform reasonable maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and deter emission related tampering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Again, EPA requests comments on the types of abuse or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tampering which would allow for the exclusion of vehicles from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recall sample. Commenters should provide supporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rationale and data to the extent practicable so that EPA may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ascertain the severity, likelihood, and possible mitigating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Test vehicle selection. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA proposes to select vehicles for enhanced in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance recall testing from the portion of the vehicle family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population that is subject to the enhanced I/M testing program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above. This would essentially limit testing to only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles that are registered in one of the three FIP areas,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless the State of California opts to adopt enhanced I/M  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures in other areas of the state. EPA is proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit the sampling in this way because recall testing resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are limited and the vehicles registered in the three FIP areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are the most relevant with regard to air quality in these areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, problems that cause noncompliance within this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpopulation of vehicles are very likely to exist in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population as a whole. The reverse may not be true because I/M  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be insuring reasonable maintenance and catching and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correcting emissions problems. EPA believes it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriate to require a recall campaign due to a problem found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside of a FIP area that enhanced I/M would have possibly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comments on the above sampling methods. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also requests comments on other alternatives, including limiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sampling to vehicles subject to basic I/M as well as enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I/M or sampling from the entire state's vehicle population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d. Testing throughout the vehicle's useful life. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA proposes to conduct recall testing throughout the useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life of the vehicles specified in the applicable regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA would also require any necessary remedial actions to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed on all vehicles in the vehicle family still within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their useful life. EPA believes that conducting recall in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner is consistent with the intent of the enhanced in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance program, which is to hold the manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for in-use emissions compliance over the full useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / City baffled by timing and size of cut City economists and opposition politicians at Westminster were baffled both by the timing of yesterday's interest rate cut and by its size. They argued that the 0.25 percentage-point cut was unlikely to have any impact on economic recovery - and one leading City economist was concerned that the move had coincided with new political difficulties for the government. Treasury ministers stressed that the cut reflected a more optimistic assessment of inflation prospects rather than concern about the pace of economic recovery. Mr Michael Portillo, chief Treasury secretary, said that officials at the Treasury and Bank of England had scrutinised a range of indicators showing that inflation was subdued - and that this was the principal factor behind the policy easing. He stressed that there was no reason to doubt that the recovery in the UK could be sustained, and he dismissed suggestions that the decision was designed to offset the unsettling effect on world equity markets of last Friday's 0.25 percentage-point rise in US interest rates. 'This has nothing to do with elections and tax rises,' Mr Portillo said. 'It has everything to do with wanting to have interest rates as low as they can be, consistent with maintaining a downward pressure on inflation.' Opposition MPs doubted that the easing of monetary policy would improve economic prospects. Mr Andrew Smith, a Labour Treasury spokesman, welcomed the cut but believed it would do little to offset tax rises, which could check the economic recovery. He said the cut was so small that home owners might perversely regard it as the final easing in UK monetary policy. The Institute of Directors also said it was difficult to understand the logic behind the UK authorities' decision. 'A  1/4 per cent cut is unlikely to have any major impact on the economy and may be seen more as a morale booster,' said Dr Ann Robinson, head of the IoD institute's policy unit. 'We can only assume that the chancellor of the exchequer is now developing his strategy to offset the impact of the tax increases, which will remove large quantities of money from people's pockets and damage the recovery.' Mr Gavyn Davies, managing director at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, welcomed the easing in monetary policy. But he was disappointed that the rate cut had occurred on the same day that the government was embarrassed by the mysterious death of one of its backbenchers. He said the UK authorities needed to quell the suspicion in financial markets that the timing of recent rate cuts had been inspired by political difficulty rather than economic reality. Mr Graham Mackenzie, president of the Engineering Employers Federation, said: 'We welcome the cut in rates, we would have liked more but every little helps.' Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'I don't think a cut of 0.25 per cent will make a huge difference to business, but it is obviously a move in the right direction.'</p>

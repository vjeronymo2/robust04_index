			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Chile's traders adjust to less exhilarating events - The equity slowdown in Santiago The heady days of 1991, when the Santiago stock exchange leapt by 124 per cent in dollar terms, are long past. Chile's traders are adjusting to less exhilarating rates of return as the export-dominated economy, which expanded by 10.2 per cent last year, adapts to more difficult worldwide trading conditions. However, excitement is not totally absent. In June, after a sluggish three months dominated by worries over the falling price of copper, cellulose and fish meal, the IPSA index of the 40 most heavily traded shares rebounded by around 10 per cent in dollar terms. The rally, according to Mr James Walker, head of research at Celfin Consultants, was prompted by the recovery in the copper price, the country's main export, as well as signs that the domestic economy, which had been in danger of overheating, was beginning to cool. Mr Walker expects GDP to grow by a relatively modest 6 per cent this year. In July the equity market had mixed and ultimately marginal fortunes, with the IPSA 40 gaining nearly 1 per cent to close the month at 114.62. The month was dominated by uncertainty over forthcoming first-half results, and a lack of liquidity in financial markets which pushed up short-term interest rates. In the event, most company results were significantly down on the same period last year, but many fared better than in the first quarter of 1993. CTC, the telecommunications group, and Chile's biggest quoted company with an equity market capitalisation of around Dollars 3bn, bucked the downward trend by registering a strong growth in profits, as did Soquimich, the mining company, which saw profits rise 86 per cent to Dollars 13.2m after last year's restructuring. The beverage industry also did well as it responded to growing local demand. A return to liquidity in the system in August and a feeling that results had not been as bad as expected contributed to a 4 per cent rise in the first week of trading. The IPSA index at one stage touched 118.84, its highest level of the year, closing on Monday at 118.51. Cervezas, the brewing group, and Entel the telephone company, were among the highest risers. Most analysts remain optimistic about the prospects of the big four electricity groups in spite of heavily-dented first-half profits. The country's electricity generators and suppliers, among the largest companies on the Santiago bolsa with equity capitalisations of up to Dollars 2 1/2 bn, have big stakes in Argentina's newly privatised electricity industry. Analysts expect these investments to begin to show profits from early next year. The banking sector looks more uncertain. A bill aimed at resolving the subordinated debt issue, which has dogged banks since the central bank took over their bad debts in the early 1980s, is expected to go before congress this month. Some banks have expressed unease over government proposals, but most analysts, including researchers at Salomon Brothers, feel that the banks should benefit from a resolution of the issue. The same uncertainty has been felt over capital markets reform, which aims to broaden the investment options of institutions, particularly the powerful pension funds or AFPs. Mr Karl Kluever, manager of Vestcorp Chile, the stockbroker, says that institutions are adopting a 'wait and see attitude'. Although much of the effects of the reform, which should come into effect over the next few months, are already reflected in share prices, there is expected to be some realignment of portfolios as the AFPs buy into second-tier stocks. Institutions are currently restricted to blue-chip companies. Most traders believe that the Santiago bolsa, though less spectacular than some other Latin American markets, notably Peru, is likely to remain a fairly safe bet. Interest rates seem set to come down as inflationary pressures ease, while big Chilean companies, like Soquimich, are still queueing up to make ADR issues. Researchers at First Boston believe that the two trends should combine to produce 'good upside potential in the medium to long term'. Mr Kluever predicts that the bolsa will yield a real return of around 14-16 per cent by the end of the year, an assessment which is more or less in line with that of most other analysts.</p>

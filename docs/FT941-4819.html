			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: PosGold market raid ends battle for Aztec Mining The ADollars 287m (USDollars 206.5m) battle for Sydney-based Aztec Mining, the metals group, came to an abrupt end yesterday. PosGold Investments, part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, snapped up more than three-quarters of its shares in a stock market raid. The victory came just a day after PosGold lifted its cash offer for Aztec from 68 cents a share to 74 cents, and waived certain conditions, allowing it to buy its target's shares in the market. No sooner had dealing opened yesterday, than it was announced that Alumax, the US group which held a 37 per cent interest in Aztec, had sold its shares to PosGold at the higher price. By late afternoon, PosGold said it had raised its interest to around 85 per cent of Aztec's equity. Aztec directors, who had previously recommended an all-paper merger with Pancontinental Mining, reluctantly urged other shareholders to follow suit. They acknowledged that the fall in Pancon's price since its bid was announced meant that offer was worth less than PosGold's. 'While directors do not believe that the revised PosGold offer reflects the full value of Aztec, in view of the fact that control of Aztec will now pass to PosGold the directors recommend to shareholders that they accept the revised PosGold offer of 74 cents per share, rather than the Pancontinental offer,' they said. Aztec shares ended the day six cents higher, at 74 cents, while the bid's success lifted PosGold by 14 cents, to ADollars 3.20. Pancontinental also gained. Its shares rose 12 cents to ADollars 1.82.</p>

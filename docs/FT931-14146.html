			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / People: Maurice Warren to chair SWEB Maurice Warren, who retires as chief executive of Dalgety next June at the age of 60, has begun to look around for two or three non-executive directorships; the first he has accepted is as deputy chairman and chairman-designate of South Western Electricity (SWEB). At the time of their privatisation, the regional electricity companies tended to have an executive who combined the role of chairman and chief executive with a managing director one rung below that. SWEB is now the third company to split the roles, and to appoint a part-time chairman from outside the group - conforming with current corporate fashion. Hence, in the first of the changes, John Seed, formerly managing director, was made chief executive before Christmas, while Bill Nicol remains chairman until the agm in August when Warren will take over. 'We like the company anyway, but we like it a bit more now,' was the comment of one analyst who reckoned that Nicol had not come across particularly well in the City. Nicol says SWEB, which engaged a firm of headhunters to make the appointment, was looking for someone who came from the West Country - Warren hails from Somerset and definitely has the accent to prove it - as well as someone who had successfully led a major company through change. 'We are all outstanding engineers but we need another perspective,' says Nicol. In his four years at the top of Dalgety, Warren is credited with masterminding a fundamental restructuring of the group, which he says meant he had to keep his head down, leaving no time for any non-executive directorships. Now he already has one or two other irons in the fire for his retirement, though he plans to spend two days a week with SWEB.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Titaghur losses up to Pounds 2.14m The accumulated deficit at Titaghur, owner of six jute mills in Calcutta, rose to more than Pounds 63m following an interim loss of Pounds 2.14m on turnover of Pounds 15m for the six months to September 30. The comparable figures were losses of Pounds 426,000 on turnover of Pounds 12.1m. Mr Reg Brealey, chairman, referred in his statement to the same adverse trading conditions that hit the full-year results, announced in January. He blamed 'a shortage of raw materials and a massive increase in their cost over the harvest purchase price'. He does not envisage any significant improvement in the second half. However, he sees the benefits of recent negotiations with trade unions and Indian authorities coming through in the year to end-March 1995.</p>

The Hartley/Merrill Prize, which includes $10,000 and the promise  of Writer's Guild minimum if the screenplay is produced in this country, was  created to encourage interchange between Soviet and American writers and film  makers. The Writer's Guild of America and the U.S.S.R. Screenwriters' Guild are  co-sponsors of the award. The competition winner will pick up the prize at a  televised ceremony in Moscow in May.  </P></p>

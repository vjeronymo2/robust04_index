			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Listing for GRT Bus GRT Bus Group, the Aberdeen-based bus and coach operator, is to seek a listing next month. The flotation is likely to be by way of a placing arranged by James Capel. The company was formed to effect a management-led employee buy-out in January 1989 of Grampian regional council's bus and coach operations, when Grampian Regional Transport became the first Scottish municipal bus company to be privatised. The group employs 1,850 people and operates a fleet of 725 vehicles. Employees currently hold 39 per cent of GRT's equity and the management a further 51 per cent. Since the buy-out, GRT's turnover has risen from Pounds 11.8m in 1989 to Pounds 32m in the year to March 1993, with operating profits rising from Pounds 850,000 to Pounds 3.6m. This excludes the Leicester and Northampton operations - acquired in the latter part of 1993 - which had 1992-93 turnover and profits of Pounds 16.8m and Pounds 894,000.</p>

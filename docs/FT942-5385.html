			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: CGT and the Revenue The Inland Revenue's promised revision of its concession on assets of negligible value in relation to capital gains tax was published this week*, writes Maurice Parry-Wingfield, of accountant Touche Ross. The purpose of making a claim for negligible value is normally to crystallise (for CGT purposes) a loss which may then be set against liability on other gains. The concession allows the taxpayer some flexibility in choosing the most useful tax year in which to make the claim - but with the caveat that the choice should not allow him to get more indexation allowance than the Pounds 10,000 transitional relief announced in April. A negligible value claim made after November 29 1993 (Budget day) might still be backdated to an earlier time when the asset had a negligible value. But the indexation allowance up to the date of that deemed disposal can be relieved - up to the aggregate of the Pounds 10,000 transitional relief announced previously - only in 1993/94 and 1994/95. In order to take advantage of the transitional relief, the negligible value claim must be made by April 5 1995. Whether it should be backdated, so as to give rise to an earlier deemed disposal, will depend upon the individual's mix of gains and losses on other assets, losses brought forward, and annual exemption. The table provides an example of an asset that became of negligible value on June 1 1993 and for which a negligible value claim is submitted on April 1 1995. In this case, the claim should not be backdated because a year's annual exemption would be forfeited - and the indexation reduced. *Extra-statutory concession D28  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NEGLIGIBLE VALUE CLAIMS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Deemed disposal                                1/6/93              1/4/95 (Pounds 000)             1993/94   1994/95   1993/94   1994/95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gains in year               15.0      25.0      15.0      25.0 Loss on deemed disposal    (10.0)                        (10.0) Indexation                  (2.0)                         (2.5)                              3.0                          12.5 Other losses (93/94 only)   (7.0)               (7.0) Losses c/f and b/f         *(4.0)     (4.0) Annual exemption                      (5.8)     (5.8)     (5.8) Taxable                               15.2       2.2       6.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Tax saving through not relating back 15.2-(2.2+6.7)=6.3 x (say) 40% = 2.5 *Including second indexation allowance which can only be used in 1994-1995  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Touche Ross  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / MP demands to see Lamont on Equatorial MR KEITH Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, last night demanded an early meeting with Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, over the Bank of England's role in the collapse of Equatorial Bank, to which administrators were appointed on Friday. Mr Vaz said that at a meeting on Thursday night Equatorial Bank officials asked the Bank of England to make up a shortfall of between Pounds 7m and Pounds 10m to allow it to continue trading. According to Mr Vaz this request was refused and administrators were called in under insolvency laws. The Bank of England refused to comment. Mr Vaz said: 'I will be pressing the chancellor at the earliest opportunity on the issue of why the Bank of England did not intervene.' More than 90 per cent of Equatorial's 3,000 customers in the UK are of Asian origin. Mr Vaz told a meeting of about 100 creditors, customers and employees in London yesterday: 'This is further pressure on the Asian community at a very difficult time.' Accountants Ernst &amp; Young were appointed administrators following a petition from directors. High provisions against bad and doubtful debts led to fears that the bank would have inadequate capital. The bank is believed to have suffered a loss of liquidity because some customers withdrew deposits after publicity surrounding the closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1991. The administrators said that the draft balance sheet of the bank, which has Pounds 117m of assets, showed that it was still solvent it was hoped that all creditors would be paid in full. A creditors' meeting will be held within three months. The bank is believed to have a number of depositors in east Africa and India. Its customers in the UK are concentrated among the Gujarati-speaking community and include many Asian small businesses. Ernst &amp; Young said that the administration had been caused by the large provisions the bank had made 'which resulted in prospective capital inadequacy for regulatory purposes'. The bank is licensed and supervised by the Bank of England. In the bank's last published annual report, for the year to September 1991, pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 549,474 compared with Pounds 879,282 for the previous year.</p>

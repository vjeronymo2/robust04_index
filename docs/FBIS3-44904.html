			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, January 7 (XINHUA) -- German Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel said today that the forthcoming NATO summit will  offer closer cooperation with East European states, but is not  likely to accept them immediately into the military alliance.    Kinkel was speaking to reporters three days before the NATO  summit meeting in Brussels, which is expected to offer all East  European states and Russia closer military links through a  so-called "partnership for peace" program.    "What East European countries want now is something they  cannot get, at least not in the initial phase," Kinkel said.    NATO has decided to involve East European states in closer  bilateral military relations but because of opposition from  Russia has not agreed to offer them full membership at the  present time.    On Thursday [6 January], Russian President Boris Yeltsin's  chief spokesman said that NATO's acceptance of East European  states as full members could wreck reforms in Russia, boost  extreme nationalism, infuriate the Russian Army and force Moscow  to set up its own military-political bloc.    Germany was one of the first NATO members to back bids for  membership in NATO from a number of East European states,  including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic and Slovak.    Kinkel told the reporters that Germany has done "all it  could" to bring East European states closer to NATO membership  but that they were exerting "unrelenting pressure" on Germany to  persuade NATO to offer them security guarantees.</p>

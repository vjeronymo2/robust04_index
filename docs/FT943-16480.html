			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: As the world's leaders prepare for the G7 meeting on Friday, they can mull over a feast of policy meetings and statistics this week. In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan's branch managers meet today. Meanwhile, May's trade figures are expected to show a small fall in the Japanese trade surplus - though analysts doubt that this will provide much support for the dollar against the yen. Tuesday: After French unemployment hit a record high last week, output figures today should be more comforting for the government. Analysts expect to see a small monthly rise, suggesting the recession has bottomed out. Meanwhile, German manufacturing figures, expected today or tomorrow, are likely to also point to a slow industrial pick-up, ahead of the Bundesbank's council meeting on Thursday. Friday: A spate of US data at the end of the week will be watched with interest by the markets in light of any decision that the FOMC may have taken on Tuesday to raise US interest rates. June's non-farm payroll is expected to show a strong 250,000 rise on the month, while May's consumer credit is expected to fall.</p>

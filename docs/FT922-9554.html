			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A SERIES of large buying orders early in the session sent stock index futures sharply forward and led the underlying cash market higher, writes Joel Kibazo. Early trading in the June contract on the FT-SE had pointed to a quiet session as it retreated 9 points with dealers digesting the poor overnight performance on Wall Street and the weakness in the gilts market on Tuesday. However, a turnround was staged mid-morning as James Capel, along with several leading US houses, went on a shopping spree. June moved ahead on the orders, but it was a large early afternoon order from international futures trader Cargill, said to have been acting for a US investment fund, that triggered a further squeeze. A firm Wall Street only served to underline the positive mood. June closed at 2,737, up 35 from the previous session and around 24 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover reached 9,006 lots. Volume in the traded options market reached 32,794 contracts, of which the FT-SE 100 option accounted for 8,914 contracts. Amstrad was the busiest stock option, trading 2,831 lots, with the June 30 calls the most traded series.</p>

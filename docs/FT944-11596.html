			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Japan grapples with law of the gun: A string of violent crimes has shaken citizens Repeated screenings on national news programmes of the blood-stained Aomono Yokocho train station in south Tokyo where Dr Takejiro Okazaki was apparently gunned down by a former patient last week have reminded viewers that Japan may not be as safe as they imagine. Japan has long prided itself on the safety of its streets and the reliability of its police force, if not to halt crime then at least to contain it in certain neighbourhoods. However, a string of violent crimes against citizens, such as the murder of Dr Okazaki, has shaken confidence in the force's abilities. The branch manager of Sumitomo Bank in Nagoya, the president of a video distribution company in Kyoto and the head of a toy company in Tokyo are among a growing list of victims of fatal attacks this year. What has particularly shocked the public is that more crimes are being committed with guns. The murder of Dr Okazaki sent a strong message to citizens that gun use is more widespread than most had suspected. According to the national police, 1,672 guns were confiscated last year, 73 per cent more than the 963 weapons taken by police three years earlier. The rising number of gun-related crimes in Japan is widely seen as a consequence of several factors combining to ease access to weapons: the country's growing internationalisation; the ripple effects of the collapse of the former Soviet Union; and the greater pressures Japan's gangsters are feeling in the face of a police crackdown and the burst of the bubble economy. 'The illegal spread of guns is a key result of internationalisation,' the National Police Agency recently claimed. One new source of firearms, for example, has been the growing number of ships carrying Russian tourists and businessmen. Prof Kazuo Shimada, of the sociology department at Kawamura Gakuen Women's University, points out that these ships and others from China and Taiwan are used as a channel for illegal imports, including guns. The arms are believed to be offloaded at sea, rather than after the ship has docked, thus making it difficult for Japanese police to stop the trade. 'Japanese society is feeling the after-effects of the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the end of the cold war,' he says. Many of the guns coming into Japan belonged to Russian soldiers who no longer have a use for them. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that such external changes would have opened Japan's doors to so many guns and increased gun-related violence if it were not for the profound social changes taking place within Japan in the aftermath of the rapid economic growth seen in the late 1980s. The economic slowdown afflicting corporate Japan has hurt the underworld as well. Gangsters, who had mostly confined violent crime to the underworld, are turning to violence against the man in the street and selling firearms to raise cash. According to the police, the last time there was a surge in gun smuggling was in 1984, when demand soared as two gangs fought for supremacy. But the recent introduction of an anti-gangster law has made it increasingly difficult for criminals to make a living from such traditional sources as prostitution and protection rackets. Recent murders of company executives and bankers, for example, are widely believed to have been carried out by gangsters unable to extort money from them, as they would have done a few years ago. Meanwhile, more gangsters are leaving the underworld as existence there becomes less easy. But their attempts to start a new life have triggered violent responses from gangs, Prof Shimada says. More worrying is the fact that the crime gangs' financial woes are forcing them to sell guns to citizens to make ends meet. For example, police have arrested a gangster for selling a Russian-made Tokarev pistol and seven bullets for Y1.4m (Pounds 8,900) to the man accused of shooting Dr Okazaki. In the past, gangsters would not have sold guns to citizens, Prof Shimada notes. The number of guns confiscated from non-gangsters increased more than tenfold from 45 in 1990 to 476 last year. In response, the National Police Agency designated October as an anti-gangster and gun control month. 'The two pillars of Japan's gun policy should be to cut off supplies from overseas and eradicate illegal ownership of guns within Japan,' the agency says. 'Gun control is crucial in securing the safety of this country.'</p>

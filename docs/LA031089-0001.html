			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.: PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Bad words -- and a flashing knife -- involving two inner-city groups.  </P> <P> Rival street gangs? No. Feuding members of the Rapid Transit District and the  Los Angeles County Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> The two rivals gathered Thursday at an RTD board meeting to discuss the Long  Beach-Los Angeles trolley line, which the commission is building and which the  RTD will operate. The two differ on how it should be built and operated.  </P> <P> Shown a sample of a cloth-covered foam seat that the commission has chosen to  use in the trolleys, RTD board member Nick Patsaouras pulled out a knife and  slashed the cushion open. This latest dig was his subtle way of showing that  the pad isn't vandal-proof.  </P> <P> Later, when commission members said they planned to use a "graffiti-resistant"  paint for the trolley exteriors, RTD forces argued that it is "essentially the  same" type of paint now used on RTD buses. And RTD buses aren't exactly immune  to spray paint.  </P> <P> "We're going to have problems (with the paint)," warned RTD official Rich  Davis.  </P> <P> The trolley exteriors didn't get the knife test, however.  </P> <P> On Oscar night, the tension will be building over which nominees, if any, show  up.  </P> <P> The nominees, that is, for worst achievements in film. Those awards, plastic  raspberries called Razzies, will be handed out in a rival ceremony March 29 at  the Palace.  </P> <P> "We hope to see Sly," says writer John Wilson, who founded the Oscar parody.  </P> <P> However, Sylvester Stallone, a two-time Razzie winner going for his third Worst  Actor award for "Rambo III," is not expected to appear. In fact, in the  Razzies' eight years, no nominee has ever shown up.  </P> <P> But versatile Bill Cosby, a three-Razzie winner for "Leonard, Part Six" last  year, did later make a good-natured exception to his no-awards-accepted policy.  He collected his Razzies between shows at Harrah's resort in Lake Tahoe. No  word on whether Cosby will hand out the Worst Actor award this year.  </P> <P> It was a situation hardly befitting the dignity of the Hermosa Friends of the  Arts Poetry Reading Series.  </P> <P> Somehow, a woman with numerous gentlemen friends left her name with a referral  service, but in doing so, transposed a couple of numbers. Suddenly, the Friends  began receiving calls at all hours from inquisitive men.  </P> <P> Hence, the new recorded message on the phone machine of the Hermosa Poetry  Reading Series: "Please do not leave any messages for Tanya. There is no one  named Tanya at this number."  </P> <P> With rumors circulating that the newspaper might be purchased by the Toronto  Sun, Don Rosen, a reporter at the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, suddenly  launched into a semi-striptease in the City Room to the whistles and groans of  colleagues.  </P> <P> "I thought, what the hell, I might as well volunteer to be the first 'SUN-shine  Boy,' " said Rosen, referring to the Canadian tabloid's daily photo spreads of  scantily clad men and women.  </P> <P> In the alphabet-soup world of radio, station KNX-FM recently switched to an  oldies format and rechristened itself KODJ -- "O" for oldies, "DJ" for disc  jockeys. The station is following the current trend of choosing call letters  that symbolize a format, in the manner of KROQ (rock) and KLSX (classics).  </P> <P> The call letters of older stations, however, have more mysterious origins.  </P> <P> Some bear their original owners' initials -- KMPC (MacMillan Petroleum Co.),  KFWB (Fox-Warner Brothers), now-defunct KECA (Earle C. Anthony) and KJLH-FM  (John Lamar Hill III, whose first studio was in a Long Beach mortuary).  </P> <P> Others are acronyms: KFI (Farm Information), KHJ (Kindness, Happiness and Joy),  and KCRW-FM (College Radio Workshop or Corsair Radio West -- "I've heard two  versions of the origin," said spokeswoman Sarah Spitz. KGFJ is short for  Keeping Good Folks Joyful, said music director John Morris, a reference to the  fact it was one of the first 24-hour stations.  </P> <P> And, 68-year-old KNX-AM, the oldest local broadcaster of all? "The letters go  back so far that no one around here seems to know," said spokesman Fred  Bergendorff.  </P></p>

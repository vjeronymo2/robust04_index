			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Disabled workers' jobs at risk as Portillo enforces EU order The jobs of thousands of disabled people may be under threat following a decision by Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, to comply strictly with a European Union directive on competition rules. Mr Portillo has authorised the withdrawal of government departments from the priority suppliers scheme, which helped sheltered workshops for disabled people, such as Remploy, win government contracts. The move, following a Commission directive on public supply contracts, was condemned as another attack on the disabled. Mr Tony Lloyd, Labour's shadow training minister, said Mr Portillo, who wore his 'euro-scepticism like a badge', was apparently prepared to accept EU rules threatening British jobs without a fight. Mr Alf Morris, a former minister for the disabled, said: 'The government quotes the EC only when it is convenient to them. They totally ignore the EC on other occasions such as the case of the social chapter. I'm certain the EC would not mean this legislation to be applied to the disabled.' Commission officials expressed surprise at the speedy and unprompted compliance with the July 14 directive. It is understood that the UK might be correct in its strict interpretation of the directive which forbids special relationships with suppliers, but the Commission said: 'We have not approached the government to abolish this system. There could have been other ways of dealing with this situation.' The priority suppliers scheme, sponsored by the Department of Employment, was set up after the second world war to help workers in sheltered workshops match the lowest tenders put in for contracts. The Ministry of Defence is still one of the biggest users of the scheme. Yesterday the Department of Employment said it was no longer possible for contracts in excess of Pounds 150,000 to be placed under the scheme because of the EU rules. This leaves companies such as Remploy, with 8,736 disabled employees in 95 factories, having to compete on the same terms as other companies, including those from overseas with cheap labour. 'The Employment Service is working with Remploy to find ways of avoiding any impact on Remploy workers,' said a department spokesman. Mr Tony Withey, Remploy chief executive, warned that the effect on the company could be considerable.</p>

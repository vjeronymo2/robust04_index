			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FLORIDA OPENS SESSION ON ABORTION;  </P> <P> SECURITY TIGHT, THOUSANDS RALLY OUTSIDE CAPITOL  </P> <P> Thousands of sign-waving, chanting demonstrators ringed Florida's Capitol today  as the Legislature convened the nation's first special session on abortion  since a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July.  </P> <P> Lawmakers gaveled the session to order shortly after 1 p.m. to take up  anti-abortion legislation pushed by Republican Gov. Bob Martinez in the wake of  a high court ruling giving states greater power to restrict abortions.  </P> <P> Just before lawmakers began the session, thousands of pro-choice activists  marched through a light fog to the Capitol -- similar to a Monday night march  by about 8,000 anti-abortion activists.  </P> <P> Anti-abortion demonstrators lined the route. No trouble was reported, although  there was jeering and yelling from both sides.  </P> <P> Also today, about 100 anti-abortion protesters gathered at a local cemetery to  pray at a grave site where the remains of 782 aborted fetuses were buried last  year.  </P> <P> Senate President Bob Crawford and House Speaker Tom Gustafson, both Democrats,  said Martinez's proposals would get a full hearing in committees. But they said  the legislation is unlikely to pass.  </P> <P> "I don't believe a session called to restrict abortion is a wise expenditure of  time," Gustafson said.  </P> <P> He said the session would cost $40,000 a day and that he hopes to adjourn it  Wednesday or Thursday, even though Martinez called for the session to run  through Friday.  </P> <P> Florida's anti-abortion movement suffered a setback last week when the state  Supreme Court struck down a 1988 law that required girls under 18 to obtain the  consent of a parent or a judge before getting an abortion. The court ruled the  law violated a privacy clause in the state Constitution.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen a bill yet that doesn't violate (the Florida Constitution's  right to) privacy," said Gustafson.  </P> <P> Uniformed officers maintained tight security at the Capitol, patrolling  corridors and guarding the doors to the Senate and House chambers.  </P> <P> "You are being heard on this issue," Martinez told a cheering crowd of 7,000  anti-abortion activists in a rally outside the Capitol on Monday night.  </P> <P> "More than 1,000 babies could be saved by pending legislation, whose voices we  won't hear, whose cries will not be acknowledged," Martinez said as the crowd  chanted, "Pro-life! Pro-life!"  </P> <P> Martinez called the session in July in response to the Supreme Court ruling in  the Missouri case Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services. The ruling prompted  efforts in several states to impose limits on abortions.  </P> <P> Among the governor's proposals are a ban on the use of public money and  facilities for abortions and expanded regulation of abortion clinics. Measures  intended to make women think twice about having an abortion would require  doctors to tell patients about the development of their fetuses and require  women more than 20 weeks pregnant to be tested to see if the fetus could  survive outside the womb before an abortion is performed.  </P></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Hit-list smaller than wine industry feared YESTERDAY'S US trade measures against European exports, targeting white wine, corn gluten and rapeseed oil, will enrage the French government, but were less widespread than the French wine and spirits industry had feared. The threat of 200 per cent tariffs is more punishing than expected, but after targeting Dollars 300m (Pounds 194m) of EC farm exports from an initial hit-list of Dollars 2bn, many of those preparing against sanctions will live to export to the US another day. French cheese-makers are unhurt, as are producers of Cognac and other liqueurs. French mineral water exports, epitomised by Perrier, are untouched, as are Germany's small sugar confectioners and apple juice makers. France exported a mere FFr470m (Pounds 56m) of still white wine to the US last year. Within that, the main wines were white Burgundies, worth FFr291m, followed by white Bordeaux, worth FFr120m, then cheap white vin de pays worth FFr33m. The damage will be spread around hundreds of small to medium producers and wine merchants when export sales are suffering in their main markets. French wine exports of all types fell by 7.5 per cent in volume in the first half of this year, but rose 4.7 per cent to FFr13.1bn in value, because of currency gains and higher prices. The impact will be limited considering the US is only France's fourth export market for wine, after Britain, Germany and Belgium plus Luxembourg. Last year, the US bought only FFr2.5bn worth of French wine and champagne, a little more than Switzerland, with FFr1.8bn. Producers feared spirits would be hit, and cognac producers, including the giant LVMH, proprietor of Hennessy, stepped up exports to the US over the summer. 'We have already shipped our entire Christmas stocks of cognac for the US,' an LVMH official said. Nor do the duties hit the champagne industry, which had FFr958m of US sales last year, so Mr Bill Clinton can toast his victory at a reasonable price. 'We are not completely heartless,' a US embassy official said. As for Germany, the US administration has chosen in white wine the one agricultural product closest to the Chancellor's heart, and to that of his political constituency in the Rhineland Palatinate. German farm exports are insignificant; the political pressure comes from small farmers who are not serious exporters. Rapeseed is grown mainly in northern Germany, where big farmers have never had great political influence. A key German concern has been that if French exports were blocked access to markets outside the EC, they would be redirected to the German home market, undercutting small German farmers.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Lack of activity in the London markets reflected the US Labor Day holiday. Some light buying was seen in GOLD, which helped to maintain the market above Friday's levels. Most BASE METALS ended a quiet day with prices below Friday's levels but above the day's lows. The SUGAR market's main talking point was the Cuban president's weekend assertion that the country had produced 7m tonnes of sugar for 1991-92. Talk of Cuban buying in March New York has been a key supportive factor recently amid concern that production may fall further in 1992-93. Compiled from Reuters</p>

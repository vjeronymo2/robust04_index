			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> SMALL TOWN EXPLODES AS TWO FAMILIES 'FEUD'  </P> <P> Why do men war with and kill each other? Great ideals? Land, gold, beautiful  women? In his 1983 comic novel, "The Feud," Thomas Berger suggests that we  fight and die because of stupidity and stubbornness, geography and lies.  </P> <P> Berger's story -- about a daffily escalating small-town vendetta, engendered by  trifles and proceeding to catastrophes -- is great movie material. But the film  that's been made from it, Bill D'Elia's "The Feud" (at the Fine Arts), shows  little imagination, less intensity. It preserves much of Berger's dialogue and  plot, but little of the Swiss-watch precision and comic ruthlessness that  animates it.  </P> <P> The basic story is a wry holocaust, set in the era of Bonnie and Clyde, in  which two families, the Bullards of Millville and the Beelers of nearby  Hornbeck, become embroiled in hostilities that claim two lives. The cause: an  inane argument over paint remover and an unlit stogie in Bullard's hardware  store.  </P> <P> The novel is about small-town dopes with frontier dreams. The combatants are  frustrated little men, nasty teen-age punks, hothead bullies leading dull  lives: all of whom explode over nothing. D'Elia's film, fast-forwarded into the  1950s -- for no perceivable reason except the lure of a rock 'n roll period  score -- loses that desperate '30s edge, the sense of lawlessness and hard  times that fuels the feud. It becomes an urbanized sitcom in which the dopes  are stripped of their cosmic obsessions.  </P> <P> Except one. As Cousin Reverton Bullard -- an alleged railroad detective who  carries around a starter's pistol to terrify would-be assailants -- Rene  Auberjonois has a great face that's a cross between a mad ferret, a shabby  Puritan lay minister and one of cartoonist Charles Addams' evil bald little  men. He's the ultimate outsider, a knee-jerk bigot with a hair-trigger temper  and, within minutes of the credits, he's pulled his gun on the equally  foul-tempered Dolf Beeler (Ron McLarty), uncorking a donnybrook that rolls  along like a Laurel and Hardy destruction derby. But D'Elia never develops the  visual grace to match Berger's dead-on dialogue. And, except for Auberjonois --  and Ron Vanderberry as the unspeakable teen-age snot, Junior Bullard -- he  hasn't cast well, either.  </P> <P> Stanley Tucci, an expert comic actor, is too urban and snappy for the beefy,  lecher-bully police chief, Harvey Yelton; Gale Mayron too Brooklynesque tarty  for sister Bernice Beeler; Lynne Killmeyer too old for 13-year-old sexpot Eva  Bullard; Scott Allegrucci too sharp for her football lineman beau, Tony Beeler.  </P> <P> Perhaps D'Elia can't keep a secret. He reveals, as they happen, the culprits  behind the Bullard hardware store fire and Beeler car bombing -- destroying  much of the story's suspense and irony. He's lost the dark passion and longing  of Eva and Tony's Juliet and Romeo pursuit and encouraged Joe Grifasi, as Bud  Bullard, to a ridiculous crazy-ape breakdown.  </P> <P> The book is by someone who really understands small towns; the movie seems to  have been directed by an urban kibitzer who finds them coy, silly and  grotesque. But D'Elia deserves every credit for finding this book and bringing  it to the screen -- even if we might wish that Arthur Penn or the Coen Brothers  had found it first.  </P> <P> "The Feud" (rated R for sex, language and violence) has something most movies  don't: a good story, if not always a well told one. Stupidity, as we learn  here, is eternal, passion only temporary.  </P></p>

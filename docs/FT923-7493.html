			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / US military team speeds Somalia aid A US military team arrived in Kenya yesterday to prepare for a big airlift of food into famine-plagued Somalia, as a top United Nations official appealed to the Somali people to help resolve security problems impeding the international relief effort. The 33-member team from the US defence department arrived at the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa in a C-141 transport aircraft. In the next couple of days it will set up a base for shifting 145,000 tonnes of food in Somalia, where an estimated 1.5m people are at risk of starvation. Aid officials have expressed surprise at the sudden speed with which the Bush administration has reacted, stung by criticism of inadequate relief efforts so far. The details of the airlift are still to be fleshed out, although at least 10 military transport aircraft will fly food to Wajir, in northern Kenya, and to destinations so far unnamed inside Somalia. The US has no relief personnel on the ground in Somalia to help ensure the security and effectiveness of food distribution to the needy and does not appear to have consulted other aid agencies. But Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun, the UN secretary-general's special envoy in Somalia, paid tribute to the US bilateral aid effort, which will complement aid operations by the UN, Red Cross and other aid agencies. He described it as a humanitarian act of solidarity with the Somali people, especially starving children, and Somalis should respond by ensuring the security of relief personel and getting together under a UN-brokered national reconciliation conference. Mr Sahnoun, who left Nairobi last night for Sweden, said he had consulted the Canadian, German and Italian governments, which had promised to fund a large part of the UN operations in Somalia.</p>

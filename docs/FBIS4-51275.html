"The crisis in the East Africa region threatens every nation  in the region and is caused by drought conditions and civil  conflicts," White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said in a  statement.    "At this early stage, it is still possible to avoid  widespread famine," Myers said, "but an estimated 20 million  people are currently at risk and may have to leave their homes  to search for food."    Brian Atwood, administrator of the U.S. Agency for  International Development, is the head of the bipartisan  delegation that includes members of Congress and representatives  of volunteer organizations working in the area.    The delegation left here today and will travel to Ethiopia,  Eritrea and Kenya.</p>

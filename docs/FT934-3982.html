			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Bhutto family row takes fresh twist A feud within the family of Pakistan's prime minister Benazir Bhutto erupted afresh yesterday when Mrs Nusrat Bhutto, her mother, challenged her own overthrow as co-chairperson of Ms Bhutto's ruling Pakistan People's Party, Farhan Bokhari writes from Islamabad. The CEC party's central executive committee decided on Sunday to replace Mrs Bhutto senior by transferring all powers to the prime minister. Before that, the two women had equal ranking in the party. 'No one can remove me. I was nominated as chairperson for life by my husband, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and I will not allow anybody to throw his decision into the dustbin,' Mrs Bhutto senior, 63, said in Karachi yesterday. Mrs Bhutto was appointed to chair the party in 1977 after her husband was arrested following a military takeover. He was hanged two years later. The two women became co-chairpersons in 1986 after Ms Benazir Bhutto returned from exile. Recently, they have appeared increasingly estranged over the future of Mr Murtaza Bhutto, the prime minister's brother, who returned from exile last month and has been in prison since. Mr Bhutto was arrested on charges that he ran a terrorism campaign against the military regime of the late Gen Mohammed Zia ul-Haq. Mrs Bhutto wants her son to chair the party. The split threatens to produce a splinter group which would dent the PPP's support base.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (5): Mobile phone success story / Profile of Nokia Finland has no other corporate success story to match Nokia. Europe's biggest manufacturer of mobile telephones has performed spectacularly over the last two years with explosive profits and sales growth driving a 15-fold rise in its share price. The company now accounts for more than 25 per cent of the value of the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Such is the dominance that its market capitalisation at around FM50bn is greater than the combined value of the country's four big listed forestry groups: Repola, Kymmene, Enso-Gutzeit and Metsa-Serla. Foreigners have been particularly enthusiastic buyers of the shares and now hold more than 50 per cent of the company. Two years ago, with Nokia's share price languishing at less than FM50 compared with a peak of more than FM700 this year, such a revival was far from predictable. At the time the group was heading for its second successive year in the red amid substantial losses from its troubled consumer electronics division. Factors which have driven the recovery include surging worldwide demand for Nokia's cellular equipment and mobile phones as well as an internal reprogramming which has transformed the group from a sprawling conglomerate to a focused telecommunications company. Cost-cutting, the weak markka and a halting of the haemorrhage within consumer electronics have also helped. The rapid growth in the world mobile telecommunications market has probably been the most important factor. 'The two things which have helped us most have been the entry of new operators into cellular market and the shift from analogue to digital,' says Mr Jorma Ollila, Nokia chief executive. This year, for example, around 25m mobile phones are expected to be sold worldwide, well above last year's 14m. Nokia, which is the world's second largest mobile phone supplier after Motorola of the US, will manufacture around 5m phones, double last year's production, to achieve a 20 per cent market share. The outlook is no less positive. Mr Ollila forecasts that the world market for handsets will continue to increase by between 50 and 80 per cent for at least the next two years. If growth rates like this materialise, the biggest constraint on the group could simply be its capacity to deliver. It has already had to turn away some orders. The group is tackling the problem by investing and taking on additional staff. It has recently expanded mobile phone capacity in the US and last month it announced a FM280m programme to increase phone and cellular network production at Salo in Finland. The dominance of telecommunications within the group's business is increasing all the time. Partly this reflects the strategic focus which has seen the group pull out of such areas as data, forestry and chemicals. Partly it reflects the annual 50 per cent growth in the core telecom businesses, when the company's other remaining activities - consumer electronics, cable and machinery, tyres and power - are hardly growing at all. There is little doubt that the emphasis on telecoms will continue. The trend will be reinforced by a likely disposal of the cable and machinery, tyre and power businesses if they fail to produce adequate cash flow. The group is already considering floating off most of its 80 per cent stake in Nokia Tyres. By contrast, the company seems to intent on hanging onto its consumer electronics unit, which is finally within sight of profits after hefty losses and considerable restructuring over the last three years. Retaining the operation will assist its ambitions to build a presence in multimedia. The group's confidence is reflected in the increasingly global scale of its activities and its readiness to take on some of its toughest competitors in their home markets. In Japan, for example, the group talks of capturing a 25 per cent digital market share by 1996 despite tough competition from domestic manufacturers. The going has been tougher in the US, where the company has been hampered by a relatively low profile and a poor distribution system. But opportunities will increase in the US market with the planned auction of broadband licences next year. In any case, the group's US profile was lifted in the summer when it became the first Finnish company to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. This was after it had raised FM2.4bn in the largest international share issue ever made by a Finnish company. The group's main problem now will be to meet the market's high expectations of it. Its capacity for pleasant surprises was on display again recently when it announced a near-fivefold surge in pre-tax profits to FM2.29bn for the first eight months, comfortably ahead of market predictions. Net sales were FM18.2bn, a 40 per cent increase adjusted for currencies and restructuring. One danger is that bigger competitors with greater resources will push Nokia aside through technical innovation. As analysts from Lehman brothers said recently: 'Nokia operates in the world telecommunications market alongside significantly larger competitors . . . Many of these companies spend more in absolute terms on R &amp; D than Nokia.' Another danger is that the group will simply not be able to manage its growth, becoming cumbersome and bureaucratic where until now it has been fast and flexible. This, for Mr Ollila, appears to be the greater threat and he has made the achievement of disciplined growth one of his main priorities.</p>

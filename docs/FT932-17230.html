			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report ZINC came under late pressure on the LME, with three-month metal pushed below the psychological support level of Dollars 1,000 a tonne, although sell stops were not triggered. Underlying producer support might cushion falls, but the bearish fundamental picture of rising stocks might see prices testing contract lows of Dollars 987, dealers said. COPPER prices were steadier. The market was helped by expectations of support below Dollars 2,160 a tonne, although stiff resistance around Dollars 2,170 prevented any further upside movement. ALUMINIUM was consolidating after Tuesday's decline to 14 1/2 -month lows. Some consumer interest was seen above Dollars 1,140 a tonne for three-month metal. Copper's stability was also supportive. NICKEL eased back from midsession highs, as recent gains attracted profit-taking, although the market remained firmer after investment fund interest. New York raw SUGAR was mixed at midday after opening lower on profit taking. But traders said tighter global supplies, expectations for sharply lower Cuban output and bullish technical factors were pointing to higher prices ahead and had deterred aggressive selling.

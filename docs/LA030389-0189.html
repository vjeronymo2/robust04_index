			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NASR EL ARAB DRAWS 7TH POST  </P> <P> Nasr El Arab, the high weight and early favorite, drew post position 7 today as  11 thoroughbreds were entered for Sunday's $1-million Santa Anita Handicap.  </P> <P> Trainer Charlie Whittingham, who also has Payant and Frankly Perfect among the  competitors for the $550,000 winner's purse, said the post positions should  make little difference in a 1 1/4-mile race. Nasr El Arab, with early odds of  5-2, must carry high weight of 124, conceding from two to 12 pounds to his  rivals.  </P> <P> In post position order the entries were Stylish Winner, Payant, Good Taste,  Super Diamond, Perceive Arrogance, Stalwars, Nasr El Arab, Martial Law, Frankly  Perfect, Triteamtri and Cherokee Colony.  </P></p>

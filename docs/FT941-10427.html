			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Thai feed producer advances Charoen Pokphand Feedmill (CPF), the listed Thai agro-industry company of the multinational CP group, yesterday announced a 4 per cent rise in net profits, to Bt1.2bn (Dollars 47.2m) last year from Bt1.15bn in 1992. The company said it expected higher revenues in 1994 from prawn feed, which already accounts for more than 60 per cent of CPF's sales. Thailand is the world's largest producer of farmed shrimp, and the feed market is expected to grow 15 per cent in 1994. CPF is planning to build a third prawn feed plant in Thailand, and is considering investments in Vietnam, Mexico and the Indian sub-continent. CPF earnings per share were Bt10.01 for the year, up from Bt9.59 the year before. Revenues and other figures have yet to be released. Bangkok Agro-Industrial Products and CP Northeastern, CPF subsidiaries, both announced lower profits. BAP's net profit fell to Bt104.4m from Bt118.4m, while CPNE's was down to Bt84.2m from Bt88.9m. CPF also holds 5 per cent of TelecomAsia, the recently-floated CP company installing 2m new telephone lines in Bangkok.</p>

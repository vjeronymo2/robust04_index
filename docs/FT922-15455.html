			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Pensions 'too big' say unions ITALY'S three largest union groups yesterday urged the government to stop promising their members generous pensions, Reuter reports from Rome. Paying out so much to an increasingly ageing population was like 'sitting on a barrel of dynamite', they warned. Some 300,000 state workers are lining up to take advantage of a law passed last year enabling them to give up their ordinary state pensions and transfer to a lucrative system run by the Treasury for civil servants. The law threatens to cost the social security service more than L6,000 trillion (million million) (Pounds 2.79bn) a year. 'This is an absurd law which needs immediate correction,' said the CGIL, the UIL and the CISL umbrella union groups. 'It flies in the face of all attempts to reform the pension system.' In theory, the law offers 'golden pensions' of 100 per cent of retirement salary to all employees in the public sector. Italian pensions, among the most generous in the world, have long been identified as one of the causes of the massive budget deficit but politicians have avoided cutting them for fear of losing votes.</p>

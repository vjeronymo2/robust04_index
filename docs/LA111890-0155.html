			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VOTE AGAINST PEOPLE'S INTERESTS  </P> <P> On Nov. 6, Californians were persuaded to vote against their own best interests  by the "too big" and "too much money" complaints of the chemical, oil and  timber industries.  </P> <P> We lost the opportunity to show a watching America that we are very concerned  about the use of chemicals linked to cancer and birth defects, and others  destroying the ozone layer or contaminating our drinking water; that we are  alarmed by our depleted forests and dwindling groves of ancient redwoods; that  we want greater accountability from those responsible for oil spill disasters,  and that we do care about the environment and the quality of our lives and  those of our children.  </P> <P> As it turns out, we seem to care about something "big" and "green" all right --  but it has nothing to do with the environment.  </P> <P> GLENNA MILLER  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

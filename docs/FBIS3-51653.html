			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Canadian International Trade Minister Roy  MacLaren said that Chile is the "number one" potential candidate  for joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that  groups the United States, Mexico, and Canada.    MacLaren, who paid a two-day visit to Chile to enhance  commercial ties and discuss Chile's possible entry into NAFTA,  met Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley.    Reporting on their meeting, Foxley pointed out that they  discussed the various methods for Chile to join NAFTA. MacLaren  mentioned the possibility that our country might directly join  NAFTA through an access clause, instead of reaching bilateral  agreements with each one of the NAFTA member countries.  [passage omitted]    Over the past few years Canada has been one of the greatest  foreign investors in Chile, with investments totaling about $4  billion, basically concentrated in the mining area. The latest  investment was made by the Canadian firm Lac Minerals, which  formed a consortium with the U.S. company Cyprus to mine the El  Abra copper deposit in northern Chile.    Nevertheless, the trade flow between the two countries is  very low, with Chilean exports totaling $53 million in 1991 and  $63.7 million in 1992. In turn, Canadian exports to Chile  totaled $157 million in 1991 and $162 million in 1992.  <H5>  APEC and GATT </H5>   The two ministers announced their decision to continue  cooperating with GATT, the establishment of a new world trade  organization, and with APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation),  which Chile will join as a full-fledged member in November.    Foxley thanked the Canadian Government for its support for  Chile's entry into APEC, and reported that he and MacLaren  established the beginnings of cooperation in forming the  orientation APEC ought to have.    For the Chilean minister, one of the most important issues  discussed in their meeting were the prospects for the  international economy after agreement had been reached on the  Uruguay Round. Foxley explained that the new world trade  organization that will replace GATT will establish the rules and  regulations; it will establish mechanisms to settle disputes,  and will oversee the enforcement of the rules and regulations by  the member countries.    Foxley said that in the same way the two countries had  managed to cooperate within the context of the Cairns Group in  the discussion of the agricultural issue during the Uruguay  Round, Chile and Canada should continue cooperating as medium-  and small-sized countries that have common interests in the  establishment of this organization.    All these issues will continue to be reviewed by the next  administration. MacLaren and Foxley thus participated in a  working luncheon with Foreign Minister-designate Carlos Figueroa  and Finance Minister-designate Eduardo Aninat. Foxley said  that, with Figueroa and Aninat, "we established a line of  continuity between our actions, to coordinate these negotiations  and agreements and the actions to be carried out by the next  administration."</p>

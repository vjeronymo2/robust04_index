			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Travel: A guidebook revolution - Practical Traveller HERE are three things you may not know about travel in eastern Europe, writes Michael Thompson-Noel: 1) Tick-borne encephalitis is known to exist in forested areas from the Austria-Hungary border east to the outskirts of Budapest, so you might want to get a vaccination. Risk season: March-November. 2) When leaving Warsaw, you will have only yourself to blame if your luggage doesn't make it onto the aircraft. You have to put it on the correct conveyor belt yourself. 3) You get what you pay for if you buy 2-cent (30-stotinki) Bulgarian condoms (aka Medbio Protex). They tend to fall apart as soon as you unroll them. These facts, plus thousands more, can be found in On The Loose In Eastern Europe, one of four new-style budget guidebooks - the Berkeley Guides - produced by students of the University of California and published by Fodor's. The other three guides in the series cover Mexico, California, and the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. In Britain they cost Pounds 8.99 With luck, the Berkeley Guides will detonate a bomb in the fusty old world of guidebook publishing. True, their political correctness may grate on some readers: 'We tell you if a place is wheelchair-accessible,' they say, 'let you know where people of colour may encounter discrimination, provide resources (information) for gay and lesbian travellers, and recognise the needs of women . . .' The guides are even printed on recycled paper using soy-based inks and are tied-in with various ecological action groups. But they are funky (Time's description), well organised, well written and packed with insightful and up-to-date information. 'We wrote the books,' say the editors, 'because the current crop of guidebooks doesn't appeal to student travellers . . . the competition has been regurgitating the same old muck for decades. In contrast, the Berkeley Guides are written from scratch. The information is fresh . . . the destinations covered were slept in, eaten in, boogied down in, and sized up by our writers. If a place sucks, we tell you and recommend something else.' Consider this paragraph from the section on Debrecen, capital city of the Great Plain of Hungary, near the Romanian border: 'It's not unheard of to miss the last train back to Debrecen (about 8.15pm) while waiting for the waiters at the Hortobagyi Csarda to bring the bill. Hitchhiking after sundown is something of a challenge round here, so you may have to check into Camping Puszta for a night. This campground just behind the Herdsman Museum rents bungalows for Dollars 7.70 and tents for Dollars 1.55 per person. The friendly staff changes money at a decent rate and rents bikes for Dollars 3.20 a day (the flat countryside is perfect for biking).' Wrinklies will not get much of a kick from the Berkeley Guides. But they are not only for students. They pack in so much information, and convey it so breezily, that they deserve wide readerships. Other guidebook publishers will just have to catch up. DID YOU know that Neanderthal is a valley not far from Dusseldorf, in Nordrhein-Westfalen? Nor me. The valley was a remote place until about 1830, when quarrying revealed numerous caves, in one of which was discovered the skeleton of Neanderthal Man. Today, Neanderthal is a nature preserve with many broad hiking trails. Families go to picnic there. There is a museum which tells the story of the discovery and contains a replica of the skeleton (the original skull is in the Rheinisches Landesmuseum in Bonn). There is an inn and a small hotel. The museum is open daily except Mondays, but closed in December and January. I discovered all this from The Scientific Traveller, an unusual guidebook described as the first-ever guide to Europe's scientific heritage. It offers plenty of information. But it also describes places and people related to the history of scientific discovery throughout Europe. The authors, Charles Tanford and Jacqueline Reynolds, are scientists themselves. The Scientific Traveller, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Pounds 10.95.</p>

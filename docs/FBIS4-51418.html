			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- Although the Taipei  Association of Travel Agents lifted a ban on group travel to  Mainland China Wednesday, the ROC [Republic of China] Consumers  Foundation warned the public to avoid traveling to "high risk"  places in the mainland.    Foundation Secretary-General Chiang Chih-chun said that  personal safety is not the only factor to be considered in  traveling to the mainland. He said that the public may have no  way to file complaints if there is trouble because of the lack  of agreement on travel safety and compensation between the two  sides of the Taiwan Strait.    He noted that the bureau of tourism and the Taipei  Association of Travel Agents have published a list of "high  risk" locations in the mainland and travelers should use the  list as a reference.    The travel agents lifted the self-imposed ban Wednesday [25  May] after losing more than NT [New Taiwan] $700 million  (U.S.$26 million), the officials said. The ban was imposed in  response to the March 31 robbery and murder of 24 Taiwan  tourists in Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province.    The association officials said that although the ban,  imposed  on May 1, was lifted, they did not expect group travel to the  mainland to resume for a few months.    The association warned travel agencies to avoid high-risk  areas such as Qiandao Lake, Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province, Tibet  and Jiouzaigou in Sichuan Province.</p>

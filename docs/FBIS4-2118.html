			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Be Aamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 5 (CNA) -- Calls continue to mount  here for the government to take tough action against Beijing  over what many are claiming is the mainland's inappropriate  handling of the March 31 boat incident in which 24 Taiwan  tourists died.    The tourists, along with six mainland crew members and two  guides, died in a fire on board a tourist vessel during a cruise  on Qiandao Hu, or Thousand Island Lake, in the central province  of Zhejiang. News of the mishap was suppressed for two days.    The ire of the relatives of the victims was further raised  when they learned that autopsies had been carried out on the  bodies on Monday [4 April] without their permission.    The relatives' demands to examine the boat and to move the  corpses to Hangzhou, from where they could be flown back to  Taiwan, were also rejected by mainland authorities. Instead the  relatives were restricted to a hotel by the authorities.    Chinese New Party legislator Jaw Shau-kong, in a written  inquiry to the Executive Yuan, said the government should not be  hesitant to suspend the ongoing private exchanges across the  Taiwan Strait should Beijing fail to resolve problems arising  from the incident.    "The denial of the relatives demands is consistent with the  Chinese Communists' ignorance of human rights," Jaw said. "The  government should not sit idle, but should help the relatives."    Chin Han-sheng, director of the Kuomintang Cultural Affairs  Department, also lambasted the mainland officials. "Beijing has  every responsibility to clarify the myths surrounding the  deaths, but all it has done over the past few days has been  muddleheaded and careless.    Meanwhile, the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] held an  emergency meeting Tuesday to draw up countermeasures. After the  meeting, MAC Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian issued a statement  saying, "the mainland authorities should carefully handle the  matter so as not to hurt the feelings of Taiwan residents and  the ties between the two sides.    He also said Taiwan reporters should be allowed to report on  the incident, and that officials of the Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) should be permitted to go to the mainland to  provide the relatives with humanitarian assistance.    The semi-official SEF was organized to handle private  exchanges between Taiwan and the mainland in the absence of  official contacts.</p>

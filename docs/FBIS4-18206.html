			<p>BFN     [Text] Goettingen (DPA) -- On Thursday afternoon [31  March] about 150 members and sympathizers of the Goettingen  "Solidarity Alliance for Kurdistan" tried in vain to block the  Superhighway A 7 near Goettingen with bicycles. Police closed  off the access points to the superhighway.    According to the police, among the demonstrators there were  numerous autonomous persons, but only very few of the about 400  Kurds living in Goettingen. Three Germans were temporarily  detained. The action was to be aimed against German arms  supplies to Turkey and the threatened deportation of Kurds.    Having played cat and mouse with the police for several  hours, the demonstrators ended their attempts to get to the  superhighway via industrial roads and slopes with a protest  demonstration in front of the headquarters of the police task  force in the evening.</p>

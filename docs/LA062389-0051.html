			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> An abandoned Salinas hotel that once counted author John Steinbeck and many  U.S. Presidents among its guests has been temporarily saved from the wrecker's  ball. Monterey County Superior Court Judge John M. Phillips found that the city  had failed to get an adequate environmental impact report before ordering the  Cominos Hotel demolished. The downtown hotel, built in 1874 and modernized in  1919, was often visited and mentioned by Steinbeck, a Salinas native whose  fiction won the Nobel Prize for literature. The hotel recently fell on hard  times and the City Council voted in April to raze it for a parking lot, an  office building and a museum dedicated to Steinbeck. The Monterey County  Historical Society sued to save the hotel, arguing that the city's  environmental document was deficient.  </P></p>

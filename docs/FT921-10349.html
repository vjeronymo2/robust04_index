			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Survey of poll tax non-payment MORE THAN one in five of poll tax payers in Labour-controlled boroughs have received summonses for non-payment, three in four of which have led to court liability orders, according to a survey of 21 district councils. The survey, published yesterday by the Local Government Information Unit, was confined to Labour councils in England. It confirms a report last year by the Audit Commission, the local-government watchdog, which found that 21 per cent of poll tax payers required a summons before paying. According to the survey, conducted between April 1990 and September 1991, summonses were issued against 442,000 of the nearly 2m poll tax payers covered by the councils and 77 per cent resulted in liability orders. Fewer than one in 10 of those summoned had paid their tax in full before their cases came to court, while 86 per cent of liability orders were being pursued by bailiffs at the time of the survey.</p>

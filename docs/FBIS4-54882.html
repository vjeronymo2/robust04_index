			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, and U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith have  signed an agreement at the Foreign Ministry between the  governments of the Republic of Croatia and the United States on  economic, technical, and related aid. Tihomir Vinkovic has this  report.    [Vinkovic] Prior to signing the agreement Minister Granic  said that this agreement is of major political and economic  significance for the Republic of Croatia. This is an  all-encompassing agreement and serves as a basis for all other  specific agreements, Minister Granic said, adding that this is  the cornerstone of future cooperation between the United States  and the Republic of Croatia. Minister Granic stressed that such  agreements are signed only with countries that have developed  friendly relations with the United States and which the United  States wishes to help. In any case, following the signing of  the Washington agreement and the meeting between Presidents  Clinton and Tudjman, this represents the most important instance  in the development of friendly relations between the United  States and the Republic of Croatia, Minister Granic said.    He expressed his hope that talks on concrete projects will  continue and that specific agreements on cooperation between the  United States and the Republic of Croatia will be signed over  the next couple of months.    Minister Granic thanked the U.S. Government, which reacted  swiftly after the signing of the Washington agreement and signed  today's agreement.    U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith expressed his  satisfaction with his signing of today's agreement on behalf of  the United States. This general agreement provides a framework  for extending U.S. aid to the whole world, including Croatia,  Galbraith said. He added that bilateral relations between the  United States and Croatia will develop on the basis of genuine  partnership and consultation. This agreement will place U.S.  know-how and experience at the disposal of Croatian public and  nongovernmental organizations, Galbraith said. [passage omitted]</p>

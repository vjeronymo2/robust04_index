			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marcelo Mendonca] </F>   [Excerpt] PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]  presidential candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso has become a  hostage of the economic plan that he implemented while he was  still heading the Finance Ministry. Figures from the last  Datafolha poll conducted on 23 and 24 May show that the voters'  main reason for supporting the PSDB candidate is the Real Plan.  This is this year's first national survey by Datafolha about  the motivations for voting.    In addition to linking the creator to the creature,  Cardoso's  voters also hope that their votes will ensure the continuity of  the plan if he succeeds President Franco.    In second place, with 17 percent of voters' preferences,  Cardoso is also chosen by his voters because he is "efficient"  (11 percent) and "honest" (11 percent).    This imbalance in the motivation for voting, which weighs  heavily on only one factor, is deemed risky by experts in  political marketing. The possibility of a failure of the  economic plan could destroy the former minister's chances at the  ballot boxes.    Even with no certainty about the economic situation, the  economic plan is already a problem for the candidate. The  complaint that the Real Plan "is not functioning" already is the  main reason for rejecting the PSDB candidate (27 percent). The  impression that he "made up the plan to become a candidate"  represents the reason for 8 percent of the voters rejecting him.    The leading candidate in the Datafolha poll, Luiz Inacio  Lula  da Silva (PT) [Workers Party], with 40 percent of voters'  preferences, has inspired a more balanced motivation among his  voters. Their main reason to vote for Lula is that he has been  "a poor man, a worker" (17 percent). This is closely followed  by "representing the workers" (16 percent), and a chance "to try  something new" (12 percent).    The main reason for rejecting Lula is his "lack of ability  to  govern the country" (15 percent). The leftist radicalism that  his campaign has been trying to soften still marks his image in  the eyes of the voters: 13 percent of those who reject him  believe he is an "agitator" who promotes strikes; and 8 percent  that he "is a Communist."    The main reasons for voters to support Quercia, the PMDB  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] candidate (8 percent);  Brizola, the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] candidate (7 percent);  and Esperidiao Amin, the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]  candidate (3 percent) is that "they have been good governors" in  their states.

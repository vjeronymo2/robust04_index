			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Mortgage boost for first-time buyers - David Barchard assesses the latest cut in rates FIRST-TIME buyers now enjoy the most favourable conditions for entering the market in many years because of this week's decision by Abbey National, the second-largest mortgage lender, to cut interest rates again. Abbey's special rates for first-time buyers range from 9.49 per cent on mortgages under Pounds 60,000 to 8.9 per cent on those over Pounds 100,000. It says they are its lowest since 1978 for this type of purchaser. In addition, the government introduced legislation this week to remove the 1 per cent stamp duty normally paid on all house purchases under Pounds 250,000 before August 19. John Bayliss, Abbey's managing director, says: 'We want to get the first-time buyers back in the market. There is a huge backlog of people who haven't moved. All it needs is a bit of confidence and for commentators to stop writing gloom and doom.' The other top lenders agree. Although Halifax and Nationwide were surprised by Abbey's cuts, it matched them within hours. As the tables show, the cuts favour buyers of cheaper properties. Although people with big mortgages still get a better rate of interest, the difference between the top end of the market and the bottom has been nearly halved. Halifax calculates that customers with Pounds 60,000 endowment mortgages will find their monthly payments dropping from Pounds 503.13 to Pounds 479.08. Repayment mortgage customers will pay Pounds 523.12 instead of Pounds 543.63. The news for existing borrowers of the Big Three is not quite so good. The new rates will not apply to them for a full month. In the meantime, you can be sure that interest rates on deposits will fall. But the cuts have come in time to ensure that 2.6m customers on the Halifax Budget Plan, and other annually-adjusted mortgage payment schemes, will benefit. Other building societies look certain to fall into line shortly. If your mortgage comes from a bank, however, you might have to wait. The TSB already has said it has no plans to cut its rates but others have the situation 'under review.' The centralised lenders probably will be even slower to reduce their variable-rate mortgages. (Incidentally, if a lender announces that it is reducing its rate, look twice to see what this means in practice. In recent months, some centralised lenders have been announcing cuts which do not take effect for 2 1/2 months). Will the Big Three be able to sustain their cuts? The base rate has not fallen for some time and there have been fears that the government might have to raise it again. But Abbey appears to have decided that there will not be a base rate increase in the weeks ahead and that the Chancellor might well reduce it around Budget time in March. Ian Darby, marketing director at mortgage broker John Charcol, says: 'This is a good move by the societies but it has come about because of serious lack of business volumes. After some terrifying statistics about house price falls, lenders feel it is worth reducing their prices to prevent the market falling further.' Darby doubts, however, that the property market can be kick-started in this way. 'We have seen the interest rates fall by 4 per cent and house sales volumes have decreased steadily as they have done so.' John Wriglesworth, housing market specialist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, agrees. 'The only thing that could kick-start the market is something more radical, like doubling the Pounds 30,000 mortgage interest rate relief for first-time buyers.' The trouble is that many potential buyers remain dubious about the future. With an election nearing, they are worried that a change of government might affect incomes. The recession also is making many people concerned about the safety of their jobs. The threat of redundancy is by far the biggest constraint on the housing market, according to a survey of property valuers published by NatWest. Such fears are especially strong in the south-east, and this week's jump in unemployment figures shows that people are right to be careful. But for those with the cash and the confidence to buy a house, conditions rarely can have been more favourable.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       INTEREST RATE CHANGES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Amount       Old       New      First time  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey Nat                &lt;60K    11.55     10.99    9.49                    60-100K       10.85     10.55    9.05                       100K       10.60     10.40    8.90 Nationwide             30K       11.50     10.99    9.49                        60K       10.80     10.55    9.05                       120K       10.50     10.40    9.05 Halifax                30K       11.55     10.95    9.45                        60K       10.80     10.55    9.00                       100K       10.50     10.30    8.80  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- All rates percentages  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     MONTHLY PAYMENT CHANGES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              Amount (pounds) Endowment (pounds)      Repayment (pounds)                              Old              New      Old       New  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Nationwide    30,000         215.63           206.07   239.07    246.83               60,000         472.50           461.57   519.27    510.13 Halifax       30,000         215.63           205.33   238.47    246.82               60,000         479.08           503.13   523.12    543.63              100,000         886.46           844.08   917.47    953.95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tehran, May 24 (AFP)--Iran does not plan to  improve ties with Egypt despite a visit planned by Foreign  Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati to Cairo next week, a ministry  spokesman said Tuesday. Iran and Egypt broke diplomatic ties  after the 1979 Islamic revolution and maintain diplomatic  contact at interest section level.    The spokesman, quoted on Tuesday by the radical daily  JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, said Velayati would only go to Cairo to take  part in a meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and the  visit "has nothing to do with bilateral ties."    "Given the nature of the Egyptian government, Iran has no  intention of boosting ties beyond the interest section level,"  he said, adding that Velayati "would not meet any Egyptian  officials" during his visit.    It will be the first to Egypt by a senior Iranian official  since the revolution. [passage omitted]</p>

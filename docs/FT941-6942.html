			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Books: A pixilated plot - Fiction JACKO THE GREAT INTRUDER by Thomas Keneally Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 15.99, 316 pages Pop to the shops or let in the cat, and Thomas Keneally has got another novel on bookstores' acquiescent shelves. How he churns them out. This is his 22nd. In honour of the ice-dancing marks at the winter Olympics, I would award Jacko The Great Intruder 5.7 for technical merit and 5.8 for artistic impression - about the same as Torvill and Dean: bronze medal only, strictly ballroom, Saga Holidays, Radio Gaga. I exaggerate. But only because I like Keneally enormously, have read most of his novels and wish he would slow his pace, stop the churning and present us with - say - five superior novels in the time remaining to him rather than a baker's dozen of hits and misses. I met Keneally once. Bumped into him at an airport. He had just won the Booker Prize. I grasped his hand. Thanked him for being him. Warmly, he responded. He is small and turnip-shaped, eccentrically-bespectacled, unsuccessfully-bearded, and dresses in the clashing pastels favoured by Aussie businessmen. His eyes miss nothing. They atomise you while you stand there, egregious in your fanship. He really is an artist. But with Jacko The Great Intruder he burdens himself with a plot that is wilfully testing, if not pixilated. Jacko Emptor, from Australia's medieval Northern Territory, works for a New York TV station, Vixen Six, owned by a shadowy Australian media-king (obviously Rupert Murdoch). Jacko is a trespasser, barging into people's homes - including that of an ex-soldier whose daughter has disappeared - on behalf of his show, Morning Manhattan. Meanwhile, the plot keeps flipping back to Oz: to the Emptors' vast cattle station (beautifully realised: see Keneally's non-fiction Outback for the source of this material) and Sydney, where Jacko's family pursue their own storylines. His brother, a gay opera-goer, has his hand in his company's till, while Chloe, the Emptor matriarch, etched by Keneally with adoration and vigor, is determined to engineer a meeting with Australia's Nobel prize-winning novelist (obviously Patrick White: a splendid piece of homage). Meanwhile, back in New York, Jacko sets about tracking down the ex-soldier's daughter, who may have been kidnapped. But there is trouble with the pacing. No sooner have we got accustomed to switching between New York and Oz than the plot lurches off to Germany, for the fall of the Berlin Wall. This episode is so well-handled that we realise that Keneally would have been better off producing a solid satire on the TV biz than interrupting his story with outings among the cafe society of Sydney. At one point in Berlin, Dannie, Jacko's fearsome female producer, admits that TV may be the domain of clowns, but then spits back: 'Clowns, maybe, but we put the spin on the direction history goes. We're putting the spin on it this afternoon. We make up out of our own heads the way people feel . . .' Make up out of our own heads the way people feel. How very good. What a missed opportunity: what a pity that Keneally didn't go for the throat of Rupert Murdoch and all the lesser monsters who breed in the video-ghetto. He could have done it standing on his head. Sceptre has republished Keneally's Schindler's List (paperback, Pounds 5.99) to coincide with Steven Spielberg's film. Re-read that: save a tenner.</p>

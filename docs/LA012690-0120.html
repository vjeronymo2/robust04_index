			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON;  </P> <P> COUNCIL REJECTS PLAN TO LIFT PARKING BAN  </P> <P> The City Council has unanimously rejected a proposal to allow parking along a  210-foot stretch of Bever Place, citing fears that such a change might invite  prostitutes back to the area near Beach Boulevard.  </P> <P> Councilman Edward Allen, who wanted the red curb and "no parking" signs  removed, said the additional space was needed for tenants of an apartment  complex on the street.  </P> <P> "I didn't see any prostitutes," he said. "I felt like people could use that  space."  </P> <P> The red curbs were part of a 10-point plan to rid the city of prostitutes in  1987. The aggressive measures included prohibiting parking along most of Beach  Boulevard and about 200 feet of cross streets. Bever Place is just off Beach  Boulevard and north of Chapman Avenue.  </P> <P> Allen's suggestion was opposed by law enforcement officials who said the  prostitutes are far from gone.  </P> <P> "Is it worth risking this just to get the prostitutes back?" asked Capt. Robert  Eason of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 'It's just worked out too good  to get rid of the red curbs."  </P> <P> Eason said his department arrests an average of 30 prostitutes every month in  Stanton, compared to 100 to 500 prostitutes jailed monthly in 1987.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Description of the Source Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 112 of the Act requires the EPA to evaluate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control emissions of HAP. The control of HAP is to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved through promulgation of emission standards under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 112(d) and (f) for major source categories and such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minor sources as deemed appropriate that emit HAP. Pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to section 112(c) of the Act, the EPA published in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the initial list of source categories that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emit HAP on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576). This list includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both ``major'' and ``area'' sources (as defined by the Act) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the EPA intends to regulate before November of the year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2000. The initial list of source categories includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Shipbuilding and Ship Repair (Surface Coating),'' the major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources only, as a source category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of the proposed rule, shipbuilding and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ship repair refers to all facilities that build, repair,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paint, repaint, convert, or alter ships. (Hereafter, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry will be referred to as ``shipbuilding.'') A ship is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined as any marine or fresh-water vessel used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> military or commercial operations, including self-propelled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels, those towed by other craft (barges), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> navigational aids (buoys). This definition includes, but is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not limited to, all military vessels, commercial cargo and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger (cruise) ships, ferries, barges, tankers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container ships, patrol and pilot boats, and dredges. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not include offshore oil and gas drilling platforms,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although it is believed that identical coating systems would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be appropriate for them also.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule represents the EPA's first extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation of air pollutants from the shipbuilding and ship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repair industry. Essentially all volatile organic hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air pollutants (VOHAP) are a subset of a category of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutants referred to as volatile organic compounds (VOC).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The VOC is a class of pollutants that are photochemically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactive precursors of ozone. Emissions of VOC (and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequently VOHAP as well) from ``marine coating operations''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been regulated by some State and local district rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California and Louisiana have defined VOC limits for a wide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range of marine coating categories. The California limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being generally more stringent than those of Louisiana.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other States have limited VOC emissions from the industry's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spray booths as one of many ``miscellaneous metal coating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations,'' using guidance presented in the EPA's control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> techniques guidelines (CTG) document ``Control of Volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organic Emissions from Existing Stationary Sources,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volume VI: Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Products'' (June 1978) EPA 450/2&hyph;78&hyph;015. Outdoor painting of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ships' hulls was specifically exempt from this guidance, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some States have rules that limit shipyard painting done  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inside buildings and on the interior of ships based on the guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Local steelmaker next on the block BAVARIA is to sell its 45 per cent stake in the lossmaking Maxhutte, a local steel manufacturer. Finance ministry officials said negotiations with two prospective buyers were under way, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. The Bavarian government hopes to sell its stake by next January. Potential buyers include Mr Max Aicher, chairman of the board at Maxhutte and owner of a steel and construction enterprise bearing his name. The other potential buyer is Mr Manfred Kuhnlein, manager of a pipe manufacturing company in Nuremberg. Mr Kuhnlein has plans to turn the steelworks into a recycling plant for cars. Maxhutte was saved from bankruptcy in 1987 when Klockner, the German steelmaker, sold it to the Bavarian state. Other German steelmakers, including Thyssen and Krupp, also took shares in the company, which produces 316,000 tonnes of rails, pipelines and steel rods per year. Maxhutte made a DM15m (Dollars 8.77m) loss in 1992 on sales of DM350m. It has 1,700 employees, down from the 4,000 who worked there before the bankruptcy proceedings. Company officials said Thyssen and Krupp had expressed a willingness to sell their stakes.</p>

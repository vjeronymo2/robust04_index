			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  PLANE ON WAY TO L.A. LOSES WING PANEL  </P> <P> A panel broke off the left wing of a Los Angeles-bound Boeing 757 after  takeoff, forcing the Eastern Airlines flight to return to Hartsfield Atlanta  International Airport in Atlanta.  </P> <P> None of the 105 passengers or crew of six was injured, said Robin Matell, an  Eastern spokesman in Miami.  </P> <P> The plane left Atlanta at 8:04 p.m. Thursday and was near Birmingham, Ala.,  when the pilot noticed the problem, said Jack Barker, a Federal Aviation  Administration spokesman.  </P> <P> "It was climbing at 28,000 feet and the captain felt a shudder and heard a  noise," Matell said.  </P> <P> The plane returned to the Atlanta airport an hour later, Matell said, and the  passengers were transferred to another flight.  </P> <P> "Eastern is investigating the incident to try to determine what caused it,"  Matell said. "We'll keep the plane out of service until we find out exactly  what happened."  </P></p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Tottenham to fund deals from existing resources Shares in Tottenham Hotspur yesterday hit a new high for the year after the quoted north London football club said it would finance its recent acquisition spree out of existing cashflow and banking facilities. The share price - which rose 2p to 110p - has increased 21 per cent in the past week following the club's decision to buy German striker Jurgen Klinsmann and Ilie Dumitrescu of Romania. Mr Alan Sugar, chairman, said: 'We will be using cash resources and working with our banks to finance these deals.' The club is paying Pounds 2.31m for Klinsmann and Pounds 3.01m for Dumitrescu, including a 5 per cent levy to the Football League. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Sugar - who is also chairman of Amstrad, the electronics group - said Tottenham was trying to resolve a row with the Football Association over the club's exclusion from the FA Cup competition. 'The FA has made it tough for us, and it is my kind of spirit to hit back and try to solve the problems.' In June the club was fined Pounds 600,000, banned from the FA Cup competition and docked 12 league points over irregular payments to players. Although the FA subsequently decided to increase the fine to Pounds 1.5m and reduce the league penalty to six points, the share price has risen by 38 per cent since its June low of 80p. City analysts said the increase reflected expectations of higher ticket and merchandise sales, and the prospect of on-field success from the new players.</p>

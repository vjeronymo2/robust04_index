			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / A lovable bully's fall from grace: Christopher Lorenz reflects on the leadership of soccer's Brian Clough So. Farewell Then, Brian. Doyen of the City Ground. Your old magic has ceased to Inspire. You've been elbowed out. The enterprise you've led for 18 Glorious years is collapsing. Keith's mum says you were a loudmouthed Bully. But I always thought you were the master. You'll be sorely missed by fans and rivals. Life will never be the same. (With apologies to EJ Thribb (17 1/2 ) of Private Eye magazine) For any readers in New York, Nuremberg, Nantes or - God forbid - Nottingham who haven't the faintest idea what on earth this dreadful adolescent doggerel is all about, the explanation is this. A few days ago Britain's best-known soccer manager and TV sports 'personality', the larger-than-life Brian Clough, announced under boardroom pressure that he would retire from his job at Nottingham Forest Football Club from the end of the season. He has occupied the post since 1975, making him, at 58, the second-longest-serving postwar soccer manager since the legendary Matt Busby of Manchester United. Clough's passing, and next week's probable relegation of the club which he transformed from mediocre journeymen to European champions, holds lessons aplenty for other leaders and their followers - not just in sport, but also in politics and especially business. For Clough's irascible character and domineering leadership style bear a striking resemblance, albeit in exaggerated form, to those of many politicians and top executives past and present. Remember Margaret Thatcher, who departed in equally ignominious circumstances? Or Lord King, late of far-from-Virgin British Airways, who went in similar fashion? Or Robert Horton, ousted from the chairmanship of British Petroleum last summer after only two years at the top? Admittedly, managing a football club is in a somewhat lesser league than the tasks which such big-time players perform. But this does not invalidate the parallels between their styles of leadership, as Clough's career shows. Together with many charismatic business leaders who have a sustained stay at the helm, Clough had his most successful years as part of a duo. In business, the partner usually stays quietly out of the limelight. But Clough's, the late Peter Taylor, was equally outspoken. Once they split up, Clough never hit quite the same heights again. His leadership style epitomised old-fashioned industrial management - the arrogant, charismatic autocrat who rules with a rod of iron, and demands unquestioning obedience. Nigel Nicholson, professor of organisational behaviour at the London Business School, calls this 'benign despotism - or not always so benign'. In Clough's case, the fear this induced was laced with a streak of paternalism and - something many business leaders lack - genuine humour. Whatever the wider world thought of him, this earned him intense respect, sometimes bordering on love, from almost all his staff. Lord King and Lady Thatcher were rather different. Combined with their manifest competence, the fear they induced earned them bags of respect, but little love. Clough's insistence on blind loyalty from his staff extended to forcing even mature star players to run through beds of nettles. Nicholson calls such acts 'rites of degradation which fully absorb people into the clan.' Clough also had a habit of humiliating players in front of one another - though much less often in public. As one of them wrote: 'It was the law of the playground.' Another tendency was to reward players when they expected to be punished, and visa versa. 'Such unpredictability creates extreme dependence,' Nicholson says. It also prompted several mature men to walk out of the club. But Clough made a virtue of it even in public. In the business world, such mercurial behaviour is unusual, and top managers who practise it tend not to last long - unless, like Robert Maxwell, they own the company. Clough's sense of his own power was so acute that he wore it on his sleeve. As with Bob Horton at BP, he could never cease letting you know that he was the boss. Overtly manipulative behaviour of this kind can be deeply annoying to one's staff, even when done with a dash of humour. Horton's conversations and internal speeches were peppered with jokes about his supposed infallibility, or his 'running for Pope', while Clough belittled most males by calling them 'young man'. He parodied this in a recent TV advert by telling Gary Lineker and other England soccer stars to eat up their Shredded Wheat cereal. Psychologists argue that such brash behaviour usually stems from insecurity. Even at the top of BP, Horton certainly saw himself as an outsider, with a different educational background from most of his Oxbridge colleagues. In Clough's case it rankled badly that he had failed to be appointed manager of the English national team. Another similarity with Horton was the contradiction between Clough's own autocratic style and his professional belief in democracy. A lifetime member of the Labour party, he talked for years of becoming an MP. At BP, Horton eventually espoused the 'empowerment' of managers and employees, but failed to suppress his innate nature, even with colleagues. It was part of his undoing. When the time for instant judgments is over, and heavyweight historians move in, Clough's key strengths will be seen as his professional skill and perception, plus his remarkable ability to motivate the members of a team to raise their performance to impossible heights. The list of his faults will include arrogance and the congenital inability of most leaders to recognise when they have lost their touch (or passed their sell-by date, as EJ Thribb would say). As recently as March, Clough was still joking about his ability to 'walk on water'. Leaders who feel that way should watch their step.</p>

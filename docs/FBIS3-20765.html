			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by TA SR: "We Are Ruthenians Not Ukrainians, </F> Ruthenians Solemnly Declare After Meeting in Presov]    [Text] Rusinska Obroda [RO--Ruthenian Revival] has never  been and never will be a member of the civic association  Spoluzitie [Coexistence], its mission is diametrically opposed  to the strategy and tactics of that movement: This sentiment has  inspired the proclamation issued by the Coordinating Committee  of Rusinska Obroda in the Slovak Republic, which met over the  weekend in Presov.    It is the goal of RO to preserve the Ruthenian language and  culture. This is why its Coordinating Committee demands the  introduction of a Ruthenian version of the ethnic broadcasts of  Slovak Radio in Presov and the establishment of a Ruthenian  language and culture department at the Philosophy College of  P.J. Safarik University in Presov. The committee also requests  that [Slovak] media refer to the Ruthenians as a specific ethnic  group and not confuse them with Ukrainians.    As far as the Museum of Ruthenian-Ukrainian Culture in  Svidnik is concerned, the RO Coordinating Committee in the  Slovak Republic suggests renaming it the State Museum of  Ruthenian and Ukrainian Culture and proposes that its director  be selected by means of an open competition. In addition, it  advises that the museum should, preferably, also include a  research department devoted to the documentation of Ruthenian  culture.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Little evidence of government success with Citizen's Charter Sir, We welcomed the more objectively based assessment of the picture of public services painted by David Owen than that released by the government's own Citizen's Charter Unit. Your report on the findings of the ICM Research Survey was honestly headed 'Public services rapped: Citizen's Charter appears to be bringing little improvement' (August 26) - while the Citizen's Charter Unit's press release was headed 'Survey shows widespread support for Citizen's Charter'. It may be true that there is widespread support for the charter - and why shouldn't there be? There is little evidence, however, that the government's policies for achieving these objectives are having any success or that they carry the wide support that the Citizen's Charter Unit claims. The survey shows, as your report made clear, that of 31 organisations about which 3,000 people were questioned only eight were considered to have improved during the last year. Among those was the Post Office, with a 92 per cent rating for overall performance. The only policy for achieving the promised improvements of the Citizen's Charter that received strong support was more regular inspection of providers of services. Trade unions are always accused by this government of pursuing vested interests, yet we were never listened to when we pressed for improvements in the delivery of services long before the Citizen's Charter was launched and we are not listened to now. More and more people are beginning to say that the government's blind policy of privatising everything it can is wrong-headed. There is a growing belief that the policy is simply dogma and that cost and damage do not matter. Maybe if the government would stop the nonsense of market testing the entire civil service at enormous cost, and abandon the stupidity of privatising British Rail and the Post Office, its claimed objectives would be treated more seriously. At the moment it is pushing an ever growing boulder. John N Ellis, secretary, Council of Civil Service Unions, 58 Rochester Row, London SW1P 1JU</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By (?Javier Rodriguez)] </F>   [Text] Havana, 6 Apr (PL) -- Cuba reaffirmed today its  willingness to identify and resolve the problems affecting Cuban  emigres, within the framework of the conference that will bring  together in this city even opponents of the political system  that prevails on the island.    Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos told the local and  foreign press that the meeting, called "The Nation and  Emigration," to be held in Havana from 22 to 24 April, will  begin a process that will normalize relations between nationals  living abroad and the authorities of the Caribbean nation.    Bolanos confirmed, as PRENSA LATINA reported yesterday  evening, that old politicians and members of organizations  opposed to the country's revolutionary process were invited to  participate in the meeting, something that will broaden its  scope. Many have agreed to come to Havana.    Among those are Roberto Carballo and Luis Tornes, former  members of the invading brigade defeated at the Bay of Pigs in  1961; Ricardo Gonzalez and Vicente Crespo, of the so-called  Cuban Committee for Democracy [Comite Cubana por la Democracia];  and Rafael Huguet, Bernardo Benes, and Manuel Castro, of the  Cuban Change [Cambio Cubano] (CC) organization.    Other guests from the opposition segment living in the  United  States are Max Lesnik, a Miami politician and press commentator,  and Patricia Gutierrez, a CC member and daughter of the group's  top leader, Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo.    When asked about the possible participation of Gutierrez  Menoyo, Bolanos explained the Cuban Government understands he  has dissented from those who sponsor or defend the U.S. blockade  against Cuba.    "We have our thoughts on that position, and although he has  not been invited yet, he could be included on the list if that  were the case," he added.    The list of participants drafted by the Foreign Ministry  (Minrex) also included Angel Fernandez Varela, who years ago  headed a radio station for anti-Cuban propaganda, and former  military man Raul Barandella.    The deputy foreign minister noted that the participants must  have, as a common denominator, a concern for resolving the  problems related to emigration and interest in the country's  current situation. They must not set political conditions for  participating in the conference.    We seek to bring together and find formulas for dialogue  that  do not harm anyone and to which all can contribute, the official  indicated.    He then noted that it is precisely for that reason that  people belonging to different organizations opposed to the Cuban  process or who come of their own accord, but who are respectful  of the country, have been included.    Bolanos affirmed there will be time for comment on all  topics  during the conference and that two-thirds of the more than 200  guests will come from the United States on account of the number  of Cubans living in that country.    Topics discussed during the 1978 dialogue, left to be  reflected on or unsettled, will be resolved now, as well as  other topics, Bolanos noted.    In reply to another question, the official left to the  conference the matter of Cuba's recognition of dual citizenship,  although he admitted the country will submit proposals on this  and other issues to the consideration of the participants.    He confirmed that Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; Ricardo  Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's  Government; Abel Prieto, president of the Union of Writers and  Artists; and Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of  State, will deliver major speeches that can serve to open the  debates.    The Cuban delegation to the conference will comprise 60 to  70  Minrex, Cuban Friendship with the Peoples Insitute and Interior  Ministry officials and experts, intellectuals, and scholars.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Clinton in reach of nomination GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas left New York yesterday after two gruelling weeks of campaigning with the Democratic party's presidential nomination firmly in his reach. By winning in Tuesday's New York primary with 41 per cent of the vote, the Arkansas governor vaulted the biggest hurdle his campaign has faced. Victories in Wisconsin and Kansas on the same day added to his commanding lead over both Mr Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, who is the only major candidate still in the race, and Mr Paul Tsongas, who continues to win votes even though he has formally suspended his campaign. President George Bush, meanwhile, continued to record comfortable victories in Republican party primaries. Mr Clinton acknowledged yesterday that many voters still felt uncomfortable with him because of the series of allegations about adultery, marijuana smoking and draft dodging that have beset his campaign. 'I'm not interested in whether they love me or not. I want them to respect me and want me to be their president,' he said. Although Mr Tsongas surprised everyone by winning 29 per cent of the New York vote, in spite of not campaigning, he said he would take several days to decide whether to re-enter the race. Most politicians in Washington believe that, even if Mr Tsongas decides to relaunch his candidacy, he will do so with a severely limited campaigning schedule. Mr Brown, however, vowed to soldier on, despite being largely repudiated by voters in New York, where he won only 25 per cent of the vote. He fared better in Wisconsin with 35 per cent. Clinton supporters were yesterday campaigning intensely to win over the 772 Democratic party committee members and congressmen who will also take part in the nominating convention as 'super-delegates.' Mr Clinton is estimated to have the backing of 213 of them already, as well as 50 per cent of the 2,197 delegates so far allotted by primaries and caucuses. Three primary victories, Page 6</p>

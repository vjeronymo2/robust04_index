			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Bank warns on inflation Mr Major, be warned. The Bank of England's latest quarterly Inflation Report is bad news for you. It predicts that, if interest rates were to remain unchanged, underlying inflation two years hence would be 3-3 1/2 per cent. This would mean that the government's inflation target of 1-2 1/2 per cent a year by the end of the current parliament will not be met. The Bank's message is crystal clear: the next move in interest rates will not only be upwards but may have to come quite soon. The report identifies three main risks. First, rates of monetary growth have continued to increase. Second, expectations of inflation have risen. Finally, the growth of underlying average earnings has picked up. Narrow money, which grew at an annual rate of 6.2 per cent in April, is still well above its 0-4 per cent monitoring range. But this, says the Bank, may reflect an adjustment of cash balances towards a new equilibrium level, as interest rates have fallen. The growth of the broader measure of the money supply, M4, has increased for three consecutive quarters, to reach an annual rate of 5.9 per cent in March, which is near the centre of its 3-9 per cent monitoring range. Furthermore, the Bank's own weighted measure of the money supply has also begun to pick up. Greater uncertainty The clearest evidence of a deterioration in expectations of inflation is in financial markets, where gilt yields have risen by more than 2 percentage points since the turn of the year. This rise has been a global phenomenon, but it has been far greater in the UK than in most major economies. The gap between yields on index-linked and conventional gilts, a good indicator of expected inflation, has also risen by almost 1 1/2 percentage points since January, to 4.7 per cent. Obviously, investors doubt whether the government's inflation target will be met. The rise in yields may also reflect greater uncertainty about future inflation and real yields. The Bank points, mischievously, to the last cut in interest rates, on February 8, now known to have been imposed, against its advice, by the chancellor of the exchequer. 'The substantial rise in nominal bond yields some days after this cut,' notes the report, 'suggested revised perceptions of the authorities' commitment to monetary stability.' The pick-up in the growth of underlying average earnings, from 3 per cent in November to 3 1/2 per cent in February, may be early evidence that expectations of inflation have risen among wage bargainers too. Puzzling rise This rise is rightly deemed puzzling, since there remains a large excess supply of labour in the UK economy. The number of hours worked in the economy has, after all, fallen significantly since its peak in 1989. The Bank iself estimates the 'output gap' - a measure of economy-wide excess capacity - at just under 6 per cent. This ought to give the UK several years of rapid growth before strong inflationary pressures re-emerge. But the evidence of higher pay inflation means that 'it will be necessary to monitor labour market developments extremely carefully over the next few months'. The report warns wage bargainers that 'monetary policy will not be used to validate inflation outside the target range'. If higher inflation is assumed in pay negotiations, 'real wage levels will turn out to be too high, with the result that labour demand will be lower and unemployment higher than it need be'. The warning is needed. If policy were expected to accommodate higher levels of wages and prices, that belief could lead to higher wage bargains and settlements. People must have faith in the inflation target and 'that belief must be reinforced by adherence to a firm monetary stance'. Unfortunately, the government is responsible for the actions needed to reinforce credibility and, not surprisingly, given its past record and the current political shambles, its commitment is in serious doubt. This means, in turn, that the real cost of achieving the target is higher than it need be, which further reduces its credibility. Whatever the political difficulties, the chancellor must heed the Bank's warning. Neither he, nor the country, can afford to preside over yet another missed target.</p>

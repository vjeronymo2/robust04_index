			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (10): When precision is everything - JIT is aimed at manufacturers of goods with limited shelf-life where delivery promises are critical. The service also reduces stocks of finished goods and cuts operating costs / Just-in-time-delivery Just-in-time delivery is often thought of as an express service. It may well be on occasions but essentially JIT is a method of distribution - tailored to customers' individual requirements - that ensures goods arrive at a specific destination at a specified time, whether the following day or the following month. What counts is precise arrival. 'The essence of just-in-time is to deliver with ultra efficiency. It is about cutting dead days out of the distribution system,' says Peter Brougham, logistics director of scientific suppliers Life Sciences International. 'It is about carriers doing what they promise - that, effectively, is just-in-time.' The system fails if one of three things occur: production lines become idle for lack of required parts; a perishable product arrives too late to be of any use; or items turn up too early and have to be stored and, possibly, re-transported. JIT was created to reduce stocks of finished goods and warehousing capacity and to allow manufacturers to be more responsive to changes in demand. According to Anthony Lock, marketing manager of TNT Express Worldwide, products suited to JIT are those 'where delivery promises are critical', particularly in areas such as electronic components and sub-assemblies, vehicle production and items that have limited shelf-life. Health-science company Amersham International, for example, manufactures products containing radio-activity, which has a limited lifespan, making fast delivery paramount. 'It is essential for our products to reach customers, especially hospitals, in time for them to be of any use,' said Martin Goodwill, the group's distribution manager. 'For most people dealing with carriers there is a clear split choice between service and cost. For us, the former is everything. A cheap service that fails is pointless. For JIT to be effective, carriers must be prepared to look at customers' individual needs rather than trying to fit them into services that they already provide.' In the end, their promise has to be based on the one suppliers have made to their customers.' Amersham International's approach is to start with the client and work backwards. Having discovered when a delivery is needed, it looks at its own internal procedures and operational factors governing its carrier and gears everything to fit. 'For JIT to be effective, carriers must be prepared to look at customers' individual needs rather than trying to fit them into services that they already provide,' says Mr Goodwill. 'In the past,' says Mr Goodwill, 'the wisdom was that you had to hold stock. The great improvement in carrier services, especially JIT now means that isn't so essential.' Mr Lock says that TNT Express Worldwide's air network in Europe normally delivers material (collected late in the afternoon) before the start of a shift the next morning. TNT Express's European road service collects material from suppliers and delivers on a daily basis, usually within 48 hours, according to Mr Lock, 'enabling minimum inventory to be held outside materials in transit'. He says TNT Express Worldwide's involvement in JIT is increasingly in industries with pan-European multi-site operations. These, he explained, 'are built to increase efficiencies and take advantage of economies of scale but, as a result, require a cost-effective solution to the logistical demands of moving component parts between sites and from component factories to final assembly plants.' Life Services International, as a manufacturer and supplier of laboratory equipment to hospitals, universities and pharmaceutical companies around the world, needs both planned and emergency cover from the express sector. 'We don't want any fat in our manufacturing process,' says Mr Brougham. 'We schedule our production into the distribution chain. 'Everything leaves our door to fall in line with the carrier. But if they say delivery will take place on the 40th day or the next day, that's what we expect. 'When delivery fails, it's manufacturers and distributors who end up footing the bill. The ultimate penalty is that you lose the trust of your customers,' he adds. But Mr Brougham believes that in general carriers' reliability is improving. 'Ten years ago, expectations were at your own peril if you took every promise literally.'</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 MEN ARRESTED IN RIDE-BY PURSE THEFTS  </P> <P> Los Angeles police were gathering evidence Wednesday from more than 50 ride-by  purse snatchings in the San Fernando Valley since September that were believed  to have been the work of two men arrested this week, authorities said.  </P> <P> Police said they believe the arrests of Ronald Clark, 24, and Curtis Brooks,  26, both of Reseda, brought to an end a string of similar incidents in which  women were robbed while walking through shopping center parking lots, primarily  in the West Valley.  </P> <P> The suspects were arrested Monday night following three days of surveillance by  a team of detectives in cars and on motorcycles, said Sgt. Paul Mattson. The  surveillance was begun after an off-duty police officer familiar with the  string of purse snatchings by two men on a motorcycle spotted them Friday in  the West Valley and followed them to their apartment in Reseda.  </P> <P> Mattson said that on Monday evening the two men went out on the motorcycle and  rode through the parking lots of several shopping areas in the Valley. About 6  p.m. they rode up behind a woman in Lucky Market parking lot in the 22800 block  of Victory Boulevard and stole her purse. She was not hurt.  </P> <P> The suspects were followed to their apartment and arrested without incident,  Mattson said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GREAT MANAGERS STANDING IN LINE FOR HALL OF FAME  </P> <P> Applauding Earl Weaver's acceptance into the Baseball Hall of Fame is a  reasonable presumption but far from automatic. The record book builds strong  cases for other imposing nominees, namely Leo Durocher, Billy Southworth, Frank  Selee and Ned Hanlon, who is credited with devising modern managerial strategy.  </P> <P> Closing in fast, statistically, are Sparky Anderson and Tommy Lasorda, both of  whom are still active. And not to be discounted are Dick Williams and Whitey  Herzog, currently retired.  </P> <P> The question that is pertinent in the land of the Baltimore Oriole is when will  Weaver follow Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson and Jim Palmer -- three players  he had the good fortune to have on his teams -- into the Hall of Fame? Weaver,  quite naturally, would thrill to the honor as would his friends.  </P> <P> "It's something I'd regard as the absolute highlight," he says, but realizes  that the competition offers impressive credentials, meaning longevity, pennants  won and winning percentage. Weaver was with the Orioles 17 years, led them to  four pennants and his .583 percentage is ninth best of all-time.  </P> <P> In the percentage category, Jim Mutrie, who managed before the turn of the  century, Selee and Southworth are ahead of him. They have marks of .611, .598  and .597. Mutrie won three pennants, Selee five and Southworth four -- the same  number as Weaver. Growing up in St. Louis, Weaver studied -- even idolized --  Southworth as he led the Cardinals.  </P> <P> A strong contender, too, is Durocher, who managed 24 years, had a percentage of  .540 and won three pennants. It is difficult to assess a manager's worth to a  team because more depends on the talent he has available, as witness what  happened to Casey Stengel, who in his nine years with the Boston Braves and  Brooklyn Dodgers never reached the first division.  </P> <P> Yet when Stengel got the opportunity to lead the New York Yankees, he won 10  pennants in 12 years. Then he closed out his career by putting in four seasons  with the other New York team, the Mets, and finished 10th and last. A disaster.  So evaluating a manager's worth is nebulous at best.  </P> <P> It would seem that Weaver will face his sternest challenge from Selee,  Southworth, Durocher and when they retire, Anderson and Lasorda, each of whom  has won five and four pennants, respectively.  </P> <P> The Hall of Fame has selected a modest number of managers, considering that  only 14 have been picked since the selections began in 1939. The lineup  includes Walter Alston (the last manager named to the Hall, 1983), Charles  Comiskey, Clark Griffith, "Bucky" Harris, Miller Huggins, Al Lopez, Connie  Mack, Joe McCarthy, John McGraw, Bill McKechnie, Wilbert Robinson, Stengel,  George Wright and Harry Wright.  </P> <P> Before Weaver can be considered by the jury weighing his accomplishments, he  must wait a minimum of five years, which means that he becomes eligible in  1992. The voting is the responsibility of the Hall of Fame Veterans Committee  of 18, including ex-players, executives and five sportswriters.  </P> <P> So the Baseball Writers Association, which elects the modern players, will not  have any influence when it comes to addressing the subject of managers. An  impressive portfolio can be advanced in behalf of Hanlon, leader of the old  Orioles. He won five pennants, three in Baltimore and two in Brooklyn.  </P> <P> Plus the fact that he is generally credited with conceiving the strategical  "book" used by managers everywhere. Does color and charisma and having a  commanding presence enter into it? That seems doubtful, considering the  personalities and styles of Durocher and Alston.  </P> <P> Durocher was demonstrative; Alston passive. Yet one is in and the other waits  in line. How managers make the Hall of Fame can't be correlated to numbers or  reputations. A backlog of exceptional candidates awaits the call.  </P></p>

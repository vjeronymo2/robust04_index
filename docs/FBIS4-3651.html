			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Rational Targets Set for National </F> Development"]    [Text] Only by pursuing sustained development can China  have a bright future. Achieving this goal will require the  nation to control its population growth, save resources, protect  the environment and ensure social stability, reported Management  World magazine.    China has a long way to go to complete these tasks and is  already confronting serious challenges in these four areas of  concern.    China entered a period of rapid population growth in the  1950's when industrialization took off following Liberation in  1949.    The baby boom slowed down after family planning began in  1978  but the problem still looms large because of the huge population  already created. Birth control limits should be based on  economic development, the reserve of resources and environmental  conditions, said the State Council-supported magazine.    Demographers have set specific targets for national birth  rate. China should keep its population below 1.3 billion by the  turn of the century, below 1.46 billion by 2020 and realize zero  growth -- where the number of births and deaths are roughly  equal -- by the year 2030.    Maximum population in the next century should not exceed 1.6  billion, the article suggests.    Experts predict the elderly and labour population will peak  between 2020 and 2040. Total population will be at least 1.5  billion by 2040, two thirds of whom will be in the 15-64 age  group. About 300 million people will be at least 60 years old.    To provide work for all these people China should try all  possible means to create more opportunities by developing  labour- intensive businesses.  <H5>  Old Age </H5>   The article suggests the 1990's will be a golden time to tap  workforce potential. After this decade a large proportion of  the population will enter old age.    Much of the populace are from the rural areas. To provide  jobs for them, it is important to transfer surplus labour to  related or even nonagricultural sectors.    Farmers can be organized to harness desertification,  assigned  to afforestry and irrigation projects or the construction of  other infrastructure facilities.    Alternative employment can be found in township enterprises  and service industries.    The vast pool of scientific personnel should also develop  hi-tech enterprises in big cities, coastal areas, and regions  along the Yangtze River.    Secondly, China should save and make a more efficient use of  its limited resources. Thriftiness must be upheld in both  consumption and production.    China cannot imitate the developed countries' model of  resource allocation; instead, it should choose a cost efficient  plan.    To promote efficient agriculture, land and water should be  saved. Fields can be used for multiple cropping and advanced  irrigation projects can bring marginal arid lands into  production.    In industry, new technology should be introduced to save  energy and raw materials. Redundant projects should be  eliminated and waste should be recycled, a practice that would  also help the environment.  <H5>  Lifestyle </H5>   A luxurious lifestyle in daily life should be discouraged.    Staple food should be plant-oriented; more chemical fabrics  should be manufactured to replace cotton products to relieve the  pressure on the land, allowing more food to be grown; more  apartment buildings, public buses, and subways should be  developed.    Thirdly, environment protection should run parallel to  economic construction.    Protection should be written into the long-term social and  economic development programme.    Environment-friendly economic and technological policies  should be encouraged. Clean industrial production and  ecological agriculture should be promoted.    Environmental protection agencies at all levels should be  reinforced; laws and regulations should also be drafted and  strictly enforced. A national network monitoring environmental  conditions should be established and international cooperation  should be sought and enhanced.    Fourth, national economic development should be stable,  sustained and concerted.    The past 40 years demonstrated that too high a growth rate  can lead to economic setbacks and severe losses.    The government should take economic measures to regulate  development speed. And the development of different sectors of  the national economy should be coordinated.  <H5>  Growth Rate </H5>   After analyzing economic growth in the past 40 years,  experts  suggest that the Gross National Product should grow at 6 to 7  percent, the agricultural output value should increase 3-4  percent, and grain output 2-3 percent. Industrial output value  should grow 10-12 percent. Specifically, light industry needs  to grow 10-12 percent and heavy industry 11-13 percent. Per  capita income should climb at 5-6 percent.    If such growth can be maintained, the economy can develop  smoothly.    As China witnesses the economic boom, it will have trouble  adjusting the relationship between population and resources,  supply and demand, and between economic development and social  progress.    During this period, the government should keep close watch  on  the national economy and be cautious in introducing economic and  social reform packages.    The government should curb inflation, minimize the widening  income gap, and reduce the friction between conflicting  interests and political and cultural groups.    Meanwhile, the government should also establish a management  system compatible with the demands of the market economy. This  management system should extend its responsibility to  production, distribution, circulation, and consumption.</p>

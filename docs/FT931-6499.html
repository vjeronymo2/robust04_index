			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Clinton eclipses Republican sun: America After Franklin Roosevelt defeated Herbert Hoover in 1932, the Democrats controlled the White House for 20 years, created a taste for government activism and permanently altered the social and economic landscape. It is far too soon to argue that President Bill Clinton will have a remotely comparable impact on US politics. But his remarkable personal attributes, coupled with seismic changes in the economic, social and diplomatic environment, suggest American conservatives may face some very lean years. At times Republicans are confronted by a politician so perfect that he might be an android built in some mad scientist's lab. Mr Clinton has a formidable IQ and a near-photographic memory. Yet he radiates warmth as well as rationality; he understands popular culture (would any republican leader feel comfortable on stage with Michael Jackson?); and he is a superb communicator. Mr Clinton has a gift for mastering complex subjects and presenting them in simple terms children can grasp. He is equally comfortable delivering a televised address to the nation, debating in a 'townhall' meeting, jousting with journalists or merely chatting with folks at a MacDonald's restaurant. Who can the Republicans throw into battle against so accomplished a political quarterback? Messrs Robert Dole and Robert Michel, the Republican leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives, are solid, honourable politicians, but they can match neither Mr Clinton's intellect nor his rhetoric. Potential Republican presidential candidates in 1996 are mostly lying low. Among governors, Mr Pete Wilson of California, once highly rated, may have been irretrievably damaged by his state's deep recession and budget crisis. Mr Dick Cheney and Mr Jack Kemp, defence and housing secretaries respectively in President Bush's cabinet, remain well respected. But one wonders how either would measure up against Mr Clinton, whose authority will be steadily enhanced by the pomp and ceremony of office. Much else is going Mr Clinton's way. The timing of the business cycle is just perfect for the Democrats. George Bush was torpedoed by three years of economic stagnation; Mr Clinton inherits an economy that we now know was growing at an annual rate of almost 5 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year. Yet the good news is sinking in so slowly that popular opinion will probably associate the recovery with Mr Clinton's economic package. Given the nature of business cycles, the US economy is likely to grow at an annual rate of 3 per cent (perhaps more) for the next few years, almost regardless of the White House's policies. Yet in 1996 Mr Clinton will sound extremely plausible when he claims credit for restoring jobs and prosperity. The end of the cold war, while welcomed by Republicans, represents another heavy blow to their electoral fortunes. The potential threat from a heavily armed communist foe - an 'evil empire' in Ronald Reagan's words - gave American conservatives a sense of unity and purpose. Now that the US is the only military superpower, defence is largely neutralised as a political issue. There has been little public reaction to the very deep real defence cuts proposed by Mr Clinton. Republicans seem equally vulnerable on social issues. Mr Clinton will undoubtedly propose a comprehensive plan for reforming the flawed healthcare system. People will dislike some aspects of the plan, especially the need for new taxes to finance cover for the uninsured, but they will respect him for tackling an issue that Republican presidents dodged for too long. Mr Clinton is also more in tune with changing social mores than his conservative opponents: by being pro abortion and pro gay rights he is moving with the tide of public opinion (especially among the young). The Republican party's ability to adapt flexibly to social change is badly hampered by the growing influence at local level of the fundamentalist Christian right. As if this were not enough, conservatives have to realise that their political ascendancy during the past 12 years was never quite what it seemed. In the 1980s, Republicans briefly controlled the Senate; but Democrats have enjoyed large majorities in the House of Representatives for four decades. If the nation had really been converted to conservative doctrines in the Reagan years, the Republicans would have won far more Congressional seats. There is always a chance that Mr Clinton will stumble badly. He could be undermined by a foreign-policy disaster or (less likely) by some unexpected economic setback. But if conservatives want to regain power in 1996, they will have to articulate an agenda for government that competes with Mr Clinton's. This will not be easy, if only because he has appropriated much of their best language - from 'empowering' individuals to 'reinventing' government. Mr Clinton is also canny in deliberately framing his policies to appeal to middle-income families, which are far more numerous than the minority groups that monopolised the attention of Democrats during much of the 1970s and 1980s or the rich, who still enjoy disproportionate clout in the Republican party. It all adds up to a challenge of historic proportions for the conservative thinktanks which, at least geographically, still surround the White House.</p>

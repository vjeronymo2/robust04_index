			<p>940312 FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Endangered males give praise . . . Sir, In this age of diminished expectations, job security is a laughable relic of a former life. We request, however, that the FT put serious consideration to offering Mr Michael Thompson-Noel a columnist position until the unfortunate event of his passing away. As management students in the somewhat humourless US, we have come to rely on his witty column every weekend as a source of unquestionable entertainment value. His latest offering, 'Wimp of the species' (March 5), was his best to date. As beleaguered males living in the politically correct/feminazi world that is academia in Boston, we have finally found a worthy and able spokesman for the endangered male species. Hardly a day goes by that we do not thank our lucky stars that the FT and Mr Thompson-Noel are available on this side of the pond. Spiridonas Diolitsis, Athanassios Kussathanas, 175 Freeman Street, 904, Brookline, US</p>

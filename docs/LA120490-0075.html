			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SETS TOUGHER RESTRICTIONS TO MONITOR KEATING  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge Monday ordered indicted Arizona businessman Charles H.  Keating Jr. to begin a stricter weekly check-in schedule after prosecutors  complained that the former thrift executive couldn't be found over the  Thanksgiving Day weekend.  </P> <P> Judge Lance A. Ito ordered Keating and the Los Angeles County district  attorney's office to choose a specific day and time for weekly check-ins by  telephone.  </P> <P> "That way, you don't have to play phone tag with each other," Ito said.  </P> <P> The 66-year-old Keating is free on $500,000 bail while he awaits trial on 46  counts of state securities fraud. He has been required to check in weekly with  authorities, but previously was not required to adhere to a specific time and  day.  </P> <P> Keating, the former owner of the defunct Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, was two  days late over the Thanksgiving Day weekend in contacting prosecutors.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman said Keating had given prosecutors a  telephone number and a time to call him on the Friday after Thanksgiving, but  no one answered when a district attorney's investigator called.  </P> <P> The investigator also called one of Keating's lawyers in Chicago, and the  lawyer tried reaching Keating. But Keating had changed his unlisted telephone  number to another unlisted number, and the lawyer didn't get through until  Sunday. Keating called the investigator on the Sunday after Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> Keating's lead lawyer, Stephen C. Neal, called the prosecutor's action a  "trumped-up issue," but Hodgman said Keating simply wasn't where he said he  would be. "Mr. Keating's got to play by the same rules as any other defendant,"  Hodgman said.  </P> <P> Keating appeared at the hearing, but Neal would not allow him to respond to  reporters' questions.  </P> <P> Ito also scheduled a Jan. 11 hearing on defense motions to dismiss 26 counts  because Keating's lawyers say the counts fail to allege a crime or are vague.  Those counts are the new and expanded versions of 22 counts that Ito had set  aside on similar grounds Nov. 9. He allowed prosecutors to amend the  indictment.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys also contend that prosecutors can't amend accusations in a  grand jury indictment without approval from the grand jury. State law allows  prosecutors to make minor changes in indictments but requires that major  changes be approved by the same or a new grand jury.  </P> <P> The remaining 20 counts also are being attacked by the defense on grounds that  the grand jury returned the indictment without reasonable or probable cause.  Ito will set a hearing on that issue later.  </P> <P> Keating, who is the former chairman of American Continental Corp., is accused  with three other former executives of misleading small investors who bought  some $200 million in the company's bonds at the Southern California branches of  its primary subsidiary, Lincoln Savings, of Irvine. The bonds have become  worthless since the company filed for bankruptcy protection in April, 1989.  </P></p>

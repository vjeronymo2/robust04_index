			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (9): The roots go deep - Peugeot Talbot's community involvement A FEW weeks ago, a small community group in the Stoke area of Coventry needed access to a photocopying machine, to duplicate a newsletter. It turned for help to an unexpected quarter. In many areas the appeal would automatically have been made to the local authority, or one of its agencies. In Stoke, however, as in many other parts of the city, it is increasingly Peugeot Talbot, the French car manufacturer  -the antecedents of which put down roots in the fabric of Coventry early this century - where such requests are heard. Roots - or Rootes - is the operative word, of course. Lord Rootes, as he later became, was one of the men who helped found the city's wealth on the motor car, and having prospered so much from the skills and hard work of the local people, he resolved to put something back. Perhaps the most public evidence of Rootes patronage in the city is the widely-respected University of Warwick, which despite its name is well within the city boundary, and which came into being thanks largely to the family's influence. Peugeot Talbot assumed the role of patron when it acquired the ailing UK business of Chrysler, which had absorbed Rootes Group some years earlier. Mr Dick Parham, the deputy managing director, concedes that the company's charitable efforts were permitted to wane in the years following the takeover, as the management wrestled with the more pressing problems of survival. Some four years ago there was a sea change in Peugeot Talbot's fortunes, and it became obvious that the company was riding the crest of a wave. At about the same time, Mr Geoffrey Whalen, the managing director, and his board members looked again at the company's place in the community. Mr Parham deliberately chooses small instances, like the offer to duplicate the newsletter, to illustrate Peugeot's belief that there is more to community involvement than cheque book charity - the glamorous and well-publicised business of allocating large sums for heart-rending causes. The story can be told in figures, of course - charitable giving last year of Pounds 181,000, covenants to hospitals, schools and community associations, lists of cars on long-term loan to deserving organisations. But the statistics alone leave the true nature of Peugeot's commitment in shadow. The whole issue is illuminated, and given character, by the people who work for the company, and who, from the boardroom to the shop-floor, immerse themselves in local affairs. SHOP-FLOOR workers are actively encouraged to involve themselves in local matters. The company, which already supplies four JPs to the local bench, recently asked for more volunteers to allow their names to go forward. Coventry's current lord mayor, Mr Dave Edwards, is an employee, as is the next mayor of Nuneaton, Mr Tony Lloyd. Among his many activities, Mr Whalen chairs the Coventry and Warwickshire Training and Enterprise Council, and has ensured that Peugeot Talbot personnel have been seconded to help with its work. Mr Parham is chairman of ADEPT - the Agency Developing Enterprise Partnership and Trust - which arose from the bishops' Faith in the City working party, and concentrates its work on the less privileged areas of the city. He was also instrumental in setting up the 'Spirit of Coventry' movement, which has now merged its interests with the newer, and like-minded, 'Coventry Is Making It' campaign. Other executives are engaged in similar work throughout the city - the purchasing director lends his expertise to the Coventry health authority, and the finance director serves as a governor at Hereward College, the city's national further education establishment specifically for the disabled. Links with education - and a desire to see employees enrich their lives in and out of the workplace - are strong at the company. The company sponsors Coventry Polytechnic's business school, helping to strengthen links between education and industry. It works closely with local schools and offers work experience to 16-18 year-olds. The firm has built a partnership centre, with an accent on foreign languages. Sporting ties are strong. The company sponsors Coventry City, Coventry Rugby Club, and Warwickshire Cricket Club - giving it a hand in the three most popular spectator sports in the area. On a broader front, Peugeot last year launched an assisted learning programme, allocating Pounds 250,000 for any studies - vocational or otherwise - to which employees are attracted, in the belief that anything which stimulates the learning habit will eventually enhance a fast-changing shop floor where the ability to pick up new skills quickly will be of crucial importance. By co-incidence, French has so far proved to be the most popular course, even for workers who do not need it for their jobs. But others have chosen to earmark their cash from the scheme in the pursuit of HGV licences, fork-lift truck skills - and even passing the standard driving test. 'We've made rapid progress over the past few years - but we've by no means finished. We can now give a lead, and harness the desire in the workforce to help in the community by having this effectively as part of the company's ethos,' Mr Parham explains.</p>

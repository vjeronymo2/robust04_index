			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Improved traffic helps Thai Airways Improvements in passenger and cargo load factors helped Thai International Airways to a 3.1 per cent improvement in third-quarter net profits, on a 6.5 per cent advance in operating revenues to Bt15.15bn (Dollars 606m), writes Williams Barnes in Bangkok. The company attributed the improved earnings to a rise in traffic, which lifted load factors (passengers and cargo carried) from 64 to 69 per cent. However, Mr Gerard Kruithof from Peregrine brokerage in Bangkok, said: 'The bare figures don't show how much of the profits have been boosted by extraordinary items like commissions from aircraft purchases and so on.' He said the airline could have trouble filling the new aircraft it has ordered. Five aircraft are scheduled to be delivered this fiscal year.</p>

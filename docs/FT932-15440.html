			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / The Week Ahead: Close watch on hotel sector after Queens Moat RESULTS DUE WITH the financial crisis at Queens Moat Houses still not fully explained, the rest of the hotel sector is being closely watched. Forte reports full year results on Thursday, with the City expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 70m, compared with Pounds 73m last time. Some expect the group to cut its 9.91p a share dividend. If it does, any criticism is likely to be muted, with many regarding a cut as evidence of financial sobriety. News of current trading will focus on whether recovery is taking root in London and any signs of life in the provinces. The group is also likely to be pressed on whether it would be interested in any of Queens Moat's Continental properties, should these become available. Blue Circle Industries and RMC Group will bring more news on Thursday about the building materials sector. The former, with about half the UK cement market, is expected to report pre-tax profits for 1992 of about Pounds 85m, down sharply from Pounds 124.2m a year earlier. There is also some question hanging over its 10.9p a share dividend. RMC, benefitting from its extensive German operations, is likely to report profits down only slightly from 1991's Pounds 167.4m. But with the German economy slowing rapidly, investors will be keen to hear about RMC's current prospects. Laura Ashley, the international fashion and furnishings group, is set to report a return to the black on Thursday after three years of losses. It may also pay a final dividend. A revitalised performance in the UK and continued growth on the continent should enable the group to report a Pounds 1m-Pounds 2m pre-tax profit for the year to January, in spite of losses and upheavals in the US. In 1991-92 the group lost Pounds 9.1m pre-tax including Pounds 11.5m of exceptional charges, mainly for reorganisation and stock write-downs. FR Group, the maker of in-flight refuelling equipment, is expected to report today preliminary 1992 pre-tax profits of around Pounds 23m against Pounds 21.4m a year earlier. A small dividend increase is forecast from 1991's 6.69p. One of the steadiest performers in the engineering sector, this would be the sixth year in a row of profits in the Pounds 21m-Pounds 23m range. Investors will need some reassurance, though, that its long term contracts will hold up. DIVIDEND &amp; INTEREST PAYMENTS YESTERDAY Bermuda Int. Bd. Fd.

			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT FORGOTTEN, NEVER CRUSHED  </P> <P> "They tried to instill into our minds that we would be forgotten in a few  years' time," said a black South African, a former political prisoner. "They  did everything to crush our morale."  </P> <P> The "they" in this case are the South African authorities, and they failed  completely in their attempt to break the spirit of their political prisoners or  the popular black equality movement they represent. African National Congress  leader Walter Sisulu and seven other South African political prisoners are free  from confinement, although their liberation is far from complete. Their recent  prison release, a gesture by the white minority government toward negotiations  with the black majority, provided them the opportunity to tell the world about  their lives behind the walls of Robben Island, South Africa's version of  Alcatraz, and Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town.  </P> <P> After Sisulu, still-imprisoned ANC leader Nelson Mandela and others were  convicted of conspiring to sabotage and overthrow the minority government, they  were put to work at hard labor. That meant breaking big rocks into small rocks  with a hammer, as a large guard with a swastika tattoo looked on. After a day  at hard labor, they had to strip naked outdoors and wash down with cold sea  water; black prisoners had to work in short pants and without socks, even in  the dead of winter.  </P> <P> Later, the prisoners fought back through hunger strikes and work stoppages and  won concessions from prison authorities. Robben Island and Pollsmoor provided  an excellent political education, former prisoner Ahmed Kathrada said, because  they "really confirmed our belief that the South African authorities do not  suddenly undergo a change of heart . . . nothing is done without pressure."  </P> <P> Their countrymen outside never forgot them, as South African authorities had  vainly hoped some 25 years ago. The freed prisoners emerged, morale uncrushed,  and were greeted with joyful sobs from South Africans who were not even born  when they were locked away. Largely cut off from communication with the outside  world, they spent a generation of darkness in prison -- but they can be proud  of the light they have helped to shine on South Africa.  </P></p>

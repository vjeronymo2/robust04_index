			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Job survey lifts hope for union chiefs the proportion of union members to the total workforce - have made gloomy reading for union leaders for more than a decade. The latest Department of Employment Labour Force Survey (LFS) showed density slipping to 37.5 per cent of the workforce last year. However, the survey, plus unpublished data from the Engineering Employers Federation, provides a few fragments of hope for union bosses as well as some statistical curiosities. The density figure for part-time workers - a growing but difficult-to-unionise part of the workforce - grew slightly from 21 per cent to 22 per cent last year, according to the Labour Research Department analysis of the LFS. That helps to explain why union density for women, who make up the bulk of part-time workers, stayed at 32 per cent last year while male density dropped from 43 per cent to 42 per cent. Manual workers are still more likely to be in unions than white-collar workers - 41 per cent compared with 35 per cent - but union density is highest of all in 'professional occupations', possibly explained by high unionisation among teachers. The lowest level of unionisation is among 'sales occupations', at 15 per cent. Only nine of 49 job categories saw union density rise last year - one was property dealers, no doubt responding to the threat of redundancy in the troubled estates market. The biggest fall in union density was in the water industry - 82 per cent to 74 per cent - probably as a result of privatisation in England and Wales in 1988. Next came telecommunications (80 per cent to 73 per cent) as a result of job transfers from unionised British Telecom to non-union Mercury. In the 1980s, union density fell sharply everywhere except in the public sector. Even manufacturing, the heartland of unionisation in the private sector, saw a big fall in density and not just in absolute numbers. The manufacturing workforce has fallen from 7m in 1979 to about 4.5m. According to LFS figures, union density was about 58 per cent in manufacturing in 1984 and had fallen to 47 per cent by 1989. Department of Employment statisticians believe it is now just above 40 per cent. That is not because there has been widespread derecognition where unions are already established, but because the few new manufacturing jobs, often in the electronics sector, are generally not unionised. Within manufacturing companies there has been a reduction in hourly paid manual employment and an increase in white-collar and professional jobs, which are less likely to be unionised. A detailed survey of about a quarter of the 5,000-plus companies affiliated to the Engineering Employers Federation shows that the engineering core of manufacturing remains solidly unionised. Of 1,300 companies surveyed, 62 per cent recognise unions for collective bargaining, representing 79 per cent of the total number of workers employed by the sample. A total of 86 per cent of hourly paid workers in those companies are covered by collective bargaining and a surprisingly high 69 per cent of staff. There is interest in simplifying collective bargaining and harmonising conditions between white and blue-collar workers, but only 7 per cent of the companies negotiate for both groups together. The likelihood of collective bargaining rises with the size of establishment. All those with more than 1,000 workers have collective bargaining.</p>

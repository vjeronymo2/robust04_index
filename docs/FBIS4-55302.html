			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with political scientist Istvan Schlett by an </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "Schlett  Says: The Political Elite Will Solve Any Conflict"]    [Text] The intelligentsia constantly clobbers the  politicians. You journalists do that also, even though the  political elite's demonstrated ability to solve problems could  serve as an example for other elites, e.g., the cultural elite,  said political scientist Istvan Schlett. The renowned expert  said that, on the basis of the past four years, we can assume  that, regardless of the outcome of the elections, the parties  will be able to solve the problem of setting up an  administration and of governing.    You are telling me to imagine the unimaginable: Gabor Kuncze  and Peter Boross sitting at the same table and discussing the  possibility of forming a coalition. Well, that too could happen.  The Hungarian political elite is cultured enough to be able to  solve a deadlock, Schlett continued.    [Schlett] I do not think parliament will have to be  dissolved and new elections called because of the leading  parties' inability to agree on the conditions for governing. The  fact that the Free Democrats' nominee for the post of prime  minister is not a person with a "bunker mentality," but one who  represents a more open aspect of the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free  Democrats], is an indication of their willingness to compromise.  The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] has also gotten rid of  those whose main objective was to create conflicts.    I think that the parties are ready for further changes in  their leadership. Of course, I cannot see what is inside the  heads of politicians, and the opposite of this is also  conceivable. At any rate, it can be said on the basis of recent  events that they are more intelligent than is generally assumed.    [MAGYAR NEMZET] You are reluctant to make a guess about  which  parties are likely to become coalition partners. I will rephrase  the question, therefore, by asking which parties are likely to  win seats in parliament?    [Schlett] Forecasts suggest that the MSZP [Hungarian  Socialist Party] will win the elections. However, no one indeed  can say which party will come in second and third. The number of  undecided people is relatively great and it remains to be seen  whom they will vote for. This in itself may be cause for  surprises at the elections.    [MAGYAR NEMZET] What if parties of diametrically opposing  ideals get most of the votes, e.g. the MDF, the MSZP, and the  SZDSZ? Can you imagine them sitting at the same table and  beginning talks on governing? The statements they have made so  far exclude any possibility of a consensus between them. Do they  not lose their credibility before the voters by their  willingness to accept any deal for gaining power?    [Schlett] You approach the issue from the wrong direction.  Credibility is indeed important in politics but the capacity to  solve problems is even more important. It is natural for parties  to compete against each other during an election campaign, for  they are fighting for votes. However, finding compromises  becomes a priority after the elections because the country's  governability is at stake. Politics has a much more extensive  arsenal than merely classifying parties on the basis of their  credibility or lack thereof or of whether or not they fulfill  their campaign promises. The citizens expect politicians to  solve conflicts. In the interest of society, of our country, of  joining Europe and, of course, in the self-interest of parties  and politicians, they must adapt their viewpoints to one  another. Of course, the voters will determine the possible  combinations for a coalition, but I do not believe that a  situation will arise where the politicians will fail to find a  viable solution.    [MAGYAR NEMZET] Is it possible that the situation will  change  between the two rounds?    [Schlett] Of course. It could happen that the winner of the  first round will increase its advantage, for people do not like  to vote for a losing party. But the opposite could also happen,  namely, that a party will gain such a landslide victory that  people will become scared and say: This is too much of a  victory. Perhaps several parties will form totally unexpected  alliances to hinder an absolute victory by a leading party.</p>

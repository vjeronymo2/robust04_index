			<p>BFN     [Text] Bloemfontein April 7 SAPA -- The National  Peace-Keeping Force [NPKF] has relieved three senior officers,  including its chief of staff, of their duties for contravening  the corps' code of conduct. A statement on Thursday [7 April] by  the NPKF said Col Duma Mdutyana, until the disciplinary action  its chief of staff, was "deseconded" from April 5 after the  force's commander, Gen Gabriel Ramushwana, was informed that a  court case was pending against him.    The other two officers relieved of their duties are Lt-Col  George Sibanyoni, now former officer commanding Battalion 1, and  media laison officer Capt Johan Loots.    Both Col Mdutyana and col Sibanyoni had joined the NPKF from  the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation,  MK].    The statement said Col Mdutyana was facing a charge of  drunken driving in an NPKF vehicle following an incident on  March 20.    Col Sibanyoni, who was also dismissed on April 5, faces a  possible charge of culpable homicide following a motor accident  in Mamelodi, Pretoria, on the weekend of March 11-13. One person  died in the accident. Col Sibanyoni was apparently driving an  NPKF vehicle at the time.    According to the statement, Capt Loots of the South African  Police was dismissed when it was established he had issued a  press release in the name of NPKF public relations officer Maj  William Bisho, without the major's permission. "(Capt) Loots  also falsely claimed to have the permission of the NPKF GOC  (general officer commanding) to organise a press 'open day' at  De Brug on March 23, 1994 during the process of (troop)  evaluation."    As a result, media coverage had been unsympathetic.    Capt Loots is also accused of breaching the powers of his  position by dealing with the media without authorisation.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Arts: The Ghost Train - Theatre 'Stay here? In Fal Vale Station? Stay here all night?' Saul Hodgkin, the stationmaster, is portentously addressing six passengers who have been stranded without a train till tomorrow morning. He proceeds to tell the tale of the ghost train: 'Twenty year ago, this very night . . .' You laugh at the melodramatic spookiness of it; but, of course, you want to know what will happen. These two reactions were just what was intended in 1925, when this play was new; and they must have been hard to bring off then. Harder today, though, because Ghost Train is now also a period piece. Heightening our interest are the facts that the playwright, Arnold Ridley, later became known to every household as Private Godfrey in Dad's Army; and that the play was turned into a film (Arthur Askey et al). In this revival, Bill Oddie plays the stationmaster who must set the tone for what follows. He draws out the ghoulishness of the big narration nicely enough. But for comedy he is underpowered and disappointing. He throws away numerous opportunities, and is altogether too subdued. But the exquisite playing comes from his six passengers (one of whom is his real-life daughter, Kate Hardie, playing a newly-married flapper). As a determinedly independent wife marooned with a husband from whom she plans to separate, Catherine Russell is interesting and silly at the same time - first-rate. Avril Elgar, as an indignant spinster, and Aden Gillett, playing a Bertie Wooster-type oaf (with hidden depths), are both astonishingly like period cartoons comes to life. She seems to have been drawn by Osbert Lancaster, he by Peter Arno. Richard Stirling and Owen Brenman, as the two husbands, complete this excellent group. Were everything on this level, this would not seem a wispy play. Roger Butlin's set and Matt McKenzie's sound-effects are perfect. But the period quaintness now stops us from being the least bit scared. And the director, John Adams, seems to have rehearsed the first act best. Act Two sags. The hardest role of all is that of the fey and neurotic Julia Price, who, around midnight, invades the waiting-room, mysteriously drawn to the scene of the haunting, resisting the advice of friends and family. It is she who should draw the play to its climax of comic horror; and yet we should suspect her too. We certainly suspect Sara Mair-Thomas. For all the high accomplishment of her playing, she lacks the lightness of touch that would make Julia persuasive and/or amusing. She also plays the final turnabout too heavily. (There are several revelations in Act Three. Hers is the only one that fails to be hilarious.) And, as her loyal chum Sterling, Jonathan Philips overdoes everything. These are not disgraceful performances - but, like Oddie's, they are the reason this promising souffle does not rise. At the Lyric, Hammersmith, until January 2.</p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Observer: Bloody nose Possibly not the best time to be associated with the blood giving business, but Hartlepool brewer Camerons had the best of intentions when it launched its latest marketing ploy, a pint of ruby red Strongarm Bitter for every new blood donor on Teesside. Managing director Derek Andrew's idea was warmly welcomed by the Blood Transfusion Service, whose only condition was that the beer be drunk off the premises.

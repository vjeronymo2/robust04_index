			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Recovery day fails to strike a blow YESTERDAY's National Day of Recovery, organised by the Trades Union Congress to link the campaign against pit closures to job losses in general, will be remembered for a long time at George Fischer Castings in Bedford. On the day when union representatives around Britain were supposed to be asking their employers to think of alternatives to redundancy, Fischer told 300 of its 350 workers that their jobs were being transferred to Germany and Austria. Mr Mike Pennington, managing director of the Swiss-owned malleable-fittings maker, said he had not heard of the National Day of Recovery and admitted that the job losses had 'come as a shock' to most of the workers and their union. Since the slump in industrial and commercial construction in the UK, Fischer has been exporting most of its UK output. But as the German market weakens as well, customers can be better served from Continental plants. Overall, the Day of Recovery saw little union activity on jobs. Most big employers, such as ICI and Unilever, said they had had no formal approach from unions at national or plant level. There was a demonstration in Manchester, and a service for recovery at Southwark Cathedral in London attended by 350 people. At the TUC's own day-long conference in London the limelight was stolen by Mr Arthur Scargill, the National Union of Mineworkers president. He reverted to the militant rhetoric that has been notably absent in recent weeks when he called for 'a day of action with millions taking part' if the government did not keep open all 31 pits under review. His comments were immediately criticised by Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU craft union, who said they were a throwback to formulas that have never worked. The European dimension did at least come to the TUC's rescue. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary and president of the European Trade Union Confederation, led a joint European union and employers' delegation to urge a growth strategy on Mr John Major, the prime minister, for the Edinburgh summit. The European unions and employers claim some credit for putting the idea on the agenda at Edinburgh, and Mr Major said a European Commission plan for infrastructure investment would be married to UK ideas for improving labour market flexibility.</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Travel: A welcome for golfers It would be nice to report that Ernie Els, South Africa's latest golfing hero, learnt his golf at some historic course such as Durban Country Club or Royal Johannesburg. Alas, the truth is more mundane. Els - tall, blond and languid - learnt his trade at Kempton Park, the unprepossessing home to Jan Smuts airport and the World Trade Centre, the site of South Africa's historic constitutional negotiations. It is a relief all round that it is now both possible and legitimate to worry more about Ernie Els's fortunes than the state of constitutional talks. It can only be a matter of time before golfers start visiting the country in large numbers. The climate is ideal for playing golf and there are many fine courses. Equally important, there is an ever-growing array of independent country hotels offering high-quality service. A recent trip took me to some of South Africa's finer coastal golf courses. First stop was Selborne, a tight setting in the rolling Natal sugarlands, 40 minutes south of Durban. The course rewards cunning rather than brawn, and the wayward golfer will soon be defeated by bush and water, which features on 15 of the 18 holes. Overlooking the Indian ocean, Selborne Country Lodge, the Tudor-style guest-house attached to the lodge, provides a comfortable and friendly base. Resident professional is Trevor Wilkes, veteran of the professional circuit, repository of much golfing wisdom, and one-time runner-up to Gary Player in the South African Open. Next stop was Fancourt, a grander establishment in George, a beautiful, mountainous part of the southern Cape. It is the leading South African lay-out, most reminiscent of US courses: perfectly manicured, with greens fast and true. The practice facilities are probably without equal in South Africa. The course is a regular tournament venue. The hotel facilities are run to five-star standards by Orient-Express Hotels, which manages some of the world's top hotel properties, including the Mount Nelson in Cape Town, rated South Africa's finest. From George, I travelled to Cape Town and stayed in the charming Constantia Uitsig guest house on a wine-farm overlooking False Bay. Guests stay in small, converted Cape Dutch cottages, and there is a popular restaurant on site. There are at least half-a-dozen good courses within easy reach. The two I played were Clovelly and Milnerton. Clovelly is a tight, undulating course, slightly inland but still susceptible to the wind like all Cape courses. Milnerton is in a more challenging, links-style setting, situated on the shores of Table Bay. My final port of call was the Grand Roche hotel in Paarl, an ultra-luxurious establishment in the heart of the winelands. The hotel is home to Bosmans restaurant - reckoned by some to be South Africa's finest. The focus of the development is a beautiful Cape Dutch building overlooking Paarl. Grand Roche served as a base for playing two nearby parkland courses, Paarl and Stellenbosch. Both are pleasant, the latter in better condition and site of tournament golf in recent years. There are many fine courses besides the ones I visited. Most of the large cities have a number of courses, with Durban Country Club usually voted the best in the country. Best known is Sun City, venue for the annual Million Dollar classic, and a very challenging lay-out. It now has a twin course - Lost City - replete with grand architectural features and a water-hole that is home to dozens of crocodiles. No golfer should resist the challenge of these courses and try, if you can, tostay in the Palace hotel. For those wanting to mix game-watching and golf, the Hans Merekensky course in the mining town of Phalaborwa should not be missed. Not only is it close to Kruger national park, the main public wildlife park, and luxury private lodges, but there is a good chance of sharing the fairways with baboons and wart hogs. Zimbabwe also provides visitors with a regional dimension. Newly-developed is the Leopard Rock course in the Eastern Highlands, and Elephant Hills near Victoria Falls. In addition, there are established courses, such as Royal Harare.

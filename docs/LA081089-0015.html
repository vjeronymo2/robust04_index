			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOSEMITE CLIMB  </P> <P> I would like to thank The Times and staff writer Clay Evans for the excellent  coverage of Mark Wellman's courageous climb to be the first paraplegic to scale  Yosemite's 3,200-foot El Capitan.  </P> <P> Having known Mark for several years, there is much more to add to this personal  triumph of the human spirit than the world knows. And the world should know.  </P> <P> Once told by doctors he would never lead any kind of "normal" or "active" life  after his tragic climbing accident in 1982, Mark has continuously proven his  critics wrong. For he is not the least bit handicapped, but on the contrary, he  is much more active than most normal people. Besides being a year-round park  ranger, he's a nationally ranked wheelchair tennis player, and intermediate  kayaker, an avid swimmer (using buoyants to keep his legs afloat), rides a  specialized "bike" that he operates with his arms, while also heading  Yosemite's handicapped skiing program at Badger Pass.  </P> <P> Yes, he's a great athlete, a great inspiration. But most of all, he's a great  friend. SuperGimp, we're proud of you! Now the whole world knows.  </P> <P> TARIK M. TRAD  </P> <P> Montclair  </P></p>

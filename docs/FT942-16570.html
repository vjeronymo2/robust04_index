			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No blame Sir, I agreed with many of the points made by Sue Fernie and David Metcalf about human resource management techniques (Recruitment, April 6, UK edition; April 8, international). But they were unfair to lay most of the blame on personnel specialists for HRM's failure to deliver its promises. In my experience senior executives and managers generally have enthusiastically endorsed HRM as part of a 'mission' to change organisational culture rather than to improve employee relations or customer service. Perhaps the situation would not be as bad as they describe if more attention were paid to the views of staff and their representatives and customers than to trendy management theories.

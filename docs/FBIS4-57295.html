			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Diego Suarez from the "TV Today" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Colombian Government strongly protested today  Amnesty International's charges of alleged human rights abuses  by the Armed Forces and the police in Colombia. Amnesty  International published full-page advertisements in two  prominent London newspapers saying that the government allows  the Colombian Army to murder with impunity.    The full-page ad by Amnesty International in London's THE  INDEPENDENT and THE GUARDIAN newspapers, show a street youth  sniffing glue. The caption explains that many of these children  are killed by death squads paid by businessmen who want to clear  the streets.    Amnesty International also states that the ad intends to  irritate the Colombian Government, which is trying to convince  the world that it is doing everything in its power to end the  murders. Amnesty International also says that the Colombian  Government wants to make believe that most murders are the work  of drug traffickers, guerrillas, or a few wicked soldiers, but  the truth is that most murders are committed by the Armed Forces  or the police. The organization argues that the government does  not want to face the Army and it says the Army is literally  allowed to kill with impunity.    Finally, the ad expresses hope that the new president, who  will be elected this month, will make human rights one of his  top priorities. The ad was rejected by both spokesmen of the  government and the military forces. The spokesmen described the  ad as biased and as part of a guerrilla strategy to damage  Colombia's image and the image of the Colombian Government  abroad.</p>

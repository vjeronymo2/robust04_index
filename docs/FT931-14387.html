			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: Perrier workforce loses merger plea - European Law Attempts by the Perrier workforce to challenge the European Commission's decision allowing the Nestle/Perrier merger have suffered a setback following refusal by the president of the Court of First Instance, Mr Cruz Vilaca, of their application for interim measures. This was the first Court ruling involving the 1989 EC merger regulation. Following clearance of the merger by the Commission last summer the Perrier workforce brought an application for judicial review. Pending the hearing of their application they also requested suspension of the Commission's authorisation decision and asked the CFI to order the Commission to require Nestle not to reduce employment in the Perrier group nor to comply with the undertakings given to the Commission which included the sale of Perrier subsidiaries. The CFI president dismissed the application for interim measures on the grounds that the applicants had not proved sufficient urgency to justify intervention by the Court. The main reason for urgency relied on by the applicants was the threatened redundancy of 740 employees during 1993 and the likelihood of further redundancies following the sale of subsidiaries to a competitor, BSN, France's largest foods group. They claimed the absence of a right of reinstatement for unfair dismissal in French law meant that redundancy constituted serious and irreparable harm. In reaching his decision the president took into account the need to balance the conflicting interests of the employees' representatives with those of Nestle. The president pointed out that, in fact, redundancies would arise only if the more favourable methods proposed by Nestle for reducing employees failed. Moreover, there should be no risk of further redundancies as a direct result of the Commission's authorisation decision itself or the conditions requiring the sale of subsidiaries. First, the merger regulation expressly states it has no impact on the collective rights of employees. Second, the 1977 Acquired Rights Directive precludes redundancy on the transfer of a business, including a transfer resulting from a merger authorisation decision. Judicial Review However, the president rejected the Commission's claim that the main judicial review application was inadmissible. The applicants' main grounds for asking the court to annul the Commission's decision include alleged infringements of the procedural rights of recognised employee representatives of the companies concerned by a merger and the failure of the Commission to respect fundamental social rights recognised by Community law, including the social charter. They also challenged the decision on the grounds of failure to maintain effective competition in France, and the introduction of the concept of 'duopoly' or 'oligopolistic dominance' without legal basis into the merger regulation. Although the CFI president did not comment on the main grounds for judicial review, his ruling contained observations on the policy objectives of the merger regulation indicating the likely position which the CFI could adopt in the context of the protection of employee interests in merger cases. He accepts the Commission policy implemented during the first two years of EC merger control that competition considerations are predominant in the assessment process. But, he notes that in considering the effect of mergers on the structure of competition in the Community, the Commission must place its appraisal within the general framework of the achievement of the fundamental objectives referred to in Article 2 of the EEC Treaty, including that of strengthening the Community's economic and social cohesion. According to the president, the Commission also acknowledges the correctness of this approach. More interestingly, the Commission is reported as saying that taking other effects of a merger into account would hinder achievement of one of the general Treaty objectives and notably the development of employment. The Commission claims that neither the Perrier takeover nor the subsequent sales of subsidiaries could harm any of these objectives.

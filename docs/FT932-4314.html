			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / New French pact aims to avoid 'second Yugoslavia' FRANCE yesterday produced its outline for a new European security pact, to be set in motion by the European Community as 'the first exercise' of its common foreign policy enshrined in the Maastricht treaty. Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, said the aim was to draw lessons from the 'painful experience' of the break-up of Yugoslavia and the war in Bosnia, and to create 'a pact on security and stability in Europe' so that wars over frontiers and minorities would not erupt elsewhere. The plan figured in Mr Balladur's maiden speech as premier two months ago, but President Francois Mitterrand, who himself proposed a grand European confederation in late 1989, has actively collaborated on it since. The two men will present the plan, which has already been discussed with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the British prime minister, Mr John Major, to France's EC partners at the Copenhagen summit on June 21-22. French officials denied that by calling for a new European security pact to prevent 'a second Yugoslavia' Paris was effectively conceding the failure of United Nations intervention in that region. But ministers told Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, in Paris yesterday that France, with nearly 5,000 troops under UN command in ex-Yugoslavia, could do no more, though it might shift some troops from Croatia to Bosnia to help widen 'safe havens' for Moslem refugees there. The geographic scope of the French plan, which would involve the US and Canada, would be focused on central and eastern Europe. But after yesterday's cabinet discussion, Mr Balladur's spokesman said it could be extended to the Baltic states, Russia and the most westerly states of the ex-Soviet Union, including Ukraine, whose tug-of-war with Moscow over nuclear missiles is worrying the west. Nevetheless, the French plan will be seen as marginalising the 53-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose role in conflict resolution was supposedly reinforced after the cold war. France believes that a somewhat smaller number of European states, with the EC taking the lead, can come up with firmer security commitments and incentives for the continent. 'Countries wanting to join the EC could only do so on the express condition that they first settle problems which could threaten European security,' a cabinet statement suggested. The security pact would not just try to freeze existing frontiers, officials say, pointing out that early adjustments to Tito-era boundaries might have headed off trouble in Yugoslavia. 'We want to establish agreements on good neighbourliness, and one cannot exclude that these would lead to minor modifications to frontiers which would then be endorsed by the (planned security) conference,' the government spokesman said yesterday.</p>

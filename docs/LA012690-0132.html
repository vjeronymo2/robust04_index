			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN RAMSEY, VOICE OF L.A. SPORTS, DIES;  </P> <P> ANNOUNCER: HE WAS THE PUBLIC-ADDRESS MAN FOR NEARLY EVERY MAJOR TEAM IN  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.  </P> <P> John Ramsey, 62, a familiar voice to Southern California sports fans for more  than a quarter of a century, died early Thursday morning of a heart attack at  Long Beach Veterans Hospital.  </P> <P> Ramsey had been the public-address announcer for virtually every major sports  team in the area.  </P> <P> In recent years, he had been suffering from complications of diabetes.  </P> <P> At one time or another, Ramsey's deep, clear voice was heard by fans of USC  football and basketball, the Rams, Raiders, Lakers, Dodgers, Angels and Kings.  He would often announce five games over a three-day weekend.  </P> <P> He was also the P.A. announcer for five Super Bowls and for the basketball  venue here at the 1984 Olympic Games.  </P> <P> Recently, though, Ramsey confined his announcing to Trojan football games at  the Coliseum.  </P> <P> His announcing style was articulate, unruffled and deliberate.  </P> <P> He got his biggest break in 1958 when Tex Rickard, the Dodgers' public-address  announcer in Brooklyn, declined to move to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Ramsey appeared, or his voice was heard, in several motion pictures, most  notably "Two Minute Warning."  </P> <P> Ramsey was born in Berlin, New Hampshire, and served in the Navy during World  War II.  </P> <P> He later attended El Camino College and USC, where he earned his B.A. in  business in 1954 and a master's degree in 1961.  </P> <P> Ramsey is survived by his former wife, Vivian, a daughter, Josette, and a  brother, Paul.  </P> <P> Funeral arrangements are pending.  </P></p>

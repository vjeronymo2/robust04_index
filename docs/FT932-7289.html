			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Inflation 'may go beyond Treasury range by 1994' PRICES WILL be rising smartly by the end of the year as inflation pushes through the upper limit of the government's target range, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. In its latest quarterly review of the UK economy, the institute predicts that underlying inflation - the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments - will be just over the top of the government's target range of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent. A 10 per cent rise in import prices over the year will be the driving force behind inflation, it adds. The institute's expectations for growth are unchanged since the last forecast in February. It expects the economy to grow by 2 per cent this year and by 2.8 per cent next year. It suggests that the trade deficit is widening and 'may well be over 3 per cent of GDP for the year as a whole'. Growth next year will be fuelled by strong investment and consumption as recent interest rate cuts feed through. This will more than offset the effects of tax increases announced in the March Budget, says the institute. The forecast for unemployment has been revised down slightly for the rest of the year. In an article, Mr Andrew Britton, director of the institute, says the best way to achieve full employment would be to expand the current system of special employment measures such as Employment Training and Workstart in the short term, while improving productivity and competitiveness in the long term by providing better education and training for the population as a whole. The new jobs created by improved competitiveness would be filled by the newly-trained workforce, leaving vacancies that the unemployed would fill, says Mr Britton. 'Thus the unemployed would find 'real' jobs indirectly as a result of a general economic expansion. Eventually the special employment schemes could be run down.' NIER 144.

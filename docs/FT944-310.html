			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Glassmaker in Vietnam venture Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan's second biggest sheet-glass manufacturer, and Tomen trading company are to set up a glass-making enterprise in Vietnam, in a joint venture with Viglacera, a Vietnamese state-run corporation, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. The new company, Vietnam Float Glass, will have an annual production capacity of about 150,000 tonnes and will be capitalised at Dollars 42m. Nippon Sheet Glass will have a majority 55 per cent stake, with Tomen taking 15 per cent and Viglacera 30 per cent. The joint venture, which will start production in 1997, aims to meet an expected growth in demand for float glass in Vietnam. The country has one ordinary sheet glass manufacturing facility, and the new venture will be the first to manufacture higher-grade float glass, for use in building and housing construction and vehicle manufacture, Nippon Sheet Glass said. Estimated demand in Vietnam for sheet glass this year was about 70,000 tonnes compared with 1.5m tonnes in Japan. The new company is aiming for revenues of Dollars 37m in the first year, rising to Dollars 52m in three years.</p>

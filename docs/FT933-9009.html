			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Observer: Not us, guv Times must be bad in Britain's cash-strapped football business. The football season has not even kicked off and yet one first division club has already put its stadium up for sale. An industrious colleague was so intrigued by the Financial Times advert offering a freehold stadium for Pounds 5m ono, that all 24 first division clubs were contacted to see who was selling. Southend United's Vic Jobson seemed the hot favourite. But he gave the thumbs down as did the chieftains of other likely candidates such as Luton Town, Portsmouth, Watford, Oxford, and Crystal Palace. Someone seems to be telling porkies.</p>

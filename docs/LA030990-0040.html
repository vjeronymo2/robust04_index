The superpowers also agreed on  mutual inspections of facilities for "safe, speedy and also economically and  ecologically sound" destruction of stockpiled weapons. Another round of talks  will begin around April 23 and the two sides are confident about having the  accord ready for President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev when  they meet in late June in the United States, officials said.  </P></p>

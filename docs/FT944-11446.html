			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: Modern art convalesces The market for major works of Impressionist and modern art is currently experiencing a long convalescence. In 1989 and 1990 it vigorously over-exerted itself, culminating in May 1990 with a rush of blood to the head which produced a record total for any art auction, Dollars 286m at Sotheby's, and a record price for any work of art, Dollars 82.5m at Christie's - for Van Gogh's portrait of his physician, Dr Gachet. Within six months, demand, in particular Japanese demand which had fuelled the excesses, had disappeared, and the market has been in severe shock ever since. A year ago there were signs of revived spirits when a Matisse sold for Dollars 13.75m, and in anticipation of a recovery in May in New York, the auction houses gently raised their reserves and expectations. In the event the results were disappointing: it was like a patient over-estimating his strength. Next week's auctions in New York are more modest affairs, with sales at Sotheby's and Christie's combined unlikely to reach Dollars 85m. Still, as always, the auction houses look on the bright side. The hundreds of Dollars 1m-plus paintings locked away in the vaults of Japanese companies are not being off-loaded on to the market to cause a second collapse in prices: their owners are reluctant to sell them cheaply and thus weaken their overall asset values. And the serious collectors of Impressionist and modern art are still interested. But in this return to a non-speculative, connoisseur, market, buyers are very selective: they are prepared to wait for the finest examples of an artists' work at the best price. Anything second rate or less than fresh is spurned. Unlike Christie's, Sotheby's sold most of its lots in New York in May but 40 per cent went for below the low estimate. So what of next week. The auctions are small - just 47 lots at Sotheby's, 59 at Christie's - and fairly modest. Prices generally are back to 1987 levels: vendors have finally accepted that they cannot expect 1989 prices. This means that few are anxious to sell: one of the main problems is an absence of star items to kick-start confidence. Every picture has its own price at the moment it is sold, but for comparison's sake, a decorative small Picasso of a Harlequin and a monkey sold for Dollars 2.4m in 1989, but is now estimated by Sotheby's at Pounds 800,000-Dollars 1m. But one of the most important paintings in the auction, Miro's 'Femme de la nuit' estimated at up to Dollars 4.5m, sold for Dollars 2.5m in 1986. Miro is an artist whose reputation has risen in the past decade. The most appealing painting at Sotheby's, and the most expensive, is one of Modigliani's last portraits of his mistress Jeanne Hebuterne. She already looks pregnant, as she was when she committed suicide a few days after the artist's own death. It carries a Dollars 5m plus estimate but this is one of the best full-length Modigliani's to have appeared in recent years. The highlight at Christie's is a Monet 'Waterlilies'. He painted the pond in his retirement home at Giverny hundreds of times but this is a rare circular format, one of only four, and Christie's hopes for between Dollars 4m-Dollars 6m, a modest estimate considering the last, conventionally shaped, example made Dollars 12m in 1991. The painting was acquired in 1946 by Miss Alice Tully, one of Manhattan's leading art patrons, from the French playwright Sacha Guitry, who bought it from Monet in 1914. Thus its provenance is excellent. Christie's will be very anxious over this lot for it guaranteed Tully's heirs around Dollars 25m to secure the fixtures and fittings of her New York apartment. In a reversal of approach, Sotheby's is now reluctant to undertake financial risks in acquiring desirable properties for sale while Christie's is still prepared to take a gamble. If the Monet does not sell, Christie's is stuck with it. Fortunately Tully's furniture sold well last week so it can afford to take slightly less for this, her most important picture. This week the auction room's sold major contemporary art in New York. This usually gives an indicator to the Impressionist sales but the signals were mixed, with Christie's having much the better evening. It brought in Dollars 14.56m (Pounds 8.8m) with 96 per cent of the pictures selling by value and 88 per cent by lot, an almost unprecedented success. Andy Warhol's silk screen portrait 'Shot Red Marilyn', so called because a would be assassin shot the picture rather than the artist, made Dollars 3.6m (Pounds 2.2m), above target and not far off the Dollars 4.07m it fetched in 1989 at the market peak. In contrast, Sotheby's sold its top lot, Roy Lichtenstein's 'Pop' art icon, 'I . . I'm Sorry', for Dollars 2.47m. (Pounds 1.5m.), but 40 per cent of the 66 lots on offer were unsold.</p>

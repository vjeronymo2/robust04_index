			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Record profit at Post Office The Post Office made a record operating profit last year, Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive, said yesterday. Although the full results will not be announced until next month Mr Cockburn said they were 'excellent' in a year that saw the largest volume of mail distribution ever recorded. He said that the corporation faced growing competition to its services however and needed an urgent decision from the government over whether it could enjoy commercial freedom and not be hemmed in by public-sector financial requirements set by the Treasury. The Post Office's hands were being tied by the government's delay on the future of the organisation, he said. This was enabling the Dutch postal service - to be privatised next month - and possibly the German one to 'plunder' the British market, he added. 'Unless we can respond on equal terms at Post Office counters, up to 20 per cent of our business could be at risk over the next few years and with it 30,000 jobs and the closure of up to 5,000 Post Offices.' Mr Cockburn also announced the results of a public opinion survey in which 76 per cent of the consumers questioned said they supported making the Post Office free to enter new markets and offer new services to compete with electronic communications. Two-thirds of respondents supported the suggestion that the Post Office should be able to compete with banks and building societies and 61 per cent agreed it should be free to raise money to invest in its business. However, the survey, carried out by Opinion Research and Communication, found strong opposition to suggestions that the Post Office should be privatised. While 49 per cent favoured allowing the organisation freedom to enter and invest in new markets, they also thought the taxpayer should remain as the sole shareholder. From the sample of 1,068 adults aged 16 and over at a hundred sampling points, 42 per cent disagreed that the service to the ordinary customer would be good or better under a privatised postal service.</p>

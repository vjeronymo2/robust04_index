			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Cosic ouster adds to Balkan turmoil YUGOSLAVIA'S President Dobrica Cosic has been forced out of office by the federal parliament, through a no-confidence motion brought by radical Serbian deputies. The sudden departure of Mr Cosic, accused in the chamber of having held a secret meeting with Yugoslav federal army leaders on the country's constitutional future, raises fresh doubts about political stability in the rump state of Yugoslavia, which consists of just Serbia and Montenegro. In a vote early yesterday, rushed through at the final session of parliament before the summer recess, deputies from the ultra-nationalist Serb Radical Party, headed by Mr Vojislav Seselj, were backed by the ruling Serbian Socialist Party of President Slobodan Milosevic. Mr Seselj claimed in parliament that the federal president had also held secret negotiations with Croatia over the Serb-held region of Krajina, and was willing to carve up the Serbian province of Kosovo - where 90 per cent of the population are ethnic Albanians - with neighbouring Albania. Mr Cosic, a leading Serbian writer who used to promote the idea of a Greater Serbia, was not present in parliament to defend himself. He did not issue any statement after the vote. Political analysts said that Mr Milosevic appeared to have sacrificed Mr Cosic, once a close political ally, in the hope of ensuring his government's survival in another no-confidence vote, due to be held this month by the Serbian parliament. Without the support of hardline Serbian deputies, the minority socialist government, accused of failing to address a disastrous economic situation, could be toppled. Mr Milosevic had recently seemed to distance himself from Mr Seselj, a fierce opponent of the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia, and from other extremists, by adopting a more conciliatory position. Although he refused western requests to deploy UN monitors along Serbia's border with Bosnia, Mr Milosevic promised to prevent the Bosnian Serbs from being supplied through Serbia with fuel and weapons. However, Serbian petrol tankers are still to be seen rumbling over the bridge at Sremska Raca, the main border crossing with Bosnia. Mr Milosevic is likely to face increased opposition in Montenegro as a result of ousting Mr Cosic. Montenegrin deputies from all parties spoke in favour of Mr Cosic during the debate. The Montenegrin government, already resentful because United Nations sanctions have damaged its economy more seriously than that of Serbia, is taking a more independent stand. Montenegro has said it is willing to accept UN monitors along its border with Bosnia. 'This vote is to be interpreted as a victory for the hardliners. It has opened the way for very dangerous developments in Montenegro,' says Mr Dragoslav Micunovic, a democratic opposition leader.</p>

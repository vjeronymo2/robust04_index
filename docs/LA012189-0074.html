			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWYERS START UNIT TO BACK LEGAL STATUS OF ABORTIONS  </P> <P> A group of Los Angeles lawyers have banded together with the local chapter of  Planned Parenthood to advocate legal protection of abortion and other family  planning rights.  </P> <P> The 100 attorneys, many from prestigious law firms, will be lobbying and  writing court briefs in support of family planning issues, according to Anne H.  Egerton, a partner in the firm of Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson. The group had its  first meeting Friday, the 16th anniversary of the landmark Roe vs. Wade  decision that legalized abortion.  </P> <P> "We believe that the right to reproductive choice is facing its greatest test  in 16 years, " Egerton said, noting this month's decision by the U.S. Supreme  Court to decide the constitutionality of a Missouri law intended to limit  access to abortions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lawyers for Choice  </P> <P> The Planned Parenthood-affiliated group, which will be called Lawyers for  Choice, will meet with legislators on family planning issues, organize a public  speakers bureau to discuss family planning issues in the community and provide  financial assistance for pro-choice issues. A similar organization was formed  by Planned Parenthood in the early 1970s, but it was disbanded after the Roe  decision legalized abortion.  </P> <P> One of the first tasks for the new group will be to file legal briefs in the  case, American Academy of Pediatrics vs. Van de Kamp. In that case, the  constitutionality of a new state law requiring written consent from parents or  judges before a minor can have an abortion was challenged by a group of medical  associations and health care providers. The California Supreme Court refused to  order enforcement of the law, and it is before the state Court of Appeals.  </P> <P> "The response at the first meeting was overwhelming," said Ruth Liberman,  spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles, the largest private provider  of reproductive health care services in Los Angeles County. She noted that  similar professional groups will be organized soon, including Physicians for  Choice and Clergy for Choice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decision Expected in July  </P> <P> The lawyers' group was organized first because of the U.S. Supreme Court case,  Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, which will be decided in July. The  case is receiving extraordinary public attention because the conservative high  court is believed ready to change directions on abortion, Liberman said.  </P> <P> Liberman said the newly organized Lawyers for Choice and other women's rights  advocates fear that a high court ruling upholding the Missouri law would invite  other states to enact even more restrictive abortion laws.  </P> <P> The Missouri law bans use of public funds for counseling a woman to have an  abortion, forbids public employees from performing or assisting in abortions  and forbids them to be performed in public facilities.  </P> <P> The state law, however, does not put restrictions on abortions in private  clinics, where more than 90% of Missouri's abortions take place.  </P></p>

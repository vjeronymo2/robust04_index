			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wu Jichuan (0702 1015 0278), minister of posts </F> and telecommunications: "Build Nationwide Economic Information  Network, Improve Information Service for the National Economy"]    [Text] 1. Building a nationwide economic information  network is an objective requirement that must be fulfilled as  China is establishing its socialist market economy, and it is  also a natural outcome of the development of modern  telecommunication and computer technology.    The gradual establishment of the socialist market economic  structure has generated an increasingly urgent demand for the  processing, handling, transmission, and exchange of economic  information. On the one hand, the socialist market economic  structure demands that all kinds of commodity markets and  production element markets be vigorously developed and that  enterprises plunge into the market. While the market needs to  operate in light of updated and reliable information,  enterprises also count on quick and accurate information sources  for survival and development amid market competition. The  so-called invigoration of markets means invigorating the  circulation of material, financial, and human resources and  achieving a rational combination of production elements. And to  invigorate the circulation of material, financial, and human  resources, one depends on rapid and highly efficient circulation  of information. Smooth transmission of information can  substantially increase the rationality and effectiveness of  circulation of human, financial, and material resources, which  is of great significance to increasing the efficiency of  economic operation and the labor productivity of the whole  community. On the other hand, to establish a socialist market  economic structure, the state must exercise strong macroeconomic  regulation and control. In this connection, the state organ in  charge of economic management must have timely and accurate  information about conditions of economic operation across the  country. If it is poorly informed of market operation  condition, and if it exercises macroeconomic regulation and  control in light of lopsided, outdated, or even wrong  information, trouble will arise. Thus it can be seen that to  run a socialist market economy one must depend first on a sound  legal system and second on a quick and efficient economic  information network.    The progress of modern electronics and telecommunications  technology serves as a powerful technological impetus to  establishing an economic information network and speeding up the  process of economic information transmission. The integration  of telecommunications and computers has greatly increased the  practical value of information, expanded the range of  applications of information processing, and given rise to a  series of modern telecommunications and information services  modes, such as long-range data processing, on-line data base  indexing, electronic data exchanges, electronic mailbox, and  video imaging. This technological progress has offered all  fields, especially industrial and commercial enterprises, an  opportunity to reform their production management mode and  increase their labor productivity and competitive power by  applying modern telecommunications means. At the same time, it  has also opened up a market full of vitality. The business of  telecommunications as a trade is no longer confined to basic  telecommunication services alone, such as telephones and the  telegraph, with interpersonal telecommunications as their  principal feature, but has been extended to high-level  telecommunication services which include man-machine and  computer telecommunications.    To cope with specific circumstances in China, the Chinese  Government has established the task of creating a nationwide  economic information network. This is an important policy  decision to speed up establishment of a socialist market  economic structure, expedite the process of economic information  transmission, and narrow the gap between our country and  developed countries. Our country's economic information network  is composed of information resource and communication networks.  The information resource network denotes all the information  banks and information application systems established by all the  related economic information suppliers and users, while the  information communication network links together all information  resources and application systems through the development of  network communication platforms [wang lu tong xin ping tai 4986  6424 6639 0207 1627 0669] on the basis of public  telecommunication networks of the state. Different types of  information application systems will also be developed in the  future to suit the needs of various economic sectors. The  presentation and implementation of the task of building a  nationwide economic information network will remarkably advance  the process of economic information transmission in our country,  therefore it is of far-reaching historical significance to  economic development and social progress in our country.    2. China's state-run public telecommunication network,  growing at a high speed over the past 10 years or more, has  prepared a basic network for the establishment of economic  information communication network.    After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, especially over the past 10 years, China has speeded  up the pace of development of telecommunication services. The  growth rate of the country's telecommunication service capacity  outdid the economic growth rate for the first time in 1985, and  the telecommunications sector has kept on growing faster and  faster since then. Now in the Eighth Five-Year Plan, the growth  of telecommunication services further accelerates. In 1992 and  1993 alone, the net increase in telephone exchanges was 6.83  million lines, the net increase in long-distance call circuits  was 121,000, and the operation capacity increased by 40.4 and  49.5 percent in these two sectors respectively.    As 22 optical fiber trunk lines, 20 digital microwave trunk  lines, and 20 large- and medium-sized satellite  telecommunication ground stations are scheduled to be put into  operation during the eight five-year plan, a large-capacity  digital transmission trunk line network linking all the cities  at and above provincial capital level in this country will  initially take shape in the next two years. During the ninth  five-year plan, the system capacity and coverage area will  continue to expand, and a nationwide large-capacity digital  transmission trunk line network mainly consisting of optical  fibers will basically be built.    While the optical fiber digital network was developing  rapidly, phase one of the nationwide bundled [fan zu 0433 4809]  public exchange data network (CHINAPAC) extension project was  completed in September 1993. Now the network covers 267 cities,  including all the cities at and above the provincial capital  level, linked with 20,000 terminals each operating at a  transmission speed of 65 kilobits per second. Inter-transmitter  repeat circuits [jie dian ji jian de zhong ji dian lu 4634 7820  2623 7035 4104 0022 4949 7193 6424] are deployed according to  operational capacity, and so far more than 100 circuits have  been installed. Now 18 domestic information system group  subscribers have signed contracts, thus being linked up with  this network, and starting rendering data telecommunication  services. And cross-network link has also been established  between this network and 37 bundled exchange networks of 20  foreign countries.    Phase one of the nationwide high-speed digital data trunk  network (DDN) [quan guo gao su shu zi shu ju gu gan wang 0356  0948 7559 6643 2422 1316 2422 2207 7539 1626 4986], which is to  link up 21 provinces and municipalities, will be put into  operation by July this year. The main use of this network is to  provide all information systems with permanent or semi-permanent  special digital circuits operating at different speeds. Phase  one of this project consists of 776 circuits operating at the  high speed of 2 megabits per second and 2,600 circuits operating  at a lower speed. Meanwhile, mobile telecommunication services  have also been developing very quickly in our country. On the  eastern and southern coast and in some central provinces,  cellular mobile phone networks have covered all cities and  counties. Now there are 700,000 mobile phone subscribers, and a  nationwide cross-network link is being established. With some 7  million radio telephone paging subscribers, China has now become  one of the countries with the most telephone pagers. After more  than 10 years' investment, the country's public  telecommunication networks have developed substantially either  in scale and capacity or in terms of technical standards. This  is an important achievement as a result of the state's  industrial policy adjustment, which has not only eased the  shortage of such basic information transmission facilities as  telephone, telegraph, and facsimile, but also laid down a  foundation for the development of a nationwide economic  information network.    3. The building of the nationwide economic information  network requires close cooperation by all sectors concerned, and  the integration of telecommunications, electronic computer  technology, and information applications.    The building of a nationwide economic information network is  a social system engineering project which involves different  sectors. This network is built on the basis of the existing  national telecommunication network and will capitalize on almost  all modern telecommunications technology, including high-speed  transmission, wide-band exchanges, network management, and  transmission monitoring and control. It will use a large  quantity of products of the modern electronics industry, as well  as computers and related software technology. It demands a  thorough understanding of the application environment and of  operational requirements on the information system. And it also  requires highly standardized telecommunication procedures,  technical standards, and information formats. All these can  only be achieved through close cooperation among the  telecommunication sector, electronics industry, and information  system applications sector. On the one hand, we must arrange  for an appropriate division of labor, make the best use of  existing technical conditions and material resources, and avoid  duplicate efforts. On the other hand, we must arrange for  different sectors to complement each other, make up each other's  deficiencies, work together to solve key problems, and strive to  build up a nationwide economic information network as soon as  possible.    The postal and telecommunication service sector is  responsible for building the infrastructure of the country's  telecommunication networks and providing telecommunication  services to all economic sectors. It must be eager to meet the  country's urgent needs, and closely cooperate with all  departments concerned to speed up the building of the nationwide  economic information network. We are now still far from  fulfilling the target of supplying basic telephone services  across the country, yet we are facing an increasingly urgent  demand for economic information telecommunication services in  the wake of the establishment of a market economic structure.  Such a circumstance has posed a severe challenge and an  opportunity for development as well. Therefore, we must proceed  from market demand and vigorously intensify data  telecommunications as well as information system  telecommunications that are geared to the needs of major  subscribers, while making further efforts to extensively provide  general telephone services. We must give comprehensive  consideration to the need for a nationwide economic information  telecommunication network and different economic sectors'  demands for information telecommunication services, properly map  out a telecommunication service development plan, further step  up the construction of high-capacity digital trunk line  transmission networks mainly built with optical fiber cables,  speed up the building of public telephone networks, bundled  public exchange networks, digital data networks, and mobile  telecommunication networks, to provide a highly efficient  high-capacity information transmission channel and a reliable  telecommunication platform in support of the "Gold Bridge" [jin  qiao 6855 2890], "Golden Gate" [jin guan 6855 0595], "Golden  Card" [jin ka 6855 0595], and various other information  processing systems.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (3): State asset sales may ease deficit - The privatisation bandwagon has finally arrived MERCHANT banks and brokers are licking their lips, potential buyers are readying their cheque-books, and politicians are sharpening their ideological oratory: the privatisation bandwagon has finally rolled into Brussels. Its arrival is not a surprise - the last government passed a law in March 1991 permitting sales of public assets - but it is ahead of the original schedule and far more heavily laden than most observers expected. A year ago, privatisation was hardly discussed in political circles. That was natural. Belgium's political establishment, still reeling from a confused protest vote in the November general election, had better things to think about. Even in March, when Hill Samuel, the British merchant bank, and Brussels- based Petercam Securities produced a valuation of state enterprises, the chances of a sell-off beginning before the end of the year seemed slim. But Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister, has been considering a preliminary list of mainly financial institutions which could be privatised. He indicated to the Financial Times early in November that one of those companies could be selected for an early sale, to test the water before Christmas. The new centre-left coalition, which was put in place only in March, has moved fast, and the main reason is money. In an interview with the FT in June, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Flemish Christian Democrat prime minister, tentatively suggested that privatisation might be considered as a way of easing Belgium's large budget deficit - the principal obstacle to the country joining the first wave of EC member states in economic and monetary union. In July, the government promised a BFr50bn (Pounds 1bn) four-year privatisation programme as part of its budget for 1993. But in October, the worsening European economic situation obliged the government to adjust next year's budget to cover a likely shortfall of BFr21.8bn. Privatisation will bridge half that gap. The government has increased its target for next year's sell-off proceeds from BFr15bn to BFr25bn. A further tranche of BFr15bn will be raised in 1994, and then BFr10bn in each of the next two years. Meanwhile, the politicians have stepped up the ideological argument. Shortly after the supplementary budget measures were presented, Mr Dehaene told an investment seminar in Brussels that it would be a no-holds-barred privatisation programme - despite the strictures of the 1991 legislation which indicated that at least 50 per cent of public enterprises should remain in state ownership. The prime minister said that the committee of 'four wise men', appointed to investigate the possibilities for privatisation, had been given a very wide mandate. 'No possibility should be excluded, either in the selection of assets to be sold, the identity of the buyer, or the size of the shareholding for sale,' he told the seminar. The speech upset Mr Dehaene's socialist coalition partners. Mr Guy Coeme, the deputy prime minister, who is also responsible for public enterprises, hit back a day later, arguing that the prime minister's comments did not reflect the government's position. Amid all this excitement, Mr Maystadt - a French-speaking Social Christian, and therefore in the same political camp as Mr Dehaene - remains calm. For one thing, he argues that the state needs the money, and that if politicians do not like the idea of privatisation then they may have to settle for further unpopular cuts in public spending. 'If you put the matter on the theoretical level, then of course there are differences of opinion,' he says. 'But I'm sure that when we come up with concrete proposals, we will overcome all ideological difficulties.' As for the question of selling off more than 50 per cent of state enterprises, Mr Maystadt concedes that in some sensitive areas - including energy and railways - the state might retain control through a 'golden share'; but he adds: 'If it appears that we can get a better deal and we are able to sell our participation on better terms if we allow control by a newcomer, then why not?' In fact, the government does not have much family silver to sell, partly because it never had a strong nationalisation policy, partly because some publicly-owned enterprises belong to regional, community or municipal administrations rather than the central government. The Petercam/Hill Samuel report estimated that a range of industrial and financial enterprises could raise up to BFr318bn if all the shares held by the state were sold. That would take time. Large state industrial and commercial companies like Belgacom, the telecommunications group, the state railway and the post office are only in the first stages of conversion to a new management philosophy, aimed at transforming bureaucracies into private sector businesses. Analysts believe the preliminary list will be more modest. It is likely to include stakes in financial institutions such as the Caisse Generale d'Epargne et de Retraite (CGER), the Societe Nationale de Credit a l'Industrie (SNCI) - some shares in which are already listed on the Brussels bourse - and the Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI). Shares in Distrigaz, a natural gas utility, may also be earmarked for sale. The government says the terms of the sale will be decided on a case-by-case basis, but for the time being it seems unlikely that major public flotations will be considered until larger state enterprises such as Belgacom are ready for privatisation in two to three years' time. Finance ministry officials argue that the capacity of the Brussels bourse is too modest to cope with a large influx of new shares. If Belgium does go down the route of sales to specific buyers, rather than the British-style public flotation, those with a stake in the future of the bourse are likely to be disappointed. 'I think it's in the Belgian interest to do this in the British way, especially as we have a (stock) market with much more depth than, say, Italy,' says Mr Alain Camu, managing director of Petercam and a director of Hill Samuel. 'There have been so many companies leaving the stock exchange that we would love to take a good chunk (of the sell-off).' Uncertainty about exactly how the Belgian government will achieve its BFr60bn target does not seem to have deterred potential investors. According to the finance ministry, many tentative approaches have already been made by potential buyers from inside and outside Belgium; and London-based advisers, starved of privatisation business at home, have been filling Mr Maystadt's in-tray with inquiries. The first sale prospectus is eagerly awaited.</p>

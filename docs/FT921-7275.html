			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Saddam's opponents seek unity IRAQI opposition leaders met yesterday to try to forge a united front capable of toppling President Saddam Hussein, AP reports from Riyadh. The closed-door session at Riyadh's Conference Palace was the first meeting of Iraqi opposition figures sanctioned by Saudi authorities since the end of the Gulf war. The conference indicates that the Saudis, who have kept their distance from most Iraqi exile groups and especially the Iran-backed Shia Moslem factions, are taking a higher profile in organising efforts to overthrow Mr Saddam. The meeting was attended by Hojatoleslam Mohammed Bakr al-Hakim, leader of the Tehran-based Supreme Assembly for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, the main Shia opposition movement. Also there was Arshad Tewfiq, who resigned several months ago as Iraq's ambassador to Spain. Arshad Tewfiq, who claims to have contact with anti-Saddam cells within the Baghdad regime, said most of the discussions involved working out an agenda. The Al-Khaleej newspaper,published in Sharjah, reported that the Iraqi opposition leaders were preparing for a general congress to produce a 'formula for . . . unified political action in co-operation with the governments concerned with the situation in Iraq and the region'.</p>

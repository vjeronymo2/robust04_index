Kenyon, coming as a guest of the assistant foreign minister  for policy planning, is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister  Han Sung-chu and other government officials during his three-day  stay. He is also to meet leaders of the chemical industry.    His title is secretary-general of the committee preparing to  launch the Organization of the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  (OPCW), the main body that will implement the chemical weapons  convention.    The convention opened for signing in January last year and  will take effect 180 days after 65 nations ratify it, but not  before two years have elapsed.    South Korea signed in January but North Korea, a suspected  chemical weapons country, has yet to do so.    Seoul officials plan to promise active participation in the  preparation process and seek seats on the 41-member OPCW  executive council.</p>

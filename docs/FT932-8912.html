			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Kantor in the firing line for excess zeal on Nafta THE Clinton administration may have run foul of US government ethics laws in its zeal to drum up support for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Congressional critics say Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative (USTR), may have overstepped the line by setting up a coalition of governors, mayors and state legislators in favour of Nafta, breaching a prohibition on any use of government money to organise a lobbying effort. Congressman Collin Peterson, chairman of a House of Representatives government operations sub-committee, has asked the General Accounting Office to investigate USTR's involvement in the Nafta coalition, which he says raises 'serious questions about potential ethical violations and possible criminal activities on the part of USTR officials and employees'. Mr Peterson leads an anti-Nafta coalition in Congress. Trade has become a highly politicised issue under President Bill Clinton, as the administration has sought to build popular acceptance of economic benefits within free trade agreements such as Nafta or the Uruguay Round of negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. At the same time, however, it has sought to stem protectionist currents in public opinion by taking tough enforcement measures against countries such as Japan. Signalling the high priority Mr Clinton attaches to trade policy, Mr Kantor will, unusually, be joining heads of government, finance ministers and foreign ministers at the Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in July. Although the US criminal code appears to impose a blanket ban on any use of government money to attempt to influence a member of Congress in any way, the law is in practice grey; administration officials are free to lobby Congress themselves, and may advise or inform outside groups. Congressional aides suggest that USTR clearly overstepped that line by actually organising the Nafta coalition, to the extent of issuing press releases on its formation. In a statement responding to Mr Peterson's letter, USTR insisted that the pro-Nafta coalition was entirely independent. 'At no time did anyone at USTR directly or indirectly ask any individual to lobby the Congress. No US officials will be involved in staffing or funding the activities of this group,' the statement said. Some elected officials listed as members of the coalition, however, said Mr Kantor's office had contacted them about joining. 'I don't know if it began in the White House or began in Mickey Kantor's office, but it is Mickey Kantor's office that actually got in touch with me about being a part of this,' said Mr Richard Raymond, a Texas state representative. Some experienced former officials from Congress and the administration yesterday agreed that the Nafta coalition went beyond past efforts to win support for administration policy. Mr Leonard Santos, a lawyer with the Washington firm of Perkins Coie and former trade counsel to the Senate finance committee, said it was 'certainly outside the norm,' although less blatant efforts to stimulate grassroots lobbying were common. Other Washington trade specialists, however, viewed the action as well within normal usage. Violations of the lobbying law are punishable by a small fine or prison sentence, but also by removal from office.</p>

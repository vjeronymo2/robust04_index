			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / China tightens credit reins: Lending clamp revives fears of another boom to bust cycle CHINA has begun enforcing tougher credit restrictions, squeezing funds available for both investment and operating expenditures, according to foreign bankers and businessmen. Fears of a resurgence of inflation, with the urban rate running at an annualised 17 per cent in April, have prompted the renewed drive by China's central bank to curb a credit explosion and calm an overheating economy. However, the lending clamp has revived worries of a return to the boom and bust cycle of the 1980s, when tough administrative measures such as credit curbs and import restrictions slowed economic growth dramatically. 'Many local joint ventures are starved of currency,' said a western banker, citing cases of businesses that now have to go to a 'grey market', dominated by non-bank financial institutions, to borrow funds at interest rates of 20-40 per cent. China's economy grew by nearly 13 per cent last year and growth in the first four months of 1993 exceeded 14 per cent, compared with the same period last year. Western economists have long been warning that such rates are unsustainable. Last week China increased interest rates on bank lending and deposits in an attempt to staunch the flow of funds from the banking system. The credit squeeze coincides with a continuing depreciation of the yuan, with rates to the dollar exceeding Yn10 on the black market against an official rate of Yn5.7. The People's Bank is reported to be placing non-bank financial institutions, such as local trust and investment companies, under more stringent supervision to restrain credit growth. Lending by the institutions has fuelled a real estate boom and the spread of economic development zones in provincial areas. China has also indicated that it plans to restrain money supply growth to a figure of about half that of last year, but western economists in Beijing are sceptical. M2, the broader measure of money supply, climbed by 30 per cent last year, and continued in similar vein in this year's first quarter.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Mortgage rescue scheme labelled a failure THE GOVERNMENT'S mortgage rescue scheme is helping only a fraction of those homeowners in arrears, according to a report published yesterday by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research body. The report predicts that the number of homeowners who will be saved from eviction this year by the scheme is unlikely to be much more than 10,000, compared with predictions of 40,000 when the scheme was launched before Christmas. Central to the scheme was the government's decision to pay the mortgage interest element of income support direct to the lenders. It was estimated that up to half the money failed to reach lenders when it was paid to borrowers. However, a survey of Nationwide building society borrowers in arrears found that more than four fifths of those on income support were already passing over in full the interest they received. The report estimates that direct payment of mortgage interest to the lenders is likely to avoid no more than 10,500 repossessions. The report is even more gloomy on prospects for 'mortgage-to-rent' schemes, which were supposed to allow those in arrears to remain in their homes as tenants. Although such schemes would reduce housing costs for about half of all borrowers in arrears, the report found resistance among mortgage holders who were determined to keep their status as homeowners if possible. The most effective initiative had been the improved management of arrears by lenders who realised that repossessions were worsening the decline in the housing market. The most effective measure, according to the report, would be a mortgage benefit scheme providing help with housing costs to people on low income, whether or not they were unemployed. With most of those in arrears in employment, mortgage benefits would help 32 per cent of households but cost the taxpayer of Pounds 800m a year. Reducing mortgage arrears and possessions.

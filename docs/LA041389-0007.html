			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UTAH FUSION EXPERIMENTS  </P> <P> The supreme arrogance of H.W. Lewis' remarks ("Clearing Fusion Off the Table  Top," Op-Ed Page, April 6) set me thinking about religion.  </P> <P> While he was castigating the media for doing what they do best -- seizing upon  a sexy story -- and seemed to have contempt for the notion that unknown  physical processes could somehow be taking place to account for the results  attained by the Utah physicists, I was struck with a thought about Copernicus.  </P> <P> Copernicus came along with new insights which upset the dogmas of the ruling  high priests of truth in his day, the Catholic Church. Now it appears Lewis  fears for his own dogmas, and he certainly comes from the modern equivalent of  the high priests of truth, the world of physics.  </P> <P> Dogmatics tend to engage in turf battles, seeking the most converts to their  view -- usually because they have some vested interest in their own dogma.  Could it be that his assertion that politicians fund only "real (and expensive)  fusion" research leaves him showing his dogma?  </P> <P> Any rational mind knows that truth is the most subjective and malleable of  substances. This is why science deals in theories and does not call its  findings absolute truths, as many religions do, for invariably new information  or creative thinking comes to light to broaden our understanding of existing  theories or supplant them altogether.  </P> <P> Lewis remarks, "Sufficiently enhanced cold fusion to make useful amounts of  energy in ordinary matter, without the discovery of a new subatomic particle  like the muon, would mean that all we know about the science of electrons,  deuterons and solids is completely wrong, not just slightly wrong."  </P> <P> Lewis overreacts. It could be simply that we are viewing the mountain from afar  as obscured by trees. Perhaps the Utah researchers' "one in a billion"  experiments have moved us slightly closer, beyond some trees, and now we see  the mountain slightly differently, and must now make sense of what we see.  </P> <P> JEFF SOFTLEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

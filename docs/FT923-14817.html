			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK accountancy The business services group BET raised barely a flicker of City interest last month when it disclosed a thumping Pounds 477m extraordinary charge with its 1991-92 results. The reaction was perhaps understandable. The charge, after all, was a non-cash item which served merely to highlight the true scale of losses on businesses bought by the previous BET management but junked by the new team. Had the company been reporting the same figures in a year's time, they might have caused a stir. That Pounds 477m - created as a result of last December's ruling from the Accounting Standards Board requiring goodwill written off to be included in the calculation of profit or loss on disposal  -looks innocuous below the line. Come the likely adoption this autumn of the ASB's exposure draft virtually abolishing extraordinary items, both the headline pre-tax profit number and published earnings per share would in such cases be slaughtered. The effective burying of acquisition accounting should be loudly applauded, even if there is still room for argument between companies and auditors over where to allocate goodwill when businesses are disposed of merely in part. The significance of the BET illustration, though, is in serving as a reminder of how volatile under the proposed accounting changes the treasured earnings figure is set to become. The new ruling can be seen as an admission that the accountancy profession is throwing in the towel after bruising behind-the-scenes battles over what is extraordinary and what exceptional. In future analysts and investors - armed with the relevant information - will have to take up the fight to determine for themselves the underlying trends. Getting away from the present obsession with stated earnings per share - and the idea that the audited figure is somehow objectively reliable - can only be healthy. But some of the market's most deep-rooted principles of valuation will be challenged in the process. It is not clear how the price/earnings ratio can be a satisfactory yardstick when the earnings figure is shown to be a subjective number. The idea of a market multiple, of course, becomes more meaningless again.</p>

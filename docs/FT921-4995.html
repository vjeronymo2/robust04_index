			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Courtney Pope seeks Pounds 5m refinancing COURTNEY Pope Holdings, the shopfitting group where several subsidiaries were put into receivership or closed to save two profitable ones, is being refinanced under a new management team. A Pounds 5.1m rights issue will bring the company back to net worth of Pounds 2.9m. Alongside the issuing of additional shares to satisfy Pounds 1m bank debt, the group's indebtedness will be reduced to less than Pounds 800,000. The new management - Mr George Duncan, Mr Tim Wightman and Mr Nino Allenza - will own 7.6 per cent of the equity after putting up Pounds 650,000. They are changing the company's name to that of their private concern, Rubicon Group. Courtney Pope has been run by Mr Ronnie Aitken, a company doctor, since October 1990. Its debts peaked at more than Pounds 13m. During the rescue, eight subsidiaries were put into administrative receivership and eight others were closed or sold. The group's bank debt was reduced to Pounds 4m last year. About Pounds 3m of the issue proceeds will go to the banks. To settle other liabilities, shares will be issued to Barclays, which will own 7.5 per cent of the equity, and NatWest, giving it just over 4 per cent. The remaining core of the business comprises Versatile, a maker of shopfittings for and Potrafke (UK), a supplier of moving belt checkouts. In the six months to November 30, for which the results were also announced yesterday, Courtney Pope made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 963,000 (loss of Pounds 3.45m) on sales of Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 32.4m). This followed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.9m in 1990-91 and a retained loss of Pounds 15.6m. Earnings per share were 5.5p (loss of 28.6p). The rights issue price of 85p is after a capital reconstruction which will turn 10 existing shares into one, making yesterday's closing price of 9 1/2 p effectively 95p.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Company News: UBS faces challenge from key shareholder A POTENTIALLY long and tense confrontation between Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and its largest shareholder began yesterday in a typically understated Swiss way. BK Vision, a Zurich-based investment trust which holds SFr664m (Dollars 469m) worth of UBS shares carrying nearly 4 per cent of the votes, sent a letter to its shareholders saying that it had contacted UBS about changes in the composition of its board announced last weekend. The letter, signed by Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, managing director, said the trust sought 'to put forward the interests of our company as shareholder in a direct conversation with them'. Mr Schiltknecht said he would not comment publicly on the substance of the trust's concerns about the board changes, but it is widely known in Swiss financial circles that the dispute is over the UBS board's decision not to renominate Mr Christoph Blocher, a controversial industrialist-politician, to its ranks at the annual meeting in April. BK Vision is one of two specialised investment trusts set up last year and managed by BZ Bank, a maverick Zurich securities house led by Mr Martin Ebner. The other is Pharma Vision, of which Mr Blocher is chairman. In both cases, the trusts have taken over shares held by large institutions with the view to creating a single large shareholder capable of putting pressure on companies' managements. In particular, it advocates having independent representatives on company boards, and it undoubtedly sees Mr Blocher as one such at UBS. UBS said it was sacking Mr Blocher, who is a member of the federal parliament, because of his alleged advocacy of government regulation of mortgage interest rates and of bringing the Swiss central bank under parliamentary control.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Viewpoint" report; materials prepared by the Public </F> Opinion Foundation, Viewpoint's sociological service, and the  INTERFAX News Agency]    [Text] "It is time for President Yeltsin to step down",  believe 46% of the Russian city respondents.    The notions "market," "reform," "renewal" are in the  background of the Russian mentality.    The Russians do not imagine a decent life without  children, while the Americans without educated children.    The reform acceleration means the transfer to regulated  prices, believe almost 25% of the pro-acceleration repondents.    Russian rich people may envy their American counterparts.    Directors more often consider the work collective as the  owner of a privatized enterprise, while the workers consider it  is the director.    As many as 49% of the polled Russian city residents  believe high prices are better than the deficit.    "IT IS TIME FOR PRESIDENT YELTSIN TO STEP DOWN", believe  46% of the polled residents of the Russian cities.    Asked "Do you believe that it is time for President Yeltsin  to step down?", the respondents answered in the following way:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |September 1993 (%)       |February 1994 (%)        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yes                      |30                       |46                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |No                       |41                       |34                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Undecided                |29                       |20                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Thus, over six months the number of people who believe that  it is time for President Yeltsin to resign increased by  16%.  Their number has grown at the expense of those who earlier were  against the resignation, and at the expense of those who earlier  were undecided.  <H3>  NOTIONS "MARKET", "REFORM" AND "RENEWAL" AT THE BACKGROUND  OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE MENTALITY </H3>   During the poll conducted late last year, the 3483  respondents were suggested to underline the words which express  in the best way their impression of a decent, happy life and  Russia's renewal. No more than 9 out of 38 words were to be  chosen.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |%                        |Ranking of importance    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Peace                    |56                       |1                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Law and order            |52                       |2                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Safety                   |48                       |3                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Family                   |46                       |4                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Democracy                |18                       |21                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Property                 |12                       |28                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Market economy           |8                        |32                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Renewal                  |7                        |33                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Reform                   |4                        |37                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Among the outsiders are the words which symbolize changes.  Sociologists have found that people of Russia are seeking calm  and prosperity but only a few link these notions with the  economic reforms going on in the country.  <H3>  RUSSIAN PEOPLE DO NOT IMAGINE HAPPY LIFE WITHOUT CHILDREN,  WHILE THEIR AMERICAN COUNTERPARTS WITHOUT EDUCATED CHILDREN </H3>   To the question: "What do you need for a happy life?"  Americans and Russian answer in the following way (the first  three places):    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |USA                      |Ranking of importance    |Russia                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Own house                |1                        |Good health              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Car                      |2                        |Happy marriage           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Happy marriage           |3                        |Children                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Children                 |4                        |Much money               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Educated children        |5                        |Highly-paid job          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Interesting job          |6                        |Own flat                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Highly-paid job          |7                        |Stability, confidence in |  |                         |                         |future                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Orchard, lawn            |8                        |Car                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Much money               |9                        |Own cottage in countrysi-|  |                         |                         |de                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Colour TV-set            |10                       |Loyal friends            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Like the Russians, the Americans do not imagine a happy life  without children. However, they attach much importance to the  education of the young generation, while the Russians think in  the last place about this (19th line in the list).    People of Russia link more rarely than the Americans the  happy life with the interesting job. The Russians place it the  16th on the list, the Americans place it above the highly-paid  job. The Russians want to gain much money. Well, when it comes  to money, the Russians say that much money is good for a decent  life.    The "loyal friends" are among the first ten component parts  of the happy life. The Americans have no such point.    Taking part in the poll held in November 1993 were 1472  inhabitants of the towns and villages of the Voronezh and Tula  regions.    In the United States that poll was conducted by the Roper  Organization.    "SPEEDING UP REFORMS MEANS TRANSFER TO REGULATED PRICES,"  believes one fourth of respondents backing such a speeding up.  "Implementation of economic reforms in Russia should be sped  up," believe 41% of respondents representing Russia's city  residents. As many as 13% are in favor it their slowing down,  and 16% believe that it's high time to stop the reforms. A  total of 30% of the opinion poll participants found it  difficult to answer this question.    Those who spoke in favor of reforms' speeding up adhere to  following notions regarding the essence of economic reforms  (percentage of those who wish to speed up reforms):    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lowering of taxes                     |44                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Speeding up privatization             |32                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Speeding up development of private se-|31                                    |  |ctor                                  |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Increasing salaries                   |26                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Stopping support to economically weak |23                                    |  |enterprises                           |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Transfer to regulated prices          |23                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Indexation of citizens' deposits in s-|15                                    |  |aving banks                           |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Increase of pensions and benefits     |13                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Found it difficult to answer          |14                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Sociologists believe that Russians still have no clear  notion  what is "the speeding up of economic reforms." Respondents had  an opportunity to choose three answers; this should have  increased the percentage of those who answered any of the  proposed variants. More than one third of the respondents  called "taxes' lowering."    However, the population knows quite well that the reform  must  improve the life. That's why many of its supporters believe  that it must improve their private well-being. There are  different notions about the reform in the society: some people  connect speeding up of the economic reform with their near term  interests, expectations (increase of wages, transfer to  regulated prices, etc.) and others -- with real changes in the  economy's type.    Analysts think that it is not by chance that "lowering of  prices" received the first place. According to experts, those  who think that the question concerns taxes of enterprises, those  who perceived them as income taxes, those who think about the  reform as about "a good life," and those who are concerned over  the changes in the type of the economy have presented identical  answers. People tried to introduce the facts which are going on  in the country into the sphere of their interests, expectations,  and wishes.    As many as 1059 respondents living in various cities of  Russia participated in the opinion poll held this February.    THE RICH IN RUSSIA WILL ENVY THE RICH IN AMERICA..... if  they  consider the nation's attitude to them.    Here's how the question: "Do you agree that the state must  restrict the level of incomes earned by the wealthiest people?"  put to American and Russian citizens was answered (% of  the  number of those questioned):    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Americans                |Russians                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yes                      |9                        |52                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |No                       |83                       |31                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Undecided                |8                        |17                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      A majority of respondents in the USA are against restricting  incomes. The Russians think differently. According to  analysts, many Russians believe that this will help the poor.    In the Russian Federation the poll was conducted among the  urban and rural population in Voronezh and Tula Regions last  November. 1472 persons were questioned. In the USA it was  sponsored by The Roper Organization (Roper reports 92-2).  <H3>  DIRECTORS VIEW LABOR STAFFS AS OWNERS OF PRIVATIZED  FACILITY, WHILE WORKERS BELIEVE THAT DIRECTORS ARE THE OWNERS </H3>   This conclusion can be made after reviewing answers to the  following question: "Who is the real owner of privatized  facility in your view?" (% of the number of those questioned).    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Directors                |Workers                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |It's the director        |7                        |25                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |It's the labor staff     |43                       |24                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      This question related to the privatization formula under  which most shares are in the hands of the labor staff.  According to analysts, the difference in the views of the  directors and the workers shows that in the near future the real  process of privatization may give rise to confrontations or  conflicts between the leaders of privatized facilities and their  rank-and- file members.    The poll was conducted at the end of last year; it involved  3483 respondents.  <H3>  49% OF RESPONDENTS IN RUSSIAN CITIES PREFER HIGH  PRICES TO  SHORTAGES  "What do you prefer: shortages of goods with low prices, or  availability of goods with high prices?" </H3>    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Shortages of goods with low prices    |25%                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Availability of goods with high prices|49%                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Undecided                             |26%                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      When people are invited to make a choice: whether to return  to the past, to the empty shops of 1991, or remain in the  present with its supermarkets which in the past could be seen  only on television screens, not simply evaluate the reforms, a  majority of respondents opt for the present after all. Much  fewer people wish to return to the past.    The poll was conducted among Russia's urban population last  February; it involved 1204 respondents.</p>

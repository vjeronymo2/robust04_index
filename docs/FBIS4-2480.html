			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in central  China's Hubei Province find themselves liberated from worries  and cares about what to grow or raise this spring -- "market  advisers" will tell them exactly what to concentrate on.    Local experts at planting and stock-raising or well-informed  businessmen are now acting as farmers' market advisers, teaching  them useful techniques and seeking marketing channels for their  products.    A farmer named Xiong Zaifu lost more than 1,000 yuan by  planting watermelons last year. At the beginning of this year  he signed a contract with a consultant, who advised him to grow  soybeans instead and guaranteed that he could market them.    Another farmer, Hu Xinan, earned 10,000 yuan last year by  raising pigs, following the advice of his market adviser.    This year he signed another three-year contract with the  same  adviser, which clearly stipulates that the adviser must buy his  pigs for a price already agreed upon by the two sides.    "So I need only see to the raising," Hu said in a cheerful  tone.    "Market advisers" have also benefited from such cooperation,  as one adviser explained, "farmers get marketing channels and we  get an ample supply of goods."    Song Guizhi of Wangtan village, near Tianmen city, an expert  at cotton growing, has organized an association of market  advisers in her village to provide services for farmers.    According to a local official, although the output of  aquatic  products and fruits in Hubei increased hugely last year,  marketing has run smoothly, thanks to the positive role played  by the "market advisers" in invigorating circulation and guiding  farmers to adjust their activities to market demands.</p>

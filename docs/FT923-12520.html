			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Bosnia's warring factions agree to 14-day ceasefire LEADERS of the warring factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday agreed to a 14-day ceasefire which will include placing all heavy weapons and artillery in the area under the supervision of the United Nations. The ceasefire is the first to be firmly linked to a plan for demilitarisation of the former Yugoslav republic under international control, offering some hope that it could hold - unlike scores of previous peace attempts. The agreement followed three days of talks by Moslem, Serb and Croat representatives with Lord Carrington, chairman of the European Community-sponsored peace conference on Bosnia-Hercegovina. It is intended to begin a process towards a constitutional settlement in the ethnically-mixed independent republic. Lord Carrington and Mr Jose Cutileiro, the Portuguese ambassador, who conducted most of the detailed negotiations, warned that many earlier ceasefires had been broken. 'But the thing which is encouraging . . . is that the atmosphere was much more realistic than it had been in previous talks in Lisbon', said Lord Carrington. 'This (agreement) is different . . . because of what they have agreed to on heavy weapons,' he added. Under the deal, all heavy weapons, including combat aircraft, artillery and rocket launchers, mostly held by the Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy Bosnian army, will be placed under UN supervision. Lord Carrington has already spoken to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, who is expected to ask the Security Council to take measures to implement this part of the ceasefire agreement. All three sides have also committed themselves not to return fire under any provocation. He added that the 14-day ceasefire period had been designed to give time for the orders to filter through to all units throughout the republic. Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, said he had already asked General Ratko Mladic, commander of the Serb army in Bosnia, to stop bombarding the eastern city of Gorazde, which Serb irregulars have cut off from the outside world for three months. Mr Mate Boban, leader of Bosnia's Croats, who control large parts of the west of the republic, said: 'We will do everything in our means to ensure that the ceasefire lasts.' Mr Haris Silajdzic, representative of the Bosnian government and of the Moslem community, welcomed the agreement, particularly if it could bring an end to the killing and deportations. 'I still want a unitary state. I hope that those forced to flee will now return to this homes,' he added. Moslem, Serb, and Croat representatives also agreed to allow refugees who have fled the area to return, and to enable citizens to move freely throughout the republic. More than 2m people have been made homeless or forced to flee the war, which has left at least 7,500 dead since April. All sides have agreed to reconvene in London on July 27. In the meantime, Lord Carrington plans to hold talks with Mr Ibrahim Rugova, head of the ethnic Albanians in the Serb-controlled southern province of Kosovo in what appears to be the first concrete step in efforts to contain the war.

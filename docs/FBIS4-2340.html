			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng and  visiting Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva said that  their governments will pursue more effective cooperation for a  smooth transition of Macao and for its stability and development.    The two leaders made the pledge at a ceremony marking the  seventh anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint  Declaration on Macao here today.    They agreed that the declaration is "a historic document  with  far-reaching significance."    Li noted that Silva's visit, which began yesterday, bears a  special significance as it coincides with the seventh  anniversary of the joint declaration.    He continued that the declaration has set an example for  other countries in settling problems left behind by history.    Over the past seven years, he said, China and Portugual have  enjoyed very good cooperation, particularly on the question of  Macao, as both sides have implemented the joint declaration  earnestly.    As a result, Macao enjoys social stability and economic  growth with its residents living a peaceful and happy life, Li  added.    He stressed that China and Portugal share the common goal  and  common interests in ensuring Macao's smooth transition,  stability and development.    Li expressed the conviction that with continued joint  efforts  and more effective cooperation, Macao's smooth transition and  power transfer will be realized.    Prime Minister Silva said that the joint declaration he  signed seven years ago together with his Chinese counterpart  accords with the two sides' common desire of resolving the Macao  question through frank, sincere and friendly dialogue between  the two governments.    Such a spirit still works today and will be carried forward  by the two governments, he said.    He continued that the ways and means for the settlement of  the Macao issue enshrined in the joint declaration have two  objectives: to ensure Macao's stability and economic and social  progress as well as its residents' confidence in the future, and  to boost Portugual-China relations from a new angle.    The reason for the two sides to mark the seventh anniversary  of the joint declaration lies in the fact that the declaration  has been implemented smoothly, he said.    He reaffirmed that the Portuguese Government will earnestly  implement the stipulations of the joint declaration so as to  ensure Macao's stability and progress and to maintain the  residents' way of life and the special features of their culture  after 1999.    He expressed the conviction that portugal and China will  fulfill their historical obligations and make stronger the link  between the two peoples by way of ensuring Macao's stability,  especially as Macao is the strongest point of the link.    Prior to the ceremony, Premier Li Peng presided over a  welcoming ceremony in honor of Prime Minister Silva.</p>

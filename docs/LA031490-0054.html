			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> TALES OF HOLLYWOOD TOLD WELL IN 'ALEPH 4' AT SAXON-LEE  </P> <P> While watching "Aleph 4," the latest in Pipeline's series of grouped (usually  four) performance pieces at Saxon-Lee Gallery, it's funny to think of how  Hollywood is governed more than ever by the ethic of the high concept --  meaning low movies. That is because this particular "Aleph" has a concept of  its own: Hollywood, and what it does to people.  </P> <P> One of the pieces, to be sure, doesn't follow the concept. Kedric Robin Wolfe's  "Snooksie," a quaint personal memoir about a favorite dog who stole dinner  goodies and yapped at passing cars, is also the slightest thing Wolfe, with  director Scott Kelman, has ever done and somewhat out of place here.  </P> <P> The other three, connected by Linda Hammett's sneaky and surprising dance  interludes, aren't slight at all.  </P> <P> Every person who has ever slaved in the Industry, gophering today to be the  Spielberg of tomorrow, should see the opener, Michael Schlitt's "Drive He  Said." Schlitt sits on a stool most of the time, recalling life as a menial  assistant for Joe, a heavyweight commercial director/producer. Schlitt's ironic  adventure to the heart of Joe, told with charming immediacy under Dean  Robinson's direction, is oddly breezy for a tale about desperate survival.  </P> <P> This makes an interesting lead-in to Maud Winchester's "Psycho Babble in  Babylon," also directed by Robinson. Winchester's actress, unlike Schlitt's  gopher, actually hits the jackpot -- so much so that she uses her percentage of  the grosses to fund pet causes and then to buy a town. In fact, Winchester's  script, which treads along the edge of cliche without ever falling in, suggests  that making movies isn't what it's about at all. It's about creative  investments, the more self-aggrandizing the better.  </P> <P> Hollywood swallows everyone alive in the end, though, and chomps down  especially hard on any unsuspecting artist who wanders in. Enter "Bert Sees the  Light," writer-director R. A. White's ingenious comic history of Bertolt  Brecht's escape from Hitler to movieland.  </P> <P> White takes several risks here, and they all work superbly. First, he doesn't  adopt a Brechtian style for actors Jack Black, Michael Rivkin and Molly Bryant  to follow, but goes for a hyperactive pace that is half Mack Sennett, half  Billy Wilder. Then, he doesn't accord Brecht much reverence, but rather sees  him as a somewhat stumbling survivor. And he has both Black and Rivkin play  Brecht, alternating at lightning speed as Bryant's hilarious ditzy character  introduces the next scene.  </P> <P> Brecht is reduced to third-degree conversations with dumb producers and  drawling U.S. senators, and reduced even further by the one law that applies to  everyone in Hollywood: Deliver the Goods. White and company do, with a swift  kick in the pants.  </P> <P>  At 7525 Beverly Blvd., on Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., through March 31.  Tickets: $12; (213) 933-5282 or (213) 629-2205.  </P> <P> </P></p>

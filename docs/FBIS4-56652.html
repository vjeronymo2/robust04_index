			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Excerpts of interview with President Fidel Castro by </F> Caribbean Braodcasting Union reporter Sharon Marshall, in  Barbados, date not given, passages within quotation marks  recorded]    [Text] During the interview granted to the Caribbean  Broadcasting Union, Fidel discussed the results of the Small  Island Nations Summit.    [Castro, in Spanish with simultaneous translation into  English] "I believe this summit is a continuation of the Rio  Summit. The Rio Summit was extremely important since it helped  to build an awareness about environmental issues. Politicians  are not usually very well informed about these matters. I  believe that in Rio, for the first time, they faced up to the  tragedy that environmental degradation means for the world. At  that time, they were undergoing a learning process.    ``At this conference, I noticed an increased awareness among  politicians, and more awareness among industrialized nations,  more than in Rio, and within a short period of time. Since Rio,  politicians from island states have of course been more aware  than anyone else. I recall that members of our delegation had  had contact with representatives from these countries, and they  were truly distressed by future prospects.''    Fidel also made reference to the historic victory of the  South African people in the recent elections that brought an end  to apartheid.    [Castro] "The work that took place helped preserve the  independence of Angola, reaffirmed the independence of Namibia,  and accelerated the disappearance of apartheid. I think it  helped accelerate the process. Namibia, in any case, would have  become independent sooner or later. Sooner or later, apartheid  would have disappeared because apartheid was intolerable in  today's world. The South African people, like the people of  Namibia, fought hard and long, made many sacrifices, and  attained their goals. I believe they had great leaders. They are  a great, extremely courageous, hard fighting, energetic,  intelligent, capable people. They have reached this point.    ``We have to study the period from after the end of the war,  the period of the elections, and the extraordinary role played  by Mandela -- his leadership talent, his wisdom. He was an  unifying force, overcame every obstacle, and remained firm. He  was flexible in achieving this political miracle, these  elections in which everyone participated and which achieved such  a resounding victory. It was a great victory for the people of  South Africa, a great victory for Africa, for the world, and for  the liberal movement. I believe we all now need to contribute to  support harmony and peace.''    Fidel reiterated the conditions necessary for the  normalization of ties between Cuba and the United States.    [Castro] "First of all, for the blockade to end. It is an  unfair, harsh, cruel blockade, which includes medicines and  foodstuffs. It was imposed on Cuba 35 years ago. It is one of  the longest blockades in history, and the most unjustified of  all.    ``Second, for the United States to resign itself to the fact  that Cuba is an independent, sovereign country. Third, respect  for our people's right to choose the political, social, and  economic system they believe most fair. These are the three  essential factors. We do not have anything against the United  States. We have not blockaded the United States. We do not want  to change the U.S. social system; we do not seek to establish  socialism in the United States. This, in any case, would be as  complicated as establishing capitalism in Russia. They are  similar things, given the characteristics of these countries. We  are therefore not trying to rule the United States, nor diminish  its independence one iota. It is not that we have a problem with  the United States. It is the United States that has a problem  with us.''</p>

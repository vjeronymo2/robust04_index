			<p>BFN     [Text] The new U.S. ambassador to Brazil will take over his  post with a long list of pending items on his agenda. Strictly  political matters have already been overcome, but many items  remain in the commercial area that must be taken care of lest  they deteriorate and acquire undesirable tones. Ambassador  Melvyn Levitsky comes with the good disposition of cooperating  to find solutions to pending commercial problems, and nothing  indicates that he intends to take overly harsh positions. He  should find the same open spirit in Brasilia.    However, two questions will demand the ambassador's and the  Foreign Ministry's best efforts to permit the evolution of  bilateral relations to continue unhindered. The first item  involves the issue of telecommunications, a market the United  States wants to see open to international bidding. The U.S.  position could, in principle, be advantageous for Brazilian  telecommunications service consumers due to the price reduction  that more competition and the exposure to international markets  would provoke internally. The problem is that telecommunications  was established as a monopoly in the Constitution, and the  removal of this obstacle was left for last and then made  impossible by the failure of the constitutional revision  process. As of last week, constitutional reforms will be  possible only with a privileged quorum of three-fifths of all  legislators' votes, and it will be useless to bring the issue  back to the fore during this legislature. Only next year, after  the new deputies and senators are installed, can Congress be  sounded again on this necessary change for the country's  modernization.    The second issue is more pressing. The Brazilian Government  promised Washington to have Congress approve a bill on  intellectual property rights by 15 June. The government and  Foreign Ministry were unable to push the issue in the Senate  with the needed speed. Besides, the bill had to be adapted to  new GATT rules and even if the Senate passes the bill in time,  which seems unlikely, it can only become law after the Chamber  of Deputies reexamines it.    The 15 June deadline will not be met. The U.S. Government  then can, if it does not consider Brasilia's efforts to provide  the country with legislation on property rights reasonable,  apply sanctions on Brazilian foreign trade. This is something  that must be prevented at all cost. Congress has its own  problems, such as the mid-year recess and the electoral  campaign. But a concentrated effort can be made, as of August,  to vote on appropriate legislation quickly. And we should expect  Ambassador Melvyn Levitsky to use all his influence to prevent  Brazil and the United States from getting involved in some  serious conflict.</p>

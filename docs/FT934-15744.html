			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Unwanted benefit I HAVE received a tax assessment requesting back payment of Pounds 244 for 1990/92. This is for benefit in kind, which I now understand to be membership of a private medical insurer supplied free to employees by my former employer. I was never given the opportunity to decline this benefit. Being healthy, I never required the service. Could you could advise me if this tax assessment is correct? Yes; unfortunately the fact that a benefit provided by an employer is unwanted by, and useless to, an employee does not relieve the employee of the obligation to pay the amount of tax laid down by parliament in respect of that particular type of benefit. Ask your tax office for the free explanatory pamphlet 480 (Guide to expenses payments and benefits for directors and certain employees). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

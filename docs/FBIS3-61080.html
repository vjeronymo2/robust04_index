The  most diverse political forces both at the helm of the country  and struggling for it are having their say on what this policy  should constitute. In the aftermath of programs pertaining to  the long-suffering domestic policy, concepts of the  modernization of foreign policy activity have appeared, as a  rule.  <H5>  Current Foreign Policy Concepts </H5>   The first attempt to formulate a foreign policy concept for  the new Russia was made shortly after the disintegration of the  USSR and the declaration of the sovereignty of the Russian  Federation. The speech of President of Russia Boris Yeltsin at a  special session of the UN Security Council on 31 January 1992,  as also Boris Yeltsin's special message to Butrus-Ghali,  secretary general of the United Nations, contained not only an  exposition of the main directions of Russian policy in the  sphere of arms reduction and disarmament but also ideas  pertaining to Russia's role in maintaining and strengthening  international peace and security, within the confines of the  former USSR included.    The speeches of the Russian president at the UN Security  Council and two weeks later in the parliament of Russia  prompted, it seems to me, other leaders of the country also to  speak out on foreign policy topics. I am talking primarily about  Ruslan Khasbulatov, former chairman of the Supreme Soviet of  Russia. At the end of February 1992 even he spoke at the Moscow  State International Relations Institute at the "Transformed  Russia in a New World" workshop. Although much of what the  speaker of parliament had to say either concurred with or  reiterated what had been maintained by other leading figures of  the country, his speech contained particular points also. They  consist primarily of an accentuation of the directions of  Russia's foreign policy which were in the past traditional for  the diplomacy of the USSR. These are the direction of Central  and Southeast Europe or the countries that were formerly a part  of CEMA and the Warsaw Pact and also the direction of the Arab  East, Asia, and Africa.    In all other respects the foreign policy concept proposed by  Ruslan Khasbulatov was highly consonant with the Foreign  Ministry concept. For both proceeded from the foreign policy of  Russia's renunciation of ideologized bipolarity, that is, the  customary division of the world into two opposite systems, of  predominant reliance on military power as a means of foreign  policy, and also of the a priori perception of any initiative of  ours as epoch-making.    In March 1992 in the Supreme Soviet of the Russian  Federation, as also the Foreign Ministry, politicians saw as a  central task of foreign policy furtherance of the "formation in  Russia of an efficient, dynamically developing economy" and also  "help to national industry and national enterprise as a whole in  reaching foreign markets" (see ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA of 6 March  1992).    In Khasbulatov's opinion, this aspect was traditionally a  weak point in the foreign policy of the USSR inasmuch as it did  not outline precisely a system of foreign policy priorities.  "Priority in our relations with the outside world," the Russian  speaker said, "should be given to states, the development of  relations with which enables us to optimally create, in  accordance with long-term social and state interests, real state  power."    A comparison of this proposition with that which is  championed in the present Government of Russia and the Foreign  Ministry shows that there is no fundamental difference between  the first and the second. No one has questioned the importance  of relations with the United States, the European Community  countries, Japan, China, India, Turkey, and a whole number of  other states. But granted all the importance of this direction  of foreign policy, the former speaker said, it should not  "screen from us relations with states on the territory of the  former USSR and the states of Central and Southeast Europe."  Geopolitical considerations and economic interests demand also  close ties to the Arab East, Asia, and Africa.    Under the conditions of the radical lowering of the  thresholds of the USSR-United States military confrontation,  relations with the members of the CIS and also with the  countries bordering the CIS are becoming preferable and more of  a priority. This approach coincides to a certain extent with the  approach of Andrey Kozyrev and his arguments concerning  horizontal directions of Russia's foreign policy.    The above-mentioned and other directions of the foreign  policy of the new Russia were reflected in the document "Basic  Propositions of the Concept of Foreign Policy of the Russian  Federation" approved by order of the president of the country in  the last 10 days of April 1993. A group of highly qualified  experts from the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations, the Defense Ministry, the Foreign  Intelligence Service, the Russian Federation Security Council  staff, and two committees of the Supreme Soviet--International  Affairs and Foreign Economic Relations and also Defense and  Security--took part in the preparation of this document. This  work was led by Yuriy Skokov. The document went through the  entire procedure of confirmation within the framework of the new  mechanism of the preparation and adoption of foreign policy  decisions. It was approved by the Interdepartmental Foreign  Policy Commission and confirmed at a meeting of the Security  Council of the Russian Federation. For this reason, obviously,  of all those that have been made public it is the most developed  and full.    The concept set forth in the document is oriented, as V.  Chernov, deputy chief of the Office of Strategic Security of the  Security Council of the Russian Federation, maintained, not  toward ideological precepts or the predilections of this force  or the other in Russian society but toward the "vitally  important interests of the country and its citizens." These  interests include "support for the processes of formation of the  statehood of the Russian Federation and defense of its  territorial integrity; creation of the conditions ensuring the  stability and irreversibility of political and economic reforms;  Russia's active and full participation in the building of a new  system of international relations, in which it is ensured a  worthy place."    I shall not further trouble the reader with a paraphrase of  the content of Chernov's article, especially since it was  published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of 29 April of this year.    In my view, neither the concept of the Security Council of  the Russian Federation nor the others dealt with above take  account to a sufficient extent of the salient features of Russia  and its people, which jeopardizes its effective realization. It  is this and also the fact that questions of foreign policy are  essentially being skirted by the election blocs that prompted me  to share my thoughts on the relationship between the particular  features of Russia and the character of its people and the  country's foreign policy. The success of our foreign policy  actions will depend on the strength of this relationship to a  considerable extent, it seems to me. And the other way about: A  disregard for and insufficient consideration of the particular  features of the country would ultimately bring about negative  consequences. This is true, in my view, in regard to both the  domestic and foreign policy of any country.  <H3>  Salient Features of Russia and Its People as Factors of  Influence on Foreign Policy </H3>   There are a good many factors of influence on Russia's  foreign policy. Both internal and external.    Among the internal, in my view, pertain not only the  political and economic systems, the break with and change of  which are occurring so dramatically in Russia at this time, but  also the particular features of the country and the character of  the people. It is on the latter that I would like to dwell in  more detail, accentuating attention merely on what most  influences the foreign policy sphere.    I would point among the salient features primarily to  Russia's unique geopolitical and geocultural position. It is  truly unique from various viewpoints. Particularly from the  viewpoint of the link of Europe and Asia. Merely by virtue of  this fact Russia could successfully perform the role of  connecting link or linking bridge between the developed West and  the rapidly developing (already no less developed than the  Western countries in some respects) East.    An insufficiently developed Russia is preventing this bridge  being dependable and firm, which is currently extraordinarily  important for both the West and the East.    Besides the fact that Russia lags behind the foremost  countries economically, it represents for the countries on both  sides of the bridge, as a nuclear power with an unstable  political situation, a great danger. Even greater, perhaps,  than, formerly, the USSR. These two main factors, that is, the  economic and military factors, are prompting both West and East  to pull Russia into their orbit. Not in the distant future but  today. For the sooner this happens, the more quickly these  countries' economies will gain not only additional oxygen but,  essentially, their second wind. Not to mention the fact that  this would sharply enhance the security of both, with a  considerable reduction in spending on military purposes, which  also is of considerable importance for the economies of these  countries.    This has to be seen. Not to derive benefits from this for  itself would be an unforgivable mistake for Russia. I would note  in this connection that a most important task of Russian  diplomacy currently is to facilitate the erection of the bridge  between West and East. This on the one hand. On the other,  Russia should contribute to a lowering of the level of military  confrontation on both sides of the bridge. I would add to what I  have said that Russia's position on the world map prompts it  also to be an arbiter and mediator in the solution of many  problems arising in the Eurasian space.    Standing next door to and at the same time detached from  this  question is that of Russia's relations with the CIS countries.  There is not at this time on the Eurasian land mass, it seems to  me, a more urgent or more large-scale problem than the  establishment of good-neighbor relations within the CIS  countries. This task confronts Russia first and foremost. Unless  friendly relations take shape among the CIS states, its  interests will suffer primarily, then those of Europe, Asia, and  the world.    It is for this reason that in relations with CIS countries  Russia cannot confine itself merely to being a mediator and  arbiter but should involve itself in patronage and messianism,  although it is extraordinarily difficult to do so in the present  situation. But as the experience of the past two years has  shown, even in this situation Russia has been attempting to find  financial and other resources and forces to perform its  preordained role. In 1992 alone Russia's financial assistance to  the CIS countries was estimated at $17.6 billion or many  hundreds of billions of rubles, not to mention any other  assistance. And this given the present virtually catastrophic  situation in Russia's economy.    The Russian Foreign Ministry, by all accounts, has already  understood full well that the preservation of good relations and  peace, within the CIS included, is less costly than war. If only  Andrey Kozyrev's article published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of 22  September of this year attests to this. I will adduce just two  short, but very expressive quotations from this publication  concerning the CIS. The first: "Russia, on account of profound  historical, political, cultural, and other relations with  neighboring states, could not and did not have the moral right  to remain indifferent to their requests for help in securing  peace." And the second: "It is time to surmount both our  'internal' slowness and the indecisiveness of the world  community in respect to Russia's peacemaking efforts in the  space of the former USSR. This is not a 'neoimperial' but, for  all that, a unique geopolitical space, the only one of its kind,  where 'no one will make peace for Russia.'" The ideas expressed  in the Russian minister's article concerning Russia's  peacemaking role on the territory of the CIS were developed in  his speech at the UN General Assembly session on 27 September of  this year in New York (see NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of 30 September  1993).    Thus the experience of recent years (recent months  particularly) shows that Russia is having one way or another to  return to great-power (not imperial but great-power) politics in  relations with its immediate neighbors, although not that long  ago it was manifestly mistakenly attempting to renounce this. As  distinct from the immediate neighboring countries, performance  of its messianic role in respect to distant foreign countries  would seem to me an extremely difficult business both now and in  the immediate future.    To what I have said about Russia's patronage and messianism  in respect to the republics of the CIS I would add one stage  direction. I personally would prefer relations within this  Commonwealth of Independent States to be built such as they  should be built between sovereign subjects: on the basis of  equality and mutual advantage. But there are  realities that have taken shape over decades and centuries and  there are, finally, particular roles that this country or the  other performs, and it is impossible to ignore all this.    The problem of the conversion of Russia into a firm bridge  between Europe and Asia and the tantalizing prospects which  could be afforded the developed countries in the event of the  enlistment of the Russian giant in their economic orbit on the  one hand, and the danger emanating from the boiling overheated  cauldron on the territory of the CIS stuffed with nuclear and  other weapons of mass destruction on the other, puts the  liberal-democratic world in a very difficult position. It will,  willy-nilly, be necessary to help us, accommodate us, agree to  compromises.... This world will altogether have to do what it  would never do in another situation.    But Russia also currently is in a no less easy [as  published]  (if not more difficult) position than the West. With the natural  resources and human potential such as it has it is humiliating  and shameful to act the part of suppliant for aid and support.  But the main thing is not even this but the fact that it will be  necessary to change its distinctiveness and adapt itself to the  more developed countries. Russia is resisting this in every  possible way and seeking ways to preserve its essence and at the  same time to join the civilized world. It is now impossible to  say how this struggle will end. It would seem to me that Russia  will, for all that, have to change considerably. But it still  has a chance to preserve its distinctiveness.    As far as the military-defense factor is concerned, it is  conditioned by the fact that from century to century Russia has  had to keep its powder dry and defend itself against  interventionists in all directions. Avid for Russia's land,  water, and forest resources, foreigners have forced the country  to waste enormous funds, resources, and forces on defense.  Whence the military-defense complex in Russians' mentality.  Fortunately, it has not killed off in Russians' souls an  openness to peace, sincere benevolence, and hospitality.  Nonetheless, Russia cannot fail to reckon with this foreign  policy complex. It is no accident that a most acute struggle is  under way in our society around the question of disarmament,  arms reduction, and the sale of weapons on foreign markets.    Speaking of the military-defense complex, it cannot be  forgotten either that there has in recent decades been a  fundamental change in the situation with the appearance of  weapons of mass destruction (particularly nuclear). Wars and  interventions have become an extraordinarily dangerous business  not only for those against whom they are directed but for the  aggressors also. We should have spotted this particular feature  of the contemporary world order back in the 1950's and have  radically restructured our views of the outside world, military  doctrine, and so forth. Approximately three decades behind the  times, many of us are even now still clinging to the habitual  dogmas. Yet the main danger now threatens us from an entirely  different direction.    The rapid development of the productive forces in the  foremost countries and of their foreign economic relations is  enabling them to expand by nonmilitary means and to achieve in  this way to a certain extent what was previously achieved by  war. In a sense this expansion is a boon not only to the  expansionists but to those who are being subjected to it also  inasmuch as it enables the latter to accustom themselves to  progress more rapidly. But it could be a danger for them also if  they forget their national and state interests. This should be  remembered. By present-day Russia particularly. And we should on  the one hand have a modern army guided by the doctrine of  defensive sufficiency and, on the other, formulate and  implement laws that safeguard security and national  interests in all spheres.    But in defending state and national interests it should be  remembered that, as distinct from previous years, there has been  a pronounced growth of the need for defense of the interests of  private individuals. Nonetheless, the defense of state interests  proper will for a long time to come prevail over other aspects  of Russia's foreign policy activity.    The said factors are, it may be considered, of a fundamental  nature, for they have either a natural origin or such long  historical roots that they are imprinted on the nation's genetic  code.    But there are also other factors which, although lacking  such  long historical roots, are still quite powerful and influential,  as their effect has been manifested in recent decades and  persists to some extent. I refer, of course, to the effect of  the theory and practice of the Soviet foreign policy doctrine in  all its components (a confrontational approach and antagonism  with the world of capitalism, proletarian internationalism and  unity with the fraternal countries of the socialist community,  solidarity with the peoples of the developing states fighting  against imperialism, and so forth), which served the system of  totalitarian socialism and which still has not yet fully  disappeared. It would be naive to think that the former doctrine  will disappear from diplomatic and other departments dealing  with foreign policy without resistance.    Nonetheless, Soviet doctrine was officially abandoned even  before the demolition of the USSR, and at that same time the  search for a new paradigm began. It persists to this day, and  the situation is further complicated by the fact that Russia has  yet to determine its position as regards its domestic  ideological reference points. Under the conditions of the  extreme intellectual ferment and ideological confusion various  political forces and individual politicians have been seeking  their own answers to the urgent questions of internal and  external life.    For this reason the subjective and, particularly,  personality  factor (the capacity of the president or the foreign minister to  generate and pursue a foreign policy appropriate to the times,  for example) is also performing a big role in the transitional  period.    Finally, there is one further extraordinarily important  factor of influence on the foreign policy of any country, Russia  included. These are changes in the international situation and  the behavior of partner countries, which frequently  dictate a certain line of behavior.    To collate briefly what has been said about the factors of  influence, it should be mentioned that they consist of six  blocks: natural; historically conditioned and subdivided into  long-term and relatively short-term; systemic or connected with  the change of systems; factors of the transitional period;  subjective; and international. The importance and priority of  each of the said blocks may be argued, but their influence is  obvious. The comprehensive simultaneous effect of these blocks  frequently leads to complex specific foreign policy situations  and steps.</p>

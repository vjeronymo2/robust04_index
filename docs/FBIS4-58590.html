			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with Faysal al-Husayni by Roni </F> Shaqed in Jerusalem on 3 May]    [Text] "We are giving birth to a baby today, but it is  weak. I love him because he is my child, but I am not pleased,"  Faysal al-Husayni, who laid the foundations for the peace accord  yet was left behind in Jerusalem today, said. Like other  Palestinian leaders in the territories, he will watch the  signing ceremony on television.    "This is the first step toward a Palestinian state. I would  have liked the first step to have been bigger, but it is a  start," al-Husayni told YEDI'OT AHARONOT. "I thought we would  be able to rule in Gaza and Jericho and tell the Israeli people:  Yes, we can be free, build our country, and provide security  for our people and yours. It now appears that we are not really  being allowed to rule. Details introduced into the agreement  take this opportunity away from the Palestinian people. If I  must provide security, I require full control.    "The future of Jerusalem also troubles me. The closure harms  religious life, and family ties are disrupted. We do not want a  new agreement, but we are demanding a return to the previous  situation in Jerusalem. I spoke with 'Arafat on the matter and  asked him to raise the closure issue in his meeting with Rabin."    I asked him: We spoke in 1988, and you said that one day a  Palestinian state would be set up. Did you think this would be  the path taken?    "I thought that the process would take much longer. I spoke  of 20 years; I thought demography would change the face of  things."    How will we promote relations ties now?    "We have to change the Israeli mentality, and our side must  see you differently as well. We have to believe in peace."</p>

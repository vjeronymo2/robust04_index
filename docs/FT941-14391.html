			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: MIM posts ADollars 18m half-time loss MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals group, yesterday announced a loss of ADollars 18.5m (USDollars 12.8m) in the six months to December 12. The first-half deficit compares with a surplus of ADollars 71.3m in the same period the previous year, and was on revenues of ADollars 996.4m against ADollars 870.9m. However, it came after items such as an abnormal loss of ADollars 17.8m relating to MIM's joint venture smelting operations in Germany and a ADollars 1.2m loss on foreign exchange. Before these items, MIM posted a small ADollars 7.1m profit, compared with a ADollars 51.1m surplus in the first half of 1992-3. The company also saw a better performance in the second quarter, compared with the first. Net profit before abnormals and foreign exchange in the second three months stood at ADollars 14m, compared with ADollars 16.6m last time. MIM said that average base metal prices received during the six months remained 'significantly weaker than a year ago, with copper and lead continuing to deteriorate in the recent quarter and zinc improving'. A weaker Australian dollar only partially offset this. Overall, the average Australian dollar price for copper was down by 21 per cent on a year ago. For lead, prices were down by 20 per cent and for zinc, by 22 per cent. However, the group also said that sales volumes rose significantly year-on-year in the first half. Late in the quarter, it also noted an improvement in metal prices, albeit from very low levels. MIM stressed that its continuing cost-reduction programme 'remains firmly in place,' and said it was continuing its review of assets and investments. On specific projects, MIM said that production at the McArthur River zinc-lead-silver mining development remained on schedule for 1995, while a geological drilling programme had been completed on the Ernest Henry deposit. 'Preliminary results from this indicate that a high-grade concentrate can be made with good metal recovery from the primary ores,' MIM said. Exploration activity remained focused on copper and gold, with expenditure in the first half totalling ADollars 38m. Pasminco, the Australian zinc and lead producer, yesterday announced that group metal production fell during the first half of 1993-4, compared with the previous year. Zinc production was down 11 per cent, due to the sale of its Avonmouth smelter in the UK to MIM Holdings and a scheduled shutdown at Pasminco Metals-Sulphide.</p>

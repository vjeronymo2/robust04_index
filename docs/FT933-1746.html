			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Pechiney blames aluminium business for interim deficit EUROPEAN recession and the depressed state of the aluminium market have taken their toll on Pechiney, the state-controlled French aluminium group. Yesterday it announced net losses of FFr397m (Dollars 70.6m) in the first six months of the year, compared with net profits of FFr782m last time. Sales at the group, which is on the government's list of 21 companies to be sold as part of its privatisation campaign, fell from FFr34.01bn to FFr31.3bn. Operating income declined from FFr1.83bn to FFr1.1bn. Mr Jean Gandois, chairman, said there were 'extreme differences' between the group's activities. Its single biggest problem, he said, is the aluminium production business, which is suffering from falling prices and excess supply. He said the gloomy outlook for this division would prevent the group from returning to profitability in the second half. The losses, however, were expected to be 'noticeably less' than in the first half. According to Mr Gandois, aluminium prices fell by about 10 per cent in the first half of 1993 compared with the same period last year. He blamed the impact of Russian imports and excess production by other international manufacturers, and forecast that aluminium stocks would continue to rise. Pechiney's chairman also expressed interest in a proposal by the French industry ministry to combine with Compagnie Nationale du Rhone (CNR), the French electricity generator. 'There would be advantages in having a stable supply of electricity,' said Mr Gandois. The French government is believed to be encouraging such an alliance with CNR to make Pechiney more attractive before privatisation. Pechiney is France's single largest consumer of electricity. At the other end of the scale from aluminium, in terms of the group's business divisions, was Pechiney International, the packaging group 67 per cent-owned by Pechiney. Net profits here fell from FFr1.42bn to FFr439m, but this was the result of large exceptional gains last year. Excluding exceptionals, profits rose to FFr578m from FFr397m. The rise in underlying profits reflected reduced financial and tax charges, which offset a slowdown in demand for drinking cans and lower prices. The group said the difficult business environment did not jeopardise the prospects for an increase in profits at the subsidiary. The third group of Pechiney's businesses, trading and non-aluminium industrial activities, reported flat profits during the period.</p>

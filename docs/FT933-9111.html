			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Plan for medical rescue SEVERAL countries yesterday offered transport and hospital places for the seriously ill and wounded from Sarajevo, write Our Foreign Staff and Reuter. A spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Zagreb talked of dozens of offers. Britain, Sweden and Ireland announced they would arrange for the evacuation of 41 emergency medical cases from the city within the next two days. In a joint statement in Stockholm, Mr Carl Bildt and Mr John Major, prime ministers of Sweden and Britain respectively, said 20 of the injured would be taken to the UK, 16 to Sweden and five to Ireland. The move, in response to an appeal from the UNHCR, follows Mr Major's decision earlier this week to order the immediate evacuation of a severely injured five-year-old girl, now being treated in a London hospital. The Saudi ambassador to Britain, Ghazi al-Gosaibi, announced that his country had promised Pounds 100,000 towards the cost of transport. In Rome, the Italian foreign ministry said it had contacted the UNHCR to solicit 'the most urgent cases of wounded Bosnian children'. And a Dutch foreign ministry spokesman in The Hague said Fl 3m (Pounds 1.05m) had been set aside to treat wounded Bosnian children.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Buying and selling for recovery - Newman Tonks' preparations for the upturn NEWMAN TONKS is a recovery stock. The difficulty is knowing when the recovery will take place. In 1991 it was expected that the benefits of continuing investment, acquisition and rationalisation would shine through in 1992. Now the expectation of benefits is put back to 1993, or, at the most optimistic, the last quarter of this year. The Birmingham-based group produces, specifies and distributes architectural products such as doors, locks and windows, to the construction industry. It is the biggest group of its type in Europe. Where the construction industry goes, it follows. So, at least in the UK, it is having to battle through the doldrums. Last year, it noted yesterday, was 'one of the most difficult years the building industry has faced since the war.' However, when it announced a 35 per cent fall to Pounds 15.1m in annual pre-tax profits and accompanied that with disclosure of two new acquisitions costing Pounds 18.9m and a share placing and offer to raise Pounds 17.9m, it pointed up some trends in Midlands manufacturing and the attitude of the City towards industry. Newman Tonks exemplifies the drive to diversify markets that has been marked in Midlands engineering since the recession of the 1980s. In its financial year to last October, 35 per cent of its turnover came from the US and continental Europe. Its aim to be an international group has been taken one step further by the smaller of the two acquisitions it announced - that of Moller &amp; Auster, the Norwegian locks cylinder maker and supplier of security systems, for Pounds 5.5m, payable in Newman Tonks shares. This follows a string of recent continental European acquisitions like Undall, also in Norway, Normbau in Germany and O Mustad et Fils in France. The recession has forced manufacturing companies to concentrate on the main lines of their business and to shed peripheral subsidiaries. Thus, in recent months, Newman Tonks has sold a central heating company and closed down a manufacturer and distributor of taps and showers. Alongside this concentration, Newman Tonks has been seeking to ensure that individual parts of its business obtain benefits from other parts. Hence, it is engaged in the delicate task of encouraging its distribution arms, in the Laidlaw business for example, which specify the products used in construction projects, to specify products produced within the group. The fall in manufacturing employment, following a sharp decline in the Midlands during the 1980s and a slower fall during the recovery years, has again accelerated. Newman Tonks has been part of this trend with a continuing process of rationalisation. On a worldwide basis, its employment roll fell during 1990-91 by 10 per cent to about 4,600 people. Apart from the sale and closure of peripheral businesses, factories have been closed as the activities of different plants have been merged in the locks, brass and doors sectors. The other side of this is that, in addition to its acquisitions, Newman Tonks has continued to invest. Capital spending in the last financial year was Pounds 8m, against Pounds 11m the previous year. Lightening the debt burden has been a preoccupation in the manufacturing sector. Although Newman Tonks has remained acquisitive, it has managed to maintain a strong balance sheet. Gearing at the end of last October was 27 per cent. But the effect of the share placing to finance the Moller &amp; Auster purchase and the larger buy, for Pounds 13.4m in shares, of Shapland &amp; Petter Holdings, the Barnstaple door manufacturer, will be to reduce gearing to 17 per cent as net assets increase from the end-year figure of Pounds 73.3m to more than Pounds 86m. Despite the generally poorer results from manufacturing companies, the financial institutions have been keen to see dividend payments kept up. Newman Tonks is keeping its 1990-91 payments at the previous level of 9.3p despite the cost: Pounds 10.6m out of attributable profits of Pounds 11.8m. At the same time the new shares it is placing will attract the 1990-91 final dividend of 5.5p. 'There is a lot of talk in the press about cutting dividends, but the institutions are saying 'pay the dividends and come back for cash if you need it',' said Mr Cecil Buckett, the Newman Tonks finance director. The institutions were as good as their word yesterday. The share placing, handled by de Zoete &amp; Bevan and Albert E Sharp, was sold out by 10.30am. The immediate future for Newman Tonks is uncertain. 'The exact timing of the recovery in 1992 cannot be predicted with certainty, and competition within our world markets is strong,' said Mr Douglas Rogers, the chairman. The UK market remains depressed, but continental Europe remains steady and the US is improving slightly. All of which suggests that 1990-91 marks the nadir of Newman Tonks fortunes.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Foreigners eager for Czech sell-offs - Shares in 861 groups are on offer Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, offered British businessmen a plethora of uplifting quotes from Adam Smith, the 18th century prophet of laisser faire capitalism, in London yesterday. But he had little concrete to offer those seeking an easier way through the Czech bureaucracy to potentially lucrative contracts and participation in the privatisation of Czech industry. The Czech Republic, he told a luncheon audience organised by the Adam Smith Institute, British Gas and Bass, the UK brewer, had an embarrassing surplus of foreign capital. The central bank was having to neutralise the inflow by domestic monetary manoeuvres. Czech companies were looking forward to the time when they would be investing abroad in foreign assets, not just absorbing foreign capital, he added. It was a tongue in cheek performance, and the audience loved it. Foreign investors have indeed been buying Czech companies and shares on the rising Prague bourse. They are closely following the outcome of the second wave of voucher privatisation which begins next month and should be completed this summer. Shares in 861 companies with a book value of Kcs155bn (Dollars 5.3bn) are on offer, compared with about 1,000 companies worth more than Dollars 7bn last time. But interest has been lively with over 6m Czechs out of a population of 10.3m registering for voucher books. Only Czech nationals can participate in the voucher scheme, but foreign investors are poised to move in on targeted companies once the process has been completed. Most will deal directly with investment funds, several of which have links with leading foreign institutions such as Credit Suisse First Boston, Corus of the US, Austria's Creditanstalt and Raiffeisen banks, and Epic, a Vienna-based fund. The 400-plus funds played a large role in the first privatisation wave, winning control of 72 per cent of privatised shares. They compete fiercely to persuade investors to entrust them with the management of their portfolios. Incentives for investors include promises of returns several times the Kcs1,000 cost of a voucher book, cheap loans and credits and other benefits. At least one fund has offered an immediate cash payment of Kcs7,000 with another Kcs1,000 promised later to buy the rights of voucher book holders, thereby getting around a ban on investors selling the books. Foreign investors are locked out of the initial process, but they can buy shares from funds and individual shareholders once privatisations are completed. They can buy shares on the stock exchange or the rival over-the-counter RM-System, although lack of market liquidity and listed stock reduces opportunities. Stakes in companies can be bought directly from the government or the government-owned National Property Fund, as many large privatisations involve a mix of vouchers, and sale by public tender or direct sales. Companies to be privatised include: SPT Telecom: 26 per cent to be sold by vouchers. The government will decide shortly on a short-list of foreign partners to be offered a 27 per cent stake, although a partner is unlikely to be chosen before 1995. There is strong interest from foreign telecommunications companies. SPT had net profit of Kcs3.5bn on revenues of Kcs18.4bn last year. CEZ: about 4 per cent of the its share capital will be sold by vouchers; 30 per cent was sold in the first wave. CEZ is one of the country's largest companies with a quasi monopoly of power generation - competition comes from a few small power plants run by municipalities. It expects pre-tax profits of Kcs18.5bn on operating revenues of Kcs49bn for 1993. It is one of the most popular stocks on the market, given blue chip status by foreign analysts, although the company could face environmental problems. Chemopetro and Kaucuk Kralupy: two refineries which have attracted strong interest from Shell, and a separate consortium of Conoco, Agip and Total. Some 36 per cent to be sold by vouchers, and at least another 30 per cent to be reserved for a foreign partner. Kablo Kladno: cables manufacturer; 66 per cent to be sold by vouchers, an additional 30 per cent reserved for Felten and Guillaume of Germany. Karosa: bus and truck manufacturer; more than 50 per cent to be sold by vouchers, with about 36 per cent sold to Renault Vehicules Industriels. Synthesia: the country's second largest chemicals company manufacturing organic chemicals and explosives including Semtex. Has switched most of its exports from former Comecon trade bloc to the West. Profits of Kcs199m on sales of Kcs4.6bn last year. With the range of companies narrower than in the first privatisation, competition is expected to be strong for favoured stocks. For international institutional investors, the second wave offers an opportunity to raise their holdings in one of eastern Europe's fastest growing emerging markets. About Dollars 200m in portfolio investment has moved into the Czech Republic since last June, and more is expected. 'There could be another Dollars 500m waiting to come in through institutional funds,' says Mr Peter Galbraith, an analyst with Epic.</p>

Texas Eastern states that it filed the Amendment to revise the proposed facilities necessary to render the service for CNG and to revise the proposed initial rates to be charged for the incremental service for CNG, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Eastern states that the revised initial rate is the result of an increase requested by CNG and agreed to by Texas Eastern in the quantities on gas to be transported for CNG and the facility changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the original application, Texas Eastern proposed to construct and operate certain replacement pipeline and compression facilities to increase its mainline transmission capacity between the existing interconnection with CNG at the Crayne Farm meter station, in Waynesburg County, Pennsylvania, and the existing interconnection of Texas Eastern's system with CNG's Line PL&hyph;1, near the Chambersburg Compressor Station in Chambersburg County, Pennsylvania. Texas Eastern proposed to provide an incremental 100,000 Dekatherms per day (Dth/d) of transportation capacity for CNG. Texas Eastern states that CNG proposed to utilize this capacity to render firm transportation service for CNG customers served off of CNG's PL&hyph;1 Line. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On November 18, 1993, in Docket No. CP94&hyph;89&hyph;000, CNG filed a related application describing the services it proposes to render for the CNG Customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Instead of the facilities additions set forth in Section V of the original application, Texas Eastern requests authorization to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Install, own and operate a 6,500 horsepower compressor addition at Texas Eastern's existing compressor station at Uniontown, in Greene County, Pennsylvania;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Construct, install, own and operate 9.71 miles of 36-inch replacement pipeline on Texas-Eastern's Line No. 1 between the existing Uniontown and Bedford Compressor Stations in Fayette County Pennsylvania; <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Texas Eastern states that the first 2.04 miles of replacement pipeline were previously authorized in Texas Eastern's ITP Project in Docket No. CP92&hyph;184&hyph;000,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 16, 1993. However, it is stated that due to a change in the market requirements, such facilities are no longer required for the project, and Texas Eastern will file an amendment to its ITP Project to reflect the changes to the ITP facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Construct, install, own and operate 4.22 miles of 36-inch replacement pipeline on Texas Eastern's Line No. 1 between the existing Bedford and Chambersburg Compressor Stations in Bedford County, Pennsylvania; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Charge an incremental reservation rate of $7.343 per Dth, as a NGA section 7(c) initial rate separately stated as part of Texas Eastern's Part 284 FT&hyph;1 Rate Schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Eastern submits that the Amendment reflects the increase in firm transportation service to CNG from an MDQ of 100,000 Dth/d to 105,000 Dth/d, and the changed location and quantity of replacement pipeline necessary to provide the corresponding increase in firm capacity for CNG. Texas Eastern states that CNG has informed it that CNG intends to notify the Commission in the near future that CNG intends to render 105,000 Dth/d of firm downstream transportation service for the CNG customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

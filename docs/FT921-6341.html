			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Japan rate cut urged by LDP elder statesman MR Shin Kanemaru, the elder statesman of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, yesterday added his voice to demands for the Bank of Japan to cut interest rates to stimulate a flagging economy. He also strongly attacked the central bank's independence, saying it was Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who had the power to make decisions on monetary policy, not Mr Ysushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor. 'They say the Bank of Japan governor has the authority on the official discount rate but the prime minister is almighty,' said Mr Kanemaru at a meeting of the LDP's largest faction, of which he is currently president. Mr Kanemaru called for a further cut in the ODR of 0.5 percentage points to 4.5 per cent, saying that if the rate had been cut by 1 percentage point at the time of the last reduction in December, instead of 0.5 percentage point, the economy 'would not have declined so suddenly.' Mr Mieno, speaking at a regular press conference, said he saw no need for a further easing in monetary policy. He said the economy was slowing but there was no risk of a sudden sharp downturn in growth. As Mr Kanemaru's remarks show, politicians and businessmen are becoming increasingly vociferous in their demands for further cuts. Recent economic data indicate that the economy is slowing faster than the authorities expected. The central bank's independence is enshrined in law. But in practice it is susceptible to influence from the government through the ministry of finance, not least because the ministry traditionally has a voice in appointing central bank governors. Mr Mieno has said that de facto independence relied heavily on the central bank maintaining a reputation for timely changes in policy. He said that while he consulted government officials and businessmen, he kept his distance from politicians. Further evidence of the slowing of the economy came with publication of figures showing household spending in December fell in real terms by 0.8 per cent, the first decline in a year. For the year as a whole, household spending rose by just 1.7 per cent in real terms, according to the government's management and co-ordination agency.</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / The Lex Column: France The French government's privatisation programme must be beginning to cause a few concerns. The 8 per cent fall in the CAC-40 this year is unnerving and some recent privatisation issues, such as Elf Aquitaine, are trading below their offer price. Friday's postponement of the sale of the recession-damaged Banque Hervet will hardly have helped sentiment either. The government's immediate worry must be whether to press ahead with the sale of more shares in the insurance group, UAP. Financial stocks have been out of favour across Europe this year. UAP has fallen 21 per cent. But the French government can ill-afford to cancel the UAP issue, given the need to recycle the proceeds into recapitalising the corporate wounded, such as Credit Lyonnais and Air France. Besides, the government will be desperate to avoid any further blows to its credibility by reversing its privatisation policy. That suggests the state will sell its holding this summer, but at a less ambitious price than might once have been anticipated. The government's discomfiture may prove the investor's opportunity. Like most other stock markets, the Paris bourse has lost ground as the US Fed has started making cash look attractive again. The liquidity tide which sustained French shares last year has now lost its force. There is bound to be a hiatus as the market waits for the corporate earnings momentum to take up the slack. But the prospects for corporate earnings look good as the economy recovers. The French penchant for provisioning in recession should also give that upturn added edge.</p>

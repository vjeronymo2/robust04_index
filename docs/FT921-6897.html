			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (9): Lots of uncertainties - Compensation ADEL OMAR ASEM has got the longest job title in Kuwait. He is probably one of the country's busiest people. His desk is awash with paper. His telephone is ringing. He signs another document and takes a sip of tea. 'I will be more than happy when this is all over,' he says. Mr Asem is director-general of the Public Authority for the Assessment of Compensation for Damages Resulting from Iraqi Aggression. It is called PAC for short. The agency was set up in November last year to assemble Kuwait's claim against Iraq for damage and loss during the war. It is an enormous and bureaucratic operation that will take about two years to complete. On February 15, Mr Asem's department sent out 600,000 claim forms. That is roughly one for every Kuwaiti citizen. Foreign businesses and expatriates seeking damages must file claims through their embassies or national authorities. This first batch of forms in Kuwait represents Phase 1 of the operation. It covers individual and personal loss and injury. Phase 2, which is scheduled to start in April or May, covers corporate and government claims. It is likely to be the biggest ever claim against a single country. 'Kuwait's oil losses alone could amount to Dollars 40bn-Dollars 45bn,' says Mr Asem. 'Oil is the biggest component, but there has been speculation that the total could be as high as Dollars 100bn to Dollars 200bn.' More conservative estimates put the likely total at around Dollars 40bn, about half of which is accounted for by oil losses. This includes production lost during and after the Iraqi occupation and the cost of repairs to oil wells and installations. Aside from war damage, there was widespread and systematic looting of private homes and businesses. About 50,000 cars were stolen, the gold souk (market) in Kuwait City was stripped and an estimated Dollars 360m worth of gold bars and foreign currency was taken from Kuwait's central bank Computers went from offices, books from schools, incubators from hospitals and spare parts from cars and factories. The reparations process is governed by the United Nations, which will scrutinise the final claims package. In all, the UN is expecting to receive 2m individual Kuwaiti claims. Each of Kuwait's government ministries is likely to file a claim. 'Most of the telecoms stations, switches, satellite equipment and so on were totally destroyed,' says Mr Asem. 'There isn't a single school that hasn't been destroyed or looted. Power substations and water facilities, museums, hospitals and libraries have all been damaged in some way. Business claims include damage and looting as well as lost earnings and opportunities. Small businesses suffered greatly.' Western loss adjustors, financial experts and lawyers are advising PAC on the claim before it is submitted to the UN, which will make the final demand against Iraq. Last year, the Kuwaiti government awarded the lucrative claims management contract to the US arm of accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick. The firm won the contract - worth tens of millions of dollars  - against competition from one of its own affiliates, KPMG Peat Marwick of the UK, which had put together a consortium bidding for the whole package. 'It caused a bit of a stir on both sides of the Atlantic,' according to a western observer in Kuwait City. 'It is such a big firm that apparently the right hand didn't know what the left was doing.' Legal advisers on the claim are Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton of the US, and Clifford Chance of London, which was originally part of the UK consortium. KPMG's staff of 90 in Kuwait City share offices with PAC, which will employ about 370 people at the height of the operation. Firms will be asked to submit new tenders for the second phase covering corporate and government damages. The claim is split, under UN guidelines, into six categories: individual expenses and losses incurred through departure from Kuwait after the invasion; death and injury; personal and private loss of less than Dollars 100,000; personal and private loss of more than Dollars 100,000; corporate claims; and government claims. The Kuwaiti authorities, and any other national governments seeking damages, have 18 months from January this year to submit their claims, although the UN is likely to be flexible about the deadline because of the size of the task. The UN has stipulated that claims made by private individuals should be processed first because of the scale of personal hardship. In particular, the Security Council has said that foreign nationals, most of whom lost everything overnight as they fled Kuwait, should be the first to get money from the UN's proposed compensation fund. Putting together the Kuwaiti claim will cost the government about Dollars 50m-Dollars 60m, money it hopes to recoup from the UN fund. Soon after the war, the Security Council told Baghdhad it would supervise Iraqi oil sales to ensure that 30 per cent of the revenues went directly into the war damages fund. Iraq is refusing to accept the UN plan. Even if Iraq pays into the fund it is likely to be several decades before all claims are paid. 'We have received assurances from the UN Security Council on the principle that Iraq, as the aggressor, should be made to pay,' says Mr Asem. 'That does not mean we can all sleep comfortably. There are still lots of uncertainties about whether Iraq will pay into the fund.' But he is sanguine about the outcome. 'This is not simply a matter of compensation. It is documentation for future generations. It is hard to make any kind of judgment about whether or not we get all the compensation we want, but this operation is something for the future.'</p>

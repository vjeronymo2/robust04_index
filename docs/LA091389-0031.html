			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KING HOSPITAL DEFICIENCIES CITED BY STATE  </P> <P> State health officials issued a 90-page report Tuesday citing serious  deficiencies in health care practices at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical  Center. The deficiencies could threaten the hospital's Medicare funding and its  state license, according to federal and state officials.  </P> <P> King, a 430-bed hospital operated by Los Angeles County in Watts, was reported  to have suffered major breakdowns in infection control, quality assurance,  nursing, dietary care, and administration by state health inspectors who spent  a week at King in June spot-checking the hospital's entire operation.  </P> <P> The inspectors cited instances in which one patient developed malnutrition  while in the hospital's care and other patients languished for hours in the  emergency room without care. Others, believed to have infectious diseases, were  not properly isolated, it was reported.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Records Misfiled  </P> <P> Equipment had fallen into disrepair, and one piece was so filthy that the odor  alerted investigators. There were cases in which drugs were left unattended,  patient records were misfiled and inexperienced nursing students were called  upon to care for acutely ill patients, according to the report.  </P> <P> Neither officials at King nor at the county Department of Health Services were  available for comment on the report.  </P> <P> The investigation was prompted by a January report commissioned by the federal  government that analyzed death rates of elderly Medicare patients and ranked  King among the bottom 50 of 5,577 hospitals nationwide.  </P> <P> Theresa Hawkes, head of licensing and certification for the state Department of  Health Services, said King will be required to submit a plan detailing how it  will correct Health and Safety Code violations. The hospital's license could be  jeopardized otherwise.  </P> <P> She said King officials will also have to answer to the federal Health Care  Finance Administration, which has the power to force corrections or, in drastic  cases, terminate a hospital's Medicare funding.  </P> <P> Peter Summers at the Health Care Finance Administration office in San Francisco  said he has not yet received the state's report, but that based on a briefing  by state health officials, he believes that the findings are significant enough  to warrant federal intervention.  </P> <P> He said state inspectors found a "major breakdown" in several key areas of  patient care. A collapse in even one of these areas can threaten a hospital's  Medicare funding.  </P> <P> "It's serious," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Series of Articles  </P> <P> Summers said his concerns about patient care at King were heightened recently  by a series of articles about the medical center that were published in The  Times.  </P> <P> "Quite frankly," Summers said, "the articles were shocking."  </P> <P> Concerned that the articles had made "serious charges of substandard health  care" at King, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors asked the county  health department last week to investigate problems at King involving "poor  administration, a lack of highly skilled medical staff and a severe shortage of  space, staff and funding to adequately deal with the hospital's increasing  patient load."  </P> <P> However, the state report took aim at the supervisors themselves for neglecting  King.  </P> <P> "Due to the amount and seriousness of the deficiencies cited in this survey,  the governing body (the Board of Supervisors) is not effectively insuring the  facility's compliance with licensing requirements and regulations, safety  procedures and federal standards for hospitals," the report said.  </P> <P> Inspectors reported that the board failed to respond in a timely manner to  correspondence from county health officials that included issues of quality  assurance at the medical center. The board was also faulted for not reviewing  hospital staff appointments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Patient Care  </P> <P> In other cases, the supervisors were not told of evaluations of patient care at  the hospital and did not hold the medical staff accountable for the quality of  that care, the report found.  </P> <P> "The minutes of the governing body which did allude to the facility by name  contained terse statements dealing only with fiscal, financial or capital  expenditure issues," the investigators noted in their report.  </P> <P> The report also noted many other problems at King which, in some cases, have  already been cited in prior reports or audits.  </P> <P> For example, the hospital's quality-assurance officials, charged with reviewing  hospital deaths and questionable occurrences, were faulted by inspectors for  having failed to take action on several unspecified "significant deficiencies."  </P> <P> As for the hospital's nursing services, a review of staffing patterns during a  two-week period showed "a consistent shortage of registered nurses," the report  said. Nursing attendants and students were routinely called upon to care for  acutely ill patients.  </P> <P> Of 40 cases sampled, inspectors cited 19 for nursing deficiencies. In one case,  a patient with pneumonia was not prescribed a nursing plan of care until the  day he died -- three days after admission.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vital Information  </P> <P> The hospital's busy emergency room was faulted for poor record-keeping in which  vital information was not kept or was improperly removed.  </P> <P> Inspectors also documented cases of apparent patient neglect in the emergency  room, including an instance where a patient with a head and lung injury  lingered six hours without any notation that he had received care.  </P> <P> In the area of infection control, the report also found numerous problems:  </P> <P> * Bedpans containing urine were found on so-called over-bed tables alongside  food trays.  </P> <P> * Infectious waste containers were overfilled and uncovered.  </P> <P> * Intravenous tubes were unlabeled with the date when treatment was initiated,  so that it was impossible to tell whether the tubes had been changed every 48  hours, as required.  </P> <P> * Tubing for connecting a patient to a ventilator was found draped over the  patient's bed five days after it had been disconnected. A suction tube nearby  was "completely coated with dark brown, dried sero-mucous material."  </P> <P> * In two rooms housing patients suspected of having tuberculosis, the doors  were found standing open with no requirement of isolation.  </P> <P> * In the isolation room of the medical intensive-care unit, the walls stopped  more than a foot short of the ceiling.  </P> <P> * Sterile supplies in one room were improperly stored below the sink drain,  some protected only with dust covers, others with a paper wrapping. The report  noted that "any malfunction of the sewerage system could result in  contamination of this material."  </P> <P> * The "morgue refrigerated holding box" had not been cleaned and appeared to  contain body fluid. The conditions raised the possibility of health risks for  personnel taking samples from cadavers stored in the box, the investigators  said.  </P> <P> As for the hospital's pharmaceutical practices, the report noted that  medications were repeatedly given without evidence of proper orders. Some  medication orders went unfilled, according to the hospital's own records, the  report revealed.  </P> <P> In repeated instances, the report said, drugs that should have been locked up  were left out and unattended. In addition, investigators found some medications  and equipment had expired as much as 15 months earlier.  </P> <P> The investigation found numerous failures to assess patients' nutritional  requirements, as is required under the hospital's own rules. Even a woman found  to have food poisoning upon admission for other conditions was never  "nutritionally assessed," according to the report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Heart Disease  </P> <P> In another case, the condition of an 88-year-old woman admitted with pneumonia,  a urinary tract infection, heart disease and numerous other conditions worsened  over two months to include anemia, dehydration and "severe malnutrition," the  report said.  </P> <P> The study noted that information on some patients had been misfiled in other  patients' records.  </P> <P> The investigators found housekeeping problems, such as dirty floors, dust and  litter in 25% of the approximately 150 rooms they visited. One piece of  equipment was so "encrusted with filth" that the stench drew the investigators'  attention.  </P> <P> In one room used for disposing of linen or trash through a chute, the  regulators found waste paper, a towel, soiled linen and a pair of men's shorts  filled with feces.  </P> <P> Other infractions reported included problems with general safety and  maintenance, including inappropriate storage of hazardous materials. The  regulators found equipment installed improperly, units poorly designed and  inadequate testing of patient-care equipment.  </P> <P> Some critical-care equipment, such as heart monitors and defibrillators, had  not been tested for approximately two years, the report stated. Five heart  monitors in the neurosurgery intensive-care unit were labeled "DO NOT USE AFTER  APRIL '89," the investigators found in their June inspection.  </P></p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Irkutsk gold row goes to conciliation THE RUSSIAN government and the local authorities in Irkutsk, the region that is home to the disputed Sukhoi Log gold deposit, have set up a conciliatory commission to work out differences over a deal giving a small Australian company a stake in the local gold producer. Mr Vladimir Dvornichenko, acting head of the regional administration, which initially supported a deal between Lenzoloto and Star Technology Systems, said on Friday that the administration had turned against the deal because the final terms were agreed without its final support. The commission was created on Monday last week after the Irkutsk authorities took the State Property Committee in Moscow to court in protest against the terms of the deal. The State Property Committee, which is responsible for managing state property and privatisation, endorsed the creation of a joint stock company in which Star would hold 31 per cent and which would include Sukhoi Log, Russia's largest hard rock deposit, among the company's assets. The conciliatory commission includes representatives of all parties concerned except for Star. 'At this stage Star is not needed. Star is a victim of, not a party to this conflict,' claimed Mr Dvornichenko. He said that he believed the commission should reconsider the inclusion of Sukhoi Log among the new company's assets, and also remove some other assets from its balance sheet. He said the commission should also seek full and clear information as how the Russian and Australian partners in the deal intended to proceed. Mr Ivan Zelent, first deputy chairman of the regional parliament, said the local authorities were divided over the issue, and that he believed a final decision should be taken by the court. 'We need to start developing the deposit as fast as possible. That will help us increase our local budget revenues.' Separately, the new company also needs to get a licence from the State Geology Committee in Moscow confirming the rights held by its Russian founder to mine Sukhoi Log, which Star previously claimed was unnecessary.</p>

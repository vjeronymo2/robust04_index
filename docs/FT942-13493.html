			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Pounds 11bn Lloyd's gap feared: Reserves warning as action by 3,000 hard-hit Names begins Lloyd's of London could have a shortfall of at least Pounds 11bn in its reserves set aside for future US asbestosis and pollution claims, a report to be published today warns. The report estimates the insurance market's total liabilities from US asbestosis and pollution at Pounds 15bn against reserves to meet those claims of about Pounds 4bn. 'Policyholders will be dismayed to learn of the modest scale of financial resources that Lloyd's has available to meet legitimate claims,' says the report, prepared by a team headed by US lawyer Mr Randolph Fields as part of a research programme under the auspices of the financial services department at London Guildhall University. Lloyd's Names, the individuals whose assets support the market, have already lost more than Pounds 7bn in the past five years and will be faced with huge extra calls on their funds, the report says. The biggest legal action by loss-making Names begins tomorrow, when a case brought by 3,095 members of syndicates formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency comes to court. Lloyd's remains confident of success for its plans to set up a new reinsurance company into which most of its asbestosis and pollution liabilities will be transferred. Mr Peter Middleton, the market's chief executive, said in Lloyd's annual report, also published today, that the company  - to be known as NewCo  - will be set up by the end of 1995, offering Names 'an exit route from Lloyd's in respect of their pre-1986 liabilities'. However the report, which is partially based on figures from about three-quarters of Lloyd's syndicates, suggests that these efforts could come to grief because of the way reserves have been treated. It had been expected that Lloyd's would seek to raise funds to capitalise NewCo by discounting an estimated Pounds 4bn in reserves held in its premium trust funds  - money set aside to meet future claims. Discounting is a common practice in the insurance industry which allows insurers to take into account investment income earned on reserves for claims which may emerge many years hence. The report, however, claims that as much as Pounds 2.8bn of the Pounds 4bn reserves is in the form of financial reinsurance due to the widespread use by many syndicates at Lloyd's of time and distance policies  - a reinsurance similar to an investment contract. In these policies a premium is paid to a reinsurer in return for the guaranteed return of the premium and a future investment income at a fixed future date. 'Thousands of Names will each be faced with meeting cash calls of up to hundreds of thousands of pounds to replace what is in effect the 'bad' money of time and distance policies with more of their own good money,' the report says. The study adds that the degree of under-reserving for old years' claims relating to asbestos and pollution claim liabilities is 'astounding', even taking into account what it calls a 'conservative' approach to estimating liabilities. Lloyd's began its own detailed work on assessing its liabilities and assets in relation to old years last year as part of its plans to establish NewCo.</p>

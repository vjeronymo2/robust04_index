			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Seeking Australia's driving seat: A look at the progress of opposition leader John Hewson ASK AN Australian what he knows about Mr John Hewson, leader of the conservative opposition, and the answer will usually come in two parts: he drives a Ferrari, and he thinks he can win a federal election by promising to introduce a new tax. It is an image which has been ruthlessly exploited by Mr Paul Keating, the embattled Labor prime minister, who never misses an opportunity to depict Mr Hewson as a rich dilettante who wants to raise taxes for ordinary people. Yet Australians are becoming increasingly aware that there is more to Mr Hewson than meets the eye. For one thing he seems a bit eccentric: he doesn't so much drive a Ferrari as keep one in his garage, mainly because he admires the marque's sense of style and engineering efficiency. Mr Keating, himself a wealthy man, has a similar passion for French Second Empire clocks. Mr Hewson hails from the same working class suburbs in western Sydney as Mr Keating. Unlike the prime minister, who left school at 14 and graduated to Labor politics via a pop group, Mr Hewson gained a PhD in economics and worked as a university teacher and merchant banker before entering parliament. However, it is his decision to commit the opposition to the introduction of a 15 per cent goods and services tax (GST), modelled on a European-style value added tax, which has attracted the heaviest fire from the government artillery. Mr Keating's portrait of a callous opposition leader unable to grasp the human impact of his computer-driven economics has had some effect, even though the prime minister's credibility is reduced by his own failed attempt to introduce such a tax in 1985. Why, many wonder, did Mr Hewson not simply sit back and wait for Labor's tired and dispirited government to collapse? The answer seems to be in two parts. First, although Labor appeared to be in deep trouble at the end of last year, there was no guarantee that the government would continue to fade until the election, which must be held by next June. The conservatives lost the last election in 1990 in spite of being widely expected to win, and a negative strategy could have allowed that to happen again. Indeed, Labor's chances have improved since Mr Keating replaced Mr Bob Hawke as prime minister in December. Mr Hewson, who leads the urban-based Liberal Party, also has to bear in mind the capacity of the National Party, his rural-based coalition partner, to self-destruct under pressure. National Party indiscipline cost the conservatives the 1987 election, when Sir Jo Bjelke-Petersen, the former Queensland premier, split the vote by mounting an independent campaign. Furthermore, Mr Hewson was convinced when he took over as opposition leader in 1990 that voters were sick of the conservatives' opportunistic changes of policy since the coalition lost power in 1983. In 1990, for example, voters went to the polls unsure what opposition policy was in the important areas of health and industrial relations. The result was 'Fightback]', a comprehensive policy statement which deliberately commits a coalition government to a detailed programme which leaves little room for doubt about what the conservatives represent. Under the coalition, protective tariffs would be virtually eliminated, the centralised industrial relations system would be abandoned in favour of collective bargaining, the government would close or privatise most of its commercial activities, and tax reform would switch the emphasis from direct to indirect taxes. The coalition would also promote the development of Australia's mineral assets, one of its main areas of comparative advantage, by reducing the delaying power of environmental and Aboriginal heritage lobbies, and removing restrictions on uranium mining. At the macro-economic level, there would be moves towards an independent central bank in an attempt to lock in low inflation. It adds up to a radical shift to the free market which would speed up and extend the tentative moves away from protection and regulation. Mr Hewson describes 'Fightback]' as an attempt to address interrelated issues comprehensively, rather than through the piecemeal initiatives which have characterised much of Labor policy-making. 'It is radical, but people have very widely accepted that there is a need for a pretty comprehensive change in Australia,' he says. 'I have always believed that good economics is good politics, and that if you advocate the right policies it is very hard to knock them over.' Nevertheless, Mr Hewson is painfully aware that the package stands or falls on his ability to communicate the core message that the GST element is essential, and that voters will be compensated. He says there is widespread understanding that direct taxes will be reduced for most taxpayers, while the coalition will also abolish seven existing indirect taxes, including payroll tax, wholesale sales tax and petroleum excise tax. The opinion polls appear to bear out this interpretation. Labor has recovered strongly since Mr Keating took over as prime minister but has been unable to shake the coalition's lead. Hearteningly for Mr Hewson, support for Labor has declined recently in the face of corruption allegations and slower economic growth. 'Fightback]' has already claimed the significant scalp of Mr Hawke, who was ousted because of his failure to respond convincingly to the coalition challenge. Mr Keating has proved a harder nut for the opposition to crack, but Mr Hewson affects a growing confidence that it can be done. 'People think Hewson has a plan for Australia, and that is what they want,' he says. 'Keating is running scared because he knows that we have the policies to do the job. All you get with Keating is a lot of colour.'</p>

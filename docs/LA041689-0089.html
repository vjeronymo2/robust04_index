			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> In a boost to the Seabrook nuclear power plant, a federal bankruptcy judge in  Manchester, N.H., refused to block low-power testing of the reactor and  approved a settlement that ensures funding until the end of the year. "It is  likely that Seabrook is ultimately going to go into commercial operation," said  Judge James Yacos in a reorganization hearing of the Public Service Co. of New  Hampshire, Seabrook's lead owner. Judge Yacos approved an agreement reached  Thursday by state officials, Public Service and its creditors ensuring that New  Hampshire ratepayers will not be charged for cleaning up Seabrook if it  conducts the atomic tests but does not operate commercially. Before the  agreement was reached, state officials had asked Yacos to delay the tests until  commercial operation is assured.  </P></p>

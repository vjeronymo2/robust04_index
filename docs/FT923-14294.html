			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: Danes see dawning of era for biorefining A biorefinery, designed to use agricultural crops for such non-food purposes as making paints, glues, plastics and other products normally based on mineral oil, has begun work in Denmark. Financed by the EC's Eclair research programme, the project - known as the Whole Crop Biorefinery Project - involves companies and research institutes from the UK, Ireland, Germany, Greece and Denmark. The hope is that biorefining will reduce environmental damage and agricultural surplus, while creating jobs. By adopting techniques similar to those used in oil refining, crops can be broken down into fibres, oils, proteins and starch. The 'raw materials' derived from purified crops can replace oil in producing paints, plastics, glues, packaging, fibre-board and chemical and pharmaceutical products. Scientists claim that manufacturing products based on crop constituents would not increase CO, sulphur and heavy metal levels in the atmosphere as much as the production of crude-oil based goods. Administrative project co-ordinator Christian Kjoller said the concept of using agricultural crops for non-food purposes had attracted increased interest during the past decade, but few products had been put to commercial use: 'The EC's grain surplus is an expensive burden. It stands to reason that we must study the possibilities of using agricultural products for other purposes. By means of biorefining, imported raw materials can be replaced by domestically produced ones and can positively influence the European balance of payments as well as employment.' The Ecu9.7m (Pounds 6.8m) project is financed by the Eclair programme, the Danish government and partners from England, Ireland, Germany, Greece and Denmark. Headed by the Bioraf Denmark Foundation, the pilot plant in Aakirkeby, Bornholm will run for three and a half years with the aim of establishing others. Kjoller stressed that expertise had been sought from five European countries and that the project would otherwise have been impossible in Denmark.</p>

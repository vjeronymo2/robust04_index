			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / United Biscuits expands to Australia: UK snack maker to buy Coca-Cola Amatil beverage group for ADollars 430m UNITED BISCUITS, Britain's largest biscuit and snack manufacturer, is to acquire the snack foods business of Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA), the Australian beverage group, for ADollars 430m (Pounds 195.5m) in cash. To help fund the purchase, UB raised about Pounds 80m by placing 24.1m new ordinary shares with institutional investors yesterday at a price of 332p. UB's shares closed at 337p, down 9p. UB said the deal was an important step in its plan to become a world leader in biscuits and snacks and would give it a strong position in Asia Pacific. CCA snacks has 56 per cent of the Australian market, which accounts for about 85 per cent of its sales. It is also brand leader in extruded snacks in Italy, where it has 27 per cent of the market, and has factories in Malaysia and Papua New Guinea. The business, to be renamed Smiths Snackfood, earned a trading profit of ADollars 36.1m on sales of ADollars 401m in the year to December. UB said it expected profits in the current year to be 8 to 10 per cent higher. The deal must be approved by Australia's Foreign Investments Review Board. The board is under pressure from economic nationalists opposed to a ADollars 209m hostile bid by Campbell Soup, the US foods group, for Arnotts, Australia's leading biscuit company. UB said it was confident its planned deal would face no such problems, as the bid was friendly and for a company already foreign-controlled. CCA, which is 51 per cent owned by Coca-Cola of the US, said the deal would allow it to concentrate on its soft drink distribution business, which has grown from four countries to eight since 1989. The sale will result in a ADollars 243m extraordinary profit for CCA. UB said it expected the deal, to be completed in January, to be non-dilutive next year and to lead to a Pounds 116m rise in group borrowings. Lex, Page 22; Market, Page 42</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Ivan Ivanov and Gennadiy </F> Talalayev]    [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin  today told journalists in the Kremlin that nobody will be able  to resolve problems linked with Bosnia without Russia. "We shall  not allow this to happen," he stressed. The president said the  Russian side would participate actively in negotiations on the  Bosnian problem in order to put an end to the war in former  Yugoslavia through negotiations.    Yeltsin told journalists after the signing of the joint  Russo- British statement on the reciprocal non-targeting of  strategic missiles, that the Bosnian problem was discussed in  detail during his negotiations with the British prime minister.  Our stands are identical on the main point -- it is necessary  to hand over to the united nations forces the heavy guns,  deployed around Sarajevo. "This measure," the president said,  "will allow us to stop the shelling of that city."    "Moreover," Yeltsin stated, "both sides have confirmed  during  the negotiations that the Bosnian problem should be resolved  primarily by peaceful means, through negotiations. This will  allow us to put an end to the war in former Yugoslavia."    Yeltsin recalled that the Bosnian problem was now being  discussed in the U.N. Security Council. "This body must issue a  mandate to the Blue Helmets to accept the guns removed from  positions around Sarajevo. This is most important," he stated.  The president believes the positions of the hostile parties in  Bosnia could be bombed only if the Blue Helmets were attacked  and called for help. "if somebody attacks the U.N. forces, he  must be punished," he stressed.    Touching on bilateral relations, Boris Yeltsin noted that  the  dynamics of their development since his visit to London was  borne out by the joint statement on the reciprocal non-targeting  of strategic nuclear missiles, signed here today, which is the  first document of this kind in the world.    The joint statement, signed by Boris Yeltsin and John Major  today, says that they would issue orders not to target at each  other the strategic nuclear missiles under their command. This  will be done not later than May 30, 1994.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: One for worldly stock-pickers - Unit Trusts / A look at the merits of Framlington's international Recovery fund - Unit trusts A WEAKNESS of UK recovery funds is that they are hit badly when recession affects the British economy. Because such funds are designed to invest in high risk stocks, returns are volatile. An international recovery fund should be able to avoid some of these problems. Although the fortunes of the world's major economies obviously are linked, it is often the case that they are out of synchronisation. Some economies (at present, the US and the UK) are recovering while others remain in recession. That should give investors a smoother ride. Framlington runs one of the few international recovery funds. In fact, for much of its life (it was set up in April 1982), the fund concentrated on just two countries - the US and the UK - where Framlington believed its expertise was concentrated. That changed when Rebecca Thomas took over as manager in 1991. She gave the fund a much wider spread and the geographical split of the assets is nowUK (38 per cent), US (32 per cent), Japan (14 per cent), Europe (12 per cent), Far East (2 per cent) and cash (2 per cent). Thomas emphasises, however, that Framlington Recovery is 'very much a stock-picking fund. We are picking the stock because of each company's potential to recover, not the economy's' With a world of stocks to choose from, the fund cannot be a one-woman show. In fact, five people make the stock selections with Thomas focusing on the UK, Antony Milford on the US, Stephen Watson on Europe, Peter Jordan on Japan and Christel de Vauman on the far East. And although the fund is worth only Pounds 50m, it has a very wide spread of holdings. 'We used to own over 200 stocks,' says Thomas. 'Now, it's down to 130.' The fund picks some stocks early in the recovery cycle: for example, buying shares in advance of the rights issue that will strengthen a company's balance sheet. Generally, it looks to hold stocks for two-three years so that it can benefit from the final phase of recovery when the shares gets the 'double whammy' of earnings growth and the re-rating of the company's price-earnings multiple. The fund's aim is to produce capital growth, and this lack of a dividend constraint allows Thomas to look at companies where the dividend has been cut. She is prepared to 'average down' her purchases if she believes in the story. 'We first bought Asda at 75p, then 44p, then 22p. The average price we paid was around 40p and the shares are now 60p.' The recovery approach means, inevitably, that there are few well-known names in the Framlington portfolio. The trust's largest 10 holdings are Renold, Hewden-Stuart, Southdown, Avon Rubber, Anchor Bancorp, BMC West Corporation, Hicking Pentecost, Matthew Clark, Shimano and American Travellers Corporation. The list contains a mix of companies where the underlying business is recovering (such as Hewden-Stuart, the UK plant hire company), or where new management has caused a revival (such as Hicking Pentecost, a textile group). The fund's long-term record is excellent. Since launch, the compound annual return to investors has been 18.8 per cent. The trust is ranked fourth of 44 in the international equity growth sector over the 10 years to October 1, with growth of 374.5 per cent (offer-to-bid with income re-invested: source Micropal). Over the one and three year periods, the trust is in the first quartile (top 25 per cent) of international equity funds, achieving growth of 48.5 and 103.1 per cent respectively. Over five years, however, the fund is just out of the top quartile, ranking 29th of 112. Thomas says the slight dip in the five year record was caused by a bad patch in 1989-90 when both the UK and US economies showed signs of slipping into recession. She adds that she under-estimated the strength of Japanese stock market and the yen over the past year, although the Japanese shares the team selected did perform well. The group has reduced its US weighting substantially over the past year, believing that the market had got ahead of itself. Thomas emphasises that the Recovery fund is not designed for those who want to track the world stock market index. And Anne McMeehan, managing director of Framlington Unit Management, says the fund is designed to add 'a bit of spice to the international investor's portfolio.' Charges. The initial is 5 per cent and the annual 1.5 per cent (increased recently from 1.25). Minimum investment is Pounds 500, or Pounds 50 a month via the savings scheme. The trust is not fully Pepable because it does not guarantee to keep more than 50 per cent of its assets in the EC. But Pounds 1,500 a year can be invested in the fund as a 'non-qualifying' Pep.</p>

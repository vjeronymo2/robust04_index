			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Companies more hopeful than Continental counterparts SMALL and medium-sized businesses in the UK are more optimistic about prospects for profitability than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe, according to a survey covering five countries, Charles Batchelor writes. Companies throughout Europe were pessimistic about the general economic outlook but UK companies were more hopeful than their counterparts in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Just over 1,400 companies were polled as part of the first five-country European Enterprise Index carried out by 3i, the venture capital company, and the Cranfield School of Management. The French businesses questioned were the least positive, both about overall conditions and their own prospects. German confidence in the economic climate had deteriorated sharply over the preceding six months, but German companies remained the most confident of those surveyed about their own future. In spite of their optimism about profits, British companies were less hopeful about prospects for increasing sales and recruiting or retaining employees. British companies' plans for capital investment and for spending on training and research and development were also less expansive. Only 15 per cent of British companies questioned said they intended to raise additional outside finance in the next six months. That compared poorly with France, where 28 per cent of companies planned fund-raising; Germany with 31 per cent; Italy 38 per cent and Spain 40 per cent. The survey also showed that wages and prices were expected to increase across Europe.

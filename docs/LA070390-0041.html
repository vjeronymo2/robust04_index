			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE FACES, PUBLIC PLACES;  </P> <P> A BRUSH WITH THE GHOSTS OF ANGELS  </P> <P> On days that the city crowds in, that the eye tires of the Los Angeles door  (bigger than the house), or the wretchedness of the street, there is a longing  to be elsewhere. The spirit pines for noises that are not man-made, for  yesteryear's language with its space between words.  </P> <P> In such a mood, one is drawn to the highway, and, as chance would have it, to  Sunland.  </P> <P> Others' corners, others' lives: how rarely we cross, shut into our cars,  blindly crawling, like ants, along our narrow paths. And, indeed, at first in  Sunland there is no sense of having traveled anywhere.  </P> <P> Bob's Big Boy, McDonald's, Sizzler, Thrifty, Payless: man's plastic logos  stretch mile upon mile. But St. Gabriel's mountains rise right behind the main  street. On clear days in downtown Los Angeles, they are distant, postcard  mountains. Here they are fierce outposts of prehistory. They defy man's  franchises and conformity.  </P> <P> How could it have been for the early settlers, arriving dusty and frightened by  train in Los Angeles from far away? Heavy-faced farmers with sickly wives,  slight, uncertain businessmen with motherless children, spinsters who had  toiled too long in offices and bachelors who had taken to hiding from life.  Their savings tied in purses hung around their necks, their hopes quickened for  finding a friendly land, a friendly climate.  </P> <P> Looking up at the implacable mountains, the familiarity of McDonalds and  Jack-in-the-Box makes more sense. How much it must have meant to those early  landsmen to find flying in this valley the same comforting Stars and Stripes  that flew in Kansas and Michigan. It is too easy to forget that in this huge  country, our memories are of traveling far and anxiously, looking always for  signs of welcome.  </P> <P> All that was here then -- all that God had left -- were rocks and a stubborn  soil, brush and rattlesnakes. Fires that burned for seven days. Floods that  poured boulders and stones down through the canyons. What courage the newcomers  had to bring to life vineyards and orchards here.  </P> <P> Signs of those old-timers are few, on the surface: some olive trees survive  down by the Big Tujunga wash where, for years, a famous olive bottling factory  stood. There is a home or two built of rocks carried from the wash, the smell  of sage, the sound of wind blowing, of bird calls carrying far out by the  canyon; slowly the past takes shape.  </P> <P> Along the back streets of Sunland, there is an ease that most of us have  forgotten. Chickens scratch, children run from yard to yard; the notices are  for dogs found, not dogs lost. In the bar of Sterlings restaurant, old and worn  with bald red plush and deep, mid-day darkness, the men and women drinking at  the bar do not even turn a head as the stranger enters. Few in the city have  such confidence.  </P> <P> In the Salvation Army thrift shop, 30 and 40 years of history lie in bins and  hang on racks. In this enormous cave are familiar old plastic cups and saucers,  fussy lamps and desks, forgotten records, china puppies, teddy bears and dolls,  squirrel boleros and spindly tables. It is as though 1959 had been frozen here  -- as though each of the old TVs, if turned on, would show President Eisenhower  at peace.  </P> <P> Next door is another thrift shop, an Aladdin's cave of vintage clothing. Out  front are the '50s and '60s, lovingly preserved and pressed. Poodle skirts,  straw hats with veils, long white gloves. Sandra Dee prom frocks. Jackie  Kennedy pillboxes to perch on beehives. Petticoats and taffeta, crepe and net.  </P> <P> On weekends, they come here from the city to put together fashion outfits, club  costumes -- the world of dazzle and lightly tended money. During the week,  locals come in -- fingering the chiffon shyly, smiling wistfully at  narrow-waisted strapless dresses, hearts fluttering under shapeless 2X shirts  at reminders of young and slender days.  </P> <P> In a back room, behind a beaded curtain, a "museum" has been created. The  finest outfits on sale, from a century and half a century ago: top hats, rich  velvets, boa jackets, feather-light silk knickers, flapper hats with peacock  feathers, flowing crepe tea gowns. Costume museums show less than this.  </P> <P> It is the old clothes, the very old ones, that work the strongest spell.  Visiting outfits from the turn of the century, white lace summertime dresses,  handmade with lace trimmings saved from dress to dress, a poke bonnet of  velvet, a black-beaded dress covered with tucks and pleats, topped with ruched  balloon sleeves. Who sewed these perfect, minute stitches? Whose hands turned  the seams by kerosene lamplight in the nights of those hot, hard summers? The  clothes are small -- how short and fragile were these women who held themselves  upright through heat, despair, temptation. Their spirits linger here, for these  are the clothes they saved, the ones they laid away in dried flowers and  memories.  </P> <P> We do not have to travel far; we simply have to pay attention.  </P></p>

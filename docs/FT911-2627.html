			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / UK Gilts: Bank's auction allays fears of flood TWO FACTORS have emerged to dominate the gilts market. The pound has become collateral damage in the war between the dollar and the D-Mark; and it appears that public spending is running out of control again when the government is already committed to raising up to Pounds 1bn a month through gilts. All this took place last week against the building suspense about exchange and interest rates at the Group of Seven meeting in Washington; the sudden angry eruptions about the 'somewhat home-grown' recession by MPs of all persuasions and right-wing industrialists and company directors; and a highly-successful auction - four-and-a-half times subscribed - of Pounds 1.2bn of the 10 per cent Conversion stock due in 1996. These singularly busy conditions set the tone for a week in which, surprisingly, the market rose right across the yield curve until late on Friday. Then - much in the same way as a big Middle East sell order drove down the pound the day before - a large domestic sale took a point off prices of long-dated gilts. The earlier springiness owed much to the outright success of the Bank of England's auction, which defied doomsters' predictions that an over-abundance of new gilts would flood the market and depress prices. Instead it proved, to the authorities' relief, that there remained an unsatisfied demand for gilts of up to Pounds 3.5bn after the auction. This suggested that the funding programme for the predicted Pounds 8bn public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in 1991-92 might go more smoothly than officials have dared to hope. Although the auction eased technical concerns about the funding programme and investors' appetite for gilts, other anxieties started to build. Sterling's weakness has kept the short end of the market on hold. Although talk of a sterling crisis was overdone last week, the pound started looking vulnerable to the dollar and even had sand kicked in its face by the D-Mark, the weakling of the foreign exchanges. This has retarded hopes of interest rate cuts. Sterling last week slipped briefly to the bottom of its grid in the European exchange rate mechanism, perhaps causing a few grey hairs at the Bank of England. The authorities have announced a pause in their efforts to bring down rates to give the pound the space to settle after the cuts from 14 to 12 per cent. This rules out more cuts for now, as sterling is not looking strong enough. Diminishing prospects of cuts does, however, help the longer end. Mr Nigel Richardson, of Warburg Securities, says: 'The longer base rates are kept up, the better the long end does, as the recession gets deeper and the prospects for lower underlying inflation improve.' Then there are the public spending worries, which are just as bad for sterling and gilts - and never absent for very long from the market. As soon as Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced the PSBR forecast for this year, analysts started deriding it as too low. Even before the most recent shenanigans over the financing of local government, the chancellor's funding arithmetic was reckoned to be on the optimistic side. Sterling bond analysts expect higher spending on unemployment - likely to top 2.3m this year - and other recession-induced outlays to enlarge the PSBR. The Treasury last week said the Pounds 3.5bn reserve would be drawn down by Pounds 640m to finance higher pay for the armed forces, health service employees, employment training schemes and child benefit. But its public spending forecast of Pounds 205bn remained intact. The actual PSBR outcome remains the subject of speculation. But today's research paper by Mr Simon Briscoe, of Greenwell Montagu, says there will be high levels of local authority borrowing for the next three years as the government attempts to minimise individual tax burdens while the authorities raise spending. Although this could make the PSBR balloon, last week's auction suggests it might not shock the gilts market, which appears to be ready for more stock. The tap stock of 9 per cent due in 2008, priced two points higher than the market, could be snapped up quickly.</p>

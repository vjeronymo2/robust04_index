			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: View on Apec is a classic example of 'Eurocentrism' Sir, I suspect that your leader, 'Apec and Europe' (November 16), will have engendered a considerable amount of mirth among businesses and governments in Asia and the Pacific. After claiming rather patronisingly that 'any kind of discriminatory arrangement within so large a part of the world's economy would be undesirable', you suggest that 'Apec should be a catalyst for global negotiations and neither a substitute for such negotiations, nor an independent forum'. Good heavens, no. After all, you then add 'the only outside entity capable of insisting upon this is the EU', and we all know how deeply the EU is committed to free trade: ask the Cairns group. Your leader is a classic example of what we poor countries in Asia and the Pacific sometimes call 'Eurocentrism'. Dr Mahathir, prime minister of Malaysia, is trying to make a point, you know; perhaps one day you will understand it.

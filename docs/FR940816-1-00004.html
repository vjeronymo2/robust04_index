			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 22(g)(4) of the FRA provides that extensions of credit to an executive officer not otherwise specifically authorized by section 22(g) may be made ``in an amount prescribed in a regulation of the member bank's appropriate Federal banking agency''. Pursuant to its authority under section 22(g)(4), the Board of Directors of the FDIC has set the lending limit on extensions of credit by insured nonmember banks to executive officers for any other purpose not specified in &sect;215.5(c)(1) and (2) of Regulation O at the higher of 2.5 percent of the bank's capital and unimpaired surplus but in no event more than $100,000. See 12 CFR 337.3(c)(2). The Board of Directors of the FDIC now proposes to except loans which are fully collateralized by certain categories of highly stable and liquid collateral from being counted toward the ``other purpose'' general lending limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. The Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board of Directors of the FDIC proposes to create an exception to the lending limit for other purpose loans to executive officers for those loans which are fully secured by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) A perfected security interest in bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, or Treasury bills of the United States or in other such obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Unconditional takeout commitments or guarantees of any department, agency, bureau, board, commission or establishment of the United States or any corporation wholly owned directly or indirectly by the United States; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) A perfected security interest in a segregated deposit account in the lending bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the proposed exception is adopted, a loan to an executive officer of an insured nonmember bank which has been secured by any of the types of collateral listed above may be made in any amount and will not be subject to the limit for other purpose loans set forth in 12 CFR 337.3(c)(2). This exception will be in addition to the statutory exceptions to the other purpose lending limit for home mortgage loans and education loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the opinion of the Board of Directors of the FDIC that the creation of such an exception to the general lending limit on loans to executive officers of insured nonmember banks is consistent with safe and sound banking practices. This is because the Board of Directors believes that extensions of credit which have been collateralized in the manner described above pose a minimal risk of loss to a bank. The Board of Directors of the FDIC is also of the opinion that the proposed exception would not lend itself to abuse because the collateralized loans to executive directors would still continue to be subject to the requirement that the loan not be on more favorable terms than those afforded other borrowers (section 22(g)(1) of the FRA) and would still be subject to the prohibitions against preferential lending in section 22(h) of the FRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes parallel changes recently made by the Board of Governors of the FRS to its regulations. See 59 FR 8831 (1994). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Board of Directors is proposing to adopt the same exception to the limit for other purpose loans to executive officers that the Board of Governors of the FRS promulgated for member banks in order to put insured state nonmember banks on an equal footing with state member banks, thus avoiding disparity of treatment among banks based upon their membership, or lack of membership, in the Federal Reserve System.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Along with the new exception to the general lending limit on loans to executive officers, the Board of Governors of the FRS made a number of other substantive, technical and conforming changes to 12 CFR Part 215, Regulation O. These changes were effective on February 18, 1994. See 59 FR at 8831. These changes became applicable to insured nonmember banks on February 18, 1994, without any need for action on the part of the FDIC because insured nonmember banks are subject to the regulations of the FRS which implement section 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA, with the exception of the provisions which implement section 22(g)(4). For a comprehensive discussion of these changes, see 59 FR at 8831&hyph;8837.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted before, it is the responsibility of each federal banking agency under section 22(g)(4) to specify the limit on other purpose loans to executive officers of the depository institutions which are subject to a particular banking agency's supervision. The FDIC specifies the limit on other purpose loans to executive officers of insured nonmember banks in 12 CFR 337.3(c)(2). Prior to the most recent amendments to Regulation O, &sect;215.5(c)(3) specified the limit on other purpose loans to executive officers by member banks. 12 CFR 215.5(c)(3) was amended by the Board of Governors of the FRS to provide that a loan may be made by a member bank to one of its executive officers in any amount if it has been secured by certain types of collateral. The Board of Governors of the FRS concurrently redesignated the provision which sets forth the limit for other purpose loans by member banks to their executive officers as 12 CFR 215.5(c)(4). 59 FR at 8840&hyph;8841. In light of these regulatory changes by the FRS, the Board of Directors of the FDIC proposes to amend &sect;337.3 to cross-reference &sect;215.5(c)(4), along with &sect;215.5(c)(3), as one of the provisions of Regulation O which are inapplicable to insured nonmember banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Requests for Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board of Directors specifically requests comment from all interested parties as to whether it is appropriate for the FDIC to establish an exception to the limit on other purpose loans to executive officers of insured nonmember banks for loans that have been collateralized in the manner described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

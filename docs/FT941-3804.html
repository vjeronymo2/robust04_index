			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Unions cut links with Hosokawa partners A fresh crack appeared in the structure of Japanese politics yesterday, when four unions, representing 1.8m voters, cut links with the Social Democratic party. This opens the way for more switching of alliances in Premier Morihiro Hosokawa's seven-party coalition, in which the Socialist party is the largest member. The unions, representing teachers, municipal, telecom and postal workers, are members of the 8m-strong Rengo union federation, which has always backed the SDP. Unions say they want the freedom to support liberal politicians from the coalition and opposition Liberal Democratic party, to help create a new centre-left grouping. This is a stage in the realignment of Japan's politics pushed on by the recent parliamentary passage of plans to reform the political system. The coalition and LDP are expected to evolve into two to three groupings to fight a general election under the new rules late this year or early next. The LDP yesterday relaunched its campaign to destabilise Mr Hosokawa. It is blocking parliamentary debate on next year's budget until he fully discloses alleged dealings with Sagawa Kyubin, a trucking company involved in a political corruption scandal. Mr Hosokawa has admitted he borrowed Y100m (Pounds 641,000) from Sagawa 10 years ago, but repaid this with interest by 1991. He denies LDP allegations he illegally used the cash in an election, and says this was a private loan. The LDP budget blockage is causing disquiet at the Finance Ministry, which has warned it may not be able to deliver Mr Hosokawa's recent tax cuts without a budget for the fiscal year starting at the end of this month.</p>

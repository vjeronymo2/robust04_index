			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hochtief advances 42% to DM284m HOCHTIEF, one of Germany's largest construction companies, demonstrated how the building sector is defying Germany's economic gloom as it announced yesterday that net profits rose 42 per cent to DM284m (Dollars 180m) last year. Mr Hans-Peter Keitel, chief executive, said the downturn in the economy had started to have an effect on business in western Germany. But, he said, this was more than outweighed by the construction boom in the east of the country. Describing the 1992 result as 'exceptionally pleasing,' Mr Keitel said that Hochtief could continue to be confident about the future. Earnings for the first four months of the current year were at the same high level as in the same period last year and he expected full-year earnings for 1993 to match the 1992 result. Orders climbed 7.3 per cent to DM8.6bn last year, a modest change which conceals a 32 per cent increase in domestic orders and a 35 per cent drop in orders outside Germany. Despite Mr Keitel's optimism about the future, he expressed scepticism about the government's ability to attract investment into eastern Germany. Hochtief is majority-owned by RWE, the Ruhr-based energy conglomerate, but a minority of its shares is listed.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Opposition backtracks on N-bomb: Pakistani fears grow of fresh international criticism Pakistan's opposition Moslem League party yesterday tried to backstep from a statement by Mr Nawaz Sharif, its leader, who had claimed Islamabad had produced nuclear weapons. His comments, at a rally in Kashmir on Tuesday, sparked fears of fresh international criticism against Pakistan, which has been suspected of producing nuclear weapons for the past decade. Last week, Pakistan was accused of involvement in an effort to smuggle weapons-grade plutonium out of Germany. Islamabad denies the charge. Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir which both nations say belongs to them. They came near a third war in 1990, and many fear that any future battle could quickly escalate into a nuclear exchange. Like India, Pakistan is believed to have all the necessary components for a bomb and the ability to assemble one in a matter of days or even hours. Pakistan's military and political leaders say the nuclear programme is necessary to deter its arch-rival India. But successive governments, including Mr Sharif's, have maintained the country has stopped short of building a bomb. Mr Sharif refused to answer questions from journalists after a three-hour meeting of his party's top leaders in Islamabad yesterday. Instead, Mr Chaudhary Shujaat Hussain, an opposition senator, accused the government of Ms Benazir Bhutto of 'exploiting the issue surrounding Mr Sharif's statement, to divert attention from a planned opposition campaign next month'. But some officials privately suspected Mr Sharif had sparked the controversy possibly in an effort to seek public support, especially from nationalists, ahead of the anti-government protest planned to begin in about three weeks. Others, however, suggested he had probably miscalculated the sensitivity of the issue. 'Sharif must now be thinking it was wrong to make such a statement in public. The nuclear (proliferation) issue can be extremely testy in the west,' one senior western diplomat said last night. Meanwhile, the Pakistani government lashed out at the opposition leader and reiterated its claim that the country's nuclear programme was only for peaceful purposes. 'He (Mr Sharif) has taken it on himself to topple the government at all costs, even if it's at the cost of the national interest,' Mr Sardar Asseff Ahmed Ali, foreign minister, declared in an interview on state television last night. 'We do not intend to make nuclear weapons. 'His (Sharif's) remarks are based on total fabrication,' he added.</p>

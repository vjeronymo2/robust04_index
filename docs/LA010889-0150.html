			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUCE CALL BACKFIRES;  </P> <P> ARAB MAYOR CALM IN FACE OF THREATS  </P> <P> Mayor Elias Freij pulled an opulent woolen kaftan over his street clothes and  assured a visitor that his only worry for the moment was his heater. It had  broken down, and the wind that whips across Bethlehem this time of year had  chilled his house enough to make him shiver.  </P> <P> One might have suspected that Freij, who styles himself "the world's best-known  mayor," might have other preoccupations. The Christian Arab mayor's call for a  truce between rebellious Palestinians and the occupying Israeli army had  brought criticism and danger almost to his door.  </P> <P> Graffiti on walls just a few blocks from his home scolded "Shame on Freij" and  threatened "Death to Traitors." Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestine  Liberation Organization, in an apparent reference to Freij, said last week that  any Palestinian who calls for an end to the Arab uprising against Israel  "exposes himself to the bullets of his own people."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Bodyguards  </P> <P> Freij dismissed the threats with what might be called enthusiastic calm. "You  don't see any bodyguards here, do you? You were able to come right in. My house  is open, as you see," he told the visitor Friday. "I'm not in hiding. I'm at  home."  </P> <P> Indeed, there was less security than is usual for the elderly mayor; no one  bothered to stop intruders at the gate who, contrary to custom, were able to  enter without identifying themselves.  </P> <P> But for all his devil-may-care tranquillity, Freij was careful to point out  that, in the wake of Arafat's words and the threatening scrawls, he had  withdrawn his proposal for a truce between Israel and Palestinians, one that  would have effectively ended the uprising while some form of negotiation takes  place.  </P> <P> "I made my views clear. I stand by every word I say. But if the PLO says it is  not time for a truce, then I withdraw my suggestion," he said.  </P> <P> A cautionary tale lies in Freij's proposal, the resulting threats and his rapid  pullback. For all the talk of moderation within the PLO, old habits die hard.  And because diplomatic advances by the PLO, especially with the United States,  depend on the organization's renunciation of terror, the PLO's words and  actions are under unusual scrutiny.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sharp Reaction by Shultz  </P> <P> Following Arafat's indirect threat, Secretary of State George P. Shultz  responded sharply. In comments to reporters, Shultz reminded Arafat that  renunciation of terrorism could not be selective if Washington was expected to  maintain contact with the PLO.  </P> <P> "The statement that (Arafat) made, and we were very clear about it, was not a  statement 'I renounce all terrorism except in Israel or the West Bank.' It was  a renunciation of terrorism -- period," Shultz said.  </P> <P> Israeli officials saw Arafat's comment as proof that the PLO's new, moderate  image is superficial and reminded everyone that Palestinians who in any way  cross the PLO are subject to assassination.  </P> <P> While Arafat quickly lashed out at the call for a truce, he has yet to respond  to Arab groups that press for greater violence in the occupied West Bank and  Gaza Strip with the aim of expelling Israel.  </P> <P> Since the PLO declared the existence of a vaguely defined, independent  Palestinian state prepared to coexist with Israel, at least three groups in the  West Bank and Gaza have publicly opposed such a notion: Hamas, an Islamic  fundamentalist movement based in Gaza but with growing support on the West  Bank; the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a faction of the PLO  that opposed Arafat's proclaimed moderation but that stayed within the  organization, and a new, amorphous alliance of pro-Syrian, anti-Arafat groups.  </P> <P> All such groups want a state of Palestine to encompass all territory between  the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. So far, these foes of Arafat have  expressed themselves only through leaflets and the occasional call for wildcat  commercial strikes.  </P> <P> Danger cannot be discounted. On Saturday, a local leader in the West Bank  village of Qubeiba, near Ramallah, was stabbed to death by a mob of Muslim  fundamentalists, Palestinian sources said. The killers accused the leader,  Mahmoud Abdallah Hamoudah, of collaborating with Israeli authorities and  advising villagers to carry on normal business on protest strike days.  </P> <P> More than a dozen suspected collaborators have been killed by Palestinians  during the 13-month-old uprising.  </P> <P> Freij off-handedly plays down the threat to himself. "So what?" he advised.  "There are extremists in any situation."  </P> <P> With a diplomacy honed during 17 years of survival as a Palestinian politician,  Freij added: "The PLO is our leadership. Anyone else must support the PLO."  </P> <P> But why should the PLO be the only representative for the Palestinians? "The  PLO is recognized by foreign governments and the Arab world as our leader. They  have freedom of action. Where we live, we are exposed to arrest and expulsion.  Only the PLO can act freely on our behalf," he said.  </P> <P> He arose to prepare himself for one of his customary duties -- the reception of  Christian patriarchs celebrating the Epiphany, Jesus's revelation to the  nations of the world through the Three Kings.  </P> <P> "You know, it is hard to be in the spotlight. You have to watch every step,  every word, jealously," he said.  </P></p>

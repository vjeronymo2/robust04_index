			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>   [Text] Israel hopes that last night's operation will shed  a little light on the fate of captive navigator Ron Arad.  According to Israeli intelligence data, the last person known  with certainty to have held Arad prisoner was Mustafa al-Dirani.    In the assessment of Israeli officials, al-Dirani turned the  navigator over to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in exchange  for money. The captive navigator's fate has been unknown ever  since and no information has been received on this matter. In  this sense, the aim of last night's kidnapping operation was to  glean more information that could help reveal Ron Arad's  location. Al-Dirani was captured by a commando force for  interrogation purposes and in the future he could conceivably  serve as a bargaining chip.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin decided to approve the  operation  with the recommendation of Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq, the head  of the Shin Bet, and other senior security officials. On  Thursday [19 May], the matter was brought before the Ministerial  Committee on National Security Affairs. The ministers were  asked to maintain total secrecy. Not all the cabinet ministers  knew about the operation, even after it had taken place this  morning.    A senior political source said that if al-Dirani's  interrogation corroborated the information Israel already  possessed according to which Ron Arad had been turned over to  the Revolutionary Guards, Iran would no longer be able to deny  any connection to this affair.    Approximately one month ago, in the framework of a  conference  in Bucharest, I asked Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati why Iran continued to hold navigator Ron Arad prisoner?    [Begin recording] [Segal, in English] Why is your country,  Iran, still holding the Israeli POW Ron Arad?    [Velayati, in English] I do not know how much this is  related to the present discussion that we have, but I  catagorically deny that there is any prisoner from Israel in  Iran.    Jerusalem says that last night's operation proves to the  Israeli people and all the families that the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] and the government continue their efforts. The soldiers  risked their lives and carried out a raid against a tough target  hundreds of kilometers from Israel in a difficult area under  Syrian control north of the Beirut-Damascus road. Officials in  Jerusalem said that this proved that Israel was doing everything  to help its soldiers held captive behind enemy lines.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Secret selection of judges 'is farcical' THE SYSTEM of appointing judges is 'bizarre and farcical', Lord Williams QC, chairman of the Bar, said at the Law Society's annual conference in Birmingham. The judiciary suffers from 'pointless secrecy - the curse of this country - and over-defensiveness', he added. Lord Williams explained that when barristers applied to be assistant recorders - the first step on the road to the High Court bench - a secret file was opened on them. 'You don't know what is in it,' he said. 'You don't know which of your dear friends have contributed. The cruellest error may be in it. You cannot put it right. It is carefully kept under lock and key by a graduate from the Franz Kafka school of business management.' Lord Williams said he had recently suggested to the Lord Chancellor that anyone who was the subject of such a file should be allowed to ask for it to be reviewed by the Bar chairman. 'You will be amazed to hear the answer was no,' he told the conference. He also attacked the training of judges as 'lamentably scanty'. A High Court judge received no training after appointment and circuit judges had a week-long seminar once every five years. This was 'quite simply not good enough', he said.</p>

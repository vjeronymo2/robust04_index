			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 7 SAPA -- Mr Arthur Chaskalson has  been appointed president of the Constitutional Court. This was  announced on Tuesday [7 June] by the minister of justice, Mr  Dullah Omar.    Mr Chaskalson, an honorary professor of law at Witwatersrand  University since 1981, was a member of the Technical Committee  on Constitutional Issues appointed in may last year to advise  the multi-party negotiation forum which drafted South Africa's  interim constitution.    Born in Johannesburg on November 24 1931, he is also a  former  long-standing member of the National Council of Lawyers for  Human Rights and has been a consultant to the African National  Congress on constitutional issues since April 1990.    Mr Omar told a news conference in Cape Town that Mr  Chaskalson was one of South Africa's most distinguished  advocates and enjoyed international recognition and standing as  a jurist.    Mr Omar also announced the composition of the Judicial  Service Commission which is to recommend six of the  Constitutional Court's 10 judges.    It is: Chief Justice Michael Corbett; Mr Chaskalson; the  senior judge president, Mr Justice J A Howard; Mr Omar himself;  Professor Etienne Mureinik; Senators I W Direko, E S Mchunu, B T  Nqcuka and Ray Radue; Adv David Gordon, SC [senior counsel]; Adv  George Bizos SC; Adv Kgomotso Moroka; and Mr J Ernstzen, a trade  unionist.    Mr Omar said the further names of two practising advocates  and two practising attorneys would be announced once different  positions adopted by the Association of Law Societies and the  General Council of the Bar, on the one hand, and the National  Association of Democratic Lawyers, on the other, had been  resolved.    He hoped this would occur "so as to enable the chief justice  to proceed with the convening of the first meeting of the  Judicial Service Commission".    Mr Omar pointed out that in terms of Section 99 of the  interim constitution, four Supreme Court judges are to be  appointed to the Constitutional Court by President Nelson  Mandela in consultation with the cabinet and with the chief  justice.    In addition to recommending judges and related judicial  matters, the Judicial Service Commission would also play an  important role in the rationalisation process flowing from South  Africa being divided into nine provinces.</p>

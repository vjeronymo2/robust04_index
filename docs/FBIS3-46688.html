Former Shimizu Vice Chairman Hiroyuki Koyama gave the money  to Otsuka in December 1990 after he persuaded a building lease  company to drop its objection to the redevelopment of a  5.9-hectare area in Tokyo's Nagatacho District, the sources said.    The lease company yielded to pressure from Otsuka, 64, whose  Tokyo No. 1 constituency in the House of Representatives is home  to the company, they said.    Shimizu, which won a consulting contract with nine corporate  land owners in the area, had to secure the consent of the  building lease company, which owned land inside the area covered  by the redevelopment project.    The redevelopment project received official authorization  from the Tokyo metropolitan government in April 1993. The  project will be completed around 2000.    After Otsuka managed to persuade the company to drop its  objection, Koyama delivered the 3 million yen to Otsuka, the  sources said.    Koyama was indicted last October on charges of giving a 10  million yen bribe to former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi to  secure public works contracts.    Otsuka's political office declined to comment on the  allegation. Otsuka, who served as construction minister from  December 1990 to November 1991 in the Cabinet of then Prime  Minister Toshiki Kaifu, lost his Diet seat in last July's  general election.    A Shimizu Corp. executive in charge of the project told  KYODO  NEWS SERVICE, "our company has not submitted any request to  former Construction Minister Otsuka in connection with the  project, although we have donated a small amount to him in the  annual summer and year-end gift-giving seasons."</p>

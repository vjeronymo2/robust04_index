			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Justinian: No longer a natural alliance Lawyers are innately conservative, but will they generally be voting for the present administration at the general election? Numerically, it may not matter. In this country there is still not quite the proliferation of lawyers that pervades the public scene in the United States. But British lawyers' voting habits may reflect the mood of the professional classes as they go to the polls on April 9. Historically, the training of lawyers was geared to the established order; law reform was barely considered a separate subject for debate. The law faculties of the older universities were once aptly described as 'encrusted with heavy-footed traditionalists'. But that is very much a thing of the past. The products of that age have virtually disappeared from bench and bar. Today a student can choose to be trained in law and expect to be an effective voice for human rights. Even though the law graduate today is imbued with the idea of public service, nevertheless the practising profession derives its profitability from commercial clients. It is doubtful whether or not lawyers take their 'ethics, economics and political ideas from the banker'. Certainly, however, there is a tendency for lawyers practising exclusively for City merchants to take on the political leanings of their clients. But there is more to the practice of law nowadays than acting for the moneyed classes. The spread of legal practice into fields that concern not property but human values has created a new brand of lawyer with political attitudes that do not necessarily reflect his or her professional tag. Lawyers have become more a part of the body politic. There is less evidence of the progression from one monastic order to another: prep school to public school to Oxbridge and on to the Temple. Still, if heads had been counted, the profession would have been largely putting its X against the Conservative candidate's name - at least until the recent past. Such a confident prediction would have been misplaced at any time since 1987. The assault upon the restrictive practices of the profession by the Thatcher administration has produced some profound shifts in allegiance. A moment's recounting of the recent history tells all. When the Labour administration of the late 1970s set up the Royal Commission on the legal profession under the chairmanship of Lord Benson, the profession regarded the move predictably as the left's instinctive dislike of the legal profession and its well-heeled members. It therefore set to, and mounted a massive defence of its status in society and its practices. When the Royal Commission reported, the profession got a virtual clean bill of health. It consequently wallowed in its evident success and proceeded to sit back and rest on its laurels. The defeat of the Labour government in 1979 simply confirmed the view that all was well, so long as there was no return of a Labour government. And even that was not too unwelcome a prospect, since there would be little likelihood of a rerun of Benson this side of the 21st century. Imagine, therefore, the horror with which the proposals of the Lord Chancellor were met after the 1987 election, resulting in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. In the course of the parliamentary process, the profession was able to chip away at some of the more radical reforms proposed by Lord MacKay, but the legislation jolted the profession out of its supposed immunity from the politician. The revulsion expressed at this legislative monstrosity was led by the higher judiciary, with the famous Friday debate in the House of Lords when the Lord Chief Justice spoke vehemently against the proposals, using language illustrative of the most vigorous assault on extreme authoritarianism. Although there has been some retreat from such outright opposition in the last two years, the scars of the battle are still visible. What the profession could not stomach was that all this was being done in the name of the Conservative party. It was not uncommon during the late 1980s to hear senior members of the profession vowing that they would abandon their life-long allegiance to Toryism. Some would abstain. Others were declared supporters of the Alliance in 1987. It was particularly noticeable that The Independent had increasingly become the daily newspaper fare in place of The Times, reflecting a shift in political attitude. Today it is not possible to predict how lawyers would vote in an actual poll. Certainly the mould of natural alliance between lawyers and right-of-centre politics (the profession rarely produced anyone on the extreme right) has been broken. While a majority of lawyers would tend to favour a party which protected individual property rights, they would not all be fearful of a Labour government. Perhaps that is as much a result of the Labour party moving closer to the centre of politics than of disenchantment with the Conservative party. At least lawyers nowadays generally opt for the median - and that may mean a vote for a candidate from any of the three parties, depending on the parliamentary constituency.</p>

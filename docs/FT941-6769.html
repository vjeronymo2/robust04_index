			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (2): Interest rates hit 50 per cent The government says tackling inflation is its main priority. If some Jamaicans are sceptical, it is because the government failed to stay the course back in 1991-92. Then, with an eye apparently on the election last March, it relaxed monetary and fiscal policy and attempted to peg the exchange rate to the dollar. The inflation battle resumed in earnest in the middle of last year, although a subsequent slide in the value of the Jamaican dollar gave inflation another boost. The main weapon has been a tight monetary policy which has pushed interest rates to more than 50 per cent. The prime minister has promised to balance this stringency with a more restrictive fiscal policy. Mr Davies says fiscal policy is already tight - but 'I want to be able to do better with the fiscal surplus.' Among other things, he says he will try to improve the government's ability to monitor government departments' spending. According to Mr Patterson, the prime minister, one consequence of this will be a clamp-down on rises in public sector pay following big increases last year. 'In the last fiscal year, substantial increases were paid to the public sector partly because of the need to reduce disparities with the private sector. There is simply no way in which we can afford these levels of pay rises in 1994-95,' he says. There will also be a continuation of the government's privatisation programme. After the sale of four sugar mills last year, the government is also aiming to privatise the national airline, Air Jamaica, the Jamaican state electricity company, the oil refinery and the railway, and to pass some functions of the water authority to the private sector. Yet some critics of the government reckon its deeds are less impressive than its rhetoric. 'The general thrust, if you go by what the government says, has been quite good. Things have worked out differently in practice,' says Mr Charles Ross, executive director of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica. He believes fiscal policy is still not strong enough. Publicly-owned companies, he says, are still on too slack a leash, able to reschedule debts unilaterally, for example, and to borrow to pay wages. Moreover, Mr Ross says that if the government's net repayment of debt is factored into the calculation, it is in fact running a deficit, rather than a surplus, which may be as high as 5-6 per cent of GDP. The finance minister counters by saying that Jamaica follows international conventions in ignoring debt amortisation in its calculations. Moreover, tax receipts tend to be too heavily concentrated in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year - the first quarter of the calendar year. This means that the deficit intra-year, financed by the Jamaican central bank and thereby fuelling excess demand, can be extremely high. Employment by the public sector has been reduced by some 20 per cent in the last few years. In the view of some, too much of this has been achieved by shaving the workforce in each department instead of making a fundamental spending reassessment. A further constraint in reducing public spending has been the high proportion of the government budget - more than 40 per cent - swallowed up by servicing internal and external debt. Jamaica has benefited from debt forgiveness from foreign government creditors. However, it wants the concessional terms extended to the poorest countries by the Paris Club of creditor governments to be widened to include it. Although its requests have so far been unsuccessful, the perception of Jamaica's creditworthiness in international financial markets has improved as prices for the government's debt in the secondary market have risen significantly - helped not only by the generally rising market in the debt of most Latin American and Caribbean countries, but also by the clearing of arrears on trade payments that existed in the late 1980s.</p>

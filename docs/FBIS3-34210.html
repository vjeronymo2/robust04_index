			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Muhammad Husni Mubarak has announced his  approval of Defense Minister Marshal Muhammad Husayn Tantawi's  request to increase the capital of the Fighters Care Fund from  50 to 100 million pounds. He said that the fighters are among  the sectors that deserve the state's care, noting that these  funds do not come from the state's budget but from the Armed  Forces National Projects Service Department.    The announcement came during President Mubarak's meeting  with  the officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers of the  central military zone.    President Mubarak arrived at the Military Sports Center in  Manshiyat al-Bakri at 1005 today and was received by Defense  Minister Marshal Muhammad Husayn Tantawi; Chief of Staff  Lieutenant General Salah Halabi; the commanders of the air, sea,  and air defense forces; and Staff Major General 'Uthman Shahin,  commander of the central military zone.    [Begin Mubarak recording] In the name of God, the  compassionate, the merciful. Happy year to you. I am always  pleased when I meet with our brothers and sons from the Armed  Forces because I spent most of my life in the Armed Forces. I  learned and was trained in the Armed Forces.    I had not thought of delivering a speech at today's meeting  but I thought I should seize this opportunity to speak about  issues and problems that concern you as a group of citizens and  as an important and disciplined group of the people. I asked  myself: What issues do our brothers and sons want to hear? I  received several questions on local and foreign issues. I will  speak to you frankly on every issue except those that affect the  public interest, since I try not to enter into the latter's  details at such a big gathering.    Speaking about local affairs, one question is: One of your  excellency's instructions to the government is to pay attention  to slums and to control them. Are there resources available for  achieving this in the near future, especially given that it  might be difficult to develop some of these areas? The slums  issue began in the sixties and has continued to grow. People  left the countryside for the cities, specifically Cairo and  Alexandria. The problem grew and buildings were constructed  without permission, without planning. Frankly, I could not pull  down the slum areas under the previous conditions because, as  you know, our economic situation in the early eighties was such  that no funds were available. We did not even have resources.  We could barely provide bread. You might remember that we held  an economic conference in 1982 to see where we were going and  what we were going to do about our economy, which is the  people's livelihood. World prices rose sharply after the  October 1973 war, including oil. Our resources from foreign  currencies were meager and we could not pay the debt  installments. Not only this, we could not even pay the price of  wheat or for the citizens' basic requirements.    I said somewhere that in September 1990 we reached the stage  where our foreign currency resources--from exports, oil, and  tourism--did not exceed 5 billion, 4.5 billion, sometimes 6  billion [currencies not specified] while we were spending 10  billion in foreign currency. We borrowed. We bought wheat in  installments to be paid over so many years. We reached the  stage where we could not pay the installments. [end recording]    President Mubarak stressed that we paid major attention to  the infrastructure because it was extremely necessary for  agriculture, industry, and investments. He explained what has  been achieved in the infrastructure field and stressed that  unemployment would have doubled to 10 times what it is now had  it not been for the infrastructure achievements.    The president explained the situation in Egypt when the  economic reforms began and how the country succeeded in reaching  a unique program through its discussions with the international  financial establishments and the IMF, which no other country  could attain. The program, he added, took into consideration the  conditions of the low-income groups. The president added that  this program was the bitter medicine that had to be taken to  save the Egyptian entity and economy.    This was stated by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mun'im, head of the  Presidential Palace Press Office. He said that the president  stressed that the economic reforms were a heavy burden and that  the increase in prices was also a burden but were necessary for  development. The president added: We had two choices: either  to embark on the economic reform experiment or to avoid it,  which would have led to a degree of deterioration that no one  could predict. The president stressed that the only remaining  danger now is the terrible population increase.    The head of the Presidential Palace Press Office added that  the president affirmed that the economic reform program is on  course and that we have been exempted from 30 percent of our  debts, which will drop another percentage point in July.    The president stressed that this stage has (?hampered) the  state's interest in the expanding slum areas. He said: After  the reform we are able to look for a solution to this problem,  proceed with improving living conditions, and develop the  economy, especially if we manage to control the population  increase.    President Mubarak touched on the sales tax, saying that  there  will be no price increase in the second stage of this tax, which  will be during 1995-96. He said taxes are the state's right  from those able to pay in favor of the ones who cannot.    He also explained the GATT, which allows free trade and  services that reflect the interest of the higher purchasing  countries and asserted that we ought to adjust ourselves and be  ready to cooperate to face all possible consequences of this  agreement.    The president said that at a time when the world is  suffering  hard economic conditions and soaring prices, some countries have  begun to export terrorism to us. He affirmed that the  terrorists who concentrate on striking at tourism as a huge  source for the Egyptian economy have nothing to do with Islam,  which renounces them. He described them as a handful of  criminals and mercenaries and said that their interest is money  and profiteering, referring to an attack on a mosque in Sudan  yesterday in which 28 people were killed and over 100 worshipers  were wounded [numbers as heard]. Criminals also used machine  guns and hand grenades in attacking worshipers in a Sunni mosque  in Pakistan.    'Abd-al-Mun'im said that the president discussed corruption,  saying that some people are exaggerating it to harm our  reputation, something that happens in other countries and from  which no society is free. He said that Egypt has less  corruption than other countries and that the international  phenomenon of corruption cannot be a justification for us. All  corruption cases are investigated no matter who is involved.    The president noted the numerous rumors about corruption  designed to cause confusion and defame the state. He affirmed  that he personally inquires about all rumors and allegations and  in most cases investigations have proved that they were merely  rumors.    The president turned to the discussion of foreign issues,  affirming their direct link with domestic affairs. He noted  that we are living in a world where interests are interwoven and  that Egypt's foreign relations affect its role and standing in  the region. The president stressed that he is committed to a  general principle that our relations should be good with all  countries.    The president also discussed the balance of power in the  world and the new world order, referring to the major changes.  He affirmed the need for us to deal with the new situation and  successive changes and that we should not despair.    He then referred to yesterday's heinous massacre in  Sarajevo,  when a mortar shell landed in the city's marketplace, killing  over 60 people and wounding about 200 others. He said that the  European countries have an obligation to end this tragedy from  which the Bosnian people are suffering. He emphasized that it  is the responsibility of the major powers and the Security  Council member states to end this tragedy.    President Mubarak said we have peacekeeping forces in  Sarajevo and Somalia that are a symbol of the solidarity of an  Islamic country with brothers in two other Islamic countries.  He added that our Armed Forces are carrying out a first class  humanitarian task in Somalia.    In his meeting with commanders, officers, and men of the  Central Military Zone, the president dealt with the Middle East  issue and the peace process. He noted that Egypt was the most  courageous country to achieve peace. He said that had it not  been for the role of the late President Anwar al-Sadat in his  historic initiative that opened the door to all the region's  countries, it would not have been possible to reach the current  situation in the peace process.    He also discussed the Gaza-Jericho accord and Egypt's role  in  all phases, as well as its efforts with the United States during  1977-1993 to make it listen to the Palestinian voice.    The president stressed that difficulties remain on the road  to peace, primarily the Israeli settlements that have gone from  40 small settlements in 1978 to 180 large ones scattered all  over the Arab territories. He said Egypt has always been  forthright in all its actions and policies and that there is  still a long, complex way to go on the Palestinian issue,  especially when a Palestinian (?administration is set up) and in  light of subsequent dealings with humanitarian issues.    He affirmed that there will soon be a just solution to the  Syrian issue, which we desire. Mubarak also dealt with Egypt's  role in finding a solution to the Libyan-Western crisis, in  which Egypt is helping as much as it can without intervening in  Libya's decisionmaking.</p>

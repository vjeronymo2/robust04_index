			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Canberra protests at US wheat for Pakistan CANBERRA yesterday protested against the US sale of 220,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat to Pakistan, part of the 800,000-tonne package the US recently announced under its Export Enhancement Programme (EEP). Mr John Kerin, trade minister, and Mr Simon Crean, primary industries minister, called the sale inconsistent with President Bush's pledge to use subsidies only against the Europeans. Mr Kerin rejected the US claim that the EC was about to go into the Pakistan market with huge price undercutting. 'Pakistan is not a significant market for the EC; sales were only 4 per cent in 1991-92. This is the first sale under EEP to Pakistan, a valuable market for Australia.' Canberra would ask US officials to explain.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chen Yongping (7115 3057 1627) and Liu Hongxing </F> (0491 4767 2502): "Work Hard To Win Six Battles, and Strive for  a Comprehensive Bumper Harvest"]    [Text] Spring has come early this year! Amid the wave of  spring, the regional agricultural and animal husbandry work  conference ceremoniously opened in Hohhot on the morning of 18  February.    Attending the conference were heads and secretaries general  in charge of agricultural and animal husbandry work of various  leagues and cities; responsible persons of pertinent  departments; and responsible comrades of various agricultural  departments and bureaus as well as pertinent commissions,  offices, departments, and bureaus, more than 300 persons in all.    Bai Enpei, deputy secretary of the regional party committee,  presided over the conference. Zhang Tingwu, vice chairman of  the region, made a report entitled "Press Package Reform  Forward, Make Breakthroughs in Major Aspects, and Create a New  Situation in Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and the Economic  Work of Rural and Pastoral Areas."    In his report, Zhang Tingwu said: This year, major tasks for  economic development of the region's rural and pastoral areas  are: to reach 21 billion yuan in total output value of  agriculture and animal husbandry; to ensure gross grain output  at 10 billion kg, or reach 11.5 billion kg; to ensure total  number of animals at 56.5 million head, or reach 57 million  head, of which, the number of pigs should reach 10 million head;  to ensure afforested land at 5 million mu, or reach 5.5 million  mu; to ensure total output value of township and town  enterprises at 28 billion yuan, or reach 30 billion yuan; and to  make the per capita net income of peasants and herdsmen 100 yuan  more than last year's figure of 829 yuan.    Zhang Tingwu said: This year, the region's agricultural and  animal husbandry fronts should concentrate efforts on winning  the following six tough battles:    The tough battle of deepening reform: On the basis of  stabilizing the household output-related contract responsibility  system and perfecting the double-tier management system, this  year we should lay emphasis on building the collectivized  service system by building, as quickly as possible, a  multi-tier, multi-form, multi-composition, and multi-function  service network, with the village and gacha cooperative economic  organizations as the foundation; with township, town, and sumu  service organizations as the link, with leading enterprises  (corporations) of banners, counties, townships, towns, and sumus  as the core, and with the service organizations run by peasants  and herdsmen individually or jointly as the supplement.  Construction of markets in rural and pastoral areas should be  accelerated. Through the government efforts in cultivating  markets, we should make markets guide production, orient  production to market demands, promote the development of the  socialist market economy, and link the scattered small-scale  production with the collectivized large market.    The tough battle of capital construction: This year, the  region plans to newly add 1.25 million mu of irrigated areas,  newly add 6,000 small enclosed pastures around water pools,  build 20 million mu of grassland, and build 5 million mu of land  whose water is conserved. We should energetically build capital  construction of farmland, grassland, and pastoral land, with  water conservation facilities as the central link, and further  enhance the comprehensive agricultural and animal husbandry  production capacity. Basic agricultural and animal husbandry  projects should be managed, built, and developed in a  comprehensive manner by using as reference the experiences  gained from the construction and management of industrial  projects. This year is the last year of the second-stage  comprehensive agricultural development of the region. We must  complete the building of development projects in good quality in  order to ensure that the region's comprehensive agricultural  development will be carried on stage by stage and to constantly  win more projects and more investment from the state.    The tough battle of optimizing structure: We should grasp  the readjustment of the internal structures of agriculture,  animal husbandry, and forestry; the readjustment of the internal  structure of general agriculture, and the readjustment of the  production structure of all rural and pastoral areas. The  readjustment should be focused on combining agriculture with  animal husbandry, drawing animal husbandry into agriculture,  drawing grass-growing into animal husbandry, and effecting a  simultaneous development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and  grass-growing by using advantages to make up each other's  deficiencies. This year, the region should grow 8 million mu of  grass, sow 1 million mu of forage grass by plane, grow 3 million  mu of forage crops, and produce 2 billion kg of silage. This  year, the region should raise a total of 15 million pigs, make  each peasant or herdsman share one pig on an average, and make  the pigs in stock reach 10 million head. The region should breed  200,000 beef cattle and 4 million mutton sheep, of which, 2  million should be lambs. The success in these aspects will  contribute to promoting overall development.    The tough battle of township and town enterprises: Efforts  should be made to push reform to a new height, expand the scale  of operation, improve the grade of products, and enhance the  level of management. This year, we should comprehensively  popularize the shareholding system and the shareholing  cooperative system and vigorously develop the nonpublicly owned  economy. We should make great efforts to expand the scale of  township and town enterprise groups and to develop the products  that are high in starting point, apply high science and  technology, have high added value, and earn lots of foreign  exchange. By strengthening management, we should effect a  marked improvement in all targets of enterprise efficiency. This  year, we should launch across the region the emulation drive of  vying with one another in becoming "100 million-yuan townships  and towns," "10 million-yuan villages," and "5 million-yuan  enterprises" and should choose, through appraisal, and commend  the banners, counties, townships, towns, and enterprises  outstanding in developing township and town enterprises.    The tough battle of scientific and technological progress:  In  agriculture, we should implement across the region the project  of organizing 10,000 agriculture-oriented scientific and  technological cadres and technicians who are peasants or  herdsmen, establish 100 centers experimenting with and  demonstrating the high-yielding, high-quality, and  high-efficient agriculture, give scientific and technological  training to 2 million people, and apply applicable and  output-increasing technologies on 20 million mu of fields sown  with major crops. In animal husbandry, we should improve the  breed of 13 million draft and small animals. In forestry, we  should expand the biological economic sphere and the ecological  economic sphere and popularize the technology of growing grain  and cash crops in forests. In water conservation, we should  emphatically apply the water-saving irrigation technology. We  should adopt the form of "four fixed targets and three linkings"  to mobilize the enthusiasm of scientific and technological  personnel. The plan of "green certificates" should be carried  out throughout the region.    The tough battle of supporting the poor by resolving most  difficult problems: As of 1992, 600,000 households and 3 million  people in the region were still in a poor state. This year is  the first year of the state implementation of the "eighth  seven-year" plan for supporting the poor by resolving the most  difficult problems. The region as a whole should emphatically  support 150,000 poor households, of which, 100,000 households  should have enough food and clothes. We should persist in the  principle of supporting the poor by developing production and  managing the poor in a comprehensive way. We should define the  major battlefield of the support of the poor. State support  should be extended to counties and the region's support should  be extended to sumus. We should be determined to change the  outlook of the poor through the methods of designating the areas  that receive support, supporting the poor by initiating  projects, supporting the poor through scientific and  technological means, organizing economic coordination in poor  areas, transferring cadres to poor areas, and making rich areas  help the poor. Zhang Tingwu stressed: The key to winning the  above-mentioned six battles lies in further strengthening  leadership, changing the style of work, and grasping  implementation. The current conference is precisely a  mobilization to grasp and promote implementation. He called on  leaders at all levels to consciously put agriculture and animal  husbandry in the most important position of economic work,  concentrate their major energy on "giving guidance, support,  protection, and control," actually carry out the policy of  protecting agriculture, and strive to yield results by changing  government functions and improving the art of leadership.    In conclusion, Zhang Tingwu called on all localities to  launch the emulation drive of "vying with one another in  pioneering undertakings" and to emulate with each other in doing  practical work, scoring achievements, and yielding practical  results in order to reap new bumper harvests in agriculture and  animal husbandry in 1994 and create a new situation in  agriculture, animal husbandry, and the economic work of rural  and pastoral areas.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Setback for Lucas SHARES in engineering group Lucas Industries dived after analysts attending a dinner hosted by the company on Wednesday evening at the Paris Air Show came away with a bleak view of trading prospects across the company's markets. The shares fell 7 to 129p early in the session, with Credit Lyonnais Laing said to have been among the sellers, and NatWest Securities reiterating its cautious stance on the stock. There were suggestions from some quarters that the final dividend may be cut and that a restructuring of the company may have to take place. Several brokers moved to downgrade profit estimates and one said: 'Trading remains gloomy and there may even be provisions to be made.' Nerves later steadied and the shares closed 5 off at 131p after volume of 6m. Market watchers are to meet the company next week.</p>

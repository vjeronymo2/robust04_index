			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RACING THE ODDS;  </P> <P> JOHN MARINO TRIES TO BUILD STATURE OF RACE ACROSS AMERICA  </P> <P> Somewhere in New Jersey, John Marino, a bowlegged ex-baseball catcher with a  bad back, climbed off a bike and onto a choice piece of Garden State pavement.  </P> <P> After riding across an entire country, and just 60 miles short of his  destination -- New York City Hall -- he had discovered that his attempt to  break the transcontinental record he had set the year before had failed.  </P> <P> Demoralized, dehydrated, degraded and not at all happy, he found he couldn't  pedal another foot.  </P> <P> Ten years can pass fairly quickly when you're inventing and keeping alive a  sport that claims the continental United States as its playing field.  </P> <P> It was in 1979 that Marino found himself stuck in the swamps of Jersey. Today  he finds himself wedged between filing cabinets, copying machines, cycling  posters, water bottles, boxes of this, shelves of that, in a cramped piece of  Tustin office space dedicated to one purpose: Race Across AMerica, a bike race  from one shining sea to another, perhaps the ultimate of the ultra-sports that  have gained popularity in the 1980s.  </P> <P> And Marino, who has kept the race going, will watch the eighth edition take off  Sunday from the Orange County Fairgrounds. In the last couple of months leading  into the race, it's not unusual for him to work 20-hour days and go without  sleep some days as he coordinates more than 1,000 volunteers along checkpoints  30 miles apart across the country. There are programs to be printed and  sponsors to be swooned.  </P> <P> If there is anyone who will stick to this quest it is Marino, whose capacity to  persevere is intense but is belied by his mild manner.  </P> <P> "Bulldogs don't bark much," said Paul Cornish, whose transcontinental record  Marino broke in 1978.  </P> <P> Race Across AMerica is having unqualified success in attracting participants --  qualifying races are held around the country to come up with about 30 racers.  But this will be the race's third year without a television contract, which  makes it hard to draw big-money sponsors.  </P> <P> The United States Cycling Federation will not allow its members -- the top  cyclists in the country -- to compete in RAAM. And some say Marino's creation  is closer to a TV mini-series than athletics.  </P> <P> Asked what's tougher, dealing with the race or riding in it, Marino smiles,  "You know, I'd have to rate that a push."  </P> <P> Marino made his first transcontinental ride in 1978. An unlikely feat of  course, all the more unlikely because Marino was not a cyclist. He was a  catcher who had played baseball at San Diego State and had been drafted by the  Dodgers.  </P> <P> But a chronic back condition -- he compressed vertebrae weightlifting -- ended  that career. Depressed, he fled to Europe for two years. Cycling was an  economic consideration more than a pleasurable activity.  </P> <P> Soon after his return to the United States, he hit upon the idea of riding  across the country. He had been taking some self-improvement classes from  Gordon Smith, a Santa Ana man who spoke six languages and had been a Marine  pilot and concert pianist.  </P> <P> Through methods that included listening to audio tapes, Smith claimed a human  being could do just about anything. With loose ends dangling from his dream of  a life in sports, Marino set his sights on running the Boston Marathon. But no  tape can cure compressed vertebrae and that project was scratched.  </P> <P> Looking through a Guinness Book of World Records one day, he happened upon the  record for riding across America. The record of 13 days 5 hours 20 minutes was  held by Cornish, who happened to live in Tustin.  </P> <P> Marino looked up Cornish's number in the phone book and gave him a call.  </P> <P> "I answered the phone and this guy says, "Hi, I'm going to break your record,'  " Cornish said. "I asked him how much cycling experience he had? He said  practically none. I said, 'Good luck.' "  </P> <P> But Cornish, who had made his transcontinental ride just because he said he  could and a friend said he couldn't, admired Marino's chutzpah.  </P> <P> "I knew this was a guy who was going to work at it," he said. "I didn't think  he'd make it, but I thought he'd make a credible attempt."  </P> <P> Cornish set up a work program for Marino that started out with the relatively  infantile distance of 20 miles a day. Two years later, Marino was riding  hundreds of miles a week. In 1978 he set out on his ride.  </P> <P> He was soon miserable. No amount of training could prepare him for the drudgery  of riding the plains of Kansas, fighting a head wind, just trying to make it to  the next grain silo.  </P> <P> His support crew was lying to him about the time and about how long he slept.  They knew that Marino couldn't ride as fast as Cornish, so he would have to  out-endure him.  </P> <P> "They'd tell me I'd slept six hours when I'd only slept two," Marino said.  </P> <P> He was miserable.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to let my crew down, I knew the only way I could stop with honor  would be to be injured," he said. "So I kept trying to figure out a way that I  could fall off the bike and hurt myself without really hurting myself."  </P> <P> He thought about that all the way to the steps of New York's City Hall, where  he ended his trip in 13 days 1 hour and 20 minutes.  </P> <P> Saddle sores behind him, intoxicated by success as well as TV appearances,  Marino prepared for another cross-country ride the next year.  </P> <P> Marino had talked to several people about developing the ride into a sporting  event with multiple entrants.  </P> <P> "I knew if my idea was going to fly, I'd have to make the ride again," he said.  </P> <P> But the 1979 trip was a disaster from the beginning with rainstorms and routes  that led to dead ends.  </P> <P> "It was even more miserable than the first trip," Marino said.  </P> <P> When his crew informed him in Phillipsburg, N.J., that he had just gone over  his record, Marino got off his bike and sat down.  </P> <P> "I just couldn't go on."  </P> <P> Crew members fretted about the wrath of sponsors if Marino quit for anything  short of a broken bone. Somehow a plan, without Marino's knowledge, was  developed that would take Marino to a Manhattan hospital under the pretext of  injury.  </P> <P> "They threw me in the motor home, drove me to Manhattan, and when I stepped out  there were reporters, cameras, probably 50 people waiting for me," he said. "My  first question was, 'Where am I?' But it turned out I was bigger story because  I hadn't made it."  </P> <P> By 1982, Marino's dream of a transcontinental race was realized. He set out on  the trip, with three other riders and ABC film crew. ABC condensed the show  into two hours and won numerous awards for the production.  </P> <P> "They called it soap opera sports," Marino said. "That kind of bugged me at  first, but from their perspective the sport offered a lot of human drama and  audiences eat that stuff up."  </P> <P> So much so that ABC chronicled the next three races. But after the 1986 race,  and some personnel changes at the network, ABC let Marino know it wasn't sure  about televising the race in 1987.  </P> <P> "They said they couldn't tell me for sure until Dec. 31."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a certain large fast-food chain -- golden arches, clown mascot --  was interested in sponsoring the event, but only if the race had a national TV  deal.  </P> <P> On Dec. 31, Marino got the word. ABC would not televise the event, the  fast-food chain would not sponsor. Happy New Year.  </P> <P> This year's event also won't be televised, something that worries Marino and  mystifies Peter Rosten, who made an award-winning film about Marino's 1979  ride.  </P> <P> "When someone performs endlessly, cries, laughs, shows raw emotion, the  audience goes 'Wow,' " said Rosten, who was executive producer of the film,  "True Believers." "Pro athletes are so cool, they show nothing, but when an  audience sees just a normal guy like them bearing his soul, that character  becomes so accessible that they cheer."  </P> <P> Believing as much, and aware that sports survival depends on on coverage,  Marino asks competitors, their families and friends to stage letter-writing  campaigns to their local papers and national publications. He claims that  recent letter-writing campaign to Sports Illustrated gained race coverage from  that magazine.  </P> <P> There are no big-name sponsors still and Marino is barely breaking even  personally. In fact, he's working toward become a building contractor in case  RAAM falls through.  </P> <P> And yet, the popularity of the event continues to grow. For the most part, the  competitors are in their 30s. Marino attributes that to the fact that racers  must finance their own operation -- support crew and vehicles, equipment --  which can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. Participants are often  professionals who have the time for training.  </P> <P> But why train for something that Cornish calls "the pits of holy hell. A  depressing, sickening, deadening experience."  </P> <P> One reason may be that, like Marino, many of the participants are not lifelong  cyclists. Marino says they're adventurers. Rosten calls them "heroic idiots."  </P> <P> These are types who take something on because of the challenge. And strange as  it sounds, riding across America is a very doable challenge.  </P> <P> "Think of it this way," Cornish said. "I can study the piano all I want, but if  I don't have the God-given talent I'll never be a great pianist. But something  like this (RAAM) you can achieve just through hard work."  </P> <P> Marino would like to see the day when top young riders who belong to the United  States Cycling Federation are allowed.  </P> <P> He knows that a dramatic race between two top riders might just be the type of  thing that could capture audiences' imagination. The Ironman Triathlon was  helped immeasurably when a race between women competitors came down to the wire  with one attempting to crawl across the finish line.  </P> <P> "If we could have something dramatic like that, something that people really  identify with, it might be enough to push us over the top," Marino said.  </P> <P> But for now, the race struggles on and Marino remains among the clutter of his  little office, feeling at times that he's stuck somewhere in New Jersey.  </P></p>

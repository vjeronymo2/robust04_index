			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Rome was not rebuilt in a day: Italy's confusing electoral reforms are likely to produce further muddle The politicians who campaigned successfully a year ago for a fundamental change in Italy's voting laws promised a lot. Moving from the previous, hideously complex system of proportional representation towards a first-past-the-post approach more akin to that of the UK would, they claimed, generate more transparent and straightforward elections, present voters with clearer choices and even produce stabler and more legitimate governing majorities. Unfortunately, although the voters signalled in large numbers that they wanted all these things in last April's referendum, they look like being cruelly disappointed. The campaign for the election due on March 27 has created neither transparency nor straightforwardness, the choices involved are about as obscure as ever in Italian politics, and the outcome could well be something to which Italians have become all too accustomed in the past 45 years: an almighty muddle. The confusion can only complicate the task of any new Italian government in dealing with political challenges and economic constraints that remain more awkward than those facing any other major western European country. Electoral reform, of course, was never going to be a panacea for the manifold ills afflicting Italy's body politic following the collapse of the corrupt old order dominated by the Christian Democrat party. Under that system, the politicians - competing on centrally chosen party lists - traded votes for patronage, and the result was an endless succession of governments comprising the same parties and faces. But reform was supposed to hasten the construction of a new order, in part by reducing the number of small parties scrambling for a slice of power and by encouraging the formation of larger political groupings whose candidates would compete for single-seat constituencies on the basis of distinct policy programmes. That is not quite how things have turned out. Thanks largely to a provision in the electoral law, allowing for 25 per cent of the seats in the lower house and senate to be elected by proportional representation and party lists, the small parties are alive and well and insistently clinging to their separate identities. In order to maximise their votes in the single-seat constituencies, individual parties of the left, right and centre have banded together in alliances. But these groupings remain flimsy in the extreme, their members united by political slogans but divided on important policy issues, riven with personality clashes, and to some extent vying with one another as well as with the opposing alliances for votes. It is hard to see any of them surviving long after the election, let alone forming the basis for stable government. On the left, such are the differences within the Progressive Alliance between the mainstream of the former communist party and a breakaway hardline faction that the alliance's overall leader, Mr Achille Occhetto, spends more of his time repudiating the extreme comments of some of his colleagues than in explaining his party's programme. The forces of the right, grouped around media mogul Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, are leading in the polls, but largely by virtue of disguising their differences behind a vapid, presidential-style campaign focused on the personality of Mr Berlusconi. Serious policy discussion has been conspicuously absent. Small wonder that the voters are confused, or that pressure is growing for another bout of electoral reform. Not only do they face the disappearance of any familiar element in the landscape (almost all the parties have changed their names to distance themselves from the past, and several have split into even smaller fragments). They are also being asked to vote, on three separate ballots, in a system that is neither fish nor fowl - neither PR nor first-past-the-post - and in ignorance as to how the candidates of their choice will ultimately be aligned or what sort of government might result. It is scarcely a climate designed to foster responsible or coherent postures by the politicians themselves. Front runner Mr Berlusconi, in particular, has been shamelessly promising tax cuts and new jobs. No serious observer expects him to be able to deliver these without severely damaging Italy's painstaking efforts to reduce its budget deficit and bring its spiralling government debt under control. He has also consistently refused to subject his platform to proper scrutiny by debating on TV with his opponents. The latter are putting their trust not in achieving outright victory (the polls give them few grounds for hope on that score) but in the idea that forces of the centre, moderate left and moderate right will, after the election, combine to back a pragmatic 'institutional' coalition that can put politics aside and get on with governing. For Italy's establishment, smoke-filled rooms and massaged results still seem more comfortable than a straight political fight. What the country badly needs is a stable government capable of matching up to its status as the world's fifth largest industrial power and getting to grips with its economic problems. Ironically, the closest it has come to that state of grace in recent decades is probably with the technocratic governments born out of the comprehensive discrediting of the political class in the last two years. The current election campaign shows how far Italy still has to go before it creates a political system that can be relied on to produce such a government at the ballot box.</p>

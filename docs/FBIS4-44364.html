			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "After Corfu"] </F>   [Text] In all the recriminations over the failure of the  Corfu summit to pick a successor to Jacques Delors, European  leaders should remember two things. First, John Major's veto  was neither as unexpected nor as isolated as his opponents  suggest. Secondly, the Prime Minister may not hesitate to cast  that veto again if pushed into the same corner.    Helmut Kohl, in particular, must quickly learn the lesson of  Corfu. His creature, Jean Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime  minister, still insists he is not out of the race. German  officials are already behaving as though they can use the weight  of their presidency to quash British objections. They have not  absorbed the truth of what has happened: that the eventual  choice must be truly unanimous. When Helmut Kohl pronounced his  own anathema, against Ruud Lubbers, Britain did not dispute his  right to do so. In the same way Mr Major found Mr Dehaene's  conception of the European Union outdated and unacceptable. He  too was within his right to veto -- and rightly did so.    The Germans are sticking with Mr Dehaene to mitigate the  damage of their clumsy attempt, with France, to agree the  succession in secret conclave. It is too much to expect that  they should drop their preferred candidate the very next day.  But Bonn may be underestimating Mr Major's determination. The  Dehaene supporters seem to believe that the British veto is as  easily overturned as the last time a stand on principle was  attempted: over the blocking minority vote it collapsed after  only a week. The prime minister has learned his lesson. He  coordinated his tactics properly and is arguing on much stronger  ground. He must not back down at the second offering of a  candidate previously declared unacceptable.    The Franco-German tactic will be to cause Mr Major the  maximum embarrassment by ostentatiously consulting all parties  beforehand -- thereby removing British objections over the way  Mr Dehaene emerged -- and then pushing a candidate as federalist  as Mr Dehaene. One obvious choice would be Wilfried Martens, a  former Belgian prime minister, who would be an even worse  outcome for Mr Major: not only does he share Mr Dehaene's views  on Europe but he has a proven anti- British record too. Mr  Major should not hesistate to use his veto again, if so  pressured.    In the present envenomed atmosphere, Dehaene supporters are  likely, out of pique, to veto Peter Sutherland, the Irish  secretary- general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade. His sin is that he is both anglophone and a liberal  free-trader. To pick him would appear to reward Mr Major for  his obstinacy. The dark horse is Viscount Etienne Davignon, a  former commissioner, a free-trader and a pragmatist, but also  conveniently a Belgian. Whitehall has hinted that it could live  with him.    Britain is ill-placed to propose a candidate. Several  countries, however, owe a political debt to Mr Major. They too  did not want Mr Dehaene but were reluctant to speak out. Mrs  Thatcher may be gone, but the tradition of hiding behind the  British veto remains. Italy, The Netherlands and even Denmark  took opportunistic shelter there at Corfu. They must now  persuade Germany to look elsewhere. This search should not be  limited to former prime ministers and commissioners. The focus  must be on the qualities needed to manage the Commission  nowadays. These could be the skills of a head of a large  corporation. Europe needs a man who knows how to keep costs  down, streamline bureaucracy, limit empire-building and, above  all, listen to the shareholders, in this case the Council of  Ministers. Those qualities may be found in industry, far beyond  the tight-knit Christian Democratic nexus in Benelux. Europe  needs a new vision, Herr Kohl has a duty to extend his horizon.</p>

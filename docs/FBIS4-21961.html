			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 17 KYODO -- Japan Red Army members  living in Pyongyang since their 1970 hijacking of a Japan  Airlines (JAL) airliner have slammed Tokyo's policies toward  North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development program.    In a letter obtained Saturday [16 April] by KYODO NEWS  SERVICE, the Red Army members remarked, "As a neighboring  nation, Japan should not be conspiring with the United States  but making efforts for dialogue and peace (with North Korea)."    The letter indicated that a declaration with the same  content  was sent to an influential member of the government's ruling  coalition.    The U.S., along with Seoul and Tokyo, has been urging  Pyongyang to comply with international nuclear safeguards  accords and permit inspections of its nuclear facilities  suspected of being part of an arms development program.    The U.S. has lobbied for a U.N. resolution calling for North  Korea's compliance with the inspections, but at China's urging  last month, the U.N. Security Council adopted a nonbinding  presidential statement asking Pyongyang to be more open with its  program.    With discussion about possibly imposing economic sanctions  on  North Korea under way in the United Nations, Japanese national  security authorities suggested the letter was part of a  propaganda campaign against Japan in connection with last  Friday's 82nd birthday of North Korean leader Kim Il-song.    In 1970, nine Japan Red Army members commandeered a JAL  Boeing 727, known as "Yodo," to Pyongyang. One of the hijackers  has since died in North Korea and another was arrested in 1988  while trying to return to Japan.</p>

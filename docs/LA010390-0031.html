			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> More than 400 pounds of oranges were removed from the shelves of a supermarket  in Point Loma Tuesday after the FBI notified police that the fruit may have  been injected with poison.  </P> <P> The San Diego Police Department received a call shortly after 5 p.m., saying  the oranges may have been injected with nicotine sulfate, which, taken in  large-enough doses, can be lethal.  </P> <P> Sgt. Jake Hughes said employees of the Vons market in the 1600 block of  Rosecrans Street were contacted by an anonymous caller, who claimed to have  made the injections. Hughes said supervisors at the store called the FBI.  </P> <P> A spokesman at the supermarket declined comment Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "Nicotine sulfate is nicotine, nothing more," said Greg Przekwas, spokesman  with the San Diego Regional Poison Center. "It is poisonous in high enough  concentrations."  </P> <P> The oranges are being held by the San Diego Police Department pending further  investigation.  </P></p>

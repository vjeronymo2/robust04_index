			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / ITT puts Dollars 1.7bn on Caesars World flutter ITT, the US conglomerate that has been seeking to expand in the leisure industry, is to buy Caesars World, one of the best-known names in gaming, for Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.03bn) in cash. ITT has agreed to buy the company for Dollars 67.50 a share through a tender offer beginning on Friday. Caesars World had net income of Dollars 78.4m on revenues of Dollars 1bn in the year to last July. It has three casino and hotel complexes  - in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and on the shore of Lake Tahoe in the Sierra Nevada. The biggest of the three, Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, occupies an 80-acre site on the famed Las Vegas Strip. It is based on an ancient Rome theme, with toga-clad dealers and a massive chariot parked in a corner. Zagat, a US hotel guide, describes the hotel rooms as 'like a bordello', with circular beds and overhead mirrors. ITT's businesses include insurance, communications and information, automotive sales, fluid technology and defence. Recently, however, it has been trying to expand in the growth sector of leisure and entertainment, where it is already active through its ownership of the Sheraton hotel chain. Earlier this year ITT began the process of taking over Ciga, the Italian luxury hotel group, of which it now owns 70 per cent. In August it acquired the Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment complex in New York for Dollars 1.1bn in partnership with Cablevision Systems, a US cable television company. In September ITT said it was seeking buyers for its financial services subsidiary, ITT Financial, in a sale that could fetch Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn. It wanted to use the funds to expand its leisure interests further. ITT is already in the gaming industry: it owns the Sheraton Desert Inn hotel and casino complex in Las Vegas and a riverboat casino in Tunica, Missouri. In May it said it was going to build a Dollars 750m Desert Kingdom hotel and casino complex in Las Vegas, but in October it cancelled the plans. Yesterday's agreement indicated that ITT now plans to buy existing gaming interests rather than build its own. Lex, Page 16</p>

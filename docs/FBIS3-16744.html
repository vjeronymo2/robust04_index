The Moldovan president's press service announced that  Moldovan President Mircea Snegur and Russian Ambassador Vasev  had met on Friday. They agreed that settlement of the  Transdniestrian issue would contribute to restoration of  stability in the region, which conformed with the interests of  the population.    Moldovan President Snegur stressed that the democratic  parliamentary elections and the sociological poll, during which  most of the population had spoken for independence of Moldova,  were the basis for normalization of the situation in Moldova's  eastern regions.

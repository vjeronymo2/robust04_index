			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY READIES BATTLE PLAN AGAINST GYPSY MOTH  </P> <P> The discovery in San Diego County this year of several gypsy moths,  tree-destroying pests with voracious appetites, has prompted agriculture  officials to increase trapping and surveillance of the insect and consider  spraying pesticide.  </P> <P> About six male gypsy moths have been found in San Diego County in 1989. One  insect was trapped in Valley Center, near the intersection of Cole Grade Road  and Valley Center Road. Five others, including one trapped last weekend, have  been caught in La Mesa, near the intersection of Spring Street and California  94.  </P> <P> The pest, which can eat up to a square foot of leaves daily, was eradicated  from the Mission Valley area in 1985, after trappings of hundreds of the  insects throughout California in the early 1980s led to statewide pesticide  spraying, said Kathleen Thuner, county agricultural commissioner.  </P> <P> "Finding one sort of marshals your forces. But when you get more than one in an  area, that signifies that there may be potential infestation," Thuner said. "We  still don't know if spraying will be needed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Monitoring Traps  </P> <P> Agriculture officials have increased trapping in La Mesa and Valley Center, and  are monitoring traps daily in Spring Valley, Ocean Beach and Del Mar, where  three moths were found last year. Officials are searching primarily for gypsy  egg masses, which can hold as many as 1,000 eggs, Thuner said.  </P> <P> If the small, tan, hair-covered eggs of the moth are found, officials may  consider spraying bacillus thuringiensis, an organic pesticide that kills the  larvae, next spring.  </P> <P> Found mostly in northeastern states, gypsy moths during their caterpillar stage  feed on more than 300 varieties of plants and shrubs. They can also defoliate  and destroy many types of trees, including avocado, lemon, pine and evergreen  trees.  </P> <P> "The moth has an appetite for just about anything with a leaf on it," Thuner  said.  </P> <P> The adult male gypsy moth has feathery antennas with dark wings and a 1  1/2-inch wingspan, she said. The female insects are white, with a wingspan of  about 2 inches.  </P></p>

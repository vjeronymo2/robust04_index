"If the Slovak Government still agreed with dissemination of  RFE broadcasts, it would actually agree with the correctness of  the discriminatory decision," Hrnko says.    According to Hrnko, freedom of the press in Slovakia is  comparable to that in the Czech Republic, Poland, or Hungary. "I  do not think that everything is in order with democracy in  Slovakia, as we still have a lot of work to become a really  democratic country. But that sort of democracy we have is also  in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary," Hrnko says, and  points to the government's interference in radio and television  broadcasting in Hungary.    Hrnko notes that in the past the RFE was dividing the Slovak  political scene into the democratic part, whereby the  pro-Czechoslovak forces were meant, and the undemocratic part,  whereby the advocates of Slovak sovereignty were meant. "This  division complicates the real crystallization of the political  forces. If someone labels the premier's steps as undemocratic,  he automatically evokes the division into pro-Czechoslovak  democrats and undemocratic supporters of Slovak independence."

			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Willis debate threatens to eclipse TUC agenda ARGUMENTS over trade union legislation and the return of the maverick EETPU electricians' union to the fold are likely to be the flashpoints of this year's Trades Union Congress early next month, judging by the preliminary agenda published today. Both, though, may be over-shadowed by the future of Mr Norman Willis, the much criticised TUC general secretary. Although some motions on the reorganisation of the TUC are implicitly critical of his leadership, there is as yet no open movement urging his removal. Nevertheless, several key union leaders are increasingly impatient with his handling of the TUC. One senior colleague said yesterday: 'Norman is seldom in the office at the moment, he seems to have mentally given up.' Other TUC officials speculate that Mr Willis, who theoretically has another five years in office, will announce his early retirement at this year's congress. One of those officials also warned that Mr Willis could sometimes be indecisive and that he might not readily make up his mind about whether to make a statement. The debate on the return of the electricians, via merger with the AEU engineering union, hinges on how far the union has to go in atoning for the actions that caused its original suspension from the TUC - particularly its acceptance into membership of breakaway groups from other unions. There is only one motion - from the National Union of Journalists - on the electricians, which requires them to give up thousands of their newest members. It is unlikely to be passed, but unless behind-the-scenes attempts to reach a compromise are successful there may still be a damaging split on the issue. On employment law, the left-led TGWU general union, the biggest TUC union, has reverted to its demand to repeal 'all Tory anti-union legislation'. Leading up to the general election, the TUC managed to present a common front with the Labour party and accepted that not all the Tory legislation should be repealed. That position is now in jeopardy, with the TGWU backed by other big unions, such as Nalgo, the local-government union. The debate on the future of the TUC will try to set priorities for the next four years and beyond, but is unlikely to result in significant further cuts to the organisation itself. There has been a 20 per cent cut in staff and the 'super unions' that support further cuts still cannot agree where they should fall. More British Airways cabin staff last night voted not to strike tomorrow over reorganisation of domestic services. An emergency meeting of BA stewards and stewardesses at Heathrow and Gatwick rejected a call to strike for 24 hours from midnight today. Crews based in Belfast had already voted not to stop work and BA said it hoped that crews in Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow would follow suit. The Transport and General Workers' Union has said the dispute was over BA's decision to move crews to a subsidiary company with inferior salaries and conditions. Crews affected are based in Birmingham, Manchester and Scotland.</p>

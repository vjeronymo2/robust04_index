			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Mountain to climb: Peace for Nagorno-Karabakh is seemingly out of reach Making nations is an ugly matter, especially when they are being formed from the ruins of totalitarianism. In Azerbaijan now, the republic's national leaders are jockeying for power in the wake of the resignation on Friday of President Ayaz Mutalibov. While this is going on, people are gorging themselves on details of real and alleged atrocities perpetrated by Armenian irregulars in their enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh against Azeri towns and villages on its south-east corner. These reports of atrocities, which have a hard core of truth however much they are inflated, have made a fraught situation apparently insoluble. Nagorno-Karabakh is taking its place among the world's apparently unsolvable ethnic territorial disputes. This sliver of mountainous ('nagorno') territory has been home to Armenians for centuries. Given semi-autonomous status in 1923, it has long been regarded by Azeri nationalists as an affront to their national integrity. Since 1988, it has been the focus of a distrust of Moscow in the popular fronts of both Armenia and Azerbaijan. President Levan Ter Petrosian of Armenia was a leading member of the Karabakh Committee, which was the nucleus of the Armenian independence movement. President Mutalibov of Azerbaijan has just fallen because he could not protect his people in the Azeri towns within the enclave. Karabakh is at the heart of the two new nations' politics, and positions on both sides have grown increasingly rigid. The town of Agdam, near the Nagorno-Karabakh border in Azerbaijan, is now a site of muted horror. It lives under the shadow of the massacre at the Azeri village of Khodjaly on February 25 and 26, when - from the survivors' account - Armenian guerrillas fell upon the town, and massacred a refugee column fleeing towards Agdam. The low claims on the Azeri side are of around 1,200 dead; neutral observers say about 200. On the streets of Abdam there are groups - hundreds strong - of refugees. In the local hospital, practically devoid of equipment, five people lie in bed in the tiny, foetid wards; when the bandages are unwrapped from their feet they reveal suppurating toes and soles, the flesh having been eaten away. The story told by one of them, Ms Aina Gasanov, 50 but looking 70, is that they fled to the woods from Khodjaly on the night of February 25 and were there until found last Saturday - 11 days and nights, lightly clad in sub-zero temperatures, eating only snow. There had been, she said, 200 of them: half had died, some were still there. A young doctor standing by said that all the survivors would undergo amputation. There is little sign of damage in the town itself. I saw three sites where rockets, said to be of the Krystal type, had fallen: one had come down outside a partly built bungalow, the fragments making a hole in the roof below which slept two infants (who were unhurt). We were told six such rockets had fallen on Saturday night. The front line is now on the Karabakh border, a few kilometres up the road from Agdam. Near the village of Sheli the Azeris have established a post with two rusting 150mm Pushka cannon. One was pushed to the brow of a hill overlooking a valley in which lies the town of Afkeran, formerly Azeri and now held by the Armenians. There were two forward Azeri positions beyond, each with half a dozen men. That appeared to be the strength of the Azeris in the field yesterday. One man at the Sheli post said that one of the cannons worked, another said that neither did: in any event, there was one shell. A little further away in the valley, automatic fire crackled sporadically, interspersed with booms from Armenian guns in or near Afkeran. Azeris warned of snipers, but no fire was directed at the post when we were there. However, it had come under fire while host to a Grad rocket launcher, according to a television reporter who had filmed it. The Azeris, who continually complain of relative weakness in the face of Armenian strength, have one or two Grads and some tanks and armoured personnel carriers. If anything is clear in this muddy, partisan struggle it is that the Armenians are trying to clear the Azeris out of Karabakh and secure their borders. The front line post at Sheli is on the border; Askeran just inside. Shusha, a little further in, is still held by the Azeris but surrounded by Armenians, and we were told that helicopter flights had stopped. In clearing the area, the Armenians have laid what presently seem to be the indestructible foundations of Azeri hatred, and appear to have put any kind of peace out of reach. The reverses suffered by the Azeris have fed their way quickly into national politics. President Mutalibov, a former first secretary of the Azeri Communist Party who rushed through presidential elections last September in the wake of the August putsch, had tried to retain vestigial links with the former Soviet Union, agreeing to membership of the Commonwealth of Independent States and delaying the creation of a national army and currency. He had survived in the clannish politics of Baku, the state capital, by co-opting some opposition figures into power - thus he had hoped to avoid the fate of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the former Georgian president, who excluded to his cost a widening circle of the opposition. It seems, however, that Mr Mutalibov was unable to quash the cabals. His ambitious prime minister, Mr Gasan Gasanov, had put lines out to the opposition and when, last Thursday and Friday, thousands surrounded the Azeri Supreme Soviet in protest, he turned on the president and helped to bring about his fall. 'Even if another takes my place, you will not be able to solve the Karabakh problem,' said Mr Mutalibov before he went. But those now calling for a change in policy think they can. Dr Tevfik Gasimov, a senior member of the Supreme Soviet's National Council, which now exercises effective power, said at the weekend: 'We want Azerbaijan to be a democratic unified state. We will have no autonomous regions; these are a left-over of Soviet imperial days when they used one nation to control another. The Armenians in Karabakh will be equal before the law with every other citizen.' Dr Gasimov said that the first priorities were to form a national army of between 20,000 and 30,000 men, 10,000 of whom would be used to seal off the borders and airspace of Azerbaijan, preventing equipment and soldiers being flown in to Karabakh. He - and others - made much of the size and efficiency of the military forces on the Armenian side, saying that the local forces were augmented by professional fighters from Syria and Lebanon, where there are substantial Armenian minorities. A Lebanese film-maker in Agdam confirmed part of this, saying that the rich Dashnak (Armenian) community in his country was providing funds for arms and men to help their kin in Karabakh. The area has already played a role far beyond its size: in stimulating the national movement in Armenia, Karabakh lit a torch round the former Soviet Union - one still flaring in Azerbaijan. Furthermore, it is one example of a host of similar cases. All over the former union are autonomous regions of differing statuses - many within the Russian republic itself, which is home to several different peoples. The groups of politicians in Baku who claim the right to destroy these autonomies in the name of the equal rule of law are parallelled in other republican capitals - including Moscow and Kiev. They claim such regions are relics of Stalinism and so, in a sense, they are. But the fact is that the people in them cling to their autonomous status, or seek to become fully independent, through fear or a resurgent sense of nationalism. This will hardly go away without further - perhaps a great deal of - bloodshed, if no mechanism can be found to untangle these knots.</p>

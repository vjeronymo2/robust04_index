			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Management: Unravelling the threads of a complex empire - From the UK to the Caribbean, taking in Australia, north America and Israel  -how the net works Conrad Black has always had a taste for complex corporate webs, multi-tier debt arrangements and manoeuvrable structures, although his business interests are organised more simply than they used to be and he says the structure will become plainer still. Hollinger began as a mining company, but has become Black's main Canadian-quoted company for his media interests. Because of the London stock exchange's anxieties following the collapse of the Maxwell empire, Black was obliged when floating the Telegraph stake to give strict undertakings about the separation of Telegraph activities from those of Hollinger. The exchange's concerns were heightened when it came to light in the flotation process that Hollinger had failed to follow correct procedures in drawing a loan from the Telegraph, an act which some in the city thought serious enough to warrant abandoning the float, though Black dismisses it as an oversight by his own staff and by external advisers. 'To have some people encourage the inference that this had Maxwellian overtones I found somewhat irritating.' The upshot is that the Telegraph runs Europe, Australia and New Zealand and Hollinger runs north America, the Caribbean and Israel. The two companies are allowed to conduct joint ventures with each other only if the Telegraph's minority shareholders agree - Black says he was considering just such a joint venture in New York. This arrangement also means, much to Black's irritation, that should Telegraph minority holders decline a joint venture proposal in the Telegraph's territories, they would also have the right to prevent Hollinger's participation. 'Can you imagine anything so fatuous, so monstrously ultravires,' he says. 'It's a classic case of regulators setting out to protect shareholders and succeeding in damaging their interests.' Since the Telegraph has powerful cash flow and a very strong balance sheet, there has been concern among some investors that Hollinger will find unacceptable ways of taking advantage of the Telegraph's financial resources. Black says Telegraph cash 'is not available to the group except in the form of dividends justified in the context of the Telegraph business'. In 1990, Pounds 28m was paid in dividends on post-tax profits of Pounds 34.7m, contributing heavily to servicing Hollinger's debt; last year, the dividend was cut to Pounds 12m on profits of Pounds 33.9m. Black stoutly defends his record over the years in dealing with minority shareholders. 'I accept that there were concerns about that at the time of the flotation, but only the passage of time will lay those concerns properly to rest.' Meanwhile, Hollinger continues to struggle with the fact that the value of its Telegraph interest is scarcely recognised in its own share price. With Hollinger's common shares trading at around CDollars 12, the company is capitalised at about CDollars 680m (Pounds 306.3m) - about CDollars 900m, says Black, if you include warrants - whereas the Telegraph, of which Hollinger owns 68 per cent, is valued in the market at about Pounds 400m. 'It's an interesting question that we puzzle over,' says Black of Hollinger's weak share price. He puts it down to Canadian disenchantment with media stocks and the fact that only about a third of Hollinger shares are available in the market as a float.</p>

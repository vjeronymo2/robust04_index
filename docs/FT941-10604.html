			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Retailers and small business unimpressed Retailers and small businesses were unimpressed by Mr Hosokawa's package. Few believed it would boost the economy or improve their short-term sales. Most interest was focused on the tax cuts. Mr Kenichi Mitsumori, president of a small printing group employing five workers in central Tokyo, said he expected the economy to deteriorate further this year in spite of the income tax cuts. 'The income tax cut won't really affect consumers' attitudes, so I don't expect any changes in my business,' he said. 'There won't be any recovery until the automotive sector picks up. One of my clients is a US carmaker, so the bilateral trade talks are probably more important for my business than any tax cuts,' Mr Mitsumori said. Sales staff at a small Tokyo clothes store were equally unimpressed. 'The proposed tax cuts will only really affect the spending patterns of high-income earners. For most households, earning between Y7m (Pounds 43,346) and Y8m a year, life will continue to be hard, and they will continue to refrain from buying luxury clothes,' said one manager. Turnover at the shop had been stagnant and was unlikely to improve in the short term. Ms Kokusai Kikau, president of a small travel agency, took a dim view of prospects. 'I don't think the tax cut will have any influence on my business. Most of my clients are middle class, and still manage to take a trip to Hawaii. I don't think the cuts will help these people to increase the number of times they go abroad.' The Isetan department store chain said the tax cuts might boost disposable incomes, but it was hard to gauge the likely impact of the measures.</p>

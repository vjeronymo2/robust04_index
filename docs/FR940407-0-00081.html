			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act revamped part D of title I by updating the general requirements applicable to all nonattainment SIP's, placing those requirements in subpart 1 of part D, and adding subparts 2&hyph;5 to cover pollutant-specific nonattainment SIP's. Subpart 2 concerns ozone SIP's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the 1990 Amendments, the 1977 Act's requirements for nonattainment SIP's were generally retained in subpart 1, but were combined differently_the RACM and attainment date requirements were consolidated into one provision and the RACT requirement was shifted to the RACM provision. Those provisions (section 172(c)(1)&hyph;(2)) now read: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) In General_Such (nonattainment SIP) provisions shall provide for the implementation of all reasonably available control measures as expeditiously as practicable (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology) and shall provide for attainment of the national primary ambient air quality standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) RFP_Such plan provisions shall require reasonable further progress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, subpart 2 contains several RACT provisions. Most importantly, section 182(b)(2) sets out the RACT requirement for areas classified moderate or higher, as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The State shall submit a revision to the applicable implementation plan to include provisions to require the implementation of reasonably available control technology under section 172(c)(1) with respect to each of the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Each category of VOC sources in the area covered by a CTG document issued by the Administrator between the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the date of attainment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) All VOC sources in the area covered by any CTG issued before the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) All other major stationary sources of VOC's that are located in the area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each revision described in subparagraph (A) shall be submitted within the period set forth by the Administrator in issuing the relevant CTG document. The revisions with respect to sources described in subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall be submitted by 2 years after the date of the enactment of the Act, and shall provide for the implementation of the required measures as expeditiously as practicable but no later than May 31, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the 1990 Act, the EPA continues to take the position established under the 1977 Act that RACT applies in the aggregate because the RACT requirement of section 172(c)(1) of the Act is phrased identically to the RACT requirement of the 1977 Act (vis., ``existing sources''). EPA does not read section 182(b)(2) to indicate to the contrary. Rather, the cross-reference to section 172(c)(1) contained in section 182(b)(2) indicates that RACT is to be interpreted in the same manner under section 182(b)(2) as under section 172(c)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the EPA interprets the RACT requirement to authorize emissions trading among the stationary sources subject to the RACT requirement (``RACT sources'') and those not subject (``non-RACT sources'') when emissions reductions result in an amount that provides an exceptional environmental benefit, e.g., a level of reductions that is significantly greater than RACT-level amounts. This interpretation entails viewing the RACT requirement as generally requiring a specified level of reduction of emissions from stationary sources subject to RACT, but as authorizing those sources to substitute significantly greater emissions reductions credits from non-RACT sources in lieu of putting controls on themselves. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA acknowledges that the statute permits different interpretations, including the interpretation that the universe of sources subject to RACT must themselves implement RACT-level controls, and therefore may not trade with non-RACT sources. However, the EPA believes that its interpretation allowing such trading is permissible, based on the language of section 172(c)(1). The EPA's interpretation emphasizes that the RACT requirement is an emissions reduction requirement for stationary sources that is designed to yield reductions to facilitate the ultimate attainment of the NAAQS and, in the interim, RFP towards attainment (sections 172(c)(1)-(2)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 172(c)(1), as quoted above, requires SIP provisions to provide ``such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology. This provision requires an amount of emissions reductions that equates to the amount that would result from the imposition of ``RACT'', but does not require the imposition of any particular set of controls or technologies. Further, the term ``RACT'' is not defined in the statute. In light of the function of this term_to identify the level of required emissions reductions_the EPA believes the term may be defined either as a specified level of emissions to be reduced from the RACT source itself, or as little as a zero level of reductions from the RACT source, coupled with the acquisition by the RACT source of emissions reductions from sources other than RACT sources in an amount that will yield an exceptional environmental benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the level of emissions reductions required from the RACT source itself, the EPA believes that if the RACT source acquires an appropriate amount of emissions reductions ``credits'' from non-RACT sources, it is not reasonable to require additional reductions from the source itself. Under these circumstances, control technology needed to produce such reductions from the source itself is not ``reasonably available''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

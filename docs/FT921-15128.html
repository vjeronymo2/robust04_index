			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Clarke Foods shares resume trading Clarke Foods, the USM-quoted ice cream manufacturer, yesterday unveiled its Pounds 6.8m cash call and announced details of its Pounds 12m purchase of Lyons Maid from Allied-Lyons, the brewing and foods group. The 2-for-3 rights issue was pitched at 60p. Clarke's shares have been suspended at 54p pending completion of the Lyons Maid deal. Trading will resume on Monday. Mr Harry Clarke, the man who made the Klondike bar America's best-selling novelty ice cream, said institutions had been happy with the rights price. The Clarke family, which holds about 33 per cent of the company, will take up part of its entitlement, leaving it with 27 per cent of the voting rights. Hillsdown Holdings, which holds 16.75 per cent of Clarke and from which it bought its first three ice cream companies, will also take up its rights in full. Clarke will pay Allied-Lyons Pounds 8.6m on completion of the deal for Lyons Maid and the balance in 30 months. The company will also assume Lyons' trade creditors.</p>

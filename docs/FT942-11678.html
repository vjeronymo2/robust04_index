			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (13): A plastic body has its uses - Judy Dempsey goes on the trail of the disappearing 'Trabi' Mr Peter Mattauch reckons his small business which he set up last year has a good chance of surviving. Faram, employing 30 people, specialises in breaking up and recycling cars. Not only western models, but the famous Trabant - affectionately known as 'the Trabi.' The bodywork, with its spluttering two-stroke engine, is made of plastic rather than steel. It was one of the symbols of the former German Democratic Republic. But like so many other products, it was in permanent short supply. People had to wait nearly a decade for one. By the time the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, there more 1.9m Trabi drivers on the roads. As soon as unification came, many east Germans swapped their Trabi for a western car. But not everyone did. Today, more than 920,000 Trabies still chug along the roads of east Germany - 'it's surprising how many of these cars still exist,' says Mr Mattauch, whose company is based in Rohr in the eastern state of Thuringia. 'I suppose it's because the old Trabi is still cheap.' But there's another reason: the Trabi has become a bit of a cult symbol in eastern Germany, and not least, part of the nostalgia for things east German. Mr Mattauch is already breaking up 3,000 cars a year, including 1,000 Trabies. He is delighted that the east Germans have not yet deposited their Trabies at waste recycling centres - 'I'll be in business for a long time - I hope.' But don't for a moment think that there is no life after death for a Trabi. Because it is not steel, it can be shredded, melted down, and then made into a form of plaster for the building industry - which shows it has qualities hitherto unknown to its critics.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  said here today that the five principles of peaceful  co-existence, which have shown strong vitality in the past 40  years, have become an important part of the norms of  international relations and played a tremendous role in  promoting world peace and international friendly cooperation.    Addressing a meeting here today to commemorate the 40th  anniversary of their formulation, Li said these principles  provide the basis for the establishment and development of  state-to-state relations.    The principles, namely mutual respect for sovereignty and  territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference  in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit,  and peaceful co-existence, were jointly advocated by China,  India and Burma (now Myanmar) in June 1954.    Li said that the five principles were born in response to  the  call of the times. The spirit of the five principles was  embodied in the ten principles adopted by the Bandung Conference  in 1955 and reaffirmed by the Declaration on Principles of  International Law Concerning Friendly Relations Among States  adopted by the 25th session of the UN General Assembly in 1970  and the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International  Economic Order adopted by the sixth special session of the UN  General Assembly in 1974.    Many documents of international organizations and  conferences  also quoted the five principles, he added.    Li said that by observing the five principles, countries  with  different ideologies, social systems and levels of economic  development can very well establish mutual trust and friendly  and cooperative relations; by violating these principles, even  countries with identical ideologies and social systems may run  into confrontation and even armed conflict.    As a co-initiator of the five principles, he said, China has  always upheld and observed these principles.    China has established diplomatic relations with 158  countries, carried out exchanges and cooperation with over 200  countries and regions in the economic, trade, scientific and  technological and cultural fields, established amicable  relations with all its neighbors and surrounding countries, and  has resolved boundary issues left over from the past with most  of its neighbors, Li added.    The Chinese premier added that China has contributed its  share to peaceful settlement of international disputes,  promotion of international cooeration and maintenance of  regional and world peace.    Li Peng noted that the past 40 years have witnessed enormous  changes in the world, the bi-polar structure has come to an end  while the trend towards multi-polarity is accelerating.    International relations are undergoing profound changes. By  and large, the international situation is moving towards greater  relaxation of tension, and for an extended period of time, a new  world war could be averted, Li said, adding that however, the  end of the Cold War does not mean a trouble-free world.    He emphasized that non-interference in each other's internal  affairs is at the core of the five principles and the new  international order.    The world is a colorful and diversified place as witnessed  not only by different social systems, values and ideologies, but  also by different histories, traditions, religious beliefs and  cultural backgrounds among nations, he said. "Only when we  recognize these differences and respect one another will it be  possible to expand cooperation, increase exchanges and live in  harmony," Li said.    To impose one's own values and model of society on others is  bound to lead to tension and confrontation between states, Li  said.    Li said mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial  integrity  and mutual non-aggression and peaceful co-existence between  states is the basis of the five principles and a new  international order, Li said.    Such actions as undermining or divesting another country of  its sovereignty, violating or annexing another country's  territory or resorting to the threat of use of force to advance  one's own policy under whatever pretext should not be allowed,  Li said.    He pointed out that Deng Xiaoping has made penetrating  comments on the five principles. Deng had put forth the great  concept of "one country, two systems" to settle the questions of  Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.    Deng said: "We have initiated the concept of 'one country,  two systems' for the settlement of issues concerning China's  reunification. It will also be a kind of peaceful co-existence."    Li said Deng also pointed out that as for some territorial  disputes between nations, the question of sovereignty may be put  aside for the time being and joint development may go ahead  first.    "We are actively discussing with the countries concerned  ways  of joint development in the disputed areas with a view to  maintaining peace and stability in the region and averting  tension," Li said.    Equality and mutual benefit of the five principles is a  principle guiding economic relations, Li said. "Countries  should learn from each other in economic development and help  supply each other's needs through mutually-beneficial  cooperation on an equal footing, whereas trade protectionism of  any form and exchanges of unequal values are undesirable."    Li emphasized that the Chinese people are devoting  themselves  heart and soul to the modernization of their country. "We need  a peaceful international environment and want to develop  friendly relations and cooperation with all other countries."    In conclusion, Li said that holding high the banner of the  five principles of peaceful co-existence, the Chinese Government  and people will join other countries in working for the  establishment of a new international political and economic  order and for a better future for all mankind.</p>

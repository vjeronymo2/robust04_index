He said: The 14th CPC Congress and the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee laid  down the basic framework of the socialist market economy  structure. A series of reform measures has been or will be  announced. In accordance with the unified central arrangements,  we should be bold and good at making overall progress and at  bringing about breakthroughs in focal points in light of Hubei's  specific conditions.    1. We must emancipate our minds significantly, really  understand that the fundamental task of socialism is to  emancipate the productive forces, uphold the basic standard of  the three favorable's, and free ourselves from all sorts of  ideological binds resulting from the abstract debate over  whether something being done is of a socialist or capitalist  nature.    2. We must make a major move in terms of policy, thoroughly  rid ourselves of the influence of the traditional planned  economic structure, and in the planning, financial, monetary,  commercial, and trade fields, we should work out a set of rules,  regulations, and methods corresponding to the market economy.    3. In action, we must produce actual results and develop  the spirit of being bold in blazing new trails. In  macroeconomic management and microeconomic invigoration, we must  do well. For these reasons, we must do the following jobs  successfully, and in accordance with the realities in Hubei: 1)  While focusing on improving large and medium-sized state  enterprises, we must expedite the establishment of a modern  enterprise system; 2) We must cultivate and develop a market  system so as to form a uniform, open, competitive, and orderly  market; 3) We must expedite institutional reform, transform  government functions, and make a success of macroeconomic  regulation and control; 4) We must actively carry out financial  and taxation structural reform and must establish a local  financial and taxation system; 5) We must deepen investment  structural reform and strengthen the formation of a local  investment structure; 6) We must widen the avenues leading to  fund sources and strive to turn Hubei into the country's fund  pool.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by journalist Jean Luckenson on ceremony to install </F> Jonassaint cabinet held at the National Palace in Port-au-Prince  on 16 May; passages within italics in Creole -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] Emile Jonassaint installed a new  12-member government on 16 May, less than 2 hours after his  first presidential decree appointing the main members of the  ministerial cabinet. The ceremony took place in the diplomatic  lounge of the National Palace. Jean Luckenson reports:    [Luckenson] The big rendezvous on the afternoon of  Monday, 16 May, a few minutes before 1600 was at the diplomatic  lounge of the National Palace where attorney Emile Jonassaint,  provisional president of the Republic, was to present his  six-point government plan. He gave each of the ministers of his  cabinet a document symbolizing their commitment -- or their  taking office.    The six major, priority, points of the Jonassaint government  are: to eradicate criminality; to guarantee safety and peace in  the nation's homes; to enforce Justice; to halt the boat people  phenomenon; to lower the cost of living; and to increase the  public revenues.    Jonassaint did not forget the students who will take  baccalaureat exams this year, nor the arrangements he will set  up for the electoral deadlines.    [Jonassaint] I have identified six essential priorities for  a  program of action. The first will have to do with buttressing  order and security in Haiti within respect for the fundamental  rights of the citizens. Concerned with eradicating criminality  in Haiti and thereby establishing a true social peace based on a  rule of law, my government is willing to firmly ensure the  protection of lives and property. To that end, a national  commission to guarantee the safety of the citizenry will be  created.    My government commits itself to strengthening the structures  of Justice to [word indistinct] to halt the boat-people  phenomenon.    [Luckenson] Jonassaint wants the private sector to  cooperate with his government, and [says] they can count on his  commitment and determination to protect their interests. [He  explains that] he will manage to perform, in keeping with the  possibilities of the moment.    [Jonassaint] As for the private sector, I would like its  active cooperation in the process begun in the country. It can  already count on my deep determination to protect its interests.    [Luckenson] Thanking the audience, the provisional  president praised the courage and determination of the ministers  who make up his cabinet. He asked the ministers to work hard,  for the job is not easy, while the national and international  communities are expecting much from them. Although the national  soul is wounded, the cabinet must work for the people and the  nation.    [Jonassaint] As members of the cabinet, well, I [word  indistinct] salute your courage and your high sense of civic  responsibility and patriotism. From now on, the country would  like to be able to look upon us with pride. The nation's too  often wounded pride, its so often endangered and even mortgaged  sovereignty....[changes thought] Let us, then, go and work for  the Haitian people, for the nation. If someone has something  [words indistinct] against our lives, then, let us die.    [Luckenson] In his speech, which lasted about 10  minutes, Jonassaint presented himself as an apostle, a prophet  who will guide those under him toward the path of progress for  the future. In concluding, Jonassaint said: To die for one's  homeland is fine; let us dig with pleasure.    After his speech, the unofficial Office of the Senate of the  Republic -- which is presided over by Bernard Sansaricq, a  member of the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion and the family  of contested senators [issuing from] the [contested] 18 January  [1993] elections -- paid its respects to Jonassaint; then came  the turn of Chamber of Deputies delegation made up of Deputies  Denis Saint-Fort, Emmanuel Reyme, Pierre Francois Vital, Jacques  Lafleur, and Laguerre. Next, the Armed Forces High Command,  headed by Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras, gave the provisional  president a military salute. Respects were then paid to  Jonassaint by the president and vice-president of the Supreme  Court of Accounts and Administrative Litigation, the chairman of  the board of directors of the Banque Nationale de Credit, and  members and representatives of various opposition parties.    In the opinion of attorney Mireille Durocher Bertin, the  provisional president's principal private secretary, Article 149  is a partial solution to the crisis the country is experiencing.  This is a process of national rescue, [she said, and] we are  moving forward.    [Bertin] This process...[changes thought] We are looking for  a national rescue solution and, as you know, Article 149 is  (?obviously) a provisional solution. Thus, we are moving  forward, and with the grace of God, Haiti will be saved.    [Luckenson] From what we managed to see, Emmanuel  Constant, head of the neo-Duvalierist party Revolutionary Front  for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, was not present, nor  was engineer Franck Pierre, head of the Capois Lamort  Organization. Professor [Hubert] de Ronceray was absent as well.    According to what we saw, the government is not headed by a  prime minister. It is made up of only 12 ministers: one woman  and 11 men.    Many observers following the crisis in Haiti are very  worried, in view of the Haitian people's alarming situation:  power outages, a high cost of living. In the next few days, the  international community will strengthen the economic sanctions  against Haiti, while threats of [military] intervention are  hanging over the country's head. The question, which remains  without an answer, is the following: Has Haiti become Hollywood?  Is it a two-headed country? Two senate presidents are fighting  for a single chair; there are two presidents of the Republic,  and two governments of the Republic for a small population, a  single nation.    This is Jean Luckenson for Signal FM.</p>

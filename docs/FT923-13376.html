			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (5): Hostile attitude is fading - Japanese transplants drive UK component supplier standards BY THE mid to late 1990s, close to Pounds 2bn worth of UK and Continental European-sourced components are expected to be flowing annually into the UK car manufacturing plants of Nissan, Toyota and Honda. Of this total, much the biggest proportion - around 70 per cent - is being sourced from either British components groups such as Lucas Industries, GKN and T &amp; N, or the UK subsidiaries of Continental European components groups such as Robert Bosch of Germany and Valeo of France. The situation is very different from the mid-1980s, when most chief executives of leading British component groups shared with Ford and other UK-based car makers an open hostility towards the prospect of Japanese car manufacturing in the UK. They believed Nissan and other Japanese car makers who might follow it would bring in on their coat-tails their own components suppliers from Japan, provoking a bitter fight for survival in the European components industry as well as among its car makers. Those most sceptical about the long-term intentions of the Japanese industry suggest that this still cannot be ruled out. They argue that the influx will simply take longer and be more subtle than in North America, where there are more than 300 Japanese suppliers for the nearly 1.7m vehicles now built in the US and Canada each year by Japanese 'transplants', from which the indigenous US components industry protests loudly that it is being excluded. Senior UK-based components group executives such as Sir David Lees, chairman and chief executive of GKN, and Mr Bob Dale, managing director of Lucas Industries' automotive division, are inclined to give such cynicism increasingly short shrift. They assert that even if Japanese suppliers were to start arriving in force, they would find the leading players in the indigenous European industry much more formidable opponents than in North America. Remarkably, in the case of many of the several hundred UK and Continental companies already supplying Nissan's Sunderland car plant, or preparing to supply Honda's Swindon and Toyota's Derby plants when commercial production starts later this year, this confidence is substantially due to their fast-developing contacts with the Japanese 'transplants'. They have come to realise that the Japanese manufacturers' stated desire for long-term partnerships with their component suppliers represents considerably more than lip service to an ideal. Those who have survived the long, painstaking selection process have found themselves adjusting to a relationship in which they have been faced with demands for unprecedented quality and consistency standards - but given close and continuing help and advice to achieve them. The onus is being placed firmly on them, as suppliers, to undertake the design and development of components - with assurances that having done so, they will be long-term, sole suppliers. They have had to adjust to the cultural trauma, for companies long used to an adversarial, price-haggling relationship with western car makers, of having to open their books to the Japanese companies to see how prices and costs have been arrived at - and how both might be lowered co-operatively, with car and component maker sharing the benefit. As the Economist Intelligence Unit stresses in a new study* of the UK motor components industry, already it is the Japanese UK transplants which are driving the UK's component supplier standards. And on the evidence of a study of Nissan's Sunderland suppliers published last year by the National Economic Development Office, much of the components industry still has a long way to go. It found Japanese component suppliers to have achieved a rejection rate of 50 per million, while the UK industry average is around one per 1,000. Inevitably, the prospect of UK car production more than doubling compared with early 1980s levels to comfortably exceed 2m by the mid- to late-1990s (of which the Japanese 'transplants' will account for more than one-third) has acted as a magnet for overseas components companies. Some are indeed Japanese. Their principal ventures include a Pounds 65m Nippondenso plant about to start producing air conditioning systems at Telford, Shropshire, and in which Fiat's Magneti Marelli components subsidiary is a minority joint venture partner, and the virtual takeover by Nippondenso and Calsonic of all independent cooling systems manufacture in the UK, through their respective acquisitions of the former IMI Radiators and Llanelli Radiator. However, the claim of Nissan, Toyota and Honda that only a relative handful of Japanese-owned or joint venture companies are supplying their plants is broadly correct. In each case, there are fewer than a dozen. Robert Bosch of Germany and Valeo, the French components giant, are among those contributing to what the EIU report describes as a surge of inward investment 'the like of which has not been seen for 40 years'. The tendency of new investments to be concentrated in specific areas is having a profound impact on some UK regions which have been hardest hit by industrial change and recession. For example, they are transforming the economy and prospects of Wales, which is fast becoming one of the UK's most important motor components centres. According to figures from the Welsh Development Agency, Wales now hosts 150 such components companies, which between them employ 16,000 people. 'Flagship' ventures include Bosch's Pounds 100m green field plant to produce alternators near Cardiff, which expects to be making 5m alternators a year and employing 1,200 people by 1995. Output started last year. A few weeks ago, Volkswagen of Germany, one of the plant's customers, took delivery of the millionth alternator produced at the plant. Meanwhile, Valeo has moved into a WDA plant in South Wales to produce air conditioning and heating systems. But one of Wales' biggest motor components projects is being provided directly by Toyota, through its Pounds 140m engine plant at Deeside, in North Wales. The plant is to go on stream within the next two months, and will eventually produce up to 200,000 engines a year, some of which are destined for export to Japan. GKN's Sir David Lees can point to surging supplies to Japanese car makers as underlining his relative lack of concern about his company's ability to compete. He expects such sales to top Pounds 120m this year and to continue rising swiftly thereafter as Honda and Toyota output in the UK gets under way. GKN already supplies Nissan with all its driveshafts at Sunderland, and its Hardy Spice facility in Birmingham will start supplying Toyota and Honda later this year. It has already established supplies with Japanese transplants in the US, its latest involvement contract being a Dollars 15m-a-year contract to supply constant velocity driveshafts for a new range of medium saloons Mazda is putting into production at Flat Rock, Michigan. T &amp; N, Lucas, Triplex, AB Electronics, BBA and BTR are among other groups forging increasingly close contacts with the Japanese, not just in Europe but in some other cases than GKN in North America, and even Japan, as well. All the principal UK players recognise that, for survival through the 1990s, even a European business perspective is no longer enough. They must be capable of responding globally to a car industry which has already globalised, and which has already led to T &amp; N chairman Mr Colin Hope, Sir David and others leading their companies into joint ventures giving them a presence in every developing marketplace, as well as in the established car-producing regions. *The UK Automotive Components Industry.

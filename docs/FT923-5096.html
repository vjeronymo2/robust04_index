			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Washington cool on oilseeds 'progress' US officials yesterday played down talk of progress towards a resolution of their oilseeds dispute with the European Community. The two sides appear to have drawn different conclusions on the outcome of talks between Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, and Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday. Mrs Hills said after the meeting she had not agreed to any new deadline for resolving the argument. 'I didn't agree to extend anything. We just said our patience had run its course,' she told the Journal of Commerce. But officials said the oilseeds issue was only a minor point in Mrs Hills' meeting with Mr Andriessen, which was largely devoted to the broader aim of concluding the Uruguay Round of talks to revise the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). US officials said they wanted to assure the EC that the US presidential election in November should have no bearing on the Gatt talks. The US and EC appear still to be far apart on the oilseeds question. Although Brussels is willing to discuss compensation to US farmers for the sales of oilseeds they say they have lost, they have refused to consider dismantling their oilseeds programme, which Washington sees as vital to any settlement. Although some observers believe the US would be reluctant to impose the punitive tariffs it has threatened on Dollars 1bn (Pounds 502m) of food and drink imports from the EC without the approval of a full Gatt meeting scheduled for September 29, US officials maintain they already have the right to impose these sanctions.</p>

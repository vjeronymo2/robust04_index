			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Official version of history upheld JAPAN'S Supreme Court has ended a 31-year dispute by ruling that the Ministry of Education has the right to change textbooks to ensure that a 'standardised' version of history is taught in schools. The ruling ends a legal challenge by a former Tokyo professor whose text, A New Japanese History, was rejected in 1962 by the ministry, essentially because it contained a blunt assessment of Japan's military aggression in Asia during the 1930s and 1940s. China and South Korea have complained that the education ministry's control over textbooks and its use of euphemism to describe wartime brutality have left Japanese ignorant of the past. Mr Saburo Ienaga, 79, a former professor at the Tokyo University of Education, said the rejection of his case against the ministry violates the Japanese constitution by allowing the government unrestricted power to censor school texts. 'This decision makes me very angry. I think it is very disappointing for Japan,' said Mr Ienaga, who was appealing against a lower court decision to dismiss a Y1.9m (Pounds 11,000) suit filed by him against the ministry. Passages of the high school text rejected by the ministry include a description of the Japanese army's advance as 'reckless', and comments that 'the war was glamorised'. The Supreme Court ruled that the ministry had the right to recommend changes or disqualify texts from school lists as long as its decisions are 'reasonable', and that its reservations about Mr Ienaga's history book were reasonable. However, the court warned the ministry that its power to alter texts should be used selectively. Ms Mayumi Moriyama, the education minister, said the court's ruling was welcome because the ministry should retain the right to determine the content of school texts and standardise history lessons, though this power must be used 'appropriately'. In a 1974 ruling, the Tokyo District Court awarded Mr Ienaga Y100,000 after judging that 19 of the ministry's 200 objections to his work were unfair. But in 1986 the Tokyo High Court overturned that ruling.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 13 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has  already begun changing nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt  reactor in Yongbyon without the supervision of International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspectors.    In a telex message sent to IAEA headquarters in Vienna on  Thursday, North Korea also said it was prepared to allow  additional IAEA inspections of a key radiochemical laboratory.    Despite the latest development, the IAEA plans to send a  team  of inspectors on Sunday to check the radiochemical laboratory  and service surveillance equipment in other facilities, IAEA  spokesman David Kyd said in Vienna Friday.    The agency had insisted that its inspectors must be present  when North Korea changes nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt  reactor. The IAEA said it would send inspectors only when  Pyongyang postponed the refueling.    Nevertheless, the U.N. nuclear watchdog has decided to  dispatch inspectors in the apparent belief that North Korea has  not yet removed the fuel rods from the reactor, informed sources  here said.    The United States has also said it would suspend dialogue  with North Korea if it changed the fuel rods without an IAEA  presence. But the sources said Washington will now decide  whether to hold a third round of high-level talks after learning  the outcome of the IAEA inspections.    State Department deputy spokesman David Johnson said  Washington was not in a position to comment on further talks  with North Korea until it heard from the IAEA on the result of  the upcoming inspections. The IAEA alone must determine whether  the continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea has been  maintained, Johnson said. Only then will the U.S. Government  decide on the third round of negotiations.    What the United States is interested in right now is to  choose the spent nuclear fuel rods at random and preserve them  for later checks, said another State Department official,  requesting anonymity.    Another diplomatic source here said "All is not clear at the  moment" with regard to the changing of the nuclear fuel rods.  However, it appears that North Korea has just begun preparations  for refueling, rather than having taken fuel rods out of the  reactor, he added.    The contents of Pyongyang's message to the IAEA will not  influence the prospect for U.S.-North Korean talks, he said,  adding that a firm evaluation of the overall situation will be  made after the IAEA inspectors' visit.    Meanwhile, Pak Yong-nam, minister of the Atomic Energy  Industry, said in the telex to the IAEA that North Korea was  compelled to begin changing nuclear fuel rods because the IAEA  had failed to send an inspection team, attaching unjustifiable  conditions.    The message was addressed to IAEA Secretary-general Hans  Blix.    Pyongyang nevertheless welcomed the IAEA's decision to send  inspectors, though belatedly. North Korea will allow them to  inspect its experimental nuclear power generating station and  the radiochemical laboratory in order to maintain the continuity  of nuclear safeguards, it said.    North Korea has also proposed resuming negotiations with the  IAEA to resolve complicated problems with the refueling.    It would be more productive to hold the negotiations close  to  where the refueling is proceeding, it said, hinting that it  wants to hold talks in Pyongyang.    Referring to the refueling, North Korea said work has just  begun and that there would be many opportunities for the IAEA to  collect the spent fuel rods at random and preserve them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zeljko Kruselj: "Faith in Conspiracy"] </F>   [Text] The already well-known report from the fourth  session of the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] Presidency on  "the current political situation in Croatia" has recently also  been published in THE HDZ HERALD. The report's significance lies  in the fact that it was accompanied by a picture of the  participants of the session, which is supposed to do most to  deny "malicious misinformation about the alleged rift in the HDZ  and replacement of its officials." In that picture, Stipe Mesic  and Gojko Susak were seated next to Franjo Tudjman, and the  seating arrangements -- to the president's left and to his right  -- "ideologically" mirrors the division within the party, and so  does the position of other "polemists."    However, the problem lies in the fact that the latest  attempt  to homogenize the ruling party should be secured primarily by  means of a fierce attack on the opposition, which was this time  accused of "destabilizing the democratic system." The report  says that "the moves and demands of some opposition parties lead  to a constitutional crisis and early elections, and thus  obviously jeopardize the internal stability and the  international position of the Republic of Croatia," and that  their goal is "to cause dissatisfaction among the people and  even stimulate strikes" in order to "provoke a constitutional  crisis and overthrow the authorities."  <H5>  "Scenario From Abroad" </H5>   Jure Radic, HDZ secretary general, was even more direct  during his visit last week to the county of Dubrovnik and  Neretva, accusing unmentioned parties of betraying national  interests. He spoke of "unwritten scenarios from abroad on how  to destroy Croatian authorities that were elected in a  democratic manner," and added that "some opposition parties have  been receiving such scenarios for six months." The sharpness of  Radic's statement may stem from the fact that he made it in  Cavtat, i.e., exactly where the present authorities are being  severely criticized for negotiating the possible "trading of the  territory of southern Dalmatia," so it would be wise to redirect  the wrath of the inhabitants of Konavli to something else. It  is, however, more probable that the statement was a part of a  more general pressure on the opposition, so that the ruling  party could take the political initiative to the full.    Anyway, if we analyze the opening statement of President  Tudjman at the said session of the HDZ Presidency, the  inevitable conclusion is that black days are ahead for  opposition parties, especially for those with large memberships.  Referring to the necessity for "unified national politics," the  Croatian president elaborated on the "scenario" for "causing a  constitutional crisis," and the only argument he presented were  "written guidelines" from abroad sent to "a party." He did not  say whether the unmentioned party required those "guidelines"  itself and implemented them in its political practice, as if  those "details are not important at all." The fact that Radic,  on the other hand, came up with several instead of just one  party is just a consequence of an intellectually well-organized  political campaign directed against Tudjman's non-party  opponents, for example against "the six" who demanded his  resignation last fall, but also against the press and trade  unions.    Tudjman's speech to the 15 "apostles," obviously also  designed to make them see which of them is the HDZ "Judas,"  shows that the ruling party cannot break free from the  "conspiracy" syndrome typical of one-party systems. Commonplace  political fighting, which also consists of contacts with similar  parties abroad, is thus consciously turned into "undermining the  foundations of the state," which, as a logical countermeasure,  could result in introducing some elements of open police and  court repression.    Another proof that this method is worthwhile is what  happened  with Paraga's Croatian Rights Party [HSP]. The party's political  extremism did not encounter resistance when it was beneficial  for the authorities, when it made it easier for them to gather  volunteers for the war. But after the political situation had  settled, the HSP was accused of something that could not  actually even be proven. HSP leaders were eventually acquitted  of charges that they attempted to "undermine the constitutional  system," but the goal of that show has nevertheless been  realized: Paraga has been totally discredited and the HSP  marginalized. Moreover, the late Ivan Cesar, who was separately  working on gathering Croatian Christian Democrats, was ridiculed  in the famous documentary about Bruno Busic.    Something like that now also threatens the Croatian Social  Liberal Party [HSLS], the only party that can now undermine the  present political monopoly of the HDZ. Regarding the liberals,  the problem does not lie in "instructions from abroad" or if the  president and the secretary general of the ruling party consider  them "conspirators" at all. Budisa's followers, according to  Tudjman, jeopardize Croatian interests for more global strategic  reasons. The key problem, therefore, is the fact that the HSLS  has assimilated into the typical framework of  "liberal-democratic" understanding of national question in  post-communist Europe. According to Tudjman, it was that option  that was "directed toward preserving Yugoslavia and secretly  hoped for the defeat of Croatia in 1991, especially this  Croatia, sovereign and on its own."  <H5>  Launching Against the HSLS </H5>   Consequently, the conclusion of the Croatian president is  even more explicit and unrelenting: "The liberal-civic concept  is looking for support in the strata of the Croatian psyche, and  it gets it, not only from those who feel nostalgia for  Yugoslavia, but also from those preoccupied by those wide  universalist, cosmopolitan ideas.... It has been trying to  prevent the HDZ from winning the elections, since it could not  prevent Tudjman from being elected (at the latest elections), in  order to be able, through weakening the coalition or by means of  concessions to each other, to redirect Croatian politics."    What is even more interesting, at the session of the HDZ  Presidency, Tudjman also pointed his political cutting edge  toward the "Catholic-universalist" concept from which European  Christian Democracy stems. The Croatian president is convinced  that international diplomacy today also uses Catholicism to  thwart authentic Croatian interests. To be more precise, the  matter at issue is a statement by Pope John Paul II, of 4  January this year, in which he made a hypothetical reference to  "the community of southern Slavs." For Tudjman, that was a clear  sign of a turning point in the official politics of the Vatican,  especially as some 10 days later, the Pope condemned "extreme  nationalism": "Therefore, from the viewpoint of world  Christianity and from the viewpoint of Catholicism, the Croats  are entrusted with again being a bridge toward the Orthodox  creed for uniting Christianity. To that effect it was announced  that, if there is peace and should the Holy Father accept the  invitation and visit Croatia, in addition to Zagreb, he would  visit both Sarajevo and Belgrade."    Finding a global "conspiracy" in intertwining liberal-civic  and Catholic-universalist options, and considering the past  repugnance to social-democratic views on the Croatian reality on  the international scene, Tudjman is becoming more and more  lonely, which may have negative repercussions for settling  conflicts on the territory of former Yugoslavia. In public, the  responsibility for that will, of course, be redirected to the  "subversive" activities of some opposition parties, primarily  those that openly oppose Croatian politics in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. If that should not prove successful enough,  then the possibility that "some party members who are not  willing to enforce the state politics may leave," as Jure Radic  announced directly in Cavtat. Tudjman, as we know, does not  advocate "disturbing the balance" in the party. It is still  safer to shift the burden of blame for present and future  failures of Croatian politics onto his opponents.    The opposition, on the other hand, is still not capable of  using the weaknesses of the ruling party to its advantage,  although Tudjman's followers have probably reached their  all-time low in their five-year history. Before the press,  Drazen Budisa openly admits that the popularity of his party  "has fallen in relation to the post-election period," and he is  also aware of the negative effects "of a fierce media campaign"  that is systematically directed against the liberals. Stipac's  Croatian Peasant's Party, as the only party that is gradually  ramifying the network of its branches, has actually never dealt  with "high politics," except for the personal frustrations of  its president regarding the events in central Bosnia. Savka's  Croatian National Party, which the ruling party ironically  refers to as "nationalists without people," cannot get over the  debacle that happened a year and a half ago.    The Left keep talking about their unification and it will  never come, so that only Racan's social democrats are present in  the public, mostly regarding social questions. The Right is even  more disoriented, so that a possible unification would not make  them a major political party.    Dalmatian regionalists contracted Paraga's "disease," and  they have to prove their innocence in court, while the Istrian  Democratic Congress is becoming more and more like an "Istrian  HDZ," regarding the fact that there is a strong conflict of  political factions in the party. And finally, Serbian parties  and forums are not a real opposition either, but only serve as  "test balloons" of official Croatian politics.  <H5>  Why Is Tudjman Concerned? </H5>   Bearing in mind those realities regarding the opposition, it  becomes even more vague why Tudjman is so concerned about rumors  about "overthrowing the legal Croatian authorities." If that is  just political "scenography" for unpopular moves on the domestic  and international scene, especially regarding the peace accord  between Zagreb and Belgrade, then this game makes some sense.  If, on the other hand, the political public is being forcefully  "disciplined," Croatia will soon have to deal with more trouble.</p>

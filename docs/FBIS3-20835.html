			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Radovanovic: "The Turnkey and the Fortress"] </F>   [Text] Now that the Serbian Government has controlled  Radio-TV Serbia for three years, the opposition will try to  right things by turning back the clock a bit. According to the  bills on the Radio-TV which DEPOS [Democratic Movement of  Serbia] and the SRS [Serbian Radical Party] have prepared, each  on its own, the Assembly would reassume power over operation of  television --from Appointment of the general director to  definition of programming policy.    According to the case made by the Radicals and DEPOS,  television would thereby cease to be a one-party institution,  and its pluralization would automatically terminate the  influence which the Socialists have at the moment on the shape  of TV programs. "We are in a big hurry," says Zarko Korac of the  Citizens Alliance [GS], explaining that the reasons for this lie  in precisely what television is showing and that the solutions  proposed, again because of the hurry, can be referred to as  "initial and transitional."  <H5>  The Bills </H5>   One of the differences between the two opposition bills lies  in the institution of the programming committee, an idea that is  backed in DEPOS; it would have 20 members (half from among  people's deputies and the other half made up of figures in  science, culture and public life, along with three members from  Radio-TV). The principal tasks of the programming committee, as  seen by the people from DEPOS, would be to appoint editors in  chief and managing editors, to establish overall radio and  television policy and to set down the rules for presentation of  party programs and candidates over radio and television during  the election campaign.    In their bill the Radicals assign these functions to the  managing board, and both parties envisage the institution of an  oversight committee, which is also quite well-known already. The  Radicals try to solve the problem of the general director by  having him chosen after each election, and DEPOS with a  provision prohibiting him from any participation in a body of  government or in the parliament itself (Milorad Vucelic, the  present general director, heads the caucus of the SPS [Socialist  Party of Serbia] in the Serbian Assembly).    The Radicals and DEPOS differ in the way they solve the  problem of allocation of radio frequencies. In the DEPOS version  this function would also be assigned to the Assembly, that is,  to a committee which it chooses, while the Radicals would leave  the question of frequencies to the Government, which would  allocate them according to criteria proposed in the Radical Law  on Radio-Television. To be sure, the Government will also  operate through a commission, but the influence of the Assembly  would be that the Committee for Culture and Information would  nominate to the Government candidates for membership on the  commission. In addition to the attempt to solve the problem  which is obviously the main one for the opposition --  television, in DEPOS they have gone a step further and also  drafted a proposed Law on Information. The most important thing  in that bill is that it envisages the existence of several, not  just one, newspaper organization and the institution of the  ombudsman. According to the conception, the ombudsman would be a  single official elected by the Assembly and nominated by the  relevant committee of the Assembly, and his principal task would  be to protect the public's right to know.    He would be chosen from among the ranks of experts in  communication science, law and journalism; he would work  independently (in response to complaints and requests of legal  entities and individuals), and his decisions would be binding on  those in positions of responsibility.    Aside from the purely mathematical problem that would arise  if the parties do not dovetail their bills and if they should  get in a situation where they cannot get a sufficient number of  votes for them, there are several other stumbling blocks for  everything the Radicals and DEPOS have conceived.    "Neither of the bills really gets to a mastodon like  Radio-TV  Serbia, nor do they establish new rules of the game," says  Professor Dragor Hiber, himself a member of the GS, and he adds:  "If the idea is to change one master for another, then that is a  bad idea, and in addition it is condemned to failure for the  simple reason that the opposition does not have the votes to get  it through the parliament."  <H5>  Defects </H5>   Professor Hiber believes that it makes no difference which  majority party has a decisive influence on television, remarking  that experience (both our own and abroad) indicates that at some  point that influence can be cemented into place. Worst of all,  once that happens, television and the person who controls it  have every opportunity to help one another in preventing any  change whatsoever.    The problem which Professor Hiber mentions pertains to  literally everything which the Radicals and DEPOS have conceived  in their bills. All the good intentions will depend, that is, on  the one who has the majority in the Assembly, so that what could  easily happen in the future is that one of the figures of  Radio-TV Serbia, hated by the opposition, might become the  "fair-minded ombudsman," and the programming or oversight  committee of television would go on doing the same things as the  oversight committee for monitoring the election.    The opposition, then, omitted to concern itself with the  most  important thing in this entire tale -- establishing clear rules  of the game that would not depend on the momentary balance of  power in the parliament and that would prevent all the  well-known evils familiar to us, from bribery to blackmail.    Neither of the sponsors has any explanation for this  omission  other than haste. The main issues have been left for some time  in the future, when presumably there would be less haste and  less fear of the "TV Bastille." At the moment the most important  thing for the opposition is to change at least the turnkey in  the ill-famed fortress.    In Professor Hiber's opinion, there is a mistake even in  that  notion, since it could easily happen that the opposition's bill,  if it should pass the Assembly, would be struck down in the  Constitutional Court. "The constitution, which calls for a  separation of powers, sees the Assembly concerning itself with  general enactments, not individual enactments, while the DEPOS  bill envisages a number of individual enactments through  commissions that would concern themselves with particular  matters, which is certainly unconstitutional."  <H5>  The Ground in Between </H5>   Acknowledging that these bills nevertheless represent  "transitional solutions," Dragor Hiber also said that the most  important thing would be to take away from Radio-TV Serbia its  undeserved title to the infrastructure (transmitters and  frequencies -- the Radical bill contains something like that)  and then to compel it to concern itself with its own  programming, in which it would be subject to strict rules.    The laws of the market (in obtaining frequencies) and those  same rules of the game envisaged by law in creating programming  that would apply to government television ought to apply to the  other, nongovernmental, television stations, which on this  occasion were not a concern of either the Radicals or DEPOS,  which left them in some middle ground not regulated by anything,  according to Professor Hiber. The Radicals, it is true, envisage  certain rules for allocating and taking away radio frequencies,  but even that concept breaks down as soon as one moves on to the  parts of the bill concerned with government television. The  essence of even their bill lies in minuscule limitation of the  influence of the Socialists today -- that is, in taking control  tomorrow if they get in power.</p>

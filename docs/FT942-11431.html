			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Worries over US monetary policy upset bourses Worries that the US might once again tighten monetary policy made its effect felt on many bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT eased slightly although the utilities went against the trend as investors continued to search for value. The Dax index weakened 3.27 to 2,249.02, after a session high of 2,259. The market was unimpressed by a further easing in the repo rate and worried again by the implications of a weak dollar. Comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, that a strong D-Mark was detrimental helped the dollar recover some ground later in the day on the currency markets, assisted by heavy intervention by central banks. He also commented that inflation was expected soon to be below 3 per cent, but stressed that further rate cuts must not interfere with the aim of ensuring price stability. Fears that the US might raise interest rates hit shares in post bourse trading, with the Ibis indicated index closing at 2,245.40. Schering disappointed the market, off DM10 at DM1,123 following first quarter results. Among the utilities RWE, which has said that it expects to increase its dividend payout this year, rose DM1.70 to DM476.00 and Veba DM3.50 to DM534.00. Lufthansa was suspended at Tuesday's close of DM219.80 after announcing details of its capital increase and privatisation programme. PARIS fell sharply late in the day on volatility in the futures market. The CAC-40 index, which had earlier seen a session high of 2,169, closed off 37.42 or 1.7 per cent at 2,141.57. While most analysts are expecting the Bank of France to ease interest rates again today this has already been discounted in the markets. Goldman Sachs in its latest strategy document said that it maintained a positive stance on the market in spite of its poor performance so far this year. The investment bank recommends an overweight position, on the basis of GDP growth, upgraded from 1.2 per cent to 1.5 per cent, while projecting a rise in earnings for cyclicals based on 'productivity gains and restructuring measures taken last year'. UAP lost FFr2.30 to FFr158, with indications that the public offering had been two times subscribed. MILAN remained under pressure as foreign investors took profits and confidence was dented by a call from Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern League leader, for a pause for reflection in talks on a new government. The Comit index fell 16.28 or 2 per cent to 783.19. Industrials which have made strong, speculative rises were sold. Fiat lost L217 or 3.2 per cent to L6,656 and Pirelli fell L99 or 3.3 per cent to L2,956. Montedison gave up another L55 or 3.7 per cent to L1,490 in further response to its worse than expected results. Fondiaria, 6.8 per cent higher on Tuesday amid speculation that Mediobanca, the merchant bank, might use some of the cash from its rights issue to raise its stake, fell L678 or 4.2 per cent to L15,570. Mediobanca fell another L590 to L17,200. ZURICH fell 1.8 per cent to its low for the year, even though a firmer dollar provided some support late in the day. The SMI index fell 50.3 to 2,705.6 with an absence of domestic demand leaving the market unable to absorb selling by foreign investors, switching to Germany. The financial sector remained under pressure. UBS bearers fell SFr20 to SFr1,136, CS Holding lost SFr13 to SFr604 and SBC gave up SFr11 to SFr375. Winterthur bearers dropped SFr30 or 4.6 per cent to SFr621 as the European Commission said it would review the Swiss insurer's plans to acquire Germany's DBV from Commerzbank. Roche certificates fell another SFr80 to SFr6,610 in further response to its Dollars 5.3bn bid for Syntex, the US drugs group. Analysts noted that the fall would have been greater but for the continued support of one private Zurich bank. AMSTERDAM was upset by a combination of events: the defeat, although expected, of the coalition government in Tuesday's general election; a weaker bond market; and the weaker dollar. The AEX gave up all of the gains made in the first two days of the week, ending off 4.65 at 411.74. Philips slipped 40 cents to Fl 56.60 after reporting a significant increase in first quarter profits but warning that the rest of the year was likely to remain difficult. MADRID was 1.8 per cent lower on continuing concern about the the minority Socialist government's ability to remain in power following allegations of financial irregularities by former members of the ruling administration. The general index fell 5.78 to 311.57, also weighed by rumours that the sovereign debt rating was to be lowered, in spite of denials by leading rating agencies. Banesto fell Pta125 or 9.8 per cent to Pta1,155 after its 70 per cent surge since the start of last week. Telefonica gave up Pta40 to Pta1,735 in heavy volume.

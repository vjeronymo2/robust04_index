			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Markets greet Tokyo moves with scepticism JAPAN'S emergency economic package yesterday was greeted with scepticism by the Tokyo financial community, which saw the government's announcement as little more than a rehash of long-discussed reforms. One proposal, to develop the domestic corporate bond market by eliminating issuance limits and restructuring the underwriting procedures, alone prompted hopes of changes towards a larger and more liquid market for corporate paper. Expectations of today's 0.75 percentage point cut in the official discount rate also failed to stimulate yesterday's stock or bond markets, and the knowledge that a bad financial year was over with a new year beginning today brought no comfort. Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the Swiss-owned London stockbroker, said the package did not contain any concrete proposals, indicating a lack of commitment by the government. The stock market has been haunted by fears that the Nikkei stock average could fall by a further fifth to as low as 15,000 before a recovery, and dealers generally believe that yesterday's government action did little to ease those fears. Apart from proposed rule changes which would eventually allow companies to hold their own shares, listed groups are being encouraged to pay higher dividends. For more than a year, the government and institutional investors have urged Japanese companies to increase dividends, but there has been little response, and individual investors remain wary of the scandal-tainted stock market. Trading volumes are weak, companies' unrealised profits on stock holdings continue to be eroded, and new equity issues have dried up. In contrast, Y9,000bn (Pounds 39.3bn) was raised in 1989 on the Tokyo stock market through new issues and equity-linked instruments. Another poorly received proposal was the establishment of equity investment funds for institutional investors. Mr Kaoru Shimura, head of equity investment at Sumitomo Life, a leading life assurer, said the most needed change to revive investor confidence was a cut in taxes on investments. The finance ministry said the proposals held out the prospect of accelerated reforms in the corporate bond market. Japanese companies are in dire need of alternative fund raising measures, as aside from the weak stock market bank lending has become tighter due to banks' capital constraints. Mr Robert Feldman, economist at Salomon Brothers, said the proposals had significant importance in the longer term affecting the supply of money available to companies. Japanese companies need funds not least because they will be required to make large repayments on equity-linked bonds issued in the late 1980s. According to Daiwa Securities, Japanese banks will need to repay Y6,950bn on maturing equity-linked bonds in the fiscal year ending March 1993. The Japanese bond market has traditionally functioned to fund the government, and the corporate bond market has been heavily regulated. However, the companies' craving for funds has pushed corporate bond issues for the fiscal year ended March to Y2,316.7bn, three times that of two years ago. The progressive dismantling of the barrier between the banking and securities industries, already under way and due to be implemented next year, is expected to increase competition in underwriting the bonds. Banks may as a result enter a market currently dominated by the Big Four brokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi Securities. The ministry also hopes to abolish the commission-bank system, where every issue has a bank which acts as an agent representing investors. Strict limits on company bond issues are expected to be eased. Currently, a company may only issue bonds equal to its equity capital plus retained earnings. The ministry of finance wants to introduce new products, such as bonds with shorter maturities and floating rate notes.</p>

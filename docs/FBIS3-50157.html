			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Martin </F> Danes; place and date not given: "The Ministry of Culture Is a  Relic of the Past"]    [Text] In the regular interview for our paper, the prime  minister spoke mostly on the topic of the relations between the  leadership and the deputies' club of the Civic Democratic Party  [ODS].    [Danes] Do you share the feeling of Foreign Minister  Zieleniec that the visit by U.S. President Clinton to Prague and  the Partnership for Peace plan will bear fruit in the form of  the expeditious membership of the Czech Republic in NATO?    [Klaus] I really cannot say anything new on this topic: At  present, no one is offering us NATO membership. It would be a  delusion to dream that we could convince the NATO-member states  to change their attitude by intense pressure or just by ardent  rhetoric. Partnership for Peace is a workable way outm and there  certainly is NATO membership at the end of this road.    [Danes] What is a better alternative for you, no Ministry of  Culture or a Ministry of Culture headed by Pavel Tigrid?    [Klaus] Of course, today's option, and at least until the  elections, is a Ministry of Culture headed by a good person. On  the long-term basis, I believe that the Ministry of Culture is a  bit of a relic of the past, and I really believe that we could  do without it.    [Danes] The departure of Deputy Josef Jezek from the ODS and  the way it was commented on by Deputy Chairman Jiri Vlach are  only additional signs that relations between the ODS and its  deputies' club are not in the best shape. What are you planning  to do to improve them?    [Klaus] I do not believe that these relations are not in  good  shape or that they are in worse shape than standard relations  between the executive and the legislative powers anywhere in the  world. It is perfectly logical, and it must be so, that the  government and parliament are struggling with each other over  their powers. It is a normal phenomenon.    This week, I spent an entire day in the ODS Deputies' Club,  and I have not noticed any adverse relations there. It is not  true, and I believe that it is all being unnecessarily blown out  of proportion.    The problem lies elsewhere. It is, as is common, that there  are individuals with a very definite one-dimensional orientation  who contemplate their problem from morning till night. They link  many other things to settling or not settling this problem  according to their ideas. This was the case with the  "cartographer," a technocratic expert on the constitutional  arrangement, Deputy Jezek, and it is the case with this or that  deputy, who is mainly concerned with the settlement of the issue  of the military zones here or there. I could go on listing  certain monothematic affairs that frustrate individuals. I  believe that this does not involve any fundamental conflict in  the overall philosophy, ideology, or political stand, and  therefore I do not see any reason to make it more dramatic than  it is.    [Zieleniec] I think that we would be making a bad job of  defending our interests if our security interests were exactly  the same as the security interests of all of the countries in  the region. Incidentally, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher  left his colleagues from the Visegrad countries in no doubt  about the importance of regional cooperation, but cooperation in  the security sphere must consist, first and foremost, of  bilateral ties between these states and NATO. This point of view  was also expressed in the speech delivered in Prague by  President Clinton. It is essential within the framework of  Visegrad to execute regional cooperation by carrying out  specific deeds, for example, in the trade and economic spheres,  and not just hold ostentatious summit meetings at which the  perfidy of the West is cursed.    This is not our policy. We are transforming our state so  that  it becomes a typical element of the West. This cannot be  replaced by the "banging on the doors" kind of behavior. It is  not true that if four fists bang on NATO's doors together it is  more effective than one fist. We are not banging on doors; we  are orienting ourselves toward the West definitively and  straightforwardly.</p>

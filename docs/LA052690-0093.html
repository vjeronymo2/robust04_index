			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AVERY AND RIVAL OFFICE SUPPLY FIRM TO COMBINE;  </P> <P> MERGERS: THE DEAL WITH DENNISON INVOLVES A STOCK SWAP VALUED AT $500 MILLION.  IT CAPS FIVE YEARS OF TALKS AND WILL RESULT IN A WORLDWIDE GIANT.  </P> <P> Avery International, a company founded in Los Angeles 55 years ago by R.  Stanton Avery to market the self-sticking label that he had invented, said  Friday that it will merge with one of its early customers to form a worldwide  office products giant with combined annual sales of $2.5 billion.  </P> <P> In a joint statement, Avery and Dennison Manufacturing of Framingham, Mass.,  said they will swap stock in a deal valued at about $500 million to form Avery  Dennison Corp. The move will cap five years of sporadic negotiations that  nearly produced a merger three years ago.  </P> <P> The result, subject to shareholder approval and government antitrust clearance,  would cap a relationship born in 1941, when Avery began to supply Dennison with  his self-sticking labels, which put the East Coast firm into the office  products business.  </P> <P> Despite the earlier failure to consummate a definitive agreement, the two  companies continued exploring a merger, in part prodded by the European  Community's imminent removal of its member nations' internal customs barriers,  scheduled for 1992.  </P> <P> Avery already attributes 40% of its 1989 sales of $1.7 billion to overseas  operations in 26 countries. From France alone, Dennison generated about $40  million of its 1989 sales of $771 million. (Avery had 1989 net income of $86.5  million, Dennison $29.1 million.)  </P> <P> Wall Street responded strongly to news of the merger. Avery common stock closed  at $26.25, off $2.24, but Dennison common finished up $8.375 at $27.375 in  trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Charles D. Miller, Avery's chairman and chief executive, will assume the same  titles in Avery Dennison. His counterpart at Dennison, Nelson S. Gifford, will  be vice chairman of the newly merged company.  </P> <P> In an interview, Miller said Friday that "fundamental changes" are transforming  the once-provincial and fragmented office products market into one dominated by  large distribution firms and super-size retailers. "It is becoming a market  where size and the ability to cross-merchandise will make for more effective  distribution and logistics," he said. "We'll be able to go more effectively  after the big customers."  </P> <P> Avery makes self-adhesive base materials, labels, tapes, office products and  specialty chemicals. Dennison makes stationery, office products, systems for  identification and control and package decoration systems. Their products are  sold under such brands as Avery, Fasson, Dennison, National and Carter's.  </P> <P> Avery, which built a new headquarters building in 1982 in Pasadena, employs  11,700 worldwide with several thousand of the jobs based in Southern  California. Dennison has 7,000 employees, mostly in Massachusetts. The merged  company will be based at Avery's Pasadena headquarters.  </P> <P> Miller said the merger is not expected to reduce the combined work force.  </P> <P> The Avery Dennison board will include all current Avery directors and four  Dennison directors, including Gifford. The planned stock swap calls for  Dennison's shareholders to receive 1.12 shares of Avery common stock for each  Dennison share.  </P> <P> The transaction is expected to take three to six months to be completed.  Despite the fact that Avery and Dennison competed in a number of areas, analyst  Matthew Robbins of Duff &amp; Phelps, an independent research firm in Chicago,  said he expects no antitrust concerns because of the intense competition in the  industry.  </P> <P> Miller said both Avery and Dennison shareholders "will be participating in the  future growth of a company that, both financially and operationally, is larger,  stronger and better positioned to capitalize on new growth opportunities and be  more competitive in a rapidly developing global marketplace."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Jiri Pisklak, the Czech </F> Republic's representative at NATO, by Jaroslav Fiala; place and  date not given: "The North Atlantic Treaty Is No Warsaw Pact"]    [Excerpts] "I was the first military representative of a  Warsaw Pact country who came to Brussels and began practical  cooperation. I had to start with very simple matters, such as  becoming familiar with NATO. We opened the door slowly and  tried to show the changes that happened in our country and its  armed forces," says Major General Jiri Pisklak, the Czech  Republic's representative at NATO.    [Fiala] What are the changes you have just mentioned?    [Pisklak] The principal changes have been carried out in  three large stages: In the first, Soviet troops were withdrawn;  in the second, the Republic was partitioned and, therefore, the  Army was also divided; and then there is the transformation that  we are undergoing now. This stage should end by 1996, which  means that, by then, our Army should be rebuilt into an army of  a new type similar to the NATO armies. It is my task to work in  that direction. I am alone here but, actually, I am mediating  contacts between the Czech Republic's Army, the NATO command  here in Brussels, and other command posts. This is  multinational cooperation among NATO's multinational staffs.    [Fiala] Have you noticed any progress in that cooperation?    [Pisklak] We have made a great deal of progress, about which  we do not know much in our country. Actually, we are  participating in the work of all committees in the North  Atlantic Council for Cooperation, which is a political and  consultative body in which the overall situation in NATO is  discussed. The ambassador of the Czech Republic comes here and  presents our political attitudes, the policy of the Foreign  Ministry, and so on. I have the opportunity to participate in  these meetings. Today, we are also participating in the  creation of the principal documents in the Political Committee.  We are also cooperating with the Economic Committee.    [Pisklak] Under what circumstance was the North Atlantic  Council established?    [Fiala] It has been newly created, and this is why a special  formula is used in that connection: 16 NATO countries and 22  countries of this council [sentence as published]. It is a body  that was established after the political changes in our country  were made. This body makes it possible for all of the  countries, including the republics of the former Soviet Union,  to join the advanced countries of Europe. The members are, for  example, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, etc. There are also  Finnish observers. The purpose of the Council is to make it  possible for all countries to consult the political situation.  For example, the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and  weapons of mass destruction is a new topic. Foreign ministers  also have meetings. It is an important thing that the Council  has approved a working plan that fixes the spheres of  cooperation, including the political, economic, scientific, and  ecological spheres. In this connection, I would like to avoid  speaking about details because there are some 300 or 400 various  committees and work groups within NATO.    [Pisklak] Can you describe the work of some of the  committees and evaluate their results?    [Fiala] I highly appreciate the results of the Committee for  the Coordination of the European Airspace. I have to say that  Europe is saturated with air traffic. We must have a unified  system of controlling the air traffic, so our countries could  join and become compatible in that sphere. The Czech Republic  has made great progress. In Prague, a new center for  air-traffic control is being built, which is practically  comparable with the West European standards. We have joined  such organizations as ARFA [Allied Radio Frequency Agency],  which deals with the allocation of frequencies, because it is  known that frequency bands are overcrowded and every country is  keeping an eye on the frequencies it can get. In the Economic  Committee, matters related to the conversion of the arms  industry were widely discussed.    Cooperation in the Ecological Committee is developing  promisingly. This committee is called the Committee for the  Vision of Modern Society. For us, the most interesting thing  was the solution to ecological problems, where Charles  University is involved to a certain extent. The Foreign  Ministry is participating in all of the said activities as the  main organizer, and the Defense Ministry and its experts are  engaged in many matters because these matters belong to the  sphere of the Defense Ministry's activity. Someone could say  that ecology does not belong to the sphere of rapprochement with  NATO. This is not the case, however. For instance, the cleanup  operation after the Soviet troops had an impact on both the Army  and civilians. [passage omitted]    [Fiala] Do you have an idea how much the compatibility of  our Army with NATO forces will cost our taxpayers?    [Pisklak] For the time being, almost nothing. We will have  to carry out the transformation of our Army, in any case.  Transformation is paid for from the state budget. We are  spending the extra money on the compatibility of our system.  For the time being, we are not paying anything extra.    In the future, when legal technicalities regarding residence  permits are sorted out, some of our people should come here--not  as many as from the big countries, however. One or two people  should remain in Mons, and three to five should be designated  for direct cooperation here in Brussels. Of course, the cost  for having officials abroad, costs that are linked to the work  of those people, are paid from the budget. However, no enormous  sums will be involved. Through the Partnership for Peace plan,  we will participate in certain social actions, which will allow  us to participate in international operations. First, certain  exercises will be focused on keeping peace, on preparing UN  joint operations, rescue and humanitarian actions, and others.  It is normal practice that each NATO country pay for those  actions. From the existing military budget, we will be unable  to pay for a large action, and it is expected that we are not  going to undertake any large actions this year. Later on, we  are expected to pay for anything that will take place on our  territory within the Partnership for Peace framework, and we  will have to pay the bill if we send smaller units abroad for  exercises. This requires legislative steps, however, because  these things have to do something with the Constitution, and  parliament will have to decide them.    [Fiala] Could you be more specific about the legislative  changes?    [Pisklak] Every country that will want to become a member  will have to review its laws and legislative system to find out  how much their law and legislative system are compatible with  membership in the Alliance. Their legislative system may  contain certain laws and stipulations that may prevent these  countries from fulfilling obligations ensuing from the treaties.  This mainly applies to the deployment of foreign troops on  their territory. (I know that we hate listening to those things  after our 1968 experience). For example, the Belgian Government  gives special status to people who work on NATO staffs in  Belgium. This status should apply to our people also. The  deployment of the troops in Germany is regulated by special  laws, for example. There is a special law that defines the  rights and obligations of foreign soldiers participating in  exercises on the territory of a member country. We will have to  establish a group of experts who will select, as a reference, a  NATO country similar to ours and who will deal with these  matters. We can ask for such help without any problems because  everyone will be willing to provide it. This is why the  question of whether to join NATO immediately is not easy. Every  country must prepare itself in a certain way. It it difficult  to fix a deadline, for which our people yearn so much.    [Fiala] When are we going to become a full Alliance member,  in your estimate?    [Pisklak] In my estimate, this deadline should not extend  beyond the end of this century because our Republic is certainly  comparable with some NATO member countries regarding the  stability of the political system, economic results, the overall  transformation of our thinking, and our capability to build a  democratic system. Actually, NATO believes that the democratic  system and the market economy are shared values. We are  building this democratic system and market economy, and we need  to complete them. Our public does not have too detailed  information on NATO. In general, NATO is believed to be a sort  of military organization, similar to the Warsaw Pact. NATO,  however, is not only a military organization....    [Fiala] What factors will most influence the Czech  Republic's joining NATO?    [Pisklak] A composite of all factors at the same time. NATO  is not only a defense organization but also a political and  economic organization and an organization that controls  cooperation in science. The security aspect prevails, of  course. We should speak about creating a reliable European  security system in Europe in the future.    NATO is undergoing a transformation and is modifying its  military structure in an important way so as to adjust it as  much as possible to the new conditions. If the conflict in  Yugoslavia is ended (which would help improve stability and  strengthen peace in Europe), I believe that we really will have  the possibility to create, in a well-conceived and reasonable  way, a European security system. I am of the opinion that NATO  has the prerequisites to become the cornerstone of a system on  which everyone could rely. It can share experience and  knowledge with others. It would be an ideal solution if we had  NATO with two, three, or more pillars--a Central European  pillar, for instance, could be one of them. We should not  divide our efforts to establish European security. This is my  personal opinion.    [Fiala] What is your view of our Army, from the Brussels  perspective?    [Pisklak] Out Army has undergone significant changes. New  people assumed positions in all of the important places. Unlike  the previous people, they are knowledgeable about the world, and  they have proper educations. Unfortunately, many of them  complete their educations and leave, which is a very sad fact.  I believe that, in the new spirit, the Army's task is to defend  the Czech Republic. I also believe that people who are in the  Army feel that they are responsible for the defense of the  country. I believe it is an unfortunate fact that our society  looks at our Army through the perspective of the past, despite  the fact that our Army is undergoing an important and painful  process of transformation. If I am to be sincere, I have to say  that we were not alone in having been immersed in ourselves for  those 40 years. In NATO, they have similar problems. They,  too, have a narrow and maybe even a distorted view of certain  things. In the process of becoming acquainted with them, we  have arrived at a surprising conclusion: We are closer to each  other than we originally thought. We have found out that our  opinions are quite close, that we have identical views on  problems of security, education, training, the role of the Army,  etc.    [Fiala] Our Army was a Warsaw Pact member until recently....    [Pisklak] NATO membership leaves complete sovereignty to its  members. This is quite a different thing from the directive  manner of control that existed within the Warsaw Pact. It is  desirable that our society should understand that we have to  begin building the Army. Time is flying, and, if we want to  build on the traditions of the first republic, we should support  the creators of the new Army. We should stop noticing only  negative aspects and begin noticing that our soldiers are able  to do something positive. I could give you examples of the  professionalism of our Army. If someone was able to move  130,000 Soviet troops in such a short time, and if someone was  able to divide the Army that had coexisted since 1945 into two  parts, he must have been a professional; amateurs could not have  done it. If our soldiers manage to be equal partners to the  Western soldiers, if they are able to fully integrate themselves  into the United Nations [troops], our Army is commensurate with  a number of other armies. We only need to create conditions for  the people to feel good and to want to serve in the Army. We  should make the Army attractive to young people.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Advance in interim results MACULAN, the Austrian construction group with substantial interests in eastern Europe, has reported a 12 per cent rise in operating profit to Sch141m (Dollars 12.5m) in the first half of 1993 and has forecast a 21 per surge in net income for the full year to Sch260m. Interim turnover was up 23 per cent to Sch6.06bn and the group's order book stood at a record Sch10.8bn at the end of June, 41 per cent higher than a year earlier. Maculan, which raised Sch695m through a rights issue in June to help finance acquisitions in eastern Europe, said that first-half growth was mainly due to a 54 per cent increase in turnover in Germany. Excluding the first time contribution of two east German acquisitions, growth in turnover was 16 per cent. Work on the group's Sch1.9bn contract to build 3,000 flats in Moscow for returning Russian soldiers has been disturbed by the recent political upheaval, but this has not so far resulted in payments, which have been guaranteed by the German government, being delayed.</p>

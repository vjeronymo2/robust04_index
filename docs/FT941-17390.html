			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Mideast talks in stalemate with resurgence of mistrust: Arafat and Rabin are playing a dangerous game; the winners could be the opponents of peace Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have slumped into a dangerous stalemate with the resurgence of mutual mistrust, suspicion and misunderstanding. The two sides are so far apart they are only communicating intermittently by telephone and fax. With implementation of the accord already delayed more than three weeks and little prospect of an immediate breakthrough, there is open talk on both sides of the process falling apart. Palestinians and Israelis still realise they have more to lose than gain from allowing the peace process to fail; but both sides appear at a loss to find a way of climbing out of the pit they have dug for themselves. At the heart of the dispute is a fundamental misunderstanding on the accord reached in secret talks in Oslo and signed on the White House lawn in Washington last September. To reach agreement, after years of bloodshed, both sides purposely left huge areas vague and open to interpretation. The accord was supposed to provide the Palestinians, after a five-year interim period, with 'something more than autonomy in Gaza-Jericho but less than statehood'. Between those two political poles lay a wide and murky grey area. From the beginning both sides sold the agreement differently to their own sceptical constituencies. Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, argued - in the face of widespread internal criticism that he had sold out the Palestinian cause - that the accord did lay the basis of statehood. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, assured an Israeli public deeply concerned about security and the PLO's violent past that the accord did not concede a Palestinian state. Conflict was inevitable and different perceptions of the two leaders on the Oslo accord eventually came to a head over the two main obstacles to an agreement: control of borders and the size of Jericho. For both Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin the same principle is at stake: how much sovereignty the Palestinians will exercise in Gaza-Jericho once Israeli troops withdraw. The latest compromise proposal by Israel, decribed by Israeli officials as a 'final offer' which must be accepted by the PLO as a basis for further talks, has been rejected by the PLO. For Mr Arafat, Israel's border proposals fall short of the sovereignty he wishes to exercise. The PLO chairman wants four main changes: Palestinian police and flags should be clearly present on the crossings; residents of Gaza-Jericho should not have to be examined by Israel except by remote computer control; there should be an international presence on the border; and the PLO should take control of roads leading to borders. On the size of Jericho, Mr Arafat's main demand is that the area should include a strip of land at the Dead Sea - vital for its tourist and mineral potential and for the possible development of a separate entry point into Gaza-Jericho by ferry from Jordan. Both sides know that whatever is gained or conceded now cannot be reversed at later negotiations, due to begin within two years, on a permanent settlement. Mr Arafat's demands are designed to bring Palestinian statehood one step closer, a prospect firmly rejected by both the Israeli government and Israeli public. 'If Arafat doesn't return in the coming days to the original Oslo track it will be worthwhile for the government to take time out in the talks to reassess the Oslo agreement and its meaning, to check whether Arafat is a man with whom we can do business, and ask ourselves where this process is leading,' Mr Yoel Marcus, a leading Israeli commentator, wrote yesterday. Exacerbating the stalemate is Mr Arafat's mercurial negotiating strategy, the deepening leadership crisis in the PLO and the calculation on both sides that the other will be forced to give in. Mr Arafat has a long history of reneging on accords and using oral promises or offers made by senior lieutenants to extract compromises from negotiating partners which he can later reject. The veteran Palestinian leader also has the problem of building sufficient consensus inside the PLO and among Palestinians who feel Mr Arafat has surrendered too much. For the moment, each side is waiting for the other to wave the white flag. Mr Rabin believes Mr Arafat's waning support and internal pressures will force him to give in. Mr Arafat believes rising domestic Israeli opposition, pro-Palestinian international sympathy, and linkage of the Palestinian negotiations to progress in peace talks between Israel and other Arab neighbours will force Mr Rabin to strike a deal. For both men it is a dangerous game of brinkmanship whose ultimate winner could be neither Mr Arafat nor Mr Rabin but the opponents of peace on both sides.</p>

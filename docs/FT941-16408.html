			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Sweden expects faster growth to help rein in budget deficit Sweden is recovering more rapidly than expected from three years of deep economic recession, Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, said yesterday as she presented the right-centre government's last budget before the September general election. She said growth in gross national product this year of 2.4 per cent - higher than previous forecasts of 1.9 per cent - would set the country on a path to sustained growth for the rest of the decade and would reverse a recent increase in the budget deficit. Mrs Wibble said the deficit in the 1994-95 budget year (July-June) would fall to 11.2 per cent of GNP, or SKr172bn (Pounds 14.1bn), from 14.8 per cent in the current year. The borrowing requirement would tumble by SKr51bn to SKr220bn. But the budget contained only marginal new savings measures in addition to a five-year SKr81bn programme outlined last year. This prompted criticism that the looming election had deterred the government from taking stronger action to curb growing debt. Net public sector debt at 35 per cent of GNP is rising faster than in other OECD countries, while gross central government debt is set to reach 95 per cent of GNP in mid-1995. 'The growth in state debt is seriously worrying,' said Mr Magnus Lemmel, managing director of the Federation of Swedish Industries. 'The budget ought to have contained further measures to strengthen the government's control of the economic situation.' But Mrs Wibble rejected this criticism, saying the five-year savings plan enacted last autumn contained the necessary measures to stabilise debt in 1998. 'For economic and electoral reasons we advanced a large part of the budget consolidation plan to autumn 1993. Last year the critics said we were saving too much.' She also denied that official growth forecasts were over-optimistic, saying latest figures for the second and third quarters of 1993 were 'better than I had dared to guess'. The budget forecast that exports will rise 10.7 per cent in 1994, thanks to increased competitiveness, and the country's current account will move strongly into surplus. But the domestic sector will again be depressed, with only modest growth in private consumption and a continued fall in public consumption. Unemployment will remain a black spot. The jobless total, including those on training schemes, is expected to rise to 14.4 per cent in 1994 from 12.9 per cent last year. The government aims to halve unemployment by the end of the decade, but it acknowledges that the economy will need to grow by 4 per cent a year between 1996 and 1999 for this to be possible. Mrs Wibble stressed the importance of Swedish membership of the European Union, which a sceptical electorate will vote on in a referendum later this year. 'Membership is central to winning investment and to the development of the Swedish economy. We must win the referendum,' she said. Economists expect a further relaxation in short-term interest rates shortly to bolster growth.</p>

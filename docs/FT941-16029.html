			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Arts: Barenboim's 'Die Walkure' - The first new Ring in Berlin for 40 years The conductor is Daniel Barenboim, the producer Harry Kupfer and John Tomlinson sings Wotan. Bayreuth 1988? No, Berlin for the next three seasons. Germany's flagship opera house, the Staatsoper unter den Linden, has just embarked on its first Ring for nearly 40 years. As artistic director, Barenboim has put Wagner at the centre of his plans, with the same production team and many of the singers who worked on the recent Bayreuth Ring. He began with Parsifal last season. Now comes Die Walkure the first part of a Ring to be completed by 1996. Barenboim's logic is clear. At Bayreuth, he established a strong rapport with Kupfer and the designers Hans Schavernoch and Reinhard Heinrich. Why not continue in his own theatre? And where better than Berlin to interpret Wagner's allegory of power for the 1990s? Barenboim and Kupfer say the Berlin Ring will allow them to develop their ideas further. Die Walkure suggested otherwise. The production lacked the originality or technical virtuosity that distinguished their Bayreuth version. Despite Schavernoch's new designs, this was a pale imitation. Kupfer did his best to dress his concept in fresh clothes. In Bayreuth we had the 'runway of history', on which man created bigger and bigger catastrophes because of his inability to learn from the past. In Berlin this becomes the 'room (or space) of history' - where nature spawns a human intelligence with the capacity to dominate and exploit lesser beings, and ultimately threatens the whole of creation. Kupfer articulates the change persuasively in the Walkure programme book, but it makes little difference to the staging. Wotan is still virile and red-haired, still charging round the stage and thrusting his spear into the ground, still forcing Siegmund onto Hunding's sword, still lying face-down next to Brunnhilde before putting her to sleep. For all the talk of nature - and its marvellous evocation in Wagner's music  -Kupfer acknowledges it almost as little as he did in Bayreuth. The stage is bare apart from a charcoal tree-trunk and a background grill, behind which are projected a succession of murky photo-images - tangled foliage in the Spring scene of Act one, a sunlit ocean during the Todesverkundigung. The atmosphere barely changes from one scene to the next, and the fixed perimeter of the 'room of history' has an inhibiting, boxed-in effect. Although Kupfer draws powerful performances from his actors, their entrances and exits pass for nothing, and the magic fire circle is an anti-climax. Where the production does represent an advance on Bayreuth is the orchestral sound. Freed from the Festspielhaus cowl and the homogenised sound it produces, Barenboim makes us aware of Wagner's felicitous scoring - the woodwind decoration of the Act one love music, the fat brass in Act three - and goes for mammoth contrasts of loud and soft. He gets away with it because of the dramatic breadth of his reading and sensitivity to his singers' needs. Apart from an unnecessary change of speed after the opening storm, tempi are more coherent than ever. The Staatskapelle is beginning to sound like a front-rank orchestra. In a high-powered cast, Waltraud Meier's Sieglinde was a revelation. After a muted debut in the part a year ago in Vienna, followed by her first Isolde in the summer, she has found her stride as a dramatic soprano - and how] This Walsung was the embodiment of female courage, beauty and rapture, the voice sounding fuller and freer than ever. The other newcomers were Ute Priew's stately Fricka and Eric Halverson's polished, dangerous Hunding. Poul Elming, Deborah Polaski and Tomlinson repeated their Bayreuth performances. As Siegmund, Elming looked as good as ever, but had to 'manage' his voice to reach the end of Act one. Polaski was every inch the warrior maiden, though nothing could compensate for her unyielding tone and imperfect top. Tomlinson, in strong, steady voice, is in danger of turning his act into an Expressionist cliche. Barenboim seems to have forgotten that one of the pitfalls in art is to repeat yourself. If he really wanted to continue with Kupfer, Tomlinson and the others, he should have picked a different opera. What he needed for The Ring was a new producer, a new designer and a new cast, capable of striking creative sparks off each other - the way they all did with such success back in 1988.</p>

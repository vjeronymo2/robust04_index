			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: WHO'S THAT GIRL?  </P> <P> You see her limbs, her thighs, her hands -- and one shot of her from behind,  climbing from a swimming pool unclothed. But in "Welcome Home, Roxy  Carmichael," while the camera tantalizes, it never reveals the face of the  title character.  </P> <P> The movie is set in Roxy's hometown, where residents await her homecoming.  Wynona Ryder and Jeff Daniels star.  </P> <P> Roxy's voluptuous body actually belongs to Ava Fabian, 28, former Playboy  Playmate (August, 1986), who hails from Brewster, N.Y., and now lives in  Hollywood. She has appeared -- face and all -- in the feature film "Dragnet,"  the upcoming "Auntie Lee's Meat Pies" and TV's "Married With Children."  </P> <P> "It was one of the easiest parts I've ever had," Fabian says of her role as  Roxy. "There was no dialogue." David J. Fox  </P></p>

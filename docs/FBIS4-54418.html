			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 28 April (MTI) -- The Hungarian Justice  and Life Party (MIEP) considers the Hungarist Movement, its  leaders, and particularly their statements declaring sympathy  for the MIEP, to be clear provocations, said MIEP Co-Chairman  Istvan Csurka at the party's press conference in Budapest on  Thursday [28 April]. Csurka sees this as a dirty political  trick, and said the organization is backed by forces who are  interested in presenting the MIEP as an extreme rightist party.    As reported on Wednesday [27 April], leaders of the  Hungarist  Movement, which openly professes extreme rightist ideas, held a  press conference in Budapest. Present were the chairmen of the  three political groups that set up the movement: the Federation  of Persecutees of Communism, the Hungarian National Front, and  the World National Popular Rule Party.    National Front head, Istvan Gyorkos, announced at  yesterday's  press conference that the Hungarist program coincides with that  of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party at several points.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Shell shares slip on news of Pounds 131m charge SHARES in Shell Transport, the UK arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, slipped 6p yesterday to 575p following disclosures at the weekend that Shell would take a Pounds 131m charge against its fourth quarter results to cover huge currency losses at a Japanese associate company. Some City investors were concerned that the currency losses come at a time when Shell's core businesses in chemicals and European oil refining are also under pressure from recession, low oil prices and over-capacity. Shell is still expected on Thursday to announce a slight increase in profits for last year with most analysts estimating income of about Pounds 3bn compared with Pounds 2.9bn in 1991. The currency loss of Dollars 1.05bn incurred by Showa Shell Sekiyu, a Japanese refining subsidiary which is 50 per cent owned by Shell, was made in breach of company rules that forbid speculation on the money markets. An investigation into the currency dealings is underway and Shell said the necessary disciplinary procedures would be taken. Mr Fergus MacLeod, oil analyst at NatWest Securities, said: 'This is the flip side of the company's decentralised management structure which enables it to react much more quickly to opportunities but which also makes it difficult to maintain management control.' Shell said the net charge of Pounds 131m to its full-year results will be offset by a credit of Pounds 149m which comes from consolidating Showa Shell into group results. But investors say three-quarters of this credit has already been accounted for. Lex, Page 20 Futures shock, Page 26 Market, Page 42</p>

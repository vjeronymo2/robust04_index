			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon 79% ahead The strength of the US dollar, a cut in underwriting losses and underlying business growth helped Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, increase pre-tax profits by 79 per cent from Pounds 42.5m to Pounds 76.2m in the year to December 31 1993. The markets reacted positively to the higher than expected profit figure, marking the shares up 16p to close at 223p. Income from broking increased to Pounds 664.3m (Pounds 575.6m) against a rise in operating expenses to Pounds 626.9m (Pounds 562.3m), while on an underlying basis brokerage and fees increased by 4 per cent with expenses unchanged. More than half of Willis's revenue comes from the US, so the group benefited from a positive movement in exchange rates to the tune of Pounds 9.4m. Operating profit (premiums less claims and expenses) from Willis's underwriting operat-ions increased to Pounds 800,000 against a loss of Pounds 14.1m last year. This mainly reflected an improvement at Sovereign, the London operation which specialises in marine and North American casualty business and which withdrew from the market in 1991. Pre-tax losses from UK underwriting operations fell to Pounds 9.4m, against Pounds 25.7m in 1992. Interest and investment income amounted to Pounds 55.6m (Pounds 57.3m). Losses on disposal of fixed assets amounted to Pounds 1.2m (against a profit of Pounds 300,000). Profits from the sale of underwriting businesses amounted to Pounds 1.4m, reflecting the sale of a 64 per cent holding in Gryphon Holdings, the North American insurance operation. The share of profit of associated undertakings amounted to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 4.4m). Interest payable amounted to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 5.5m). The reduction in the dividend for 1993, which was cut to 6.6p compared with 13.2p in 1992, was announced last November. Willis said it intended to maintain the pay-out at the same level for the first quarter of 1994. COMMENT The strength of the US dollar, continued economic recovery and higher interest rates in the US are all positive trends for Willis, which is on course to produce profits of at least Pounds 95m in 1994 and earnings of more than 14p. On that basis the shares - on a prospective multiple of 16 - look reasonably good value. This is especially the case given yesterday's indications that Sovereign appears to be over the worst of its problems. Nevertheless, although all these trends look positive, in the longer term the group will do well to maintain its margins in the highly competitive North American market, where there still appears to be no immediate prospect of any significant increase in rates.</p>

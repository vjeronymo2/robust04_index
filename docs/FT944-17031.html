			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Beijing angered by party in HK Britain's uneasy relations with China took another lurch for the worse yesterday when Beijing rebuked London for allowing Taiwan's representatives in Hong Kong to celebrate their 'national day'. China was stung by the decision by Hong Kong's urban council to allow the colony's cultural centre to be used by Taiwan to mark 'Double Ten' - the day the republic of China was founded in 1911. China celebrated 45 years of the People's Republic on October 1. The foreign ministry in Beijing attacked the Hong Kong government for allowing the celebrations to proceed. It said this proved once again 'that the British side's deeds do not conform with its words,' according to state radio and television reports monitored in the Chinese capital. The reports quoted ministry spokesman Mr Chen Jian as saying Britain 'lacked sincerity to improve Sino-British relations'. The decision 'not only hurts the feelings of the Chinese people but also adds new difficulties to Sino-British relations,' he said. 'We demand the British side really fulfil its promise (of recognising only one China) or else the British side should be held responsible for whatever serious consequences arise from this,' Mr Chen added. The urban council's decision to allow the Taiwanese to use a public building has deeply embarrassed the Hong Kong government. Less then a week ago, Governor Chris Patten offered closer co-operation with China in the run-up to the 1997 handover of the colony. In public, however, the government has stood by the decision, claiming that to reverse it would be illegal. The latest Anglo-Chinese row has come at a time when the British Foreign Office was making a renewed attempt to repair relations with Beijing. A meeting between the two countries' foreign ministers a fortnight ago had gone well. Some officials said the 'Double Ten' controversy had spilled over to other areas of the relationship. During the weekend, Mr Lu Ping, China's top official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, demanded Hong Kong re-tender a contract for a big port project. Beijing objects to one of the participants, the Jardine Matheson group, in the successful consortium. Earlier it had called on Hong Kong to exclude Jardine from the group, saying the company was a beneficiary of British favouritism. Mr Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary, rebuffed this suggestion. 'To suggest that our decisions were taken on anything other than economic or financial grounds undermines business confidence and impugns the integrity and competence of the government and the officials involved in the exercise,' she said. Mr Lu has also urged Hong Kong to hand over sensitive financial data on its budgets in the interests of smoothing the transition in 1997. These demands were rejected.</p>

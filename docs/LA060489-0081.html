			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Two San Joaquin Valley counties were accused in Fresno of violating the federal  Clean Air Act by failing to meet air quality standards. Three environmentalist  groups -- Citizens for a Healthy Environment, Sierra Club and Kern County  Valley Action Network -- filed suit in U.S. District Court, calling for the  federal Environmental Protection Agency to impose sanctions on Kern and Fresno  counties for failing to meet a 1987 compliance deadline. The suit alleges that  the two counties have "consistently violated the federal health standards for  ozone."  </P></p>

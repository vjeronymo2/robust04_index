			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REPUTED VICE RING MADAM WILKENING, LAWYER WILL BE TRIED FOR ILLEGAL FLIGHT  </P> <P> Reputed madam Karen Wilkening and her former attorney, Buford Wiley Jr., were  ordered Thursday to stand trial on charges that she fled the country in 1987 to  avoid prosecution on charges that she was operating a call-girl ring.  </P> <P> Assistant Dist. Atty. Chuck Rogers said it is likely that National City car  dealer Tony McCune and his former attorney will also face charges stemming from  this case.  </P> <P> In emotional testimony Thursday, McCune said he "begged" Wilkening to plea  bargain her case in 1987 so he could avoid personal embarrassment.  </P> <P> McCune's former attorney, Armando Odorico, refused to answer questions, citing  his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.  </P> <P> Among other charges, Wilkening is accused of obtaining a passport under the  name a friend, Linda Webster, which she used to flee to the Philippines.  </P> <P> Prosecutors allege that Wiley urged Wilkening to obtain the false passport, and  that he harbored a fugitive by hiding her presence in the Philippines.  </P> <P> McCune, who testified last week that Wilkening arranged for him to have sex  with prostitutes, said Thursday that he gave money to Wilkening to help pay her  legal expenses.  </P> <P> "I told her I would give her $25,000," McCune said. "The woman was, in my  opinion, destitute."  </P> <P> Webster, Wilkening's former best friend, testified Wednesday under immunity  from prosecution that McCune offered Wilkening the money in exchange for  leaving the country.  </P> <P> McCune continually denied that he urged or knew about Wilkening's plan to flee  to Manila, where she was arrested last month.  </P> <P> "I was quite concerned about my wife and my family . . . and my reputation, so  obviously I wanted her to plea bargain and negotiate a settlement," said  McCune, who had to stop to regain his composure. "I wanted her to do it. I  begged her to do it."  </P> <P> McCune testified that he never had any idea that Wilkening was going to flee  the country, even though he did send her $15,000 after she had failed to appear  in court in 1987. McCune said he delivered the money "because Karen and I at  our last meeting agreed that anything that happened after that would go through  Mr. Wiley."  </P> <P> McCune said he was testifying at the preliminary hearing without being  subpoenaed.  </P> <P> "Since the beginning of this whole ordeal, I've been up front, I've been  cooperative, and I've told the truth," he said.  </P> <P> Wilkening was ordered to stand trial last week on charges of conducting a  prostitution ring. After her arrest in 1987, police seized a file containing  the names of clients and the women who worked for her. This led to the affair  being dubbed the "Rolodex 500" case.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Joe Littlejohn ordered Wilkening and Wiley to appear in court  June 22 to set a trial date on the charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice,  failure to appear in court, and false impersonation.  </P></p>

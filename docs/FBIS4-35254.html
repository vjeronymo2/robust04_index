			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 28, IRNA -- The refusal of the British  Foreign Office to comment on the report carried by the daily  GUARDIAN Saturday that a ranking Iranian diplomat in London has  been ordered to go home, indicates a new provocation on the part  of the British Government against Islamic Iran.    A spokesman of the British Foreign Ministry contacted by  IRNA  Saturday refused to confirm or deny the report saying simply  that the content of the talks between the Iranian charge  d'affaires in London, Gholam-Reza Ansari, and Deputy Minister of  Foreign Affairs of Britain Douglas Hogg was meant to remain  undisclosed.    Experts on relations between the two countries say in the  event the report by THE GUARDIAN should be true the British  Government might have to expect a similar action by Iran.    They believe that the British Government in view of its  abortive propaganda campaign against Iran, is trying to take a  new provocative step against the Islamic Republic.    In the opinion of Iran-Britain watchers, London intends to  exploit the meeting between the two for propaganda purposes.  Early this month a section of the British press in a  simultaneous move without any documents to substantiate their  claim, alleged that the Islamic Republic of Iran was backing the  Irish Republican Army (IRA).    The provocative insinuation by the British press, however,  was hardly heeded by the media elsewhere in Europe.    Iran-Britain watchers say under the circumstances any  hostile  action by the British Government towards the Islamic Republic  may entail a stronger reaction by Iran which the Britons do not  consider to be in their best interest.    International relations consultant Sadeq Azimi says the  measure by the British Government might be simply a device for  burying its scandalous bugging of the Iranian embassy in London  under fresh anti-Iran propaganda. He says any indiscreet action  by the British Government might entail ruinous consequences for  the British Government.    A sophisticated bugging device planted by the British Secret  Service in the Iranian embassy was recently discovered during  repairs.</p>

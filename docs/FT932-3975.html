			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Arts: Playing with fire - Opera in Lyon Lully's Phaeton, the first opera ever to be performed at Lyons (in 1688, a year after the composer's death) has returned there 300 years later as the final production for the opening of the new opera house, recently described here by Max Loppert. In Paris the first Phaeton was so successful that it became known as 'the opera of the people' - a tribute no doubt to the elaborate spectacle as much as to the music. Readers of Angus Wilson's last novel Setting the world on fire may remember that this was the opera chosen for a modern revival in the Vanbrugh Great Hall, suitably frescoed, in the mansion Wilson imagined near Westminster Abbey. In the unusual libretto by Quinault, a clutch of discontented royals with divine connections intrigue and bicker. Phaeton, whose father is the Sun, is chosen by the King of Egypt to succeed him and to wed his daughter Libye, infuriating Epaphus, a son of Jupiter, who wants both the job and the girl. Epaphus insinuates to Phaeton that the Sun is not really his father. Phaeton's mother Clymene, now married to the Egyptian king, reassures him. Phaeton, however, consumed by overwhelming longing to rule the universe, asks his solar father for confirmation. The Sun obliges, adding a pledge to give Phaeton anything he desires. To his father's horror the boy asks to drive his fiery chariot across the skies. Epaphus sneaks to Jupiter, who dispatches a thunderbolt. Phaeton falls. The designer, Jean Bauer, frames the action in a revolving, flame-coloured permanent set, somewhere between ochre and apricot, with fantastic costumes, mainly yellow and gold, by Sylvie Skinazi. Sunlight, spheres, circles, hoops everywhere. Dancers, acrobats, trapezists, a midget. For much of the time the stage centre is occupied by a plexi-glass half-globe sometimes on the floor, sometimes tilted or suspended. Much of the dancing took place under the glass, hidden from me by an exceptionally tall opera-goer in the seat in front (not typical - sight lines from the stall seem good). Karine Saporta, producer and choreographer, is described as being 'on the cutting edge of modern dance'. The singers were given finicky little arm and hand movements like the Peter Sellars Zauberflote at Glyndebourne. Too much movement altogether, to the detriment of plot and words. I am sure that Lully, if he came back today, would make his singers dance but I do not believe he would have blurred the distinction between singing and dance with so much fiddle-faddle. In one dialogue two pairs of dancers 'acted out' the words with distracting effect. During Phaeton's crucial interview with the Sun, two extras peeping through holes twiddled shaving mirrors. Phaeton's fall was effectively suggested (Herve Audibert's lighting was ingenious when he stopped dazzling the audience). The producer rightly realised that the real point of interest is not the catastrophe but the insensate pride and ambition that causes it. I saw the second performance. There may have been too little rehearsal; not everything on and behind stage went smoothly. After a heroic ten days or so the company appeared understandbly tired. The singers, some of them seemingly worried by their movements, too often failed to give Lully's masterly recitatives their full effect - I gladly except the irrepressible Jean-Paul Fouchecourt in three roles including the Sun. Howard Crook, dignified as ever, took the title-role. As Libye, Veronique Gens sang brightly. Jennifer Smith as her rival Theone, unavailingly sighing for the unfeeling Phaeton, had some expressively turned phrases also some shrillness at the top. Like most operas of the period Phaeton is rich in rewarding small parts, well taken here by, among others, Rachel Yakar, Laurent Naouri, Gerard Theruel, Philippe Huttenlocher. The Musiciens du Louvre under Marc Minkowski were energetic but less spick than span than usual. The Ensemble Vocal Sagittarius provided the chorus (how artful of Lully to open his prologue with such a ravishing piece for female voices). The large audience was pin-still and appreciative. I did not detect any outward sign of discontent with the much-discussed new building as they clattered down from the upper balconies in the interval in search of refreshment. Whatever its faults the new opera house is intensely and enjoyably theatrical (no-one could say that about La Bastille in Paris), even if in that theatricality there is an element of international exhibition swank which may not last well or long.

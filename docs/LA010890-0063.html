			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. GOALKEEPER VANOLE IS A NO-SHOW AT SOCCER TRAINING CAMP IN LA JOLLA  </P> <P> Former UCLA goalkeeper David Vanole, who started three of the United States'  eight qualifying games last year for soccer's 1990 World Cup, has been a  no-show since the national team opened its training camp Friday in La Jolla.  </P> <P> "All we know of David's decision is that I got a note here saying he's not  pleased with the general situation and that he's not going to show up," Coach  Bob Gansler said Sunday.  </P> <P> "I think it would behoove him to make a call if he wants to give me or the  administrators further explanation. He hasn't done that."  </P> <P> Vanole, who lives in Manhattan Beach, was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Another player, who did not want to be identified, said Vanole was unhappy with  the standard player contract offered by the U.S. Soccer Federation because it  does not provide insurance coverage.  </P> <P> Although Vanole is the only player who chose to hold out because of the  insurance dispute, several other players have not signed contracts and have  requested a meeting here during the two-week training camp with USSF President  Werner Fricker.  </P> <P> Vanole was the No. 1 goalkeeper until he lost the job after the fourth  qualifying game to the University of Virginia's Tony Meola, who did not allow a  goal in the remaining four games as the United States earned a berth in this  summer's World Cup in Italy.  </P> <P> Four others are not among the 25 players here but have excused absences.  Midfielder Hugo Perez and forward Peter Vermes are playing with teams in  Europe, while Meola and midfielder John Harkes are trying out this week with an  English team, Sheffield, on Wednesday.

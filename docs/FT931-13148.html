			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Principality improves to Pounds 17m THE PROSPECT of building societies maintaining profitability despite the depressed housing market was reinforced yesterday as the Principality Building Society announced a 13 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 17m. The Principality, the 24th largest society by asset size, is the first to announce profits for the year ending December 31 1992. Its pre-tax outcome was helped by bad debt provisions being held at Pounds 1.6m, against Pounds 1.5m in 1991. Mr John Mitchell, chief executive, said the low bad debt charge on a mortgage book of Pounds 890.6m (Pounds 823.1m) reflected the fact that the society assessed lending risk centrally rather than through its 49 branches. Mr Mitchell said the result was due to prudent management. It did not simply have a better bad debt record because it carries out little lending in the depressed housing market of south-east England. Peter Alan, the society's estate agent subsidiary, recorded a profit for the second year running. The number of the society's borrowers in arrears fell by 14 per cent, while repossessed properties fell by 15 per cent. The society's profit after tax as a percentage of total assets rose slightly to 1.07 per cent (1.06 per cent). Mr Mitchell said it had maintained a level of profitability over five years unmatched by any of the top 20 societies. Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the society's 'excellent' results were an indicator of the resilience in society profits that was likely to be seen in the coming reporting season. The society's total assets rose to Pounds 1.12bn (Pounds 1.03bn), while its ratio of gross capital to assets strengthened to 7.35 per cent from 6.69 per cent.</p>

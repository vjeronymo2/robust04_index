			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / UK Company News: TR City of London net assets advance TR City of London Trust reported net assets up from 133.64p to 135.33p over the year to the end of June. Net revenue for the year improved from Pounds 9.02m to Pounds 10.7m for earnings per share of 5.25p (4.59p). A fourth interim dividend of 1.31p has already been paid for a total of 5p (4.8p). For the current year the board is forecasting a total dividend of 5.24p. The result was helped by a decision to charge half management expenses to reserves. If the same allocation had applied in the previous year revenue would have been Pounds 9.3m for earnings per share of 4.81p.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Wills and times MY WIFE and I are thinking of writing our wills. Should we both be involved in an accident - an air crash - and were both found dead, would one be presumed to have died before the other? If so, which one? What happens if we are both involved in the same accident and one dies, and the other is injured and dies later - would death be presumed to have happened at the same time as the deceased partner? If not, and the will of the first dead left all to the second, would this happen as per the will? Under current legislation where deaths are simultaneous or the sequence is unknown the younger is deemed to have survived the elder, save that on intestacy the estate of each falls to be distributed as if the other had not survived. If it is known that one survived the other, the normal rules of distribution of estates would apply, ie. the survivor's estate takes any gift which the will of the first to die (or his or her intestacy) gives to the survivor. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

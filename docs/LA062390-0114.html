			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUGH SOUTHERN, GM OF THE MET, RESIGNS  </P> <P> In a mysterious move that stunned the music world Friday, Hugh Southern,  general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, abruptly resigned his post for  unexplained reasons effective July 1. Southern, 58, a former official of the  National Endowment for the Arts in Washington, had held the position only since  November.  </P> <P> "I have been reluctant to make such a choice, but I have become aware over the  course of the season that I have not found fulfillment at the Met," Southern  stated in a press release. "I, therefore, felt it would not be fair or  productive to continue."  </P> <P> Mrs. Gilbert W. Humphrey, president of the Met Board of Directors, responded:  "We are very sorry he will not be continuing, but we understand his feelings  and wish him well in his endeavors."  </P> <P> Southern was unavailable for further comment, but an official of the company  who requested anonymity said, "There were some actions which he (Southern) took  that the board did not like. A settlement of the contract was made after  negotiations."  </P> <P> Coming to the Met last fall, Southern brought credentials that included 14  years as executive director of the Theater Development Fund in New York City,  and a background in theater production. Like ad executive and former Met  general manager Bruce Crawford before him, Southern was seen as a top manager  who could oversee financial matters while artistic director James Levine took  the lead in aesthetic decisions.  </P> <P> Southern, a native of England who won the Met job despite being a dark horse  candidate, was paid a reported yearly salary of $350,000 for a three-year  contract. He succeeded Crawford, former head of the advertising firm of  BBD&amp;O, who left the Met to become chief executive officer of Omnicom.  </P> <P> Crawford, in his three years as head of the Met, the nation's largest opera  company, was credited by many with bringing financial stability to the company.  </P> <P> There was no indication when a new general manager might be appointed.  </P></p>

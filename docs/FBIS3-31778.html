Dusan Kovacevic, the Bosnian Serbs' "defense minister," told  AFP the problem was resolved peacefully late Tuesday at Osijek,  near Ilidza, a western suburb of the Bosnian capital, after the  units received orders from their military headquarters.    "These arms were withdrawn deep into our territory, not to  any particular destination, and will not be used at any point  along the front unless the Moslems (Moslem-led Bosnian  government forces) launch a general offensive against the  Serbs," the general said.    He denied reports in Sarajevo that the Serbs had moved the  arms toward the Olovo front, 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of  Sarajevo, where fierce clashes broke out between Serbs and  Moslems in November and December.    Journalists who witnessed the settlement said the soldiers  had refused to turn in their weapons unless UN peacekeepers  deployed along the front line.    The confrontation began Sunday, in the run-up to the  expiration of a NATO-imposed deadline to Bosnian Serbs to  withdraw their weapons from around Sarajevo or put them under UN  control by midnight GMT, or face air strikes.    The recalcitrant units were based at Ilidza, Grbavica, the  only part of central Sarajevo under Serb control, and in the  northern part of the front lines.</p>

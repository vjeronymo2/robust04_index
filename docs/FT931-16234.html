			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Allies confident of air superiority THE US, France and Britain have been able to wield the threat of overwhelming air power to back up the UN's ultimatum to Iraq over the recent deployment of anti-aircraft missiles in the country's southern no-fly zone, writes David White, Defence Correspondent. More than 200 US, French and British combat aircraft deployed within striking distance of Iraq provide a force considered by the US defence department to be easily sufficient for a punitive action. Three-quarters of these fighters and bombers are based in Saudi Arabia, including 20 F-117A 'Stealth' aircraft - the type that led the air attacks on Baghdad in January 1991 - stationed at the southwestern base of Khamis Mushayt. Aircraft concentrated at Dhahran in eastern Saudi Arabia include US Air Force F-15s and F-16s as well as F/A-18s and F-14 Tomcats disembarked from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, currently in the Gulf. The US also has specialised anti-radar aircraft in place - versions of the F-111 and F-4 - equipped with jamming equipment and Harm anti-radar missiles. Other aircraft at Dhahran include six British Tornado bombers recently arrived from Bruggen in Germany, and eight French Mirage 2000 fighters. The three allies also have some 52 combat aircraft at Incirlik in southeastern Turkey. The Iraqi air-defence missiles which have given rise to the latest confrontation provide relatively easily targets. The Soviet-made SA-2 and SA-3 are weapons of 1960s vintage, both guided by radar. If the radars were emitting they would be attacked with Harm missiles or the British equivalent, the Alarm.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Brown pledges to curb bank charges Banks and building societies would face legislation to cut the cost of customers' service charges under proposals outlined by Labour yesterday. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the next Labour government would act quickly to curb the growth of charges, which have nearly doubled in six years. Figures produced by Mr Brown's office suggest that service charges levied by the nine biggest banks and societies rose from Pounds 7.5bn in 1988 to Pounds 13.4bn in 1993. The charges cover services such as arrangement and overdraft fees, unauthorised overdrafts and returning or stopping cheques. Mr Brown said banks would be required to tell customers about changes in charges before implementing them. He said that all charges should be published, to allow customers to compare fee scales. Labour will release full details of its proposals later this week in a policy paper timed to exploit public unease about the announcement of healthy profits by some of the big banks. Barclays recently announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.04bn in the six months to June 30, compared with Pounds 335m in the same period last year. Midland Bank's interim profits rose Pounds 58m to Pounds 443m. However, banks said that advance notification of charges was already required by the end of 1996 under the voluntary code of banking practice. Most of the main clearing banks plan to bring in pre-notification more quickly, and some have already done so. Lloyds and Barclays said they had already taken action on other points raised by Mr Brown, such as sending customers a tariff of all charges. Both banks have also abolished some of the most unpopular charges, such as the fee for sending account-holders a letter to inform them that they are overdrawn.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Canada's debt dilemma Last week's publication of the Canadian government's document outlining a new framework for economic policy was accompanied by much plain talking from finance minister Mr Paul Martin. 'We are,' he declared, 'in hock up to our eyeballs.' Current policy, he added, was unsustainable; and further spending cuts or tax increases would be needed to put it back on course. The good news for Mr Martin was that the bond markets did not take fright at his diagnosis. But nor were they cheered by his protestations of fiscal austerity to come. Despite the modest improvement in market sentiment since the narrow victory for the separatist Parti Quebecois in the recent Quebec election, the yield on 10-year government bonds remains at over 9 per cent. Even assuming an increase in Canada's inflation rate to 2 per cent - the midpoint of the official inflation target - the real yield would still be a phenomenal 7 per cent. That is more than 2 1/4 percentage points above the real yield on US Treasury bonds. Unflattering though the comparison may be, it does not point to market fears of a direct Canadian default. Real yields on US dollar-denominated Canadian government bonds are closer to those on US government debt than Canadian. Nor is inflation set to take off in the short to medium term. The question is how far other factors can justify such a differential. Capital importer Part of the gap is attributable to Canada's role as a capital importer. Despite running a consistent trade surplus, the country has had a current account deficit in all but three of the past 20 years, largely because of interest payments on a huge stock of external debt. Much of that foreign debt, amounting to 44 per cent of GDP, has been used to finance current consumption. The result is that the current account deficit this year will be equivalent to 2 1/2 per cent of GDP at a point where Canada's chief trading partner, the US, is close to the peak of the economic cycle. Nor has the political worry entirely gone away, despite evidence in recent polls that there is no great appetite in Quebec for separation. Yet by far the most important factor in the bond market is the risk premium relating to a spiralling debt stock which stands at 100 per cent of GDP. Canada is in the vicious circle where deficits lead to higher interest rates, which in turn create further budgetary problems. Such is the compounding effect of interest on the outstanding debt that despite federal spending now being lower today as a proportion of GDP than in the mid-1970s, fiscal deficits have become endemic. Faster growth With growth of 4 1/2 per cent the federal government calculates that it will need to run a primary budget surplus (which excludes interest) of more than 2.6 per cent before its debt to GDP ratio can begin to stabilise. Yet the primary surplus this year will fall well short of that level; and the federal government has always had difficulty in restraining provincial government spending. While faster growth has offset the impact of the rise in interest rates this year, the increase will become more damaging over time as existing long-term debt matures. There are two obvious policy responses. The least desirable is to monetise the debt by borrowing from the banking system, a form of internal default by inflation which will lead to overvaluation of the real exchange rate and subsequent devaluation. That is what the bond markets fear. While superficially attractive, it is no real solution because it increases the cost of servicing the mountain of foreign denominated debt. The alternative, which the Liberal government rightly prefers, is fiscal adjustment. But while the government talks of root and branch social security reform and proposes to reduce the deficit from 5.4 per cent last year to 3 per cent by 1996-97, the markets are suspending judgment until they see real action. Mr Martin claims that the government can deliver predominantly through spending cuts. That hope looks pious in the light of many previous failed attempts to cut the deficit. Without significant tax increases, Mr Martin's next budget is unlikely to receive the endorsement that will pave the way for lower real interest rates.</p>

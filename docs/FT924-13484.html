			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Rise in volume reflects ERM turmoil - William Cochrane explains the reasons for the surge in European turnover last month Last month, European equity investors and traders came back from their summer holidays to the partial collapse of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). International investors made big changes in their portfolio weightings, and turnover figures for the top eight bourses soared by 37.3 per cent in September. The gain over July was just 5.1 per cent, but, says Mr James Cornish of County NatWest which produces the turnover figures, the ERM realignments and the currency turmoil surrounding them were far more important than the return from holiday in producing the upsurge. This September saw turnover in European Seaq International stocks in London up by 73.7 per cent over August, reflecting the influence of international investors and their need to deal in size. In some cases, the wages of virtue were no more rewarding than the consequences of running a soft currency. For its return to fiscal probity, Switzerland saw a 7 per cent gain in the SMI index, while in the effectively devalued UK, the Footsie index climbed by 10 per cent over the month. The fall in the dollar at the beginning of September, the thin Yes majority in the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty and the resulting devaluations and floatings had moved international investors, in particular, to take advantage of currency gains: by selling equities lifted by currency appreciation; and by buying UK equities thought to be beneficiaries of the weaker sterling. UK turnover, and UK equities, rose in tandem. But in France, where the franc withstood the currency storm at the cost of higher interest rates, revaluation against several trading partners and a savage reduction in earnings estimates, the CAC 40 index managed an appreciation of just 3 per cent on the month as turnover more than doubled. In Spain, share prices fell on poor first-half company results. The peseta devaluation particularly hurt the utilities sector, but banks enjoyed a mid-September rally which was halted sharply when the Bank of Spain imposed exchange controls. Performance was mixed, too, in the D-Mark bloc. In Germany, the slowdown in the economy, exacerbated by the costs of integrating the eastern Lander, coincided with devaluations of currencies covering a fifth of German exports, according to Barclays de Zoete Wedd Strategy. This combination put particular strain on cyclical stocks as the DAX index fell nearly 5 per cent over the month. Turnover rose by only 7.3 per cent, falling below that of London in dollar terms - and this in spite of the effective devaluation of sterling - for the first time since December 1991. Switzerland, meanwhile, is regaining its 'safe haven' status after a period of rising inflation and high interest rates which bedevilled the market during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Swiss franc has appreciated against the D-Mark this year and the Zurich equity market outperformed the rest of Europe during the third quarter of 1992, further raising its cumulative performance since the beginning of the year. The Netherlands might appear to be in similar case, with a rise in turnover of 47 per cent on the month, compared with 48.7 per cent in Switzerland. However, says James Capel, while the ERM reshuffle brought better volumes last month, average daily turnover of Fl 555m (Dollars 346m) in the third quarter had receded from the Fl 645m of April/June. 'Recently,' says James Capel, 'we learned. . . . .that foreign investors, on balance, sold Dutch equities worth Fl 1.4bn in Q2. This was the 10th consecutive quarter of net foreign sales, totalling Fl 9.9bn over this period. Our impression is that this trend was continued into Q3.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                  Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse           June        Jul        Aug       Sep       US                  1992       1992       1992      1992   Dollars bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium         40.57      34.78      41.38      42.76     1.47 France         134.26     100.18      64.52     134.26    28.08 Germany        109.97     121.51     101.72     109.19    77.27 Italy        8,594.77  11,975.60   6,039.60  10,808.00     8.73 Netherlands     12.00      13.10       9.80      14.41     9.05 Spain          515.35     538.64     317.47     578.78     5.84 Switzerland     12.46      10.89       9.01      13.40    10.85 UK              34.05      34.33      26.68      45.30    80.76  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Italian data adjusted to include off-market trading.

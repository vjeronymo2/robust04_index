Social Democratic Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said he  pushed the request in a meeting Friday with Hosokawa at the  premier's official residence. "I told the premier that even the  U.N. Security Council would not be able to reach an agreement  (to impose the sanctions) easily," he told reporters as he  stepped out of the room where he held talks with Hosokawa.    "I asked the premier to respond cautiously regarding the  North Korean matter," Murayama said. He quoted Hosokawa as  replying to him on the spot, "it may be so."    The premier's remark came one day after he told South Korean  President Kim Yong-sam, "if the U.N. Security Council adopted a  resolution (to impose economic sanctions), Japan will take a  responsible step (to comply with the resolution) within the  boundary of the Constitution."    Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a lecture meeting  Thursday the premier's vow to act in accordance with the  Constitution implies Japan's readiness to revise laws to impose  economic sanctions.    The United States has been asking Japan to block the annual  flow of cash remittances to North Korea from the pro-Pyongyang  Korean community, whose size Japanese intelligence reportedly  estimated at 180 to 200 billion yen.    The SDP, which has long maintained friendly ties with the  (North) Korean Workers' Party, has consistently balked at  Japan's possible participation in the economic sanctions.    The U.N. Security Council is now sketching out a resolution  following Thursday's report to it by Hans Blix, director general  of the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Pyongyang broke  its vow to allow its inspectors to take samples of radioactive  materials from its suspected nuclear arms facilities.</p>

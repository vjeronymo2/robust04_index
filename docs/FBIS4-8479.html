			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Laszlo Csucs, vice-president of </F> Hungarian Radio, by Zsolt Mester; place and date not given:  "Change of Regime at the Hungarian Radio"]    [Text] [Mester] The government approved a request for  special assistance in providing lump-sum settlements in  connection with downsizing; thus, the last obstacle was removed  before the planned measure can be carried out. The people  concerned in the case were given notice. Who are you dismissing  in the end?    [Csucs] I will not publicize a list, because it could be  regarded as branding the people in question, and it could injure  their personality rights.    [Mester] However, I have seen a list which included, among  other people, Akos Mester, Istvan Bolcs, Henrik Havas, Sandor  Szenasi....    [Csucs] I will not play guessing games.    [Mester] ....that is to say, star reporters, professionally  recognized radio personalities with great experience.    [Csucs] This is a matter of opinion. It is one thing how  well  one knows the ins and outs of the profession, and quite another  what he does with his expertise and talent. If he carries out  his job in a way which is ethically reprehensible, he is not  suitable to hold a public service position.    [Mester] On 3 March, two demonstrations took place in front  of the radio station. In one group, the radio employees  gathered, and in the other, the followers of Istvan Csurka who  were cheering for you. The radio employees saw a perfect proof  in this that you are supported by the extreme right. Csurka's  group had also announced earlier that in the district in which  you run for parliament, they will not have a candidate.    [Csucs] If any segment of society supports such initiatives  in such a critical situation, which is at the same time a nearly  historical moment, I will gratefully acknowledge it, and have no  intention of refusing it. It would be absurd to pick and choose  whose sympathy I am counting on, and whose I am not. Concerning  my running for parliament, it is true that in Baranya county, in  district five, in Mohacs and environs, several voters and  parties solicited me to become a candidate. In the beginning I  was inclined to do so, because I have ties to this region; I  know the problems of the people who live there, and I know that  I could effectively contribute to solving them. Unfortunately,  my present task, just like that of a parliamentary  representative, requires my complete attention. I decided that  as long as the powers that be do not prevent me, I will try to  carry out the task I undertook at the Radio with the greatest  devotion and honesty. Thus, to my great regret, I cannot  undertake to run for parliament.    [Mester] With what kind of a program, on which platform,  would you have run?    [Csucs] On the one hand, I consider the concord of national  forces important, because in our past, in our history, the  reason for defeat could always be pinpointed in discord. I  wanted to work for concord, on the basis of Christian values,  which for me do not mean only a kind of religious commitment,  but also honoring the natural and social laws formulated in the  Ten Commandments. On this basis, I wanted to implement my  primarily economic program, which includes budget reform, a  complete refurbishing of the budget, the overhaul of the system  of taxation, the examination of the acute problems of  agriculture, and so on. I think this program could be made  credible by my professional career and my past, rather than by  unsubstantiated promises.    [Mester] Let us return to the Radio. Earlier you said that  when it comes to dismissals one must think of the group of  people who refuse to support the transformation of the radio.  How did this resistance manifest itself?    [Csucs] When Csaba Gombar left and it was incumbent on me to  carry out the tasks of president, I initiated the transformation  of the Radio so that it would function as a national  institution, and would fully carry out its public service task,  especially in the area of objective, all-round information. My  task was made considerably more difficult by the fact that in  1990 there was no change of regime at the Radio, and thus the  people devoted to the previous regime were strengthened. It is  not a well-known fact how we probed behind the scenes, how we  tried to find points of contact with decisive forces in the  Radio, including the star reporters, in order to get along. I am  not interested in their past--which is, incidentally,  universally known; I am not interested where they are coming  from, only where they are going. If they leave their political  affiliation outside the gate, they can continue working; they  cannot be harassed, moreover, we can fully utilize their  expertise. A very long series of experiments were conducted, in  which I was able to make use of the past of chief editor Jozsef  P. Szabo, who used to be a diplomat, and who is not only an  extremely talented and experienced radio personality, but also,  on account of his human capabilities and attitude, was a perfect  mediator, should direct contact with the decisive elements fail.  My only request was to discuss without screaming how we could  make the Radio even better. Unfortunately, the people in  question did not think that this was possible. At the same time,  they expressed their aversion at every turn, also in their  programs. No self-respecting management can tolerate such  behavior. I tolerated it for more than a year. Now the cup is  full. The change of regime must take place.    [Mester] Many people consider your measure to be an act of  the government. Are the remaining radio employees supportive of  the government?    [Csucs] One can hardly find journalists who are supportive  of  the government, especially not in the political programs on the  Kossuth station which can be regarded as decisive. And anyway,  it is no criterion whether someone is supportive of the  government. The ethical code is still in force, and I hope the  remaining employees will keep to the norms.    [Mester] If it is a change of regime that is taking place in  the Radio, as you formulated it, is it not too late for that?  Was it worth embarking on it before the election? Some people  think that if the government falls, the dismissed employees will  return.    [Csucs] It is too late for a change of regime, because it  should have been done four years ago. But not to take steps on  the pretext that it is too late would not only be a crime  against the listeners, but also, we are simply not in the  financial position to maintain the current situation. I find it  despicable that the budget does not finance the public service  tasks, but rather we must rely on subscriptions which are an  uncertain source of income. Namely, this forces us to increase  our commercial activities, while the rules and regulations  stipulated by the government oblige us to carry out public  service tasks. But they don't give us any money. What can I do  in such a situation? Should I decrease the power of the Kossuth  station, so the Hungarians beyond the border could not hear it?  Should I cancel the Bartok station, which broadcasts the brunt  of cultural and artistic programming? Or the foreign language  programs from abroad? Downsizing is the only possible solution,  and the State Accounting Office pointed this out to me as early  as 1992. And as far as the return of the dismissed is concerned,  it is hardly likely that there would be a radio president who  would re-hire them in this financial situation, especially the  ones who did not keep to the ethical norm.    [Mester] Are you not afraid that the dismissed Radio  employees will become martyrs?    [Csucs] I am certain they will. They will make sure that  they  will get a monument. But it will be a monument carved in ice,  and the first spring rays of sunshine will melt them.</p>

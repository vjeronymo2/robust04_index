			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Letter: Contracts for directors in line with risk Sir, With the recent cutting back of the Top Pay Review Board's recommendations for pay awards for senior public appointments ('Top public pay rises cut to 4 per cent', July 10), much has been made of the difference in the risk/reward ratio between the public and private sectors. While it may now be argued that this ratio, given the current economic situation, is broadly correct for the public sector, it is open to question whether in the private sector reward has not overtaken risk. Chairmen of board remuneration committees might now begin to wonder whether, with salaries broadly equivalent to worldwide values and with well-constructed incentive schemes giving the potential for considerable enhancement, the other benefits considered appropriate for senior private sector positions should be reconsidered. No one would grudge share options to a captain of industry - particularly as they are, as a recent correspondent suggested, 'a gamble to which he or she is entitled' - nor such trappings of office as cars. However, it could be questioned whether contracts of two, three and even more years should continue to be available. There have been many instances recently where a person who has manifestly failed has left the company with a substantial sum of money. For a shareholder, this is a questionable outcome as in the preceding years substantial remuneration will have been paid. Would it not be much more equitable if company directors and senior executives were to have the same notice and redundancy terms as any other employee in their company?

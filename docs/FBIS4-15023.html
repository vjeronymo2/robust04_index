			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Galkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- "As a result of slowing down  rates of inflation, the development of small-scale business,  farming, farmers' personal subsidiary plots, the revival in  branches of the consumer sector of the economy and the  implementation of social programs, we count to stabilize the  living standards of the main part of the Russian population by  the end of 1994," Yakov Urinson, first deputy minister of  economics of Russia, stated on Tuesday speaking at parliamentary  hearings on the draft of Russia's federal budget for 1994.    According to Yakov Urinson, the draft budget envisages the  conducting of a moderately rigid financial policy with a  balanced approach to the settlement of current and medium-term  tasks. This approach implies a selective state support for  highly efficient productions and the implementation of  investment projects which are quickly repaid, as well as the  expansion of sources of financing in social spheres.    The first deputy minister of economics believes that in 1994  workers' incomes and their minimum wages will increase. The  ratio of the growth of the minimum wage and consumer prices is  expected to be 85-90 per cent. The size of wages with due  account for the expected subsistence wage will rise 4.9 times by  the end of 1994. On the whole during the year real cash incomes  of the population will decrease insignificantly in the course of  the implementation of an active policy of economic  stabilization, Yakov Urinson promised.</p>

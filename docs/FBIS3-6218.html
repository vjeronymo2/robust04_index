			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Japan's telecommunications  ministry confirmed Tuesday [15 March] that it will remain  neutral on a complaint filed by Japanese international operators  against cut-rate services offered in Japan by U.S.-affiliated  firms.    Japan is shelving the decision on whether to restrict or  keep  allowing the services, an official at the Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry said, noting that global attention  is fixed on Japan and the United States.    "We are seeking a compromise measure...but Japan cannot move  alone on an issue that requires international adjustments," said  Hirokazu Suda, director of the ministry's tariff division at the  ministry's Telecommunications Bureau.    The comments came after an industry official last Friday  quoted government sources as saying that the ministry had  virtually dismissed the Japanese industry's petition as it found  the U.S. firms' services posed no problem under current rules.    Suda admitted that the services cannot be restricted under  the current law, but said, "it's just that the law was not made  to encompass such a new, advanced service." He described the  services as "abnormal."    But with the services already spreading, user benefits of a  service that was invented amid the global trend toward  deregulation cannot be ignored, he said.    "We just have no idea yet, and don't know which countries  will come up with a good solution," Suda said.    KDD and other common carriers should also review their  services and rates, he said.    Three Japanese common carriers led by KDD, which formerly  monopolized Japan's international phone services, lodged the  petition in January requesting the ministry to probe the  "call-back" discount services which they claimed use their lines  unfairly, free of charge.    The move followed a similar complaint filed with the U.S.  Federal Communications Commission (FCC) last autumn by American  Telephone and Telegraph Co. against U.S. discount phone firms  exploiting call-back and other such systems.    Under the call-back system offered in Japan, users call a  switching center in the United States and hang up after two  rings. After a few seconds, the center calls back and the users  dial the actual number they want to call, the country of origin  of the call now being the United States.    In the U.S., cut-rate operators use lines offered with  discounts to large-lot resellers by common carriers.    Suda said Japan is gathering information from the FCC, which  is also having difficulties in ruling on the issue. The FCC is  also probably watching what Japan will do, he said.    France and Germany are focusing attention on Japan because  U.S. discount rate operators have also entered those two  nations, he said.</p>

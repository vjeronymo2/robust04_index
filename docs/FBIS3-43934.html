			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Osman Hassan Ali, alias Osman Ato, Professor  Mohamed Hassan Awaleh, and Omar Salad Ilmi held a press  conference this morning at the United Somali Congress [USC]  headquarters, Mogadishu, in which they spoke about their illegal  detention in a UN Operation Somalia [UNOSOM] jail, in addition  to other problems they had recently encountered. The honorables  gave an account of how they were kidnapped from their homes on  21 September and 3 October 1993 and how they had been treated  until their release on 10 January 1994.    The honorables started by saying that for the first 24 hours  of their kidnapping they had been handcuffed, no food had been  provided to them, and water was in very short supply. Shortly  afterwards, they were taken to an island off the coast of  Kismaayo, which was barely fit for human habitation, as the  temperature was 40 degrees Celsius during the daytime and very  cold at night.    The honorables went on to say that in disrespect to their  religion UNOSOM sometimes added pork to their meals -- but they  threw it away. They said after some time they fell ill in  detention and their request for treatment fell on deaf ears,  resulting in a deterioration in their health. They also stated  that they were subjected to terrible noises coming from jet  fighters and helicopters, with the aim of terrorizing them. The  citizens also said that the reason for their being taken to  Baidoa was to attempt to prove that they were the ones  responsible for all acts against UNOSOM troops.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICAL BRAWL OVER HOMELESS;  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA: COPING WITH TRANSIENTS EMERGES AS A MAJOR ELECTION ISSUE.  PROPOSITION Y SEEKS TO OUST CITY ATTY. ROBERT MYERS, WHO OPPONENTS SAY IS TOO  SOFT ON THE HOMELESS.  </P> <P> Some love him, some hate him, but no one in Santa Monica is likely to accuse  City Atty. Robert M. Myers of being a conventional, play-it-safe politician.  </P> <P> For years, Myers has been the official most closely identified with Santa  Monica's tolerant attitude toward the homeless. A determined social activist,  he regularly volunteers to help at the food handouts that take place each  afternoon in front of City Hall.  </P> <P> His refusal to prosecute transients for some nonviolent minor crimes draws  praise from supporters who see him as a person of compassion and enlightenment.  Critics, however, regard Myers as the person most responsible for making Santa  Monica a magnet for troublemakers, freeloaders and aggressive panhandlers.  </P> <P> Now, nine years after he was first appointed to the job by the City Council,  Myers is the target of a ballot measure, Proposition Y in the Nov. 6 election,  aimed at removing him from office by making the office elective rather than  appointed.  </P> <P> Myers offers no apologies. In fact, when he held an anti-Proposition Y  fund-raising event last month, the invitations urged those who came to bring  along a homeless friend.  </P> <P> Homelessness, and how the city should respond to the problem, has emerged as a  major issue in the city elections. In addition to Proposition Y, the issue  figures prominently in the City Council campaigns.  </P> <P> Nine candidates are seeking three seats on the council, and all have felt  obliged to take a public position on Proposition Y -- four are in favor, and  five opposed. Several of the candidates have also made the issue of  homelessness a central theme of their campaigns.  </P> <P> But in recent weeks, attention has also focused on the tactics of Proposition  Y's chief advocate, Leslie Dutton, president of the conservative Assn. of  American Women, because of what opponents call misleading and personal attacks  on Myers.  </P> <P> Further muddying the water is the fact that some voters who have lost battles  with Myers over rent control or development issues are supporting the ballot  measure because they say it is the only way to get him out of office. Myers has  been city attorney since 1981 and is the author of the city's tough  rent-control law and an advocate of more affordable housing in the city.  </P> <P> On the sidelines and generally frustrated with the entire situation are  officials from social service agencies that deal with the homeless. With  limited success, they are urging City Council candidates to tone down the  rhetoric and seriously discuss what they consider a complicated regional and  national problem.  </P> <P> Vivian Rothstein, executive director of the Ocean Park Community Center, which  offers shelter and other programs for homeless people, said there has been a  tendency over the years in Santa Monica and elsewhere for local candidates to  try "to use homelessness to get elected."  </P> <P> "I think it is a reprehensible thing," she said. "Homeless people are the most  powerless people. This is not an issue that can be solved by a local election."  </P> <P> Christine Reed, the lone incumbent among the nine council candidates, was quick  out of the blocks last month with a flurry of press releases indicating her  indignation over a recent incident in which police officers did not remove two  homeless men from sleeping overnight on the grounds of Franklin Elementary  School.  </P> <P> At the time, Reed said she was "thoroughly fed up with the current council  majority's laissez-faire attitude toward the ever-worsening homeless problem."  </P> <P> Reed says she has fought for several years to get a workable homeless policy in  the city, but has been thwarted by the council majority. She is pushing for  implementation of a program that would put homeless people to work cleaning up  the beach.  </P> <P> "In addition, we have to enforce local laws to protect our citizens," said  Reed, who supports Proposition Y. "We cannot allow an elitist majority in City  Hall, with their handpicked city attorney, to continually turn their backs on  their responsibility to protect law-abiding citizens of this community."  </P> <P> Other candidates, in particular attorney Kathleen Schwallie, say Reed has  seized on the homeless issue only to divert attention from an issue on which  she is vulnerable: her support over the years for many large development  projects.  </P> <P> "We're going to assure that her record is made clear during the campaign,"  Schwallie said.  </P> <P> Proposition Y, which would amend the City Charter to make the city attorney an  elected official rather than a council appointee, was placed on the ballot  through an initiative drive that collected nearly 11,000 signatures after the  stabbing last spring of an 89-year-old woman by a transient.  </P> <P> Dutton blames Myers' tolerant attitude toward homeless people for a rise in  crime by transients. She said the free daily feeding program at City Hall  encourages more homeless people to come to Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "We have created a Mecca for a disaster," she said. "Santa Monica has become  the home of the homeless."  </P> <P> Many residents are supporting the measure out of frustration of having lost  their parks and beaches to homeless people who sleep there. Others are annoyed  at being asked for money by transients while dining at outdoor cafes or simply  walking around the city.  </P> <P> No one knows exactly how many homeless people there are in Santa Monica, but  social service officials believe that hundreds of people are living on city  streets and beaches. Social workers generally concur that the Santa  Monica-Venice area harbors the largest concentration of homeless in Los Angeles  County outside of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Dutton and other supporters of Proposition Y contend that the city's annual  $2-million commitment to homeless programs citywide and Myers' reluctance to  aggressively prosecute misdemeanor crimes committed by transients add up to a  welcome mat for homeless people.  </P> <P> "As long as transients perceive a hands-off policy here, they are going to keep  coming here," said Jean Sedillos, co-chairwoman of Concerned Homeowners of  Santa Monica, a citywide homeowner group supporting the measure.  </P> <P> Dutton, meanwhile, has gone beyond the homeless issue to attack Myers for other  things. Citing his several trespassing arrests at protests of nuclear testing  and in opposition to U.S. policies in Central America, she has labeled him a  "convicted and habitual criminal." Dutton also recently ran an ad in the Los  Angeles Journal, a legal paper, soliciting applications for the job of elected  city attorney -- which, of course, does not exist.  </P> <P> Some of Myers' allies have launched a counterattack.  </P> <P> "If I was a supporter of the measure, I would be embarrassed by the way the  campaign has been handled so far," said attorney Chris Harding.  </P> <P> A group of lawyers from Santa Monica opposing the measure also questioned  Dutton's tactics.  </P> <P> "We have often disagreed with our city attorney's positions," the group's  statement said. "However, as attorneys we respect honest disagreement, provided  that the rules of fair play are observed. . . . Supporters of the elected city  attorney initiative have trampled on fair play and integrity."  </P> <P> Mayor Dennis Zane, a longtime Myers supporter, has tried to shift the  discussion of Proposition Y away from Myers and the homeless problems, saying  it is a question of whether the office of the city attorney should be an  elected office.  </P> <P> "We cannot be assured of the skills of someone elected to office," he said at a  recent debate sponsored by the Santa Monica Area Chamber of Commerce. "We do  not simply need another politician. We have enough with seven politicians."  </P> <P> But Dutton countered that Myers already had politicized the job with his  numerous arrests in connection with what she called "trendy political causes."  </P> <P> Zane and other opponents of the measure have argued that if people are unhappy  with Myers, they should make it a campaign issue in the upcoming election for  three seats on the City Council.  </P> <P> In fact, it would take five of seven City Council votes to remove Myers --  something that most political observers in the city regard as unlikely to  materialize.  </P> <P> Thus, some of Myers' longtime adversaries on other issues are embracing  Proposition Y as a means to an end.  </P> <P> "Something has got to give somewhere," said James Baker, a landlord who is  active in the fight to weaken the city's tough rent-control system. "I don't  know any other practical, pragmatic way to do it."  </P> <P> So far in the campaign, Myers has been uncharacteristically reticent. He  initially refused to respond at all to Dutton's charges, but recently has  countered by calling her remarks false and misleading.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, he said the real victim of Dutton's campaign is the  community.  </P> <P> "Ms. Dutton has failed to offer any constructive solutions to the national  disgrace of men, women and children living on our streets," he said. "Stirring  up fear and prejudice is not helpful in addressing the tragic problems  associated with homelessness in America."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, other residents and officials from social service agencies are  hoping there can be a real discussion of the homeless issue during the  campaign.  </P> <P> "Maybe we should ask the different City Council candidates for their position  on the issue," said Daniel R. Kingsley, a vice president with the Maguire  Thomas Partners development firm and co-chairman of the Chamber of Commerce's  homeless task force. "We shouldn't let their lack of interest keep them from  addressing the real issue."  </P> <P> At the Ocean Park Community Center, Vivian Rothstein concurs.  </P> <P> "It does not matter who is city attorney in Santa Monica; this is a mental  health crisis," she said. "I wish the energy going toward slamming Bob Myers  would go to fighting the closure of mental health clinics."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Proposition Y, one of 10 ballot measures to be considered by Santa Monica  voters Nov. 6, would make the city attorney an elected position rather than one  appointed by the City Council. It was placed on the ballot through an  initiative drive sponsored by community members concerned about crime and  aggressive panhandling by the city's sizable population of homeless people.  City Atty. Robert M. Myers has been targeted by the group because of his  reluctance to prosecute nonviolent crimes committed by the homeless. Four City  Council candidates have endorsed Proposition Y, and five are opposed to it. In  favor are Robert T. Holbrook, Larry Jon Hobbs, Donna Alvarez, and incumbent  Councilwoman Christine Reed. Opposed are Tony Vasquez, Kelly Olsen, Kathleen  Schwallie, Sharon L. Gilpin and Jean Gebman.  </P></p>

"If this idea fails to gain broad support within the CIS, it  could be formed by Russia and Kazakhstan," Nazarbayev stressed  at a meeting in Moscow's State University today.    The union, in his opinion, should be based on principles  different from those of the CIS, although he added that he was  not calling for the restoration of the old Soviet Union or the  formation of an empire.    Nazarbayev said that the new union should have  supra-national  bodies to coordinate the economic, defense and foreign policies  of the member states with a council of heads of state and  governments to discuss strategic matters.    "This should be followed by direct elections to a common  parliament, which would coordinate the legislative activities of  all the member states," Nazarbayev explained.    He added that a council for defense ministers should be  formed to create an effective military bloc along with a foreign  ministers' council to coordinate members' joint activities in  the world arena.    He said the Eurasian Union should stipulate the introduction  of a single document or citizenship for all members, compulsory  concerted economic reform programs and the establishment of a  supra-national currency.    However, Nazarbayev said that membership of the union should  not interfere with any bilateral relations with third countries.    "The union should be based on the principle of equality,  respect of sovereignty and independence of states, guaranteed  rights of every man and woman and individuality of every state,"  he added.    Nazarbayev, who arrived in Moscow for his first three-day  official visit to Russia, signed a "record number" of bilateral  documents with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, including  agreements on political, economic and military cooperation  between the two former Soviet republics.</p>

They Have Set Up Their Own  Club for This"]    [Text] "Transformations meeting the interests of society  are possible only with nationwide accord based on a clear  understanding of the aims, with a quest for ways to achieve  them, and, most importantly, with the determination of the price  which the country and its people will agree to pay for reforms,  without running the risk of facing a national catastrophe," the  "Statement on the Creation and Aims of the `Realists' Club"  states. The club was established in Moscow on 14 March. The  board of the new organization includes Aleksandr Vladislavlev,  first vice president of the RUIE [Russian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs]; Valeriy Neverov, president of  the "Germes" Concern; State Duma Deputy Yekaterina Lakhova;  Yuriy Petrov, chairman of the State Investment Corporation;  Nikolay Fedorov, president of the Chuvash Republic; Mikhail  Shmakov, chairman of the FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade  Unions of Russia]; and a number of other well-known politicians,  regional leaders, entrepreneurs, and arts figures who adhere to  the concept of political realism. Supporting the quest for a  mechanism to formulate accord "for the sake of supreme national  interests," they proposed convening a Russian congress "For  Civil Accord in the Name of Russia's Revival" to adopt the  appropriate document. The main aim of the "Realists" Club has  been proclaimed as pooling efforts to resolve the problems  facing the country and promoting mutual understanding and  cooperation between political and public forces.    The creation of the "Realists" Political Club may be  regarded  as one more response from society's political elite to the  president's initiative with regard to signing the Memorandum on  Civil Peace. In a broader context this event may also be defined  as a regrouping of society's "summit" forces in the search for a  response to the political, social, and spiritual-moral realities  of life today. Time will show what kind of response these  initiatives will elicit -- not only in the political  establishment but also in broad sections of the population.  <H5>  Composition of the "Realists" Club Board </H5>   1.

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Investors in 3i Stormy financial markets have forced 3i to trim its sails a touch but not prevented its flotation. The issue has been priced at a 13.5 per cent discount to net asset value, which is somewhat higher than the venture capital group's existing bank shareholders were originally looking for. Barings, 3i's merchant bank, has also thought it wise to choose a price which will mean that institutional shareholders will on average receive less than half the shares they apply for. That should ensure a healthy aftermarket provided equity prices do not take another dive in coming weeks. But it would be wrong to conclude that the pricing offers investors the prospect of quick profits. Though the bulk of 3i's portfolio is unquoted, it is valued by reference to market price/earnings ratios. Similarly, the drying up of new issues means it will take longer for 3i to realise the value of its assets. The 272p issue price merely reflects these factors. It is not particularly generous. 3i's main attraction is as a long-term investment. The company has out-performed average venture capital and smaller company investment trusts over the past decade. The source of this success is a branch network that enables 3i to invest in a much broader range of small companies than rival investment trusts are able to tap. Though there are costs in maintaining 3i's network, they have been cut in recent years. Because the competition in supplying finance to this sector is not severe, the prospective returns are higher.</p>

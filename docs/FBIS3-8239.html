			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sylwester Walczak from New York: "Former U.S. </F> Ambassador in Warsaw to Clinton: Support Kuklinski"]    [Text] Richard T. Davies, former ambassador of the United  States to Poland, recently sent an open letter to U.S. President  Bill Clinton. In the letter, Davies requests intervention in the  case of Colonel Ryszard Kuklinski.    Davies suggests that Clinton bring up the issue of  Kuklinski's rehabilitation during his visit to Poland, scheduled  for July. "I hope that you might draw President Walesa's  attention to the irony of the fact that the Pole, who before  1989 risked his life to help NATO, officially remains a traitor  and is liable to imprisonment, whereas the leaders of today's  Poland boast of its participation in NATO training and insist  upon full membership in this organization," writes Davies. He  emphasizes the "striking anomaly" that, in the case of the  people who were sentenced earlier for treason, such as  Spasowski, Rurarz, and Najder, the sentences were waived, but  the charges against Kuklinski still stand.    Davies recalls his earlier pleas defending the colonel, when  he made an appeal published in THE WASHINGTON POST, and in  letters to senators and congressmen, in which he suggested that  Kuklinski's rehabilitation be the preliminary condition for  Poland's admission to NATO. Kuklinski himself objected to such  a proposal at that time; he claimed that he attaches greater  importance to Poland's security, and, therefore, he would not  like this issue to even slightly impede Polish efforts to become  a member of the organization.    "Now the situation has changed," notes Davies. Poland has  joined the "Partnership for Peace," which is supposed to lead it  to NATO. For this reason, the president of the United States,  Poland's partner in this program, has a chance to repair the  evil by "persistently insisting" that the same criteria applied  in the cases of Spasowski, Rurarz, and Najder be applied to  Kuklinski.    However, the Office of the President of the Polish Republic  states that each of the three ways to rehabilitate Colonel  Kuklinski--extraordinary appeal, another trial, or an act of  clemency by the president--requires that he take the first step;  this is because--Davies quotes a letter from the Belweder--the  public debate that took place in Poland in 1992 did not provide  any final answer to the question of whether Kuklinski deserves  to be called a contemporary Wallenrod [heroic character in  Polish literature], or simply a foreign spy.    Davies foresees two obstacles that Clinton may encounter in  making an intervention in the case of Kuklinski. The president  may decide that this problem is too minor to affect the good  atmosphere of U.S.-Polish relations in any way; or he may decide  that it is an internal Polish affair.    However, due to what Kuklinski did for the West, NATO, the  United States, and the freedom of his own country, he really  deserves strong support of the United States, argues Davies.  Apart from that, he is now a U.S. citizen and the U.S.  authorities should be concerned about his good name.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Four banks handle Portuguese sell-off A four-bank consortium of Merrill Lynch, Banco Essi (the merchant banking arm of Espirito Santo, one of Portugal's leading financial groups), UBS and SG Warburg is to handle the sale of up to 30 per cent of Portugal Telecom, which is likely to be the biggest global telecoms privatisation of next year. The deal will consist of four tranches, each handled by a different bank. The domestic tranche, which will be listed in Lisbon, will be handled by Banco Essi; the North America tranche by Merrill Lynch; the UK tranche by SG Warburg and the rest of the world by UBS. Between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of the company will be sold in the initial public offering, which could raise between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 1.5bn. This would be Portugal's biggest privatisation and would value the whole company at between Dollars 4bn and Dollars 5bn. The offering is likely to take place in the second quarter of next year. Three international banking consortia were consulted by the Portuguese government to undertake a valuation of the company, which was formed by the merger earlier this year of three state-owned telecommunications utilities and is the country's biggest employer. Portugal, which has about 34 telephone lines per 100 population, is expected to open its telephone services to competition by 2003, five years after most of the European Union.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 1 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam told Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata in a telephone  conversation Sunday [1 May] that Seoul will closely cooperate  with Japan and the United States in dealing with North Korea's  suspected nuclear weapons program.    Kim made the remarks when he telephoned Hata to convey his  congratulations on his assuming the premiership and forming the  cabinet Thursday, Japanese officials said.    "Through those close relationships (among the three  nations),  we can prevent North Korea from developing nuclear (weapons),"  Kim was quoted by Japanese officials as telling Hata.    Hata replied, "Japan will not change its policy of opening a  window for dialogue with North Korea while showing the  international society's steadfast stance toward it," the  officials said.    "As the (nuclear issue) has been approaching a serious  phase,  (Japan) will continue keeping close relations with South Korea  and the U.S.," Hata said.    North Korea has refused to accept full inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), increasing suspicions  that it is trying to develop nuclear bombs.    Kim also said, as in the case with the cabinet headed by  former Premier Morihiro Hosokawa, that South Korea will proceed  with its efforts to establish future-oriented relations with  Japan.    Hata replied that the new government will succeed Hosokawa's  foreign policy which "aims at establishing future-oriented  Japan- Korea relations by facing up past history."</p>

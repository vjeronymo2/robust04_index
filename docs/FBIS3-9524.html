			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Sofia, March 24 (TANJUG) -- Bulgarian papers on  Thursday sharply criticize a U.N. Security Council decision to  accept Turkish troops for the U.N. peacekeeping force in the  former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Fire is not put out by petrol, the paper 24 HOURS writes,  recalling that the decision is a "dangerous precedent, because a  biased party to this two-year war cannot be a peacemaker."    Under the headline "Turks Light Fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina  Via the United Nations," the paper calls on great powers to  think it over as to what is hiding behind Ankara's longstanding  and persistent insistence to enter Bosnia-Herzegovina.    A new Turkish presence in the Balkans is beginning, the  paper  DUMA writes on Thursday. DUMA insists that the United Nations  should be energetically warned that neighbouring countries to  the former Yugoslavia should not interfere in  Bosnia-Herzegovina's conflict, especially Turkey, with a past  heavily weighing down on it as regards the peoples of the former  Yugoslavia. This message holds also for Germany, Austria and  Italy, the paper writes.    The daily adds that "Turkish troops will establish peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina today. Tomorrow, possibly in our country  too."    By sending Turkish troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina the United  Nations has shown its true face, the commentator of the paper  KONTINENT says. The world organization should safeguard world  peace by political means. Military operations have prevailed  instead, the Sofia paper sets out.    Turkey has unequivocally taken the side of the Bosnian  Moslems in the two-year civil war in the former Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Among the Islamic countries,  Turkey has set an example in the sending of financial aid and  mojahedin to Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as large quantities of  weaponry, in defiance of a U.N-imposed arms embargo on the  entire territory of the former Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Jan 26 SAPA -- A volkstaat [homeland] and  self-determination were a small price to pay for peace in the  country and if this demand was not granted farmers would not  hesitate to resist, Transvaal Agricultural Union [TAU] President  Dries Bruwer has said in a letter to African National Congress  [ANC] National Chairman Thabo Mbeki.    In the letter, released to the press on Wednesday, he said:  "The TAU stresses the fact that failure to accept these demands  will result in farmers becoming part of South Africa's problem  and not still part of the solution. If farmers are left no other  choice they will not hesitate to resist with all means  available." Mr Bruwer said it was in the interests of all that  Mr Mbeki urgently attend to these facts to work out a peaceful  solution.    Transvaal farmers had for years played an indispensable role  in stabilising rural areas and it was an acknowledged fact the  future existence of 60 percent of rural towns was dependent on  the farming community, Mr Bruwer said. Farmers had been and  still were committed to maintaining peaceful labour relations  with the more than seven million black people who worked and  lived on farms, he added.    The Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National  Union]-affiliated TAU demanded that farmers' "reasonable  demands" which included the recognition and establishment of a  volkstaat with self-determination be accommodated.    Mr Bruwer said farmers and the ANC had come close to signing  an agreement which would have provided for self-determination  for Afrikaners in a volkstaat. The agreement, which also  provided for blacks remaining in an Afrikaner volkstaat, had  been scuttled as a result of the bogged-down trilateral Freedom  Alliance/ANC/government talks.    Mr Bruwer said he enjoyed good relations with the ANC and  liaised personally with Mr Mbeki.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] When the Liberian factions signed the peace accord  in Cotonou last July they were not accounting for the emergence  of a new anti-Charles Taylor movement, the Liberian Peace  Council, LPC. It's been creating havoc with attacks in the River  Cess region, south of the port of Buchanan. What its ultimate  aim was has remained unclear. Now, it has come out into the  open demanding a piece of the action and a place in the  transitional government. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison  telexed this report:    The Liberian Peace Council today vowed to continue fighting  until the Cotonou Accord was amended. The Peace Council's  spokesman, Octavius Walker, said: We insist on being included  in the Liberian National Transitional Government. He said: We  made this clear when we met with the Transitional Council on 13  March. Mr. Walker said that Isaac Musa, Charles Taylor's  National Patriotic Front representative, had walked out of that  meeting when the LPC was putting forward its demands. He added  that after Mr. Musa had left, the LPC had made it clear that the  NPFL could not represent areas under LPC control. Mr. Walker  claims that the LPC is in control of six counties: River Cess,  Grand Bassa, Sinoe, Maryland, Grand Gedeh, and Grand Kru. He  said that the Peace Council is seeking to represent these  countries on the Interim Council, but the NPFL information  minister designate, Joe Mulbah, disputed the LPC's claim that it  controlled six counties. Mulbah said that the NPFL had recently  dislodged Peace Council fighters from River Cess and Compound  No. 2, in Grand Bassa County.    Meanwhile, the fighting between the LPC and the NPFL  continues to trigger a large number of refugees in the  southeastern region. United Nations Shelter officials said that  in the first six days of April alone 1,200 people had fled to  the town of Buchanan.</p>

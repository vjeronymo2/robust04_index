			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Carton-board 'cartel' check EUROPEAN carton-board makers have been given 14 weeks to respond to allegations they are operating an illegal cartel, or face fines from the European Commission. Industry officials said yesterday they received letters from the Commission last week detailing its objections to alleged price-fixing, and setting a deadline for replies. The Commission raided 15 companies across the EC in April 1991, after the British Printing Industries Federation (BPIF) complained the manufacturers had co-ordinated price rises across Europe. All the main EC producers were involved in the original inquiry, including subsidiaries and sales agents for non-EC companies in Sweden, Austria and Canada. Officials said they believed the Commission had since narrowed its inquiry, but declined to give details. The Commission refused to comment. It is allowed to levy fines of up to 10 per cent of turnover on companies involved in price-fixing, but these are usually reduced if the groups have ended anti-competitive practices. Carton board is high-quality card used in packaging cosmetics, food and other products. The BPIF, members of which print directly on to carton board, said yesterday it had not been in contact with the Commission since lodging the complaint two years ago, and had not spotted any further instances of alleged co-ordinated price rises since 1991. The Commission is pursuing an alleged cartel of 76 cement makers and associations. A number of the companies and federations failed just before Christmas to gain more information about the Commission's objections to the alleged cartel. Commission officials claim the cement companies were trying to delay a final decision in the case, which may come later this year.</p>

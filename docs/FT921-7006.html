			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Hungary improves on targets set by IMF Hungary recorded its healthiest ever balance of payments in 1991, according to official figures released yesterday, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Capital inflow surged 156 per cent to Dollars 1.46bn (Pounds 830m) on a wave of foreign investment in privatisations and greenfield developments, the National Bank of Hungary said. Hungary claims to have attracted 50-60 per cent of investment in east Europe. The current account balance also improved in 1991, showing a record Dollars 267m surplus which comfortably surpassed the Dollars 1.2bn deficit agreed with the International Monetary Fund. Better than expected capital and current account flows helped the central bank to nearly quadruple hard-currency reserves from Dollars 1.1bn to Dollars 4bn over the course of 1991. The balance of payments is a point of light amid the gloom of recession. Official figures put industrial production down 19 per cent in 1991 and gross domestic production down 7-9 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) The PHA has fewer vacancies on the date of its application than it had on September 1, 1993, and the PHA had expended funds on rehabilitation of the unit in reasonable anticipation of reimbursement from Vacancy Reduction Program funds. The PHA may be reimbursed for the cost of the rehabilitation only if funds remain available after HUD has funded all other eligible costs at all PHAs applying for funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lead-based paint activity <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  includes lead-based paint risk assessments, risk management (interim containment), testing, and abatement, consistent with the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821&hyph;4826) and HUD implementing regulations at 24 CFR parts 35, 965, and 968.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Marketable <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means that there is a waiting list for units of the applicable size and that either the past experience of the PHA would indicate that the unit should lease reasonably quickly after completion of the work funded under this program, or other available data indicates that physical and management improvements, including more extensive outreach, would likely result in a demand for the units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Repair <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  includes routine maintenance when essential to the reoccupancy of the eligible vacant units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vacancy Reduction Plan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means a plan developed by the PHA that includes the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The statements required by &sect;968.407(b) of the final rule (also see Appendix to this NOFA) published elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For all vacant units, reported by development, information on the:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Number and percentage of units vacant at the time of application under this NOFA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Number and percentage of units expected to be occupied by each semiannual date after the submission of the PHA's vacancy reduction plan, as provided under paragraph (3) of this definition, including date of full occupancy;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Source of funding and expected percentage of funds to be obligated and expended by each semiannual date, as provided under paragraph (3) of this definition; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Expected date of any demolition or disposition, and the number of units involved in this activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A schedule, by chart or time line, indicating milestones for vacancy reduction activities (all vacant units must be included regardless of whether they require funding and whether they have already been funded).

Such units include those for which the PHA is requesting or intends to request funding under the Vacancy Reduction Program or another HUD program (e.g., CIAP or the Severely Distressed Public Housing Program), or for which approval of demolition/disposition is required but has not yet been granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E.

The assurance may cross-reference management improvement activity described in its vacancy reduction plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Waigel snubs Kohl's tax warning: Finance minister insists rise in 1995 would be 'last resort' MR THEO WAIGEL, the German finance minister, yesterday distanced himself from Chancellor Helmut Kohl, insisting that a tax rise in 1995 was a 'last resort' in the struggle to finance German unification and control the public sector deficit. He rejected outright any move to increase taxes before then, demanding further drastic savings measures in the coming weeks to reduce a yawning gap in government finances, even in 1993. Mr Kohl also insisted yesterday that there could and would be no tax rises for two years - in other words, before the 1994 elections - but gave confusing signals on his willingness to make drastic cuts in state subsidies to such sensitive sectors as coal-mining, agriculture and ship-building. Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) closed its annual conference with an overwhelming vote in favour of a resolution calling for big spending cuts, increased efforts to boost economic growth in eastern Germany, and tax rises in 1995. The resolution appeared to be a show of unity, but the party, and the ruling coalition, remain deeply divided on how to bridge the spending gap. Immediate measures are required to trim next year's budget by at least DM10bn (Pounds 4bn), and probably more like DM15bn, before it comes to the committee stage in the Bundestag on November 11. First proposals must go to the cabinet by next Wednesday. A meeting of the parties in the coalition is scheduled for tonight. The DM10bn is the saving needed to cope with the loss of revenue expected from a 1 per cent decline in next year's economic growth rate. In addition, a string of extra spending plans has been all but agreed to help the collapsed east German economy, including an increase in investment subsidies for small businesses. The central exchequer is likely to face the cost of servicing east Germany's DM50bn housing debt in 1994 and in 1995 the full burden of DM400bn to DM500bn of accumulated eastern debts, including the debts of the Treuhand privatisation agency. Mr Waigel, who is leader of the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) in the ruling coalition, showed his extreme dislike of the idea of a 1995 tax rise without flatly rejecting it. 'Tax increases only come into consideration as a last resort, when all other options have been exhausted,' he said, 'What is needed is a painful and unavoidable definition of new priorities. The room for further borrowing has been played out. Top of the list must come the exploitation of every possible measure for savings and reordering of priorities. 'To have tax increases in reserve reduces the pressure to save on both the central government, and the federal states.' For his part, Mr Kohl insisted: 'When I say save, I mean save.' But he underlined the difficulties in cutting subsidies in such areas as shipbuilding and coal-mining - and flatly rejected the sort of policies introduced by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in Britain. 'We are a social market economy, not a market economy.'</p>

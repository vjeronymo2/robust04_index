			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Do Not Write Off Peacekeeping Force--"It is by no means  surprising that in the first two weeks there have been blow-ups"  in the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF), says a page-12  editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 8 February.  "Sensible South Africans will beware of writing the force off  too easily." The government should give the NPKF based at De  Brug "a top-priority rating," and the African National Congress  (ANC) "should resist any lurking temptations for a little cheap  politicking." "It is also time for openness. There are no  secrets in this army; no reasons to lock its men away. Let them  be visible, so that future bust-ups and future successes alike  can be seen clearly by the public and not left to the  exaggeration of whisper."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   ANC, NP Seek To Retain Police State Powers -- "When ANC and  NP [National Party]-aligned delegates to the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC] are called on by the DP's [Democratic  Party] Colin Eglin to account today for their apparent  reluctance to scrap detention without trial, the least they  should do is blush," remarks a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English 8 February. "Clearly, there are little  dictators in both parties who think the constitutional impasse  is to be resolved, and a `free and far' election fought, with  the backing of a 1980s-style law and order crackdown." BUSINESS  DAY finds it "disturbing" that the ANC and the NP "are intent on  retaining police state powers through sleight of hand -- it took  the eagle-eyed Black Sash to notice and publicise this latest  exercise in cynicism. And let us not forget that this is the  second time the ANC and NP have acted covertly together to sneak  through detention provisions -- the first occurred at Codesa  [Convention for a Democratic South Africa] in 1992. Let us see  how they squirm out of this one."  <H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>   Country `Does Have a Future' -- Gerald Shaw writes in his  "Political Survey" column on page 6 of Cape Town CAPE TIMES in  English on 4 February that in South Africa "there will by much  sound and fury but the intermittent terrorism and sabotage of  the fanatics will not stop the election." One estimate of the  security situation which Shaw has seen, written by Colin Legum,  "doyen of analysts of Southern Africa affairs," suggests that  "Northern Ireland is the closest parallel to present-day South  Africa, rather than Algeria on the brink of independence, when  the army generals revolted against De Gaulle's policy and France  itself seemed momentarily at risk. An Ulster-type situation is  about as bad as things will get, it seems to me. The bombs will  go off but life will go on. The main thing will be to convince  the world in the next few months that South Africa does have a  future."  <H6>  CITY PRESS </H6>   ANC-Freedom Alliance Talks on Verge of Collapse --  Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 6 February in a page-14  editorial believes the ANC-Freedom Alliance talks "have all but  collapsed." "The ANC and the government on the one hand, and  the Alliance on the other, seem to be drifting further from each  other." CITY PRESS does not understand how the ANC "can expect  the Alliance to make commitments to a document they have not yet  seen, let alone discussed." Alternately, if the alliance rejects  the proposals, or shifts goalposts, "the rest of the country and  the world will then know who is not interested in a peaceful  resolution of the country's problems."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Problems With New Peacekeeping Force -- "The fact that the  minister of defense, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, found it necessary to  instruct General Georg Meiring, chief of the army, to  investigate alleged problems within the National Peacekeeping  Force increases suspicions that all is not well within that  force," notes Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 4 February in a  page-8 editorial. "The name National Peacekeeping Force becomes  a mockery if the rumors of unhygienic conditions, disease and  lack of discipline, are true." "Strict disciplinary measures  should be taken against those who refuse to cooperate in the  creation of a respectable peacekeeping force."    Call for Action Against Right-Wing Threat to Peace --  Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 7 February in a page-8  editorial says: "Conflict is building up in South Africa which  could lead to full-scale civil war. If no definite action is  taken now the country will get exactly what Mr. Eugene  Terreblanche has been hoping for -- conflict between the  Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB, and other right-wing  organizations against the ANC and its allies. Mr. Terreblanche  admitted that the right wing was responsible for the current  terrorist attacks, and indicated that more attacks could be  expected. His remarks reflect a knowledge of what is happening.  He challenges and threatens. Has he even been questioned?"  "ANC threats of retaliation are understandable. The endless  attacks on ANC property cannot be tolerated." "Urgent action  should be taken against those who threaten the peace. The time  has come for drastic decisions and actions."</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: Boos for Birtwistle - David Murray braves the hecklers at the revival of 'Gawain' at Covent Garden There was a bracing outburst of boos at the Royal Opera on Thursday, almost before the revival of Harrison Birtwistle's 1991 Gawain concluded. During its last dying note, a woman's voice cried 'Shame about the score]' from a right-hand balcony, and a man in the front mid-stalls stood up to boo as continuously and vehemently as he could manage, echoed at once by loyal voices scattered throughout the house. Keen applauders soon redoubled their efforts, and later - when the composer himself appeared - played their 'standing ovation' trump. (How should a dissenter retort: gesticulate, make faces, do a tap-dance?) For a minute or two we could imagine ourselves to be re-living some famously contentious Diaghilev premiere like Stravinsky's Sacre du printemps. But the most telling anecdote from Le Sacre's first night is not about old Saint-Saens flouncing out during the preludial solo for very high bassoon (asking sarcastically what instrument that was), nor the choreographer Nijinsky having to shout One] two] three] from the wings because his dancers could not hear the orchestra through the swelling hubbub. Rather, it is Carl Van Vechten's report that when some impassioned chap behind him began to beat upon his head in unison with the music, for some while neither of them noticed. The Covent Garden protest was different. It was orchestrated by Frederick Stocken, a defiantly 'traditionalist' composer, and promulgated in the London Evening Standard (which, ironically, made Gawain its Opera of the Year). Many people had thus been forewarned, including everybody at the Royal Opera, and no doubt some were sympathetically inflamed. The traditionalist's claim is that Birtwistle is a misguided dead-end modernist, unpleasing and unrewarding to hear, but irrationally - and expensively - favoured by the Establishment. The modernism he loathes, however, is not just postwar music after Boulez and Stockhausen, but something more widespread and longer-standing; Tippett and even Britten are among the sinners. Gawain, then, merely lies further beyond the pale. To sympathetic modernist ears, Birtwistle's opera has actually become more user-friendly, for it has been judiciously shortened. The long 'Turning of the seasons' ritual in Act 1 - the purification of Gawain before he goes in search of the Green Knight - has been trimmed and rewritten, and its symbolic pageant simplified. It fulfills its dramatic function better and more economically than before, and it still looks and sounds splendid. A matching cut in the Act 2, at Gawain's return to King Arthur's court, does no harm, and helps to bring the opera in at about two-and-a-half hours. Most of the original performers are back. Again Elgar Howarth makes the brazen panoply of the music resound and shiver, haunted by shrill, sustained woodwinds and the twang of the cimbalom. As Gawain and the Green Knight, Francois Le Roux and John Tomlinson are even more assured than three years ago, and Marie Angel's Morgan le Fay warbles like an electrical oboe d'amore. A newcomer is Anne Howells, beautifully in command as the sinister, seductive Lady de Hautdesert. The production and the designs (Di Trevis and Alison Chitty) look pristine. The long, measured stride of Birtwistle's score remains its greatest strength, evolving in great rolling periods. It is not much like anything else (except other late Birtwistle, of course), but its gnomic, timeless character imposes a potent spell; we are drawn in, and held fast.</p>

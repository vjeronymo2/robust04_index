			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Dimitar Buzlevski, chief of the </F> Customs Administration; place and date not given: "Porous  Borders"]    [Text] The head of Macedonia's [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Customs Administration, Dimitar  Buzlevski, talks about the new method of collecting duties, the  service's lack of equipment, corruption....    [PULS] How much money was planned to be supplied for the  budget last year on the basis of customs duties, and to what  percentage were the projections fulfilled?    [Buzlevski] There were 2.5 billion denars planned, but 90.9  percent of the projections were fulfilled. It is interesting  that the percentage achieved was not achieved continuously  throughout those months, since during the first six months only  22.2 percent of the planned customs funds were supplied to the  budget, which indicated a very low level of the collection of  customs duties. That was associated with many problems in  customs procedures which directly led to that low percentage  collected. As a result of certain measures that we subsequently  implemented, for the period ending in December customs duties  constitute the highest percentage in fulfillment of the planned  budget funds.    One of the measures that we undertook is to prevent  manipulations with respect to imports of consumer goods.  Importers exercised the right of customs supervision of those  goods, as well as the right to customs storage within their  business premises, and those goods were very frequently lost and  put on sale; the state thus, in a way, provided the enterprises  with advance financing of part of their unpaid customs duties,  and according to some information, the unpaid sales tax as well.  It is precisely for that reason that through a decree sometime  in May 1993 we prohibited putting consumer goods under  supervision. We thereby achieved two results: preventing the  uncontrolled placement of those goods in the markets, and at the  same time gaining the opportunity to collect customs duties on  time. Likewise, an important element in improving the collection  of customs duties is placing the collection immediately in the  customs line, by requesting through the appropriate shipping  office an instrument for ensuring collection, either acceptance  or certified checks.    There is also one other element that we analyzed in detail  for improving the collection of customs duties: determining the  true value of imported goods. The fact is that the importers  used two types of invoices: an invoice that they received from  the foreign partner and that cited the real price that they  paid, and another invoice with a reduced value, i.e., with a  reduced base for the payment of customs duties. The Customs  Administration adopted a decision that wherever there are  suspicions about the validity of the value given in the invoice,  it is to be verified.    [PULS] How many consumer goods were imported last year  without paying customs duties?    [Buzlevski] Somewhere around $600 million.    [PULS] With all the exemptions from paying customs duties,  what level is the general rate?    [Buzlevski] The average duty on imports in 1993 was 6  percent. With this percentage, we are the most liberal country  in Europe.    [PULS] How consistent is our tariff liberalization with  tariff trends in the world? The GATT negotiations, for example?    [Buzlevski] In general, the tariff duty in the United States  and in the developed West European countries is not much over  the percentage that was noted here last year. Nevertheless, the  imported goods subsequently fall under the regime of tax policy.  In this case there has to be mutual coordination. Let us take  cigarette smuggling as an example. Our analysis shows that the  prices of cigarettes in the duty-free shops are more or less  identical with black market prices. This alone suggests that a  large part of those cigarettes come from the duty-free shops.  That is why we are currently preparing a decision on the regime  for the sale and importation of cigarettes, whiskey, and other  sought-after products from the duty-free shops. Not to prejudice  matters, I would also like to state just that the purchase of  one carton of cigarettes and one bottle of whiskey will be  permitted, and then only for someone who is leaving Macedonia.    [PULS] All of these deviant phenomena and smuggling  activities suggest the question of whether the Customs  Administration is equipped to counter those phenomena.    [Buzlevski] We are not equipped as a service. We have a  model  for development of the Customs Administration that was verified  by top customs experts in the United States and Canada, but we  will only be able to speak of successful customs when we have  started to implement that model. So many things are happening to  us because we are not equipped to discover them. For example,  our law allows the tariff payer himself to decide which customs  branch office the duties will be levied at. The data indicate  that the Skopje customs house accounts for about 62 percent--a  figure which itself is very large, and represents a difficulty  in conducting a detailed inspection of every truck that has  entered. Otherwise, all the trucks should be inspected in detail  and the contents of the goods should be verified. In developed  customs administrations that is simply done with the most modern  devices: for measuring the density of the freight contents, for  measuring the length of a vehicle... Likewise, we should equip  customs in regard to automated data processing. During the  course of this year we expect to develop that computer network  and we are on the way to obtaining a finished program.    [PULS] After the collapse in transportation that occurred  with the blockade of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY],  Europe announced a much more liberal procedure for avoiding  customs jams. How much does that increase the danger of all  sorts of smuggling--of weapons, for instance?    [Buzlevski] We are participating actively in that program,  which was conceived at the European Union [EU] level. The idea  of that project is a customs corridor that would make it  possible for the customs procedure to take place rapidly. In  certain cases, perhaps, it would become possible for goods to be  transported to their destinations where they are sent by convoy.  In mid-March, top experts from the European Customs Union will  visit Macedonia to implement the project. I can say that the  European Customs Union's analyses for approving financial  assistance for modernizing two border crossings are in the final  phase. These are the Cafasan and Deve Bair border crossings, a  corridor planned for communications with Europe. North  Rhine-Westphalia will provide about 1.1 million German marks  [DM] and the United States will provide $1.1 million to equip  the Deve Bair border crossing, while they will likewise provide  $1.1 million for Cafasan.    [PULS] A lot is said about the corruption of the customs  service.    [Buzlevski] So far the Service has fired 15 individuals for  whom there was substantiated proof that they had committed  serious customs violations. It is a well-known problem with oil  in Gevgelija and the channel going to Tetovo and Kumanovo, and a  well-known problem with imports of silk from Turkey and China.  The blunder of the customs officers was that they participated  in ensuring the legality of transactions by which the entry of  the goods was recorded by one customs branch office, but the  importer, dissatisfied with the established tariff base,  announced that he would return the goods to the original  destination, and the customs employee attached a seal to the  form that the goods had left Macedonia, while they remained here  de facto. We had the latest case at the Skopje airport a few  days ago, with imported satellite antennas.    [PULS] It has been heard at the Customs Administration that  a  list has been prepared of officials who have opened shipping  offices either in their own names or in the names of close  relatives. What about them?    [Buzlevski] It is a very unfavorable element that a certain  number of customs officials, even though those individuals are  in higher-level positions in the customs hierarchy, have  commercial firms, especially in the area of shipping, which are  registered in the names of members of their close family. We  have prepared the list, and the legal procedure for resolving  this problem is being analyzed now. Two solutions are possible:  either closing the shipping offices or leaving the job.    [PULS] How true is it that last year the Ministry of  Internal  Affairs bought automobiles from one of our distributors--we will  not mention his name and give him an advertisement--in the value  of DM 1.2 million. We are asking you the question, since such  activity cannot take place without being observed by the customs  authorities.    [Buzlevski] The Ministry of Internal Affairs is a body that  has to be well-equipped, and we should not view that negatively.  The fleet that it has purchased is intended for performance of  its established duties.    [PULS] The fleet can also be equipped with confiscated  vehicles. How many vehicles were confiscated last year, and how  many were released for auction through AMSM [Automobile and  Motorcycle Federation of Macedonia]?    [Buzlevski] Approximately 250-300 vehicles are confiscated  each year. Last year there was only one auction, in Bitola, and  about 15-20 vehicles were auctioned off. This year, however,  with the resolution of the dispute over where the second-level  procedure will take place (it has been determined that it will  be at the Customs Administration), things will take place more  quickly.    [PULS] Did the number of vehicles confiscated increase last  year?    [Buzlevski] It increased considerably, since a large number  of individuals sought to take advantage of various benefits,  especially for imports from Albania. The vehicles were  registered in the names of firms there, but were driven by  citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, and that is a customs  violation.    [PULS] Since as a state and a people we are inclined toward  actions that skirt the edge of the law, we would like to ask you  whether there have been any pressures on you at all from  powerful commercial firms or from individuals of high political  rank to look aside in specific cases.    [Buzlevski] I have been at the Customs Administration for  nine months, and I can freely state that the service, and I  personally, have been released from all forms of political  pressures. In practice, it is impossible for such pressures to  be applied in the Customs Administration. We have established  such a working regime in customs procedures that the customs  employee's autonomy is guaranteed, although a commission may  feel that his work is over.    [PULS] Nevertheless, the general belief is that in any  businessman's contact with certain individuals in your  hierarchy, things can be made easier with a fat bribe. Is that  possible?    [Buzlevski] It is most likely possible. Nevertheless, in the  event that it were discovered it would be punished, starting  with me and including the last employee in the Customs Service.</p>

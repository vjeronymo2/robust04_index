			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Belarussian [Belarusian] parliament speaker  Mechyslaw Hryb predicts social tensions in connection with the  current presidential campaign. He told a press conference on  Tuesday that the Central Electoral Commission had officially  registered the support groups of 19 candidates. Hryb also said  that the current developments in Belarus must be closely  followed.    Commenting on the agreement on the unification of the  Belarussian and Russian monetary systems and on its compliance  with the constitution, above all the provision on the powers of  the National Bank of Belarus, Hryb said that interpretation of  laws and state documents was the exclusive prerogative of the  parliament.    He also announced that the problem of parliamentary  elections  would be considered during the spring parliamentary session. In  experts' estimate, this means that the current parliament will  perform its duties until the end of the constitution-provided  term and that early parliamentary elections will not be held.    Among the main issues to be discussed during the emergency  session opening on 27 April, is elections of the Constitutional  Court and amendments in the customs legislation that are  expected to cancel customs duties in Russian-Belarussian trade,  given the forthcoming unification of the monetary systems.</p>

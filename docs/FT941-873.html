			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Elect Swedish buy Yorkshire Electricity, the UK utility, is set to buy a 20 per cent stake in Stockholm Energi, Sweden's third largest energy producer and supplier which is at present wholly owned by the city of Stockholm. The two sides announced on Friday that they intended to reach full agreement by the summer, following the signing of an agreement in principle that Yorkshire will become a significant minority shareholder in Stockholm Energi. Stockholm Energi reported sales last year of SKr6bn (Pounds 510m), producing 6,123 gigawatt hours of electricity, 5,093 gigawatt hours of hot water-based district heating and 369 gigawatt hours of town gas. Half its output is generated by nuclear power and 35 per cent by hydro-electric power. The company, based chiefly in the Swedish capital, returned a profit of SKr217m in 1993, but is projecting profits of about SKr1bn this year after unwinding heavy losses from debts held in foreign currency. Stockholm city authorities decided to seek a foreign partner in anticipation of deregulation of the Swedish market. Although deregulation terms have yet to be determined by the government, Stockholm Energi said it needed new capital to meet new competition in its established market and to enable it to seek new markets for itself.</p>

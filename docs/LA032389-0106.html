			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAIN PILLS TO BEAR WARNING OF SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS  </P> <P> The government Wednesday directed makers of prescription pain pills to add new  warnings informing doctors that such drugs may increase the risk of  life-threatening gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers.  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration announced that it had ordered manufacturers to  add a warning citing studies that show that up to 4% of people who receive  continued therapy with pain-relieving drugs may develop serious  gastrointestinal reactions.  </P> <P> The side effects, which include peptic ulcers and intestinal perforation,  sometimes occur in people without any warning symptoms, the FDA noted.  </P> <P> The prescription drugs in question are called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs, or NSAIDs. They generally are considered safer than steroid treatments,  which they have largely replaced, and often are essential in treating serious  arthritis. Some are approved for pain and menstrual cramps also.  </P> <P> FDA data shows that the drugs are being prescribed for conditions, such as  tendinitis, sprains or joint and muscle pain, that can be treated with other  therapies bearing fewer side effects, according to the new labeling.  </P> <P> FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young urged doctors "to discuss with their patients  the risks and benefits of using these drugs."  </P> <P> The drugs for which the new labels are required include: Voltaren, Nalfon,  Tolectin, Indocin, Dolobid, Meclomen, Feldene, Ponstel, Anaprox, Naprosyn,  Orudis, Butazolidin, Rufen, Motrin, Ansaid and generic versions of ibuprofen,  indomethacin and phenylbutazone.  </P></p>

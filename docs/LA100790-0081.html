			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WHICH IS ROACHE?  </P> <P> I have been closely following the sheriff's race, as I feel it is a very  important race.  </P> <P> Some time ago I had heard that Jim Roache, one of the candidates for sheriff,  was opposed to the 15-day waiting period to purchase handguns.  </P> <P> This concerned me greatly.  </P> <P> On Aug. 29, both candidates were on a radio talk show, so I called in and asked  specifically about this issue. Roache stated emphatically that he had never  said he was opposed to a 15-day waiting period and he would not support  opposition to it.  </P> <P> Furthermore, he said he supports the 15-day waiting period and felt it was a  reasonable amount of time to make the required background investigations. I  accepted what he said.  </P> <P> Imagine my surprise when, only 2 1/2 weeks later, at a forum in San Diego,  Roache stated that he was opposed to a 15-day waiting period. He felt it should  be done more quickly.  </P> <P> Now I am very confused. Does he support the 15 days or oppose it? Or is it just  a matter of what day it is and who he is talking to?  </P> <P> VIRGINIA KODADEK, San Marcos  </P></p>

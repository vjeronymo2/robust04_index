It was my duty to talk about it," Slovak President  Michal Kovac said in a Slovak television debate this evening.    Kovac was rejecting accusations that he had damaged the  interests of Slovakia with the speech he made in parliament last  week which led the opposition to hold a vote of no confidence in  Vladimir Meciar.    The president also defended himself against Meciar's  subsequent attacks on him, and also expressed himself in favor  of achieving early elections by issuing the competence to  dissolve parliament.    Kovac said that in his speech on Friday, Meciar had  "masterfully distorted" his warning against the threat of  corruption, making it seem as if Kovac had been accusing the  government of corruptibility. Kovac quoted from his Wednesday  speech to make it clear that he had not made such a claim about  the government.    He also rejected the ex-premier's accusation that as  chairman  of the former Federal Assembly he had promised cooperation to  Croatia in arms production and arms trading. He also denied  that he had asked Meciar to officially recognize Taiwan for a  reward of 500 million dollars. Kovac emphasized that he had  only informed Meciar of this offer, because he was aware that  accepting it could mean the discontinuation of contacts with  China.    Finally, Kovac said that he was not going to let the  demonstrations outside his window get him down, and force him to  resign.</p>

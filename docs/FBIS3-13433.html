A former high-ranking  Oil Ministry official who requested anonimity told the bilingual  weekly 'KAYHAN HAVA'I' that Saudi Arabia was producing about 9.5  million barrels per day, 1.5 million more than its official OPEC  quota.    "If Saudi Arabia abides by the OPEC agreement and reduces  its  oil output, oil prices will jump up", he told the weekly.    Brent North Sea crude oil last week crashed to a low of  dlrs.  13.5 a barrel, its lowest level for six years. Oil prices  further plummeted last week after OPEC members of the (Persian)  Gulf Cooperation Council ended a meeting without reaching  agreement to reduce their oil output. "There is no evidence to  prove that Saudi Arabia will agree to a lower quota in the  upcoming OPEC meeting", the former Oil Ministry official said.</p>

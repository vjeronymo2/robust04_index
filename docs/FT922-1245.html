			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (7): Key role for Singapore - Batam INDONESIA'S attempts to develop far-flung reaches of its territory away from the main island of Java have finally borne fruit in the Riau islands, but the exploitation of Batam, Bintan and the other islands owes as much to the determination of nearby Singapore as to the Indonesians themselves. Under the so-called 'Growth Triangle' concept espoused by Singapore, the Riau islands and the southern Malaysian region of Johor can benefit from Singaporean investment and expertise while providing the labour and the land which Singapore and the multinationals based there find so hard to obtain. Batam alone is two thirds the size of Singapore and there is a plentiful supply of contract workers flown in from overcrowded Java. Singaporean efficiency in constructing the necessary infrastructure was crucial to the development of Batam as an industrial location for foreign investors. Indonesia granted foreign investors the right to 100 per cent ownership of their Batam operations three years before the privilege was extended nationwide in April this year. But of eight industrial estate projects on the island, the only one operational is run by Batamindo, the Dollars 400m joint venture between Singapore Technologies Industrial Corp and Jurong Environmental Engineering (both of Singapore) and the Indonesian Salim group of Mr Liem Sioe Liong, the wealthy business associate of President Suharto. So far, 29 companies, including Thomson, Philips, AT&amp;T and Bowater have begun operations at the Batam Industrial Park. In all, 40 per cent of Batam has been set aside for industry, while the larger island of Bintan is being marketed as a tourist attraction as well as a location for factories. The proposed Dollars 2.2bn Bintan Beach International Resort is being touted as 'Asia Pacific's playground of the 21st century' and will be sold together with Singapore as a single tourist destination. Singapore's relationship with Indonesia, like its older tie to Malaysia, may be complementary but it has not been without friction. Singaporeans find themselves frustrated by what they politely refer to as Indonesia's 'different work ethic' while the Indonesians sometimes accuse the economically-advanced Singaporeans of arrogance and condescension. A priority for Singapore has been smoothing the way for Singapore-based companies to base themselves in Batam - for example by introducing a 'smart card' for immigration control at ferry terminals - but the impatient attempts to bypass Indonesian bureaucracy can easily be interpreted as an assertion of de facto sovereignty. 'The problem we have is that we don't want to over-emphasise that we are running the show,' says one senior government official in Singapore. Mr Chudri Nizar of Indonesia's Batam Industrial Development Authority - asked in Jakarta if the sovereignty issue was a problem - replied: 'It can be.' Indonesian officials acknowledge, however, that the confidence inspired by Singaporean economic management and the proximity of Singaporean financial and technical services are essential in the drive to attract international companies to Batam. Ms Jean Tsai of Thomson Consumer Electronics, the first company at the Batamindo estate to start operating in early 1991, describes Thomson's SDollars 3m investment in a television modulator and tuner assembly plant as 'a toe in the water', but says the experience has been positive and an expansion is on the cards. Thomson already has plans to employ 1,000 people on Batam. 'We operate on Indonesian soil but Batamindo is there to smooth the way,' Ms Tsai says. 'Batam is close. Expatriate Singapore managers can come here (Singapore) for the weekend.' Environmentalists might balk at the damage done by development to Batam's natural beauty - soil erosion is visible everywhere - and labour activists might criticise the idea of housing migrant workers in a dormitory building on the estate, but investors are happy to reap the rewards of low labour costs. Batamindo officials say most of the production workers they supply are women between the ages of 18 and 25. Companies pay about SDollars 220 per month per worker to Batamindo, of which the employee receives about SDollars 150. After the difficult start-up period, companies are anxious to employ their own production workers and to hire skilled Indonesian staff to take over managerial jobs from expensive Singapore expatriates who find the living conditions on Batam relatively harsh. 'The main problem now is the training of the staff to take over more responsible positions,' said Mr M. S. Leow, manufacturing manager at Thomson's Batam plant. Earlier problems included difficulties with telecommunications and the movement of goods. These are said to have been resolved, although a new harbour may have to be constructed because the main port is working at full capacity. Batam, vigorously promoted by Mr B. J. Habibie, minister of state for research and technology, saw its population grow to more than 107,000 last year from a mere 6,000 in 1973. By the end of next year, the airport is supposed to be capable of receiving Boeing 747 jumbo jets. Batam's exports rose to Dollars 210m in 1991 from Dollars 148m in 1990, but officials agree that it is difficult to gauge the economic significance of the gross export figures because the island is a low-cost assembly location and imports are presumably rising rapidly as well. The Riau islands are developing fast, but they will continue to depend for the time being on the backing of the Indonesian government and of Singapore.</p>

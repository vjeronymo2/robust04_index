			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH PENALTY AND ABORTION  </P> <P> In response to Conrad's cartoon regarding the "supposed" inconsistency of an  individual who is both pro-life and pro-capital punishment (Jan. 26), as one  such individual, it seems apparent to me that the entire debate surrounds one  single issue -- responsibility.  </P> <P> An individual who is convicted of killing another human being and is sentenced  to death must accept the consequences of his behavior. He made the decision  before committing the crime and must not be allowed to shirk all responsibility  for his actions.  </P> <P> In a similar way, before a man and a woman engage in sexual intercourse they  know there is a chance that the woman might become impregnated. Yet abortion is  so often used as a way of avoiding responsibility.  </P> <P> Yes, there is a major difference -- an individual who commits murder had a  choice, babies in the womb have none. They should be given the right to choose  and nobody has the right to decide for them.  </P> <P> BRETT BARBRE  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

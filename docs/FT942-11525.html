			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / BAT beats expectations with 20% jump BAT Industries, the UK tobacco giant, produced much stronger first-quarter figures than expected, with a 20 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 424m. The star performer was US tobacco, where profits doubled. Last week BAT announced its intention of buying American Tobacco for Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m). BAT said the US recovery was mainly due to the end of trade loading, whereby the trade was stuffed with stock in the fourth quarter ahead of January price increases. Ending this had helped profits by Pounds 50m in the quarter. Chief executive Mr Martin Broughton said US tobacco had had a good start to the year, with no evidence of further price discounting. The black spot in tobacco came in BAT's Brazilian Souza Cruz subsidiary, where volume fell 17 per cent and BAT incurred a loss of Pounds 10m. Mr Broughton said this was partly due to a massive influx of smuggled cigarettes from Paraguay under the encouragement of the Paraguayan government. BAT was confident the US tobacco market would remain 'large and profitable for a long time', despite government moves to curb smoking. Mr Broughton expected the Federal Excise Tax of up to 75 cents a pack to be introduced this year, leading to a sharp drop in consumption followed by a sharp recovery. Total tobacco trading profit rose 13 per cent to Pounds 268m on sales up 1 per cent at Pounds 3.04bn. Profits from financial services were up 16 per cent to Pounds 220m, consisting of Pounds 127m (up from Pounds 95m) from general insurance and Pounds 93m (against Pounds 94m) from the life and investment business. Worldwide general business premium income was slightly ahead at Pounds 743m, while the underwriting loss fell from Pounds 58m to Pounds 13m. Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar increased profits to Pounds 37m and Pounds 44m respectively, while Farmers in the US produced flat profits of Pounds 126m. On group turnover down 2 per cent at Pounds 5.84bn, trading profits from continuing operations were 15 per cent ahead at Pounds 488m. After interest charges of Pounds 51m (against Pounds 43m), pre-tax profits were Pounds 424m against Pounds 354m. After tax of Pounds 154m (against Pounds 131m) and minorities - reduced by the Souza Cruz loss - of Pounds 12m (Pounds 24m) net profit was Pounds 258m (Pounds 199m), giving a 27 per cent rise in earnings per share to 8.4p.

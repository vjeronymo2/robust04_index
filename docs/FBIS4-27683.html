			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, June 2 (AFP) -- Vietnamese Defense Minister  General Doan Khue is to make an official "friendship visit" to  North Korea in the next few days, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman  said here Thursday.    "This visit is aimed at strengthening the friendly ties  between the two armies and the two peoples," spokeswoman Ho The  Lan said at a press briefing.    Diplomatic sources here said though Hanoi has been  approached  by western countries to intercede in the nuclear crisis on the  Korean peninsula between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington.    The ministry spokeswoman did not give the dates of the  visit.  But according to the Japanese press, the general, who ranks  fifth in the politburo of the Vietnamese Communist Party, will  visit Pyongyang from June 16.    Khue's visit is the first by a Vietnamese defense minister  to  North Korea since the Vietnam War, and official visits to  Stalinist North Korea have been infrequent over the past few  years.    Bilateral relations were frozen after Vietnam and South  Korea  normalized ties in 1992.</p>

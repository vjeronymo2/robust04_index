			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> LAST STRETCH OF BEACH CLOSED BY TANKER OIL SPILL IS REOPENED  </P> <P> A public ban was lifted today on the last 1 1/2-mile stretch of Orange County  shoreline closed after the tanker American Trader ruptured its hull last month,  spilling 394,000 gallons of crude oil into the ocean off Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> A mid-afternoon ceremony was hastily arranged to mark the reopening of beach  between Golden West Street in Huntington Beach and the main lifeguard  headquarters at Bolsa Chica State Beach.  </P> <P> The decision to lift the ban was made after a series of tests showed that  levels of petroleum hydrocarbons were well below acceptable levels established  by local and state health officials.  </P> <P> At one stage after the Feb. 7 tanker accident, more than 20 miles of county  coastline was closed as the Alaskan crude formed a huge slick before washing  ashore, blackening long stretches of shoreline. The cleanup force numbered  nearly 1,500 at the height of the effort, but British Petroleum, which owned  the spilled oil, said only about 30 workers remained on the job today.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, U.S. Coast Guard officials said preliminary results of its  investigation into the accident about 1.3 miles southwest of Huntington Beach  may be completed within two weeks. Authorities have said that one of the  tanker's anchors apparently gashed the forward hull, causing the spill.  </P></p>

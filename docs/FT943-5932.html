			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Mowlem returns to black with Pounds 700,000 John Mowlem, the construction equipment and contracting group, moved back into the black, with interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 700,000 against a loss of Pounds 41.8m for the same period last year. The results, for the six months to June 30, were the first since a financial restructuring in March, and showed all the group's divisions improving. Borrowing was all but wiped out by the proceeds of the Pounds 64m rights issue, and the disposal of the housebuilding division in July - sold to Beazer for Pounds 31m - has left the group cash positive. Turnover slipped Pounds 12m to Pounds 646m. The SGB scaffolding hire arm showed the most marked improvement, with profits nearly tripling to Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 2.4m). Contracting moved from break-even to notch up profits of Pounds 700,000. Losses at the London City Airport fell by 33 per cent to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 2.4m). Earnings per share were 0.5p (38.4p losses). The company reiterated its intention to pay a final dividend of 2p. COMMENT Shareholders who stumped up the Pounds 64m needed to stop Mowlem breaching its covenants six months ago will have been doubly relieved yesterday to see the group return to profitability, and the shares creeping above the 100p rights issue price. That the company has turned the corner is beyond doubt. This is reflected in analysts' pre-tax profit forecasts for 1995 which range from Pounds 11m to Pounds 18m - a handsome leap from the current year's Pounds 3m to Pounds 5m estimates. However, beyond this, market optimism begins to dry up. Few analysts share Mowlem's belief that it can achieve Pounds 40m annual profits, even in the medium-term. Even at the bottom of next year's forecasts, the prospective p/e is about 18 making the rating look very demanding.</p>

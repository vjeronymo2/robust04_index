			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Zhirnov: "`Choice' Chooses the Most </F> Drastic"]    [Text] We have learned from sources close to Russia's  Choice about intensive consultations between Yegor Gaydar, who  has quit the government, and the leaders of the so-called free  trade unions. The first summit took place last Friday; the  second is scheduled for the end of this week. Yegor Timurovich  is proposing to the trade union leaders cooperation with the  "strict political structure" that he is forming on the basis of  Russia's Choice. The structuring of the party-trade union bloc  is to have been completed by March, before the elections to the  local representative organs of power.    The free trade unions (the Independent Miners' Union,  Federation of Air-Traffic Controller Unions, SOTSPROF  [Association of Socialist Trade Unions], and others) are  considered democratic and oriented toward market reforms. One of  their particular features is their relatively high strike  activity, despite their relatively small numbers. The miners and  air-traffic controllers are striking or declaring a state of  pre-strike readiness almost continuously.    The news that the chief "Russia's Choicer" was formalizing  an  alliance with the most restless union organizations has  coincided with talk about a "general political strike," which  could erupt in the spring. The first to warn the head of the  government of this was the newspaper IZVESTIYA. Then Mikhail  Poltoranin mentioned a "general political strike." The hard-line  political statement of the Independent Miners Union in  connection with Gaydar's resignation was then noticed.    All this could be interpreted as some Freudian slips  indicating either the subconscious desires or the deliberate  plans of the democrats. Can they, who have hitherto accused  their "Red-brown" opponents of the instigation of social  conflicts, have now been engaging in this themselves?    Opinions on this score vary. Aman Tuleyev, representing in  the Federation Council the region where the Russian strike  movement was conceived, believes this to be the case: "Russia's  Choice will now heat up the political situation in order to  clear out its opponents in the government. `Choice' and other  democrats have direct contacts with the Independent Miners  Union. Last December the miners were visited not only by  Gaydar--Sobchak, Denisenko, and others spent days and nights  with them. Several mines are already `laid up' with us  today--this is simply not being reported. Political demands--the  resignation of the government--are airily being added to the  economic demands."    "Senator" Tuleyev did not discern anything good in the  intentions of the Russian democrats earlier either, and for this  reason it is hard to call him an "entirely trustworthy source."  Dmitriy Semenov, cochairman of the SOTSPROF, for example,  considers the prospect of a political strike unrealistic: "I do  not believe in a general strike--the people are not yet ready  for this. A strike on political grounds in support of the policy  of the departed Gaydar is even less likely. Of the trade unions,  only the miners and the Federation of Air-Traffic Controller  Unions could agree to this. The SOTSPROF Coordinating Council  could `assign to the strike' certain branches of our union, but  we would most likely not do so, lest we put our own people in  jeopardy. No democrat has appealed to us with hints even of the  desirability of a strike. Perhaps they have appealed to the  miners or air-traffic controllers."    Some common denominator shows through in these largely  opposite opinions, however. The radical section of Russia's  Choice is now, evidently, predisposed toward risky decisions.  Both in September-October of last year and at preceding "pivotal  moments," the democrats were strong precisely by virtue of their  radical approach and their egress from the system into a  meta-system--beyond the framework of rules, beyond the  "constitutional field." And from their viewpoint a strike is  beneficial--the president would then be forced to take emergency  steps, in the course of which the "government of Red managers"  and the intractable Duma would be sidelined politically, and the  actions of the radical democrats themselves would increase.    But the "Russia's Choicers" are pragmatists, and while  keeping in mind the strike potentialities of the independent  unions, they are nonetheless assigning them a different  role--not so much the organizer of upheavals as the medium of an  increase in their electorate. Here their interests interface  with those of the union upper stratum.    According to confidential information in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's  possession, the union leaders want for an alliance with "Choice"  to obtain ministerial positions in a future government. This  plan presupposes the early dissolution of the Duma and new  parliamentary elections.    The moderate scenario of a "revanche of the democrats" not  specifying the need for a general rebellion is, from the  viewpoint of the union bosses, preferable. Not only in that it  guarantees them ministerial office, but also in that it promises  their organizations an appreciable gain in political weight and  respectability in a "linkage" with the future "Gaydar party."</p>

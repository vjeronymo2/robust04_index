IZVESTIYA writes that the Ministry of Labour  summed up some results of the year 1993, describing as  accomplishments "the stabilisation of the living standards of  Russian citizens, as well as the non- coming of massive  unemployment."    "Incomes have grown, but the number of the poor has  increased," the newspaper writes, pointing to the fact that last  year the incomes of the population went up by nine per cent.  "Most probably, this is true only of the part of the population  whose income exceed those of the poorest people by 27 times. A  major part of the Russian population (77 per cent) had an income  lower than the double subsistence wage, which stood at 50,000  roubles in December. One third of them got even less than the  subsistence level ... The situation on the labour market  resembles a lull before a storm. Officially, unemployment  continues to be insignificant and does not exceed one per cent  of the workforce. However, the so-called hidden unemployment is  growing. According to various estimates, between four and seven  million people have a shorter working day or are having unpaid  vacations."    "The government is granting easy-term credits to the  agrarian  sector. The inflation rate will grow in the forthcoming  months," TRUD writes, calling attention to the latest government  resolutions. "During the current year, 14.1 trillion roubles of  direct subsidies will be paid out of the budget. The creation  of a federal food reserve will require another 14.5 trillion  roubles. Add some other privileges to it, and the total will  reach 34.7 trillion. The experience of the past several years  shows that, in the long run, about half of easy-term credits are  turning into cash money and finding their way to the currency  market. There is no doubt about the effect: First of all, the  prices of durables will grow, because people buy them in the  expectation of further inflation."    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI began today the publication of a series of  articles about the logic and the character of the formation of  the executive local authorities. The first article has been  contributed by Nikolay Medvedev, head of the department for  relations with regions at the administration of the president.    According to Medvedev, the new constitutions says that  "state  power in the country has two levels: the level of the federal  state power and the level of power of subjects of the  federation." He recalls that the division of authority accepted  in Russia -- the presidential and legislative power --  inevitably involved some confrontation, because at that time the  new constitution did not exist, and "the old principles  connected with the work of the old system in the person of  Soviets were in effect ... As a result of it, two systems of  state power were functioning in the country, whose confrontation  was unavoidable. Now, the adoption of the new constitution  created a new legal situation. Dual power in one country was  eliminated." In his opinion, the main task on the current stage  is to reform the second stage of state power, namely "the second  link, i.e. state power of subjects of the federation."    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA comments on Ukraine's decision on  nuclear  weapons. According to the newspaper, "Ukraine has made one more  step towards the world community on the path of nuclear  disarmament." Aside from it, the parliament showed by this step  that "the reputation of Leonid Kravchuk as the only peace-maker  in the ruling elite and the all-out supporter of Ukraine's  nuclear-free status was seriously tarnished."    Commenting on the results of President Yeltsin's visit to  georgia, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA points out that leaders of all  parliamentary groups of the State Duma sent a letter to him,  expressing their "concern over the signing of the  Russian-Georgian Treaty of Friendship." "The existence in the  draft treaty of the provisions involving the signing in the  future of agreements on 'assistance in the purchasing of  armaments, military hardware and technologies' may, in our  opinion, destabilise the situation," the letter said.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an article dealing with  Russian-American cooperation in space exploration. Thus,  according to its information, an expedition of an American  astronaut on board the Soyuz spacecraft is planned for 1995.  About ten flights of American spacecraft of the shuttle type to  the Russian Mir orbital station are scheduled for the period  between 1995 and 1997. Then the two countries will begin the  construction of an orbital station with an entirely new design  (now it is tentatively called Alfa).</p>

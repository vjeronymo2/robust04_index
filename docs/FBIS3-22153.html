			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shenyang, Feb 21 (XINHUA) -- Sulphur dioxide in the  air of Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province,  will be reduced to two-thirds the current content in 1996.    This is the predicted outcome of a facilities upgrading  project in the Shenyang Smeltery, which emits up to 40 percent  of the city's sulphur dioxide.    The project, scheduled to be completed in 1996, will slash  sulphur dioxide emissions from the smeltery by 80 percent.  Density of emissions will be far below limits set by the state.    The project recently received a loan of 5.89 million U.S.  dollars from the Canadian Government through the Shenyang branch  of the Bank of Communications.    The pollutant is mainly discharged by the smeltery's  out-of-date purifying equipment, used in the preparation of  sulphuric acid.    In 1994, this industrial city is reportedly to improve 70  percent of its combustion and dust removing installments to meet  state requirements.</p>

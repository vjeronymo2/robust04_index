			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: Happily sprawled in the Garden - Alastair Macaulay recalls 21 years of Promming at the Royal Opera House TWENTY-ONE years ago this year, the Royal Opera and the Midland Bank launched the Covent Garden Proms. Critics have always praised this venture, in which the Stalls' usual 546 seats are removed for a week to make room for 700 Prommers - who sit, squat, sprawl or lie on the red carpet. These Prommers have always been more attentive and more enthusiastic than those they replace (some of whom now pay Pounds 98 per seat). But, as the late Harold Rosenthal, then editor of Opera, wrote in 1974, if just one Prommer becomes a regular Covent Garden patron, the Proms will have been worthwhile. It so happens that the first Prommers, in September 1972, included Richard Fairman, (who reviews the Vixen, above),then a schoolboy who had recently finished his A-levels. And, in April 1974, I - then a first-year undergraduate - attended all six Proms performances. These included the first ballet Proms, which were my first taste of great choreography and great dancing. This week I decided to go promming again. There have always been a few keen queuers who begin around 11 am; but, as in previous years, I found that less than 100 were in front of me when I joined the queue just before 4pm. The box-office and auditorium open, as of old, an hour before performance. As in previous years, my queue neighbours were widely varied. One of them, who had arrived here four weeks previously from Australia, knew plenty about current opera and was working here as a waiter; one had first attended the Royal Opera House in 1946, when, as a balletomane Wren, she had been given a place in the Royal Box to watch Margot Fonteyn, Robert Helpmann and Beryl Grey in The Sleeping Beauty; and one of them, an American, was catching up with European culture after 20 years in Kenya. In 1974, as I recall, a Proms place cost Pounds 1. Today one costs Pounds 10. Still, for last Monday's Tosca, the carpet felt as full as it did in 1974 for a Cotrubas-Carreras Traviata. Partly because the Proms now occur in term-time, no doubt, fewer of today's Prommers are students. Partly because of today's economy, no doubt, more of them wear City suits or pearls. Mine was by no means the only FT in the queue. Recalling the Proms of the 1970s, I feel that they helped to change my life. There must have been others over the years who now feel the same way. On their behalf and mine, to the Midland Bank and the Royal Opera House, a big thankyou. The current season of Covent Garden Proms ends tonight, with another Tosca</p>

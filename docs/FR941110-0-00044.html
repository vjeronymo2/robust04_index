			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining the amount of the penalty, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1128A(d) of the Act requires the Secretary to consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific matters and also provides authority to take into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account any other items relevant to the penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination. We proposed that the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nondiscretionary and discretionary requirements be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to the State as well to make the Medicare and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid requirements equivalent for SNFs and NFs. We do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not believe that the Congress intended to have two separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment methodologies in place between both enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorities when a civil money penalty from each could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially be imposed on a single facility. Our proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included two additional factors so that the noncompliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> itself is considered when determining the penalty amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining the amount of the penalty, we proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at &sect;488.230(g) that HCFA or the State must take into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account the following factors:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The facility's degree of culpability;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The facility's history of prior offenses, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeat deficiencies;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The facility's financial condition;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The nature, scope, severity and duration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The category of requirement with which the facility is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out of compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effective date for a civil money penalty would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 10th day after the last day of the survey in the case of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate and serious threat deficiencies; or the 20th day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the last day of survey in the case of non-immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and non-serious threat deficiencies. These timeframes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit time to notify the facility of the intent to impose a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil money penalty 5 days after the last day of survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When HCFA's or the State's imposition of a civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty is upheld on appeal or the facility waives its right  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a hearing, we proposed that the civil money penalty would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be for the number of days between the effective date of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty and the date of correction of deficiencies, or, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable, the effective date of termination. Penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be computed after compliance is verified or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility has been sent notice of termination and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date. In the case of the facility achieving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance, HCFA or the State would send a separate notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the facility containing the amount of penalty per day,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of days involved, the due date of the penalty,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the total amount due. In the case of a facility to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminated, HCFA or the State would send this penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information in the termination notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The daily accrual of civil money penalties would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed for no longer than 6 months for non-immediate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-serious threat deficiencies after which HCFA would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminate a SNF provider agreement, or stop Federal funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the State for a NF, and the State may terminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider agreement of the NF if deficiencies remain. In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of immediate and serious threat deficiencies, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> daily accrual of civil money penalties would continue until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies are corrected. If the facility can supply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation acceptable to HCFA or the State survey agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that compliance with participation requirements was attained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a date preceding that of the revisit, fines would only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrue until that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

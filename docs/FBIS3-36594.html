Certain successes scored by the Azerbaijani Army at the  start  of the winter campaign due to its multifold superiority in men  and material were mostly localized and temporary, and they were  soon neutralized by the Karabakh army units.    The unprecedented losses suffered by the Azerbaijani Army  also played a significant role in lessening the intensity of the  military operations.    According to data available to NKR Defense Army  headquarters,  the Azerbaijani side lost up to 5,000 soldiers and officers  killed over the last one and half months. It also lost one  military aircraft; 62 armored cars, including 36 tanks; 12  cannons and artillery pieces, three of them Grad launchers; and  large amounts of other military equipment.    In that same period, nearly 300 fighters were killed on the  Karabakh side. Its losses in military hardware amounted to 24  military vehicles, which were completely recouped by the capture  of tanks and armored personnel carriers from the Azerbaijanis.    In that same one and half months, 26 Azerbaijanis servicemen  surrendered voluntarily. Among them are also citizens of other  countries.    According to Seyran Hovanyan, no matter how much the  Azerbaijani side tries to cover up its losses, its consequences  cannot but effect the situation on the war front and the morale  of the Azerbaijani Army.</p>

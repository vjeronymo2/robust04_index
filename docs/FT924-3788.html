			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Lift off for a flight of nostalgia - The final count-down to the winding up of Dan-Air's parent, Davies &amp; Newman AFTER all the breast-beating that surrounded the swallowing up of Dan-Air by British Airways, Monday's extraordinary meeting to consider winding up the airline's parent may well have an air of nostalgia. Mr Frederick Newman, a director of Davies &amp; Newman Holdings from 1946 to 1990, is likely to be there for the final act. He says he will vote in favour of the winding up 'because there is no alternative'. The last two autumn crises led first to Mr Newman being replaced as chairman by company doctor Mr David James, and then to a Pounds 49.3m rescue share issue that swamped the family holding. With the prolonged recession scuppering the recovery plan, the upshot for the Newmans is that shares that peaked at 845p in April 1989 are worth nothing. The 19 institutions which took part in the rescue have seen a 50p-a-share investment wither away. Davies &amp; Newman's difficulties emerged in May 1990 when a Pounds 3.1m pre-tax loss was announced for the previous year. Most ominous was the 100 per cent gearing level on borrowings of Pounds 42m. High finance costs have proved to be a feature of the Davies &amp; Newman saga, although the banks ended up with little exposure. In the 3 1/2 years to June this year, interest payments totalled Pounds 28.3m. In addition, Pounds 8.75m of the share issue proceeds went in special fees to the banks. In 1989 Dan-Air's charter business turned over about twice as much as the scheduled side and carried 4.5m passengers. But without a tie with a tour operator, it was increasingly pushed to the periphery of the big holiday companies' plans. In response, it switched its emphasis towards scheduled services based on Gatwick, where it was the largest operator with more than a fifth of the slots. Here Dan-Air faced three historic handicaps (some would say four because of its 'Dan Dare' image): The traditionally weak yields from Gatwick, outshone by Heathrow in the more lucrative business sector. Its lack of a scheduled culture. It sold too many seats cheaply to discount houses, rather than reaching the customer direct. The arrival of Mr John Olsen as chief executive in April improved the marketing, but not soon enough. The age and variety of its aircraft. Although running costs would have been substantially lower in a modern simplified fleet, the balance sheet was not strong enough to take the hits on disposals. Cuts in net worth could be ill afforded as the borrowing ceiling of Pounds 35m fell with it. These burdens proved too much in the longest recession since the 1930s. Instead of heading for the Pounds 20m profit projected at the time of the rescue, the group stayed firmly in the red - although a trading profit of nearly Pounds 4m was made in the seasonally better third quarter. If shareholders feel irate on Monday, they may quiz Mr James on such things as cost-cutting or the search for a trading partner. As usual he is not short of answers. He cites the sale of the engineering business as an example of the former and talks with 20 airlines to satisfy the latter. BA was the only one in at the death. It paid just Pounds 1 for the airline, but took on about Pounds 35m of liabilities. As to where the rescue money went: it drained away roughly equally in trading losses and restructuring costs - including closing the charter business, halving the number of scheduled routes to 14 and disposing of 26 of the 38-strong fleet. Assuming liquidators are appointed, the way will be clear for a proper bout of nostalgia. Did you know that Dan-Air was the last airline to fly a Comet? Mr Newman reckons that was in about 1980, 15 years after it started purchasing the jets from BOAC and really took off in the holiday business.</p>

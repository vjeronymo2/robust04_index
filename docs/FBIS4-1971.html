			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, April 5 (XINHUA) -- East China's Anhui  Province has become one of the country's key light industrial  producers.    With a gross light industry output worth 12.5 billion yuan  last year, Anhui now has an industrial set-up, mainly in  domestic electrical appliances, chemicals for daily use, and the  wine-making industry.    Of the 49 key products listed by the China National Light  Industry Council, Anhui's output of 29 products ranks among the  top ten in the country, with the number of refrigerators coming  the second.    A provincial official attributed the good results to the  reform and opening further to the outside world.    Since China began its reform in the late 1970s, Anhui has  focused on importing and absorbing advanced foreign technology  and equipment.    It spent four billion yuan on technically upgrading 80  percent of its light industry enterprises during the 1978-93  period.    As a result, the provincial light industrial set-up has  developed an annual output of 2,500 new varieties of products in  recent years.</p>

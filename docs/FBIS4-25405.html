			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's press secretary today dismissed media reports of Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's resignation as "fabrication and  lies."    Vyacheslav Kostikov in a statement this afternoon denied  that  President Yeltsin was planning to replace Chernomyrdin with  former Russian Security Council Secretary Yuriy Skokov.    He said that the media reports about Yeltsin's meeting with  Skokov on June 7 "were not in conformity with the facts."    Chernomyrdin's aides also issued a statement saying that the  reports about the prime minister's resignation were "absolutely  groundless."    "Spreading such rumors only serves certain elements and is  exploiting the current situation," said the statement.    Opinion polls show that Chernomyrdin's reputation has been  surging since early in the year. But speculation that  Chernomyrdin will leave his post this autumn has been rife since  he flew to Germany for a medical check-up on June 5.    The newspaper KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA today carried a  front-page  story saying that Skokov is going to replace Chernomyrdin as  prime minister.    It quoted informed sources around the Russian cabinet as  saying that the president's advisors have agreed in principle  that after Chernomyrdin's resignation for health reasons is  accepted, Skokov will be appointed prime minister.    Chernomyrdin seemed to have agreed to this arrangement  before  he flew suddenly to germany early this month, according to the  newspaper.    The reports have created a furor at home and abroad.  Chernomyrdin's aides immediately responded by issuing a  statement in Germany saying that the prime minister would return  to Moscow later today.</p>

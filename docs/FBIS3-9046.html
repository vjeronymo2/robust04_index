The declaration followed a CSCE request for  the installation of CSCE missions in Kosova, Sandjak and  Vojvodina. It added that "Yugoslavia cannot allow to be a  subject to carry out decisions which it has not approved. It  doesn't mean that special missions are not allowed to come, but  on the condition that it must be stressed that they are coming  to Yugoslavia and not to Kosova, Vojvodina or Sandjak."    Ms. Savovic said that they also do not accept the proposal  of  an independent Swedish foundation that a civil UN administration  be installed in Kosova due to human rights violations in the  territory. She considered this act as "an attempt to  internationalize the Kosova question and to impose a UN  protectorate on Yugoslavia".</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Western zinc mine output falls sharply Zinc mining ended in Austria and Italy last year, brought to a halt by low prices caused partly by a surge in imports of refined zinc from China and the Commonwealth of Independent States. This followed the closure of the last zinc mine in Germany in 1992 and contributed to a 130,000-tonne, or 17 per cent, drop in production from European zinc mines last year to 659,000 tonnes. Output in Spain also fell steeply, by 22 per cent, because of the closure of one mine and drought problems at another. According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group, 34 zinc mines closed during 1993, reducing western world nominal capacity by 694,000 tonnes. Bolivia was hit by the closure of four mines and its output dropped by 23 per cent. The study group estimates that total western world zinc mine production fell by 9.4 per cent to 5.125m tonnes last year. Meanwhile, producers maintained zinc metal production at about the same level as in the previous year: 5.456m tonnes. Producers preferred to maintain high utilisation rates at their plants in order to minimise costs, says the group, 'helped, at least in the early part of the year, by the ready availability of concentrate (an intermediate material) at attractive treatment terms'. The good news for producers is that demand for zinc last year is estimated by the group to have surpassed the record set in 1991 and moved up 2 per cent from the 1992 level to 5.46m tonnes. However, imports from Russia, Kazakhstan and China are believed to have jumped from 308,000 to 415,000 tonnes to contribute to a supply surplus of 430,000 tonnes. The cumulative surplus in the past four years is more than 1m tonnes and stocks at the end of 1993 totalled 1.45m tonnes, 13.8 weeks of consumption. Zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange, reflecting the growing stockpile, averaged Dollars 961 a tonne, 23 per cent lower than in 1992 and 44 per cent below the average in 1989 when prices peaked.</p>

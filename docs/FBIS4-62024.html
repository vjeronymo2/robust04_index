			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent] </F>   [Text] Bonn May 12 TASS -- "Everything that the Russian  Federation is doing to strengthen the integrational processes,  by no means pursues the purpose of restoring the former Soviet  Union and is based on purely economic considerations," Russian  President Boris Yeltsin, currently on a three-day official visit  in the FRG, stressed in his message, which was read out in Bonn  today during the opening of the first general session of the  International Committee for Economic Reforms and CIS Cooperation  with Western Countries.    The head of the Russian state drew attention to some  strategic factors in East-West economic relations, particularly  to the fact that "the merging of the Western investment  potential with the resources and labour force of the new  independent states is becoming increasingly pressing in our  days". "It is absolutely clear now that the Russian Federation,  like the other CIS states, has irreversibly embarked upon the  road of reforms, switching over from the centralised planned  economy to market relations, and is fully resolved to go the  whole hog," Yeltsin pointed out.    The address of the Russian president who, as noted here,  wanted to attend the general session personally, but could not  do it due to the busy programme of his official visit to  Germany, had set the tune to many other speeches.    "I readily joined the work of the international committee,"  its vice leader and chairman of the "Deutsche Bank" supervisory  council Friedrich Wilhelm Christians noted, "because I was sure  that integration processes had begun in the CIS countries. The  former republics of the Soviet Union made a big mistake when  they presumed that each of them could survive independently  after the USSR's collapse. This is impossible today. Not only  much time was wasted in vain during the years that had elapsed  since then, but great damage was inflicted upon those states,  too," this prominent German banker who, as he said, has been  actively cooperating for the past 25 years first with the former  USSR and then with the CIS nations, told the general session.    "And after the beginning of the integration process, not  only  in the political but also in the economic sphere, it was time to  think of the emergence of those countries on the world market,"  Christians noted.    "The Bonn general session," head of the international  committee and Chairman of the Council of Experts of the Russian  Government Georgiy Khizha stressed, "is an important event in  the international economic life. "The preservation of peace,  political stability and democracy in the CIS countries and other  states of the world depends largely on economic and social  progress. The work of the committee should make a substantial  contribution to the development of real partnership, trust, and  mutual understanding. International security in the interests  of all the countries of the world can be achieved through  economic cooperation," Khizha stressed.</p>

The Indians lost twice this  season to Madera, the Central Section champion, in the Stanford and Mt. San  Antonio College invitationals.  </P> <P> "I figured we would have to have a great team race and (Madera) would have to  have some problems, and it happened," Hart Coach Gene Blankenship said.  </P> <P> Billy Dixon surged from 12th to third during the second mile of the 5,000-meter  race and held on to lead Hart with an eighth-place finish in 15 minutes 48  seconds. Sophomore Keith Grossman was 13th in 15:55 and Hector Chavez placed  20th in 16:06 for Hart.  </P> <P> Agoura's girls avenged second-place finishes the past three years to claim  their first state championship, beating San Diego Mt. Carmel, 41-68.  </P> <P> Deena Drossin paced the Chargers by winning her third Division I individual  title in the past four years. She timed 17:29. Teammate Tiffany York finished a  surprising fourth in 18:14 and sophomore Kristie Camp placed 15th in 19:10.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes, which won the girls' Division I title three times from 1987-89,  placed a distant fifth with 124 points.  </P> <P> "It was a long time coming," Agoura Coach Bill Duley said. "(We) felt pretty  confident (we) were going to win it last year but PV ran a great state meet (in  a 65-75 win)."  </P> <P> The Fillmore boys' team defeated top-ranked Maranatha for the Division IV  championship, 90-98, and Nordhoff edged Morro Bay, 77-79, for the girls'  Division IV title.  </P> <P> Fillmore's Jorge Barajas sprinted by Richie Boulet of Drake (North Coast  Section) to finish second in 15:43 behind Brian Singleton (15:41) of Altaville  Bret Harte. Joel Lopez (16:23) and Victor Hernandez (16:35) placed 13th and  17th for Fillmore.  </P> <P> In winning their first state title, the third-ranked Flashes avenged their loss  to Maranatha in last week's Southern Section championships.  </P> <P> Dascha Spellman led Nordhoff with an eighth-place finish in 19:00 and was  followed by freshman teammate Maria Garcia (14th in 19:34) and senior Jennifer  Kimpton (20th, 19:57).  </P> <P> Jeannie Rothman of Westlake posted the fastest girls' time of the day in  winning the Division II title in 17:28, one second off Drossin's state-meet  record set last year.  </P> <P> Newbury Park's Jeff Wilson surged away from San Luis Obispo's James Menon with  400 yards to go to win the Division III championship in 15:15.  </P> <P> Drossin and Veronica Barajas of Channel Islands finished first and second in  the Division I race.  </P></p>

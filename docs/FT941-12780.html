			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Advertising proposals resisted Sir, Your report 'Cash with order adverts reprieved' (January 22) correctly draws attention to the compromise text on distance selling proposed by the Greek presidency of the Council of Ministers. However, the UK's marketing industries should not assume that the reprieve is permanent. The Commission's contentious revised draft remains on the table - with its restrictive provisions on cash with order, telephone selling, credit cards, information requirements and its inclusion of the financial services and tourism sectors. While the Greek text does reflect some of the discussions between governments, the Commission's text in the main may still be approved by the European parliament, and still represents a position generally supported by many of the EU member states. Thankfully, the UK is not one of these. The UK Advertising Association and its members will continue to defend the UK's effective consumer guarantees in the face of inappropriate and unwieldy EC legislative proposals. Lionel Stanbrook, director of special issues, The Advertising Association, Abford House, 15 Wilton Road, London SW1</p>

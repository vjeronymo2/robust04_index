About 75,000 people waited much of the day for the ANC  president at Miami Beach, a popular picnic resort at the dusty  Vaal Triangle township where police shot dead 69 protesters 34  years ago.    Just how much has changed in the intervening years was  demonstrated by the brazen display of weaponry, including AK-47  rifles, handguns, axes and assegais carried by rallygoers.  Sporadic gunfire was heard from time to time and stones were  thrown at people who refused to sit when the ANC president began  his address.    Earlier marshals battled to control the crowd as it thronged  forward to get a glimpse of Mr Mandela when he arrived. Nobody  appeared to be injured but several people fainted due to the  heat. There were anxious moments as mr mandela's motorcade  inched through the crowd.    Mr Mandela, thanking the crowd for their turnout, then  lashed  out at the ANC's organisers. "I must condemn in the strongest  terms their lack of organisation and their inability to  anticipate the crowds.    "It's lucky that nobody has died. I don't want to see this  again. If I see such a mess I will have to deal with the region  and the branch," he said.    At one stage, Mr Mandela stopped his address to remonstrate  with some "ruffians" and at another point he complained about  the rough manner in which marshals handled the crowd.    Mr Mandela, referring to the 1960 killings, said there would  never be a Sharpeville again.    He then turned to the election campaign, saying the ANC  wanted a better life for all. That included houses, education  and medical care. He said the ANC's opponents said the ANC was  being over-ambitious. What they meant by this, he said, was that  providing social services to blacks would be too costly. But the  ANC was determined to go ahead with its plans whether its  opponents liked it or not.    "The National Party has never cared for the masses of this  country," he said.    Mr Mandela, referring to the interim Goldstone Commission  report concerning alleged gunrunning said to involve senior  policemen, he said there were good policemen in the force and  good soldiers in the South African Defence Force.    He then led the crowd through the voting procedure, telling  them they must look for his face on the ballot paper and put  their cross alongside that face.    The roads of Sharpeville were crowded with buses taking  supporters home when the rally finished. Sporadic gunfire  punctuated the din.    Earlier, Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] President Clarence  Makwetu addressed about 3,000 people at the George Thabe stadium  about three kilometres away. Mr Makwetu said the ANC had not  wanted to become involved when the PAC launched the pass  protests that led to the Sharpeville killings.    He said only the PAC had stuck to its principles and only  the  PAC could ensure real liberation. The PAC's rhetoric at the  rally, complete with "one settler, one bullet", was more  militant than the ANC version. But the gathering itself was  quieter.</p>

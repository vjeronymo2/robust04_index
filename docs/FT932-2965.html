			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy outlines a flexible approach to borrowing - One option is a global dollar bond offering as the country gets back on track The Republic of Italy could be poised to issue one of the world's biggest global dollar bonds as borrowing gets back on track after political upsets and debt downgradings earlier this year. However, Mr Mario Draghi, director general of the treasury, stressed that the bond was just one of a range of options currently being considered. Italy's flexible approach has been reflected in the treasury's two latest deals. Last month, it launched an innovative swap offer, giving investors in seven old Eurodollar bond issues the chance to exchange their paper for one of two new bonds, depending on maturity. The deal, which raised around Dollars 800m in fresh money thanks to new issues accompanying the swaps, was followed this month by a Dollars 2bn issue of floating rate notes. The two transactions showed that Italy's foreign borrowing plans, heralded by a DM5bn bond in late January, were back on track. When the D-Mark issue was launched, Mr Draghi said Italy hoped to raise between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 15bn on the Euromarkets this year, depending on market conditions. However, Italy's creditworthiness started to take a battering within days of the D-Mark deal as the widening political corruption scandal triggered a string of ministerial resignations and called the former Amato government's authority into question. Political turmoil in turn raised uncertainties about Italy's ability to deal with its huge budget deficit, the core of its structural economic problems. One reason for the republic's return to the Eurobond market after a two-year absence was to switch borrowing away from relatively expensive domestic lira deals. Since the Amato government had some success in cutting spending and raising taxes, servicing costs on the deficit now account for the bulk of the government's funding requirements. The political turmoil led to a volatile period in the domestic bond markets, which were additionally buffeted by the decision by Moody's, the US rating agency, to downgrade Italy's credit rating to A1 from Aa3. However, there has been a marked return of confidence in recent weeks, which treasury officials say is not reflected in the ratings. The appointment of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former central bank governor, as prime minister convinced dealers further action would be taken to tackle the deficit. Meanwhile, recent referendum results suggest far-reaching political changes are now under way. The decision to launch the bond swap was an attempt to 'sound out the market and tighten spreads,' says Mr Alberto Giovannini, the Columbia University professor now working as a full-time adviser to the treasury. Although only about 10 per cent of the eligible bonds were exchanged for the new paper, Mr Giovannini said the treasury was pleased with the results. 'A lot of the professionally-held paper was locked up in asset swaps. And much of the retail sales had gone to Italian investors, who previously bought bonds free of withholding tax on the coupons,' he said. But Mr Giovannini stressed the treasury's objective was not to tease out the maximum amount of paper. With fixed and floating rate dollar issues and a large D-Mark transaction under its belt, the treasury is now about half-way to meeting its Dollars 10bn-Dollars 15bn borrowing goal for 1993. Mr Draghi stresses the range is flexible. 'We don't want to force anything down the market's throat,' he says. 'We're not pushing for tight spreads at any cost. We're looking for the equilibrium spreads in line with what the market will take.' With the risk of political upsets still present and the rating agencies so far sticking to their guns, the Italians cannot afford to take a more aggressive position at present.</p>

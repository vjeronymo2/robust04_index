			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / International Company News: Hoare Govett makes 70 redundancies - Job cuts will mean more direct focus on corporate finance business HOARE GOVETT, the stockbroking firm owned by Security Pacific which has been seeking a new backer for months, will announce tomorrow that it has made around 70 of its 450 staff redundant, to focus more directly on its corporate finance business. The cuts, which will affect most levels and departments of the firm, will cut back the market making, which employs some 30 people and an estimated Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m capital. The move follows the introduction of a bonus scheme, controversial inside the firm, in which the top 70 have been locked in with 'loyalty payments' believed to total around Pounds 7m. Hoare Govett declined to comment 'on any matter involving our staff'. The firm is expected to argue that the cuts - and bonuses - are necessary either for a successful deal with a new owner or for the firm's independent survival. The firm is understood to be in negotiations with a potential buyer. The move raises questions of whether the firm's chairman, Mr Peter Meinertzhagen, has finally secured the future of one of the City's most respected houses, given the repeated failure of proposed deals in the past six months. Hoare Govett's plans for a partial management buy-out from Security Pacific were scuppered in October when SecPac merged with BankAmerica and it was made clear that even a reduced investment in the securities firm would have no place in the two banks' joint future. However Hoare Govett executives were unable to finance a full buy-out, and the search began for new backers. Hoare Govett says that no formal deadline has been given by SecPac, despite reports of a six-month limit to its support. The firm made a small operating profit in 1991 - Mr Meinertzhagen and his colleagues have cut the cost base drastically in recent years - and it is believed to share its tax losses with its owners. Despite the uncertainty, the firm has managed to hold its share of UK institutional business at about 5 per cent to 6 per cent, although that is believed to have been slipping recently, and to have held its share of UK market making at around 8 per cent to 9 per cent. However, there is undeniable urgency in finding a solution to the firm's ownership problems. Hoare's executives did not disguise their disappointment when a proposed deal with Deutsche Bank fell through in December. The pressure that Mr Meinertzhagen faces is that Hoare Govett's most tempting asset, its exceptionally strong list of some 150 corporate clients, is likely to erode if uncertainty continues. The loyalty of those clients in recent years has been impressive. While the firm has lost several - the industrial Sedgwick, both gained by Warburgs - it was appointed recently by Redland, the building company, for its attempted merger with Steetley. Mr Gerald Corbett, Redland's finance director, is emphatic in his support. 'It is a fine established business, with a tremendous reputation on the corporate side, and if we'd been concerned about its future we wouldn't have gone there'. However the firm is not immune to the normal wear and tear on a client list, such as conflicts of interest. As brokers to both Hanson and ICI, Hoare's suffered the misfortune of being excluded from both sides when Hanson took its exploratory and unwelcome stake in the chemicals group. Redland apart, the uncertainty is likely to have been a handicap in winning more business. The same risk of erosion may apply to its research team; its leading banks analyst and its retail analyst left recently. If those are the pressures on Mr Meinertzhagen and his colleagues to resolve the ownership question, what have been the obstacles? The pitfalls of investing in any stockbroker have been well illustrated by the past few years. A particular obstacle is that Hoare's executives have been anxious to have control of their business. One former senior employee sums up: 'What Hoare's have been setting out to do - and Peter Meinertzhagen in particular - is to find a solution that gives the senior executives a role in the direction of the firm'. 'He is very much of the partnership mentality,' another former colleague said. 'The deal they were doing before Bank of America scrapped it was the one they really wanted, where the management of Hoare's had a large minority or small majority'. If that is the case, Hoare's market making could have been part of the obstacle. The market making employs an estimated Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m of capital simply to keep the firm's prices quoted for a wide range of shares on the stock exchange Topic screens. But any investor might well feel uneasy at putting that capital in a risky activity without majority control. Cutting some of the capital risk out of business might then be a solution either in an outside deal, or a plan for management investment. Several Hoare watchers suggest that Mr Meinertzhagen wants Hoare Govett to be a pure corporate broker, Cazenove Mark II - referring to the City's pre-eminent corporate broker. Cazenove's policy is to make markets in shares as a service to its corporate clients, and in practice that means mainly the smaller stocks neglected by other brokers. 'Peter admires Cazenove enormously,' said one former colleague, who added that it might nonetheless be hubristic for Hoare's to expect to emulate Cazenove's success. Mr Meinertzhagen's uncle was senior partner of Cazenove until 1981, and there has been a long-standing goodwill - although no formal relationship - between the two firms, with many corporate clients shared. The next few months will show whether Mr Meinertzhagen's plans take the firm in that direction, and its realistic chances of success. One former colleague of Mr Meinertzhagen said: 'I think Peter will try hard to do the deal he thinks is right. He will not try hard to do a deal he doesn't think is right. The business has been messed up once already. It's not collapsing, but this time it has to work.'</p>

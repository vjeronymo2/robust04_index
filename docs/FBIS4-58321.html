			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 2 May (INA) -- Reliable sources in Iraq's  Kurdistan have stated that the two U.S. helicopters, which were  downed over northern Iraq last month, were carrying a team of  experts from the Pentagon, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency,  and the Zionist Mosad.    Informed Kurdish sources informed the newspaper  AL-JUMHURIYAH  that among the people killed were five agent Kurdish elements  known for their links to the Pentagon and the U.S. intelligence  circles. They explained that the five dead Kurds were Salih  Sa'id, a translator, born in 1962; 'Abd-al-Sattar 'Arab, born in  1969; Nadir Mikhu, born in 1964; Ghandi Husayn, born in 1968;  and Ahmad Muhammad Sulayman, born in 1956. These elements were  carrying extremely important reports which were to be discussed  in a meeting in Salah al-Din, which was not convened due to the  helicopters' downing.    The Kurdish sources asserted that the meeting in Salah  al-Din  was designed to expand the circle of conspiracy and discuss  reports on proposals aimed at entrenching the separatist  movement and detach Kurdistan from Iraq as part of the  comprehensive fragmentation scheme prepared by U.S. and Zionist  circles. The sources explained that many Mosad agents were  present at the scene of the accident. A group was spotted, led  by Marlin Bogos [name as received], who plays the role of  coordinator, and Barbara Schell, political adviser to the forces  of aggression in the Turkish base of Incerlik.    The newspaper sources revealed a U.S. report which was to be  discussed during the Salah al-Din meeting. This report aims to  entrench the United States in the region, loot the mineral  resources in Iraq's Kurdistan, and transfer them to California  under the supervision of scientists specialized in exploring  uranium, gold, tin, and other minerals.</p>

			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / German M3 growth slows Growth in German money supply slowed further to an annualised rate of 11.3 per cent during June, after a rise of 13.4 per cent in May and 15.4 per cent in April, according to provisional Bundesbank figures. The result was better than expected, reviving expectations of more short-term interest rate cuts this year. However, most economists think the key 4.5 per cent discount rate is unlikely to be reduced before the central bank's four-week summer break, which starts after tomorrow's council meeting. Attention at that meeting will be on the traditional mid-year review of the performance of M3, the bank's main indicator of potential inflation. Despite the welcome moderation in M3, it is still growing far above this year's 4-6 per cent target range. The Bundesbank added in a statement that lending to the private sector - down in the previous two months - had fallen again. Investment in long-term instruments outside the scope of M3 had also strengthened further during the month. Monetary growth, however, had been 'strongly' influenced by the cash management tactics of the public authorities during the month. Editorial comment, Page 21</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris financials consider recovery potential END-of-quarter operations moved bourses, and individual shares yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was driven by technical factors throughout the day as the September options expired. In the last hour, the start of October futures pulled up the CAC-40 index, which closed 4.80 better at 1,736.73 in turnover of FFr3.8bn. Arbitrage-related activity affected the performance of most stocks while the financial sector was affected further by disappointing first half results as Suez, down FFr3.30 at FFr236.20, and Paribas, eventually FFr9.20 higher at FFr322.50, both said that they would have to make large provisions against exposure to the property sector. The Suez and Paribas warnings are only the latest in a series, following an increase in commercial property vacancy rates. However, Mr William Vincent, European banking analyst at Nomura, commented that the provisions were likely to peak in 1992, assuming that the economic climate did not deteriorate, which would lead to a good year for earnings in 1993. In the case of Compagnie Bancaire (up FFr15 at FFr350), which also reported interims recently, he noted that 'next year the combination of continued steady revenue growth, strict cost control and a fairly modest fall in provisions will result in a sharp recovery.' Other active issues of the day included Peugeot, up FFr15 at FFr540, and BSN, down FFr9 at FFr989 as an extraordinary general meeting approved limits on voting rights. FRANKFURT surrendered early gains on gloomy economic data, earnings downgrades and foreign selling. The DAX index, up 12 points at the outset, dropped 9.90 to a new 1992 closing low of 1,466.36. Turnover rose to DM4.8bn from DM4.2bn. A German inflation figure of 3.6 per cent for September snuffed out any lingering interest rate hopes; in addition, the federation of German retailers said that west German retail sales dropped by 3.1 per cent during the first seven months of this year. At County NatWest, Mr Adrian Hopkinson noted that German holiday bookings abroad were up 20 per cent this summer, and that consumption was unlikely to flow in two directions at the same time. Shares in the sector fell in tandem, with Kaufhof down DM8 to DM412 and Karstadt by DM9 to DM478. Carmakers continued their downtrend on the weak dollar and the truckbuilder, MAN, dropped DM9.50 to DM250. County, starting from a conservative base has recently dropped its 1993 eps forecast for MAN from DM26 to DM22. Meanwhile, in utilities, an apparently defensive sector, Bayernhypo put out deeper downgrades for RWE and Veba, which fell DM6 to DM376.50, and DM4.50 to DM356.50 respectively. ZURICH, mixed as the weak dollar dampened sentiment, saw the SMI index shed 1.9 to 1,878.3. The consumer electronics group, Interdiscount, topped the active list and ranged between SFr1,500 and SFr1,640, on apparently conflicting bets on today's annual news conference, before closing SFr20 higher at SFr1,600. MILAN, once again, tasted the bitter-sweet fruits of devaluation. The Comit index rose 4,82, or 1.3 per cent to 363.64 but the Italian component of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, expressed in D-Mark terms, fell by 24.71, or 3.9 per cent to 604.43. BRUSSELS reflected late arbitrage activity in Electrabel, between ordinary and tax-efficient Afv stock which rose 0.1 per cent, and 1.7 per cent (for the Afv 1) to BFr4,790 as the Bel-20 index closed just 1.97 higher at 1,109.17. However, there were more steel industry problems as Cockerill dropped 4.5 per cent to BFr128 in active trade. The industry leader reported a 58 per cent drop in profits after the market closed. AMSTERDAM resisted steep falls as the CBS Tendency index closed 0.1 down at 110.9. Philips lost 70 cents to Fl 22.70 while Polygram was 20 cents lower at Fl 47.00. James Capel downgraded the Polygram stock yesterday to short-term sell from hold, expecting profits growth to slow down further over the second half. COPENHAGEN saw Baltica rise DKr26 to DKr215, writes Hilary Barnes, following statements by the chief executive officer, Mr Peter Christoffersen, to local newspapers explaining why, in his view, the insurance group's problems cannot end in the same kind of free-fall that wiped out Hafnia. The KFX index of most-traded shares rose 0.84 to 73.61. VIENNA lost 2 per cent in low volume, on selling pressure from the futures and options exchange. The ATX index closed 16.90 lower at 795.56. TEL AVIV closed at a new high in active trading. The index rose 2.15 or 1.28 per cent to 170.23 in turnover of Skl101m.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     11.30am  12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     4 pm     close 1004.87  1004.91  1004.75  1003.23  1002.90  1002.21  1003.13  1003.44  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             Day's High  1005.73    Day's Low  1000.95  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Sep 29    Sep 28    Sep 25    Sep 24    Sep 23          1009.98   1016.40   1035.63   1041.31   1043.77  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

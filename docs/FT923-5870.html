			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Brewers see no sign of upturn in pub trade THE impact of the recession on the pub trade is getting worse, brewers reported yesterday. Some industry estimates suggested that volume beer sales through pubs in the past two months were 5 per cent down on the same period last year, though the take-home market was more buoyant. 'Trading conditions, far from showing any improvement, have further deteriorated,' Sir Alick Rankin, chairman of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, said at the company's annual meeting in Edinburgh. 'We cannot, as yet, discern any sign of a future upturn.' Sir Alick said that the impact of the recession, which had so far been felt mainly in the south-east, was spreading into northern England and Scotland. Scottish &amp; Newcastle was gaining market share, he claimed. 'However, it must be acknowledged that we are currently operating in a highly competitive, reducing marketplace.' The group's holiday operations, Center Parcs and Pontin, were also being affected by a general trend for customers to book later and spend less. He warned that the company could not expect 'to overcome all the negative aspects presented by today's business climate'. Mr Simon Redman, chairman of Greene King, the East Anglia-based brewer, told his shareholders yesterday that the company's total sales so far this year were slightly below those in the same period last year. 'At the moment we see no real signs of an end to the recession,' he said. 'Trading conditions have, if anything, deteriorated in the last two months after some improvement in May and June.' Whitbread said that its total beer sales were ahead of last year's but agreed that the pub trade had fallen in July and August. Both Whitbread and Allied-Lyons, however, reported that business through their off-licence chains remained relatively buoyant. Bass described trading conditions as 'very, very tough', but claimed it was gaining share in a market that was declining overall. Mr Alan Flockhart, finance director of Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley, said: 'Trade is certainly not getting any better. It is a gloomy marketplace.'</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Botnar retains shares 'control' court is told MR OCTAV BOTNAR, chair-man and managing director of Nissan UK, settled his shares in the company in a charitable trust some years ago but 'does retain the voting control of that holding', Mr Michael Hunt, Nissan UK deputy chairman and assistant managing director, told the High Court yesterday. He was giving evidence for the company in an action in which Mr Stan Cholaj, a former Nissan UK assistant managing director, is suing the company for damages of more than Pounds 1m for wrongful dismissal and breach of contract. Mr Hunt said in written evidence that Mr Botnar 'is personally involved in all aspects of the business and he makes all important strategic decisions. It is well accepted that the directors delegate their authority to Mr Botnar to bind the company on their behalf.' He said it was the 'personal control of Mr Botnar which distinguishes Nissan (UK) from other companies in the motor industry. There is a lack of formal structure and bureaucracy.' In cross-examination, Mr Hunt said Mr Botnar was in Switzerland. A warrant for the arrest of Mr Botnar has been issued by the Inland Revenue, and he has submitted only written evidence. Mr Botnar, in written evidence, said: 'Cholaj was responsible for the fleet market as soon as he joined and he remained responsible for it throughout his employment.' He alleged that Mr Cholaj wanted 'to play up the secondary responsibilities' given to him such as finance, advertising, or printing brochures, while omitting to discuss his performance in fleet sales. He said Mr Cholaj's allegations were 'frivolous, trivial, distorted, inaccurate'. Commenting on one of Mr Cholaj's allegations, Mr Botnar said: 'If I asked Cholaj to curtail a meeting, it would have been because I do not consider lengthy and fruitless palaver of any variety to be useful for the company.' The hearing continues today.</p>

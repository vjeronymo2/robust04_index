L. 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. Comments are invited on the proposed minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' for the implementation of the general statutory funding preference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approximately $600,000 will be available in FY 1995 for this program. It is anticipated that the $600,000 will support approximately 7 competing awards averaging $86,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 751 authorizes the award of grants for the purpose of planning and implementing projects in primary care training for podiatric physicians in approved or provisionally approved residency programs which shall provide financial assistance in the form of traineeships to residents who participate in such projects and who plan to specialize in primary care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible entities for this program are schools of podiatric medicine and public and nonprofit private hospitals. As noted above, the authorizing legislation limits eligibility to residency programs that are approved or provisionally approved. The Council on Podiatric Medical Education (CPME), the recognized accrediting body for podiatric medicine, uses the term ``candidate status'' in lieu of ``provisional approval.'' For the purposes of this program ``candidate status'' will be accepted as meeting the statutory requirement for ``provisional approval.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants to this program that are planning to initiate a new podiatric primary care residency program are expected to apply to CPME for candidate status. Grants will only be awarded to applicants that can demonstrate the attainment of candidate status by July 1, 1995. The application for Federal funding must demonstrate, through responses to the program specifications, that an adequate emphasis will be placed on podiatric primary care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The period of Federal support should not exceed 3 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> National Health Objectives for the Year 2000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas.

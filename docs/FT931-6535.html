			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Observer: King cat Whatever might be said about Lady Thatcher, her loyalty to her old business heroes is admirable. When TV-am lost its breakfast slot, Lady Thatcher wrote to tell chairman Bruce Gyngell how heartbroken she was, especially since she was partly responsible for the legislation which lost TV-am its franchise. Now it seems she has been consoling Lord King who has lost his British Airways chairmanship somewhat earlier than planned. According to yesterday's Sunday Times a lady called Margaret phoned Lord King to say: 'I just wanted to tell you, you were the greatest achievement of my years in office. I am so proud of you.' Whatever the truth of the tale, it is clear that Lord King has not lost his sense of humour judging by his performance at last week's annual dinner of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, where he recounted the story of a hungry mouse. Every time it tried to venture out of its hole, it was terrified by a loud feline 'miaow'. Eventually the 'miaows' were replaced by a dog's bark. Thinking that the coast was clear, the mouse ventured out, only to be pounced upon by the cat. Moral of the tale: it pays to learn a second language, even if you are a cat.</p>

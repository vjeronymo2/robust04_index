			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- The Foreign Ministry plans  to set up a panel to study possible topics for the agenda of the  next global trade negotiations that will succeed the Uruguay  Round of multilateral trade talks, ministry sources said  Wednesday [25 May].    The sources said the planned panel indicates Japan's desire  to take the initiative in launching the next round of global  trade negotiations.    The study group, led by the ministry's Economic Affairs  Bureau, will be focused on possible agenda subjects for the next  round, such as the relationship between trade and environment,  trade and labor, and trade and investment, as well as  regionalism.    It will work out draft proposals on these themes by November  and announce them at meetings of the World Trade Organization  (WTO), which is scheduled to take form in January to replace the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).    The draft proposals will reflect opinions from academics and  private-sector firms as well.    Just days after the Uruguay Round trade pact was signed in  April, major powers began shifting to the next round of trade  talks.</p>

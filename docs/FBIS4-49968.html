			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 11 (CNA) -- Taiwan was rated the  world's third best country for investment, next to Japan and  Switzerland, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Wednesday [11  May].    Ministry officials said that the rating was listed in the  latest report of the New York-based Business Environment Risk  Intelligence S.A. (BERI), which regularly evaluates investment  profit opportunities in the world's 50 major countries.    BERI issues the investment climate report three times a  year,  in March, July, and November, they said.    The March report said that Taiwan's ranking may advance to  second place sometime within the next five years. This will put  Taiwan on equal footing with Japan and Singapore, the report  said. Switzerland is expected to keep hold of its top position,  the report added.    The BERI evaluation on investment profit opportunities is  based on three major indicators: the operation risk index, the  political risk index, and repatriation capabilities. A final  cumulative assessment comes out after separate evaluation of the  three factors.    In terms of the operation risk index, which comprises 15  items including inflation, the balance of international  payments, transportation and telecommunications, and long-term  loans and trust funds, Taiwan topped the economic growth list  and and ranked second in the local attitude toward foreign  investors and their profits as well as labor costs versus labor  productivity.    Taiwan was placed fourth with Norway in the political risk  index, behind Switzerland, Singapore, and Austria.    In repatriation capabilities, Taiwan was currently rated as  third, behind Japan and Switzerland, but was expected to jump to  the top position in the next five years.    The officials, commenting on the BERI report, pledged that  they would continue their efforts to help improve Taiwan's  investment environment.</p>

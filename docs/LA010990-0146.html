			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WRONG RETURN ADDRESS HAS IRS RED-FACED  </P> <P> About 1 in 200 of the 107-million tax-form packages mailed by the IRS last  month contained return envelopes with the wrong address, IRS spokesman Steve  Pyrek said today.  </P> <P> "For example, a taxpayer in Maryland, who normally would file to Philadelphia,  might receive a package with an envelope carrying a Cincinnati address," Pyrek  explained. The folks at the IRS are red-faced but say there is no reason for  panic. He said taxpayers may change the address on the IRS envelope, but even  if they don't, processing returns sent to the wrong address will not pose a  problem for the IRS.  </P></p>

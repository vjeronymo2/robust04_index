			<p>BFN     [Text] Mortar fire resounded across Kigali before dawn  today. Heavy fighting has resumed, and small arms fire can be  heard in the streets of the Rwandan capital. The RPF [Rwandan  Patriotic Front] rebels are currently aiming for the  administrative district of the city. They already hold part of  the capital, and they are resuming the offensive to control the  whole country. This is how we will protect the Tutsis: we do  not need France, they repeat, even threatening France. This is  what Jacques Bihozagara, RPF spokesman in Brussels, had to say  to Anne-Marie Mouradian:    [Begin recording] [Bihozagara] The RPF agreed to  humanitarian  intervention, but we do not want a mission which is imposed upon  us. For a long time, we have been opposed to a French presence  among the blue helmets. We now see that France has decided on  war.    As you know, there was a Security Council resolution that  defined the framework for intervention by the international  community. Now France wants to go in alone, or with its friends  or its acolytes. France is currently mobilizing African  countries, in particular French-speaking countries, some of  which are not all that independent from France. We consider  French intervention as an act of provocation, and therefore we  will meet it with the appropriate means.    [Mouradian] By armed force?    [Bihozagara] Yes, of course. We are quite ready for a trial  of strength, and, as I said, we are prepared to make use of all  the means at our disposal. If we must all die, then we will  die, but I think France will also have to pay a heavy price.  [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> OUTDOOR NOTES;  </P> <P> 44TH WESTERN FISHING TACKLE AND BOAT SHOW STARTS AT LONG BEACH  </P> <P> If it's true that God does not subtract time spent fishing, Fred Hall should  live forever.  </P> <P> Hall's life has been dedicated to all forms of the sport, which he brings to  the public again as the producer of the 44th Western Fishing Tackle and Boat  Show at the Long Beach Convention Center today through Sunday.  </P> <P> His policy has always been to admit children under 12 free, if they're with a  parent, and to let them fish free at the show's trout tank. Hall estimates that  he has introduced 600,000 kids from three generations to fishing.  </P> <P> The show claims to have "the world's largest supply of fishing tackle," plus  booths for resorts and displays of boats up to 48 feet. Show hours are 3-10  p.m. today through Friday, 11 a.m.-10:30 p.m. Saturday and 11 a.m.-7 p.m.  Sunday. Admission is $6.50.  </P> <P> People on the Upper Kern River who rely on the fishing trade were supportive  when the Department of Fish and Game proposed changing a stretch above the  Johnsondale Bridge to wild trout status this year.  </P> <P> "We didn't fight that at all," said John T. (Jack) Dempsey, who runs Sierra  Sporting Goods in Kernville. "Then they dropped the bomb on us."  </P> <P> Dempsey and his neighbors read in a newspaper that the new state fishing  regulations effective Thursday also would close the heart of the Upper Kern  from Lake Isabella to the Tulare-Kern County Line to year-round, winter  fishing, "to protect the resource."  </P> <P> But it wouldn't do much for business, said Dempsey, who estimated that a  two-month shutdown starting Thursday, until the general trout season opens  April 28, would cost merchants in the area 70% of their normal trade.  </P> <P> "March and April are going to be devastating," he said.  </P> <P> Fishing also will be less fun, Dempsey said, because it's only in the winter  months that the anglers have the river to themselves, without sharing it with  rafters, kayakers and swimmers.  </P> <P> And furthermore, Dempsey added, it isn't fair that "the price of a (fishing)  license has increased by $1.75 to $21, but the season has been reduced to six  months."  </P> <P> Apparently there will be no closure. Dempsey organized an appeal with 45  letters of protest and collected 619 signatures on petitions. Ron Pelzman of  the Fish and Game Commission staff said Tuesday that special action was taken  to review the change, and an announcement is expected today that it will be  fishing as usual on the Kern, year-round.  </P> <P> "There was never an intent to close that winter fishery down," Pelzman said,  indicating that it was just a mixup when the regulations were completely redone  for simplification this year. The Kern was "inadvertently" grouped with the  seasonal streams.  </P> <P> Briefly  </P> <P> The six-man Transantarctica Expedition, having logged 3,800 miles, is expected  to complete its seven-month trek with sled dogs Saturday at Mirnyy, a Soviet  base. ABC plans to televise the arrival during "Wide World of Sports.". . .  Trout Unlimited's South Coast Chapter conservation banquet on March 10 at the  Balboa Bay Club is open to the public.

The Society for the Conservation of  Bighorn Sheep and the Department of Fish and Game are seeking volunteers for a  census project in the Lytle Creek area March 10-11. Details: (213) 256-0463.  </P> <P> The take of abalone will be reduced when the season opens Thursday because of  declining abalone stocks in several areas off the Southern California coast.  The daily bag limit will be two a day in any combination of the species. The  size limit will remain unchanged. The mainland coast from Palos Verdes to Dana  Point is closed to the take of abalone. . . . The DFG will commission a new  marine patrol boat, "Tuna," Thursday at Shelter Island in San Diego. . . .

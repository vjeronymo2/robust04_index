			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U. COLO. CENTER TELLS OF QUESTIONS ON HIS MOOD;  </P> <P> VANDIVER TELLS QUERIES ON 'SATISFIED' QUOTIENT  </P> <P> University of Colorado center Shaun Vandiver said his mother and junior college  coach have received inquiries from other colleges, including Minnesota and  DePaul, asking how content he is at Colorado.  </P> <P> Vandiver, a junior in his first season with the Buffs, drew attention to  himself last month with a 27-point, 14-rebound performance on national  television against Iowa State. He leads Colorado University in 10 statistical  categories and is the only player on the team who has started every game this  season.  </P> <P> Vandiver said Monday that "several" coaches have talked to his mother in  Romeoville, Ill., but he would identify only two of them, calling both "friends  of the family." They are Minnesota coach Clem Haskins, who recruited Vandiver  two years ago for Western Kentucky, and Doug Bruno, the women's basketball  coach at DePaul.  </P> <P> "Some (other) schools have said something to my mother, and others have called  my junior college coach," said Vandiver. "But I can't say who. I don't want to  bring down some kind of big investigation on anybody."  </P> <P> The NCAA prohibits coaches from making "direct or indirect contact" with  players who are on scholarship at another school without first receiving  permission from the player's athletic director.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No One Would Ask Me'  </P> <P> Vandiver's former junior college coach, Dave Farrar of Hutchinson Community  College in Kansas, said he had not been asked whether Vandiver was content at  Colorado.  </P> <P> "No one would ask me that," Farrar said. "And that (transferring) wouldn't be  anything that he would consider. He's a smart, loyal kid."  </P> <P> Vandiver said he is not considering a transfer. If he did, he would have to sit  out one of his two remaining years of eligibility.  </P> <P> "I'm not crazy," he said. "I'm not going to leave here. This is the best place  for me. It would be selfish of me to leave here. I knew the record when I came  in, I knew the struggles we were in for."  </P> <P> Colorado, 7-18 overall and 2-10 and in last place in the Big Eight Conference,  plays its final home game Wednesday night against Iowa State.  </P></p>

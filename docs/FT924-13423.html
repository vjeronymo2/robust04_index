			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bear Stearns follows industry trend BEAR Stearns, the Wall Street broking house, yesterday unveiled fiscal first-quarter earnings of Dollars 63m, substantially higher than a year ago but well below the extremely strong profits of the previous two quarters. At the same stage last year, the firm earned Dollars 47.1m. Bear Stearns' earnings repeated a pattern seen at most big Wall Street firms in the current reporting season, with strong trading and investment banking earnings offsetting weak brokerage business. Revenues from own-account trading jumped sharply, rising 41 per cent to Dollars 250.7m, due to favourable conditions in international financial markets. Investment banking revenues rose 15.3 per cent to Dollars 62.4m in the wake of a busy corporate securities underwriting calendar. Interest income, however, was sharply lower at Dollars 204.5m in the wake of further declines in domestic interest rates, and broking commissions were virtually flat at Dollars 84.9m following reduced investor activity in the stock markets over the summer. Total corporate expenses rose 20 per cent between July and September to Dollars 330.5m, primarily due to a big increase in employee pay and benefits linked to market performance and profitability. During the quarter the company bought 1.6m shares of its common stock, worth about Dollars 25m, for a deferred compensation plan for senior managing directors.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Railtrack snubs transport union peace proposals The RMT transport union's leaders disclosed peace proposals yesterday to resolve the nine-week long rail signal workers dispute, but these were described as 'a step backwards' by Railtrack. Although talks were taking place between the two sides through the conciliation service Acas last night, the prospect of preventing three days of rail disruption around the weekend looked increasingly remote. The strike is due to start at midnight tonight and last all day Friday, with a further 48 hour stoppage on Monday and Tuesday. More stoppages are expected to be announced shortly by the RMT. Last night, Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said Railtrack's initial response to his 'constructive suggestions' had been 'far from enthusiastic'. He added: 'I believe Railtrack's objective is to break the strike rather than settle it by negotiation.' The union yesterday released the details of its proposals for a possible deal it claimed it put to Acas on Tuesday. However, Railtrack - the state-owned company that runs the rail network - denied it had seen them and expressed disappointment that they had been released publicly. The union claims that a settlement of the conflict could be found 'without the company having to concede a politically sensitive headline figure'. Four possible ways out were suggested by the union. Three would involve interim increases of 4.6 per cent - this would include a consolidation of half a 6 per cent unconsolidated supplement in addition to Railtrack's last 3.6 per cent offer. In addition Railtrack would be asked to concede either a one hour cut in the 39-hour week or a continuing index-linked payment that would not go into the basic rate, or an improvement in overtime and shift payments. A further option, the RMT suggested, would mean incorporating money put aside to compensate 'losers from restructuring into the basic rate'. Railtrack said the plan would 'indicate the union is asking for more money' with rises of 2 to 3 per cent on top of 4.6 per cent. The union added that if the employer agreed to make this offer it would start 'intensive talks' with Railtrack on the entire restructuring and productivity package next Monday. The aim of the negotiations would be to reach a deal well before the end of next month, with a final package being put to the signal workers in a ballot. 'These discussions would see negotiations on all aspects with a firm commitment to Railtrack's salaried status and a simpli-fied grade structure,' said the union. 'We are trying to blow a flicker of hope into a flame,' said Mr Knapp. 'We are being as flexible as we can be around our claim.' The RMT said that while it was 'willing to negotiate on the signalling staff claim and on restructuring', the company seemed only prepared to negotiate on restructuring. Mr Vernon Hince, the RMT's assistant general secretary and chief negotiator, said that Railtrack was 'not serious' about resolving the dispute. Strike details, Page 6</p>

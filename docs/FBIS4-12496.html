			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, 9 April, IRNA -- The Iranian Embassy in  Paris has denied allegations that Iran ever provided any arms to  the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) of Algeria.    In a statement issued on Friday, the Iranian embassy denied  claims raised by the French daily `LE FIGARO' on Iran's possible  involvement in arms supply to FIS.    According to official reports released here an Israeli-made  assault rifle has been found in the house of an Algerian  national in Paris which was searched by the French police.    In the past, certain segments of western mass media have  tried to justify the West's support for the military-installed  government in Algeria by accusing foreign countries of  involvement in the Islamic movement of the Algerian people.</p>

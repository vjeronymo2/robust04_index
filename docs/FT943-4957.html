			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Abbey National launches L250bn three-year deal The eurobond market saw few new issues yesterday with the US, Canada and Luxembourg closed for holidays. However, issuance is expected to pick up over the next few days with both Pearson and the City of Yokohama expected to launch offerings. Pearson, the media and entertainment group which owns the Financial Times, is expected to come to the euro-sterling market with a 10-year offering, which syndicate managers expect to amount to about Pounds 100m. The City of Yokohama is also rumoured to be considering a 10-year fixed-rate eurodollar offering of around Dollars 300m, lead-managed by Bank of Tokyo Capital Markets. Abbey National Treasury Services launched a L250bn offering of three-year bonds with a coupon of 11.5 per cent, lead-managed by Swiss Bank Corporation. Syndicate managers said that the bonds were fairly priced, although they said that they were surprised by the relatively large size of the issue, especially with the Luxembourg market closed. Many recent eurolira issues have been placed with Luxembourg investors. 'There is much debate about whether the lira market is saturated, especially in the three-year area, but we are seeing no evidence of that,' said one syndicate manager. Compagnie Ge'ne'rale des Eaux tapped the D-Mark sector with a DM300m offering of five-year bonds priced to yield 45 basis points over the five-year 6 1/4 per cent German government bond. Around one-quarter of the bonds were placed with French institutions and a large part of the remainder will be targeted at retail investors in Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg, according to the lead manager Credit Commercial de France. The D-Mark market currently offers favourable swap opportunities, particularly in the four- to five-year area, syndicate managers said. The proceeds from the offering were believed to have been swapped back into French francs. The market also digested the announcement on Friday by the World Bank that it plans to launch a global fixed-rate dollar bond issue later this month, expected to be about Dollars 1.5bn. The timing of the launch and the maturity of the issue would be determined in light of market circumstances in the coming weeks, the World Bank said. The market expects the offering to have a life of five or 10 years. The deal will be lead-managed by Lehman Brothers and UBS. 'There is a continuing demand for high quality dollar paper, which this certainly is, and we expect this deal to go well,' said one syndicate manager. Previous recent global offerings have struggled to find buyers outside the US. 'It will be interesting to see how much is placed outside the US, whether there is now a broader interest, particular from Asian investors, in the dollar bonds,' said one syndicate manager. Telekom Malaysia is rumoured to be assessing demand for a Dollars 300m to Dollars 500m 10-year convertible eurobond offering. The issue will be the first by a Malaysian company which is rated by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service.</p>

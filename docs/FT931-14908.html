			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Cray Electronics leap to Pounds 18m CRAY Electronics Holdings, the Berkshire-based high technology group which acquired the Dowty information technology division from TI for Pounds 50m in July, yesterday reported sharply higher turnover and profits for the first-half and resumed payment of an interim dividend. Operating profits in the six months to October 31 more than doubled to Pounds 5.71m, against Pounds 2.77m last time. The latest figure included Pounds 1.12m attributed to acquisitions and Pounds 787,000 (Pounds 982,000) from discontinued operations. Turnover increased to Pounds 81.9m (Pounds 40m), including Pounds 8.91m (Pounds 6.93m) from discontinued operations. Pre-tax profits, including a Pounds 13m profit on disposals and after Pounds 899,000 in net interest payments, jumped to Pounds 17.8m from Pounds 536,000 last time when profits were reduced by Pounds 1.14m in abortive bid costs and Pounds 1.51m of net interest payments partly offset by a Pounds 410,000 profit on disposals. Earnings per share came out at 10.33p (0.47p) and an interim dividend of 0.5p is declared. Sir Peter Michael, chairman, said Cray's outlook had been 'transformed' by the acquisition of Dowty IT and its subsequent merger with the original Craycom business to form the new core Cray communications division comprising four companies based in the UK, US, Denmark and Australia. He said the results confirmed both the growth achieved by the original Cray companies and the non-dilutive effect of the Dowty IT acquisition. At the end of October, having paid for the Dowty IT acquisition mainly through a Pounds 41.1m rights issue, the group's total debt was about Pounds 7.4m. Since then the group has sold two non-core busi-nesses and has eliminated all debt. COMMENT The Dowty IT acquisition was a big lump to swallow, but appears to have been well digested and integrated into the new communications division. The Dowty businesses generated about Pounds 30m of the first-half revenues and about Pounds 1.1m of profits. Although margins in the new businesses were slim at 3.7 per cent, the full effect of cost cutting has yet to come through. With pre-tax profits projected at between Pounds 15m and Pounds 17m this year, producing earnings of 6.4p a share, the stock is currently trading on a lofty prospective p/e of 20.9, although this drops to about 16 based on next years' prospective earnings. Against this Cray is operating in an increasingly competitive international market, its share price has risen sharply recently and already commands a premium. Hold.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Arts: Opera's daring annus mirabilis / A look back at a year of adventurous productions The operatic talking point of 1992 was, strictly speaking, a non-artistic one: the prominence given to the Royal Opera House and its general director, Jeremy Isaacs, in a run of sensationalised media stories in the middle of the year. These were variants on the theme of 'Opera House deficit scandal: Isaacs blamed for chaos', which had been developed on the basis of leaks of supposed excerpts from the Arts Council report into the house, chaired by Baroness Warnock. Who did the leaking has never been established. The excerpts came wrapped in unattributed comment and fake-impartial tones of delivery. Their purpose seemed designed to stir public outcry prior to the Covent Garden board's re-examination of Mr Isaacs's contract. (In the end, he got it renewed until 1995.) At one point, indeed, it was 'widely rumoured that David Mellor is looking round for a replacement', according to a Times Diary item; that it was not his job to do so left the rumour-mongers unruffled. All of this unfolded during the summer of David Mellor's brief occupancy of the heritage ministry. His eventual resignation, on September 24, was of course one of the bigger national news items of the year, and its effects and implications were felt far more widely than in the opera world alone. Mellor constantly denied that he was in any way responsible for the Isaacs-destabilisation campaign. It does seem, then, an extraordinary coincidence that since his departure a blanket of silence should have descended so completely on the whole subject. (In the event, what little of the report was eventually disclosed offered no opinion of Isaacs's managerial skills; its main criticisms - ridiculously short-sighted, in my view - were directed at the ROH redevelopment scheme.) To Royal Opera House-watchers the irony in all this was that a distasteful brouhaha should have been stirred up in the year that was, by general consent, artistically the most rewarding for a very long time. Of the eight new productions already unveiled (I write prior to the opening night of the ninth, Alcina), only one elicited a wide range of critical catcalls. This was the house's tribute to the Rossini bicentenary in the form of a hideously over-designed, feebly farcical, vocally underpowered Viaggio a Reims. But it is worth recalling the others, not only for the happy memories they summon but because they added up to so richly varied and balanced a repertory. For me the peak of excitement was reached by the first house production of Prokofiev's Fiery Angel, an uneven opera made enthralling by Edward Downes's lucidly controlled conducting, the singing of the Russians Galina Gorchakova (a young soprano of thrilling potential) and Sergey Leiferkus, and the 'nave' theatrical vision of the producer, David Freeman, in which weird, beautiful flesh was given to the demons haunting the opera. But the triumphant London re-creation of Glyndebourne's epoch-making 1986 Porgy and Bess, with Andrew Litton its inspired conductor, came near it. So did Death in Venice in Colin Graham's shimmering, liquidly unfolded staging, with Philip Langridge its masterly Aschenbach. The manifold musical pleasures of a Bellini Puritani sung with beauty of tone and style and potent dramatic feeling by June Anderson and Giuseppe Sabbatini were complemented by a handsome, intelligent production. Don Giovanni, with Thomas Allen at the head of a uniformly fine cast, was given a dark, complex, violent-spirited reading by Johannes Schaaf that argued its case with impressive clarity. Bernard Haitink's rapturously warm, unforced conducting of Die Frau ohne Schatten and Anna Tomova-Sintov's noble, heartfelt Empress were the notable features of the colourful but somewhat limited Cox-Hockney production. In a Flying Dutchman (staged by Ian Judge) more notable for splashy stage effects than deep re-examination of Wagner's themes and characters, overall standards were high, and there was the inestimable bonus of Julia Varady's gloriously impulsive, vocally italianate Senta. The improvement of the chorus continued apace. On the whole, revivals were carefully considered. The return of the 1990 Guillaume Tell, enriched with previously missing authority, gave this Rossini appassionato particular satisfaction; the polished bel canto of Alfredo Kraus and Sumi Jo in L'elisir d'amore afforded a collector's item; and while I found the ballyhooed Otello - it marked Georg Solti's 80th birthday, brought back Placido Domingo and Kiri Te Kanawa, and featured Leiferkus's first Iago - coolly calculated and unmoving, it was plainly the product of a front-rank opera-theatre. A further irony of this splendid year is that it directly bears out one of the subsidiary Warnock criticisms: that the company has been favouring artistic adventurousness over economically prudent planning (which would give us Carmen, Boheme, Tosca and Barber wall to wall). In the words of the November editorial of Opera magazine, 'In effect the ROH is being castigated for doing its job - staging world-class performances of opera and dance - in open defiance of an Arts Council that is plainly not doing its job ie funding it.' But with the Royal Opera now committed to putting into practice several of Warnock's recommendations; with one cancellation - La Juive - already announced and perhaps others to follow; and with the Arts Council's 2.5 per cent rise in funding allocation just settled, there is every depressing chance that 1992 will have been the last such annus mirabilis of Royal Opera achievement for some while to come. The big news from the English National Opera this year was that the government produced Pounds 12.8m to enable the company to buy the Coliseum from Stoll Moss. Security of tenure is undoubtedly a boon. I trust it will enable the new team poised to succeed Messrs Jonas, Elder and Pountney at the end of the 1992-93 season to take a long view of planning - opera invariably suffers from its lack. I am not sure whether it was this, or the need for programming caution after the bold, risky 1990-91 season of 20th-century opera, that seemed to leave in its wake great tranches of 'safe' Mikado, Rigoletto and Magic Flute revivals; but 1992 felt like a year of ENO batteries running down. There were fewer new productions than in the past; their choice may have been imaginative - Humperdinck's Konigskinder (an underrated, beautiful late-Romantic fairy-tale which I particularly welcomed), Don Carlos, The Force of Destiny, Princess Ida, and Janacek's Broucek - but all were to a greater or lesser extent flawed by their production conceits or execution. In the matter of Ken Russell's grotesquely vulgar, wretchedly incompetent account of the Gilbert and Sullivan, the phrase 'greater extent' counts as the most timorous of understatements. Nicholas Hytner's eagerly awaited return to the house with The Force of Destiny elicited a curiously muted Verdi encounter: fine performances from Josephine Barstow and Jonathan Summers, serious Verdi conducting from Elder, excessive reliance on the stage revolve. From the evidence of Pountney's Konigskinder, Don Carlos and Broucek stagings, all replete with 'house mannerisms', I suspect that he has reached something of an artistic watershed, and that his forthcoming departure from Coliseum management will occur not a moment too soon in his own artistic development. The world premiere of John Buller's Bakxai - musically fascinating, dramatically inert - was a duty conscientiously discharged. In the end it was left to the vital, purposeful revivals of Xerxes (pure Hytner delight), Street Scene, the Monteverdi Orfeo and Wozzeck to remind us of ENO's past form when operating on full engine-power. Opera North's choice of repertory seemed to me an ideal mixture of adventure and intelligent renewal: Schreker's Ferne Klang, The Thieving Magpie (apart from the London Tell, the only really worthwhile Rossini centenary tribute in all our opera theatres), a Boris Godunov revival, the first British staging of Gerhard's 1949 Duenna (which followed hard on the first-ever staging, in Madrid), Orpheus in the Underworld, Billy Budd. The success rate varied, but the excitement of visiting this admirable company was never seriously confounded; and, in the case of the shattering Budd, reality far surpassed expectation. Welsh National Opera put on what many people seem to consider the operatic highlight of the year: the Pelleas collaboration between Pierre Boulez and Peter Stein. On this page Andrew Clements pronounced the Cardiff opening a 'landmark'; I had the misfortune to hit upon a later performance dogged by technical mishap; but over Boulez's Debussy conducting there could be no grounds for dispute: it was magnificent tout court. WNO's Elektra, in a David Alden production that with its panoply of stale surrealist gestures looked like a David Alden parody, had the benefit of Felicity Palmer's star-quality Clytemnestra; Gluck's Iphigenie en Tauride was also done in a modish, arty way but with intensity, urgency and commitment. Scottish Opera dipped a toe into the waters of modern-production-with-a-vengeance with a Handel Julius Caesar styled (and musically re-written) after the model of Viz comics. I thought it beneath contempt. In general, hopes for a revival of this company's artistic fortunes were greatly increased by the appointment of Richard Armstrong to succeed John Mauceri as music director. If anyone still needed evidence of Armstrong's mature mastery, the spellbinding Edinburgh Festival concert performance of Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron came usefully to hand. In the domain of new opera it was not a significant year for Britain. Bakxai apart, the most notable premiere was the Women's Theatre Trust staging of Nicola Lefanu's Blood Wedding - notable, that is, for the startling disproportion between staging (classy) and work itself (thin gruel). I went to Chicago for Bolcom's McTeague, a mixture of 'modern' and 'popular' idioms imperfectly coalesced but with beguiling moments; and to Los Angeles, where the Finnish National Opera gave the premiere of Aulis Sallinen's fourth opera Kullervo. My admiration for this composer's theatrical vision, unremittingly stark yet 'approachable', was not unanimously shared; but for the great Finnish baritone Jorma Hynninen in the title role, superlatives were unleashed on every side. When - we ask again - is he to receive an invitation from Covent Garden? The last word must go to Glyndebourne. This was its final season in the 'old house'; already during the festival a huge excavation was visible where the walled garden used to be. This year there is no festival; the year after, there is the promise of a new theatre larger than the old (but not un-intimately so), and with warmer acoustics and greater audience comfort as its goals. The final summer series before the break was one of tremendous achievement. Revivals of Cos fan tutte, Jenufa (altogether triumphant) and Death in Venice offered examples of the Glyndebourne 'work ethic' at its most elevated. The new Peter Grimes, conducted by Andrew Davis and produced by Trevor Nunn in carefully researched naturalistic vein, may not have pulled its component parts exactly into balance - and those Suffolk accents were definitely an error of judgment - but there were many musical and dramatic illuminations to compensate. The new Queen of Spades, conducted by Davis and produced by Graham Vick, was a revelation. It was at once contemporary in dramatic idiom and capable of richly affectionate spectacle, turbulent and colourful; and it was sung - by, among others, Nancy Gustafson, Felicity Palmer, Sergey Leiferkus, Dmitry Kharitonov, and the alarmingly unsparing Yury Maruzin as Hermann - with a truly Tchaikovskyan blend of poetry and passion. It formed one of the peaks of Glyndebourne achievement, and an inspired climax to one of the most impressive festivals in Glyndebourne history. If I had a prize to award for 'event of the year', this Queen of Spades would unquestionably be its recipient.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Fall in unemployment fails to clarify trend THE SMALL fall in the jobless total last month did little to remove confusion about the trend in unemployment. Although a third consecutive monthly decline makes the falls in February and March look less like 'freak' figures, other data released yesterday was not so encouraging, including a month-on-month fall in unfilled vacancies. The government denied Labour party accusations that the figures were 'fiddled'. Mr Peter Stibbard, director of statistics at the Department of Employment, said: 'I have been assured by Mr Mike Fogden, chief executive of the Employment Service, that there has been no significant change in the way the administrative rules have been applied in recent months. They have been applied in the same way as in the second half of last year when the figures were rising fast.' Many analysts, however, continued to express doubts about the trend in unemployment and said they expected to see the jobless total rise again in the months ahead. The employment department said that although the April fall had taken the jobless total to its lowest level for five months, 'it was not easy to detect a consistent trend yet'. Unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres fell a seasonally adjusted 1,600 last month to 124,600. Falls in such vacancies, which account for about a third of all vacancies, tend to precede rises in unemployment. More encouragingly, they rose on average by 6,600 in the three months to April and were up by 15,800 compared with a year ago. Overtime hours worked in manufacturing industry were 9.11m per week in March, a decrease of 0.07m hours per week since February. Manufacturing employment, however, rose in March and also rose in January and February following substantial revisions to the figures. It increased by 5,000 in March to 4.2m, for the third consecutive monthly rise. In the regions the biggest falls in unemployment were in the south-east, the south-west, the east Midlands and Northern Ireland. The most substantial rises were in London, the north and the north-west. The unadjusted count of people out of work and claiming benefit increased by 3,786 to push the figure back over the 3m mark. The new total of 3,000,511 represents 10.7 per cent of the workforce. The seasonally adjusted rate of unemployment was unchanged at 10.5 per cent. More people joined the dole queue in April than in March, but the monthly unadjusted inflow of 364,800 was 1,600 fewer than a year ago. Outflows were 25,700 higher than in April a year ago. The average monthly rate of increase in unemployment has eased considerably. In the six months to April, a better guide to underlying trends, the average increase was 11,900 compared with 29,700 in the previous six months.</p>

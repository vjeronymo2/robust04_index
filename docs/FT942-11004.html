			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: Generali confounds rights issue speculation Generali, Italy's biggest insurance group, yesterday announced an 8 per cent increase in parent company profits, to L420bn (Dollars 262m) for 1993 compared with the previous year. However, it confounded speculation that an important strategic announcement would be made. Following a board meeting, the company proposed a L10 increase in the dividend, to L360 per share. However, instead of launching a rights issue - as many commentators had predicted - Generali announced a bonus issue of shares. The issue will be made on a one-for-10 basis. Generali's stock rose by nearly 4 per cent yesterday, as speculation continued about the possibility that it would buy Victoire, the French insurer which has been put up for sale by its owner Suez, the French holding company. Victoire is valued at FFr15bn (Dollars 2.6bn), and an announcement about the successful bidder is expected soon. The Italian company is also said to be interested in taking part in an Austrian-led consortium to take a minority stake in Creditanstalt Bankverein, Austria's second-biggest bank. Last year, the Generali parent company increased gross premium income from L8,804bn to L9,776bn. Life insurance premiums rose 12.8 per cent to L3,850bn, a 9.3 per cent increase if exchange-rate fluctuations are ironed out. Non-life premiums totalled L5,926bn, up 9.9 per cent, or 4.7 per cent if adjusted. The company also enjoyed a strong rise in net income from investments, from L2,121bn to L2,482bn. The consolidated group results should be announced on May 27, but Generali said yesterday gross premium income at group level would reach some L25,000bn, against L22,423bn in 1992. Toro Assicurazioni, the insurer which is part of the Fiat group, reported that net profits increased to L153.2bn in 1993, up 10.1 per cent on 1992.</p>

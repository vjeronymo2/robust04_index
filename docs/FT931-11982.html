			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Goodhead shares fall as profits dive 58% SHARES in Goodhead fell 6p to 27p yesterday as the printing, paper publishing and marketing services group announced a 58 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits after exceptional charges of Pounds 133,000. In the half-year to November 30 1992, profits stood at Pounds 181,000 against Pounds 429,000, on lower turnover of Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 22.2m). The interim dividend is again passed; there was a final of 0.5p last time. Mr Colin Rosser, chief executive, said consistent results from the print and paper division, and its publishing side, were offset by a sharp decline at the marketing services business which struggled to break even. Interest charges fell to Pounds 611,000 (Pounds 706,000) on largely unchanged borrowings of about Pounds 10m. Below the line the group absorbed extraordinary provisions of Pounds 3.73m associated with the sale of its loss-making Review Group subsidiary and related properties. That left a loss attributable to shareholders of Pounds 3.64m (profit Pounds 220,000). Losses per share were 0.2p compared with earnings of 0.6p. Mr Rosser said the group was committed to concentrating on its core printing and publishing businesses and pulling out of marketing services, which might be accomplished by the year-end. It was evaluating the future of its profitable Canadian publishing operation.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> MOTHER GETS LIFE IN RAPE-DRUG DEAL  </P> <P> A woman was sentenced to life in prison today for giving her daughter to a  rapist in exchange for drugs.  </P> <P> Wayne County Circuit Court Judge James J. Rashid told Susan Barbier, 29, that  she had "sunk to an intolerable level of humanity" in the May, 1988, incident,  for which she was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.  </P> <P> Rashid exceeded the sentencing guidelines, which called for 10 to 25 years in  prison, saying Barbier has "very little, if any at all, potential for  reformation."  </P> <P> Barbier gave her 13-year-old daughter over to Anthony Sawyer, who raped the  girl, then left the child alone while she went to get high with Sawyer, police  and court records showed.  </P> <P> Sawyer, who had two previous rape convictions, was sentenced last week to 40 to  60 years in prison for raping Barbier's daughter.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AQMD ENFORCEMENT ACTION  </P> <P> The article "Parts Plant Accused of Pollution" by Amy Pyle (Jan. 26) was not  especially clear, concise or fair about the facts surrounding this story. This  situation has existed for more than a year and has just kept getting  progressively worse.  </P> <P> Our mobile-home park has been at this location for more than 40 years, long  before any other businesses moved into this neighborhood. Being a resident of  the mobile-home park she spoke of, I believe that I am in a position to know  that she left out some very important details about this story. I don't feel  that a "good neighbor," which the Coastcast company is reporting itself to be,  would threaten to have someone arrested for trespassing after my complaint  about the toxic odors, and further saying that there was nothing residents  could do to change their manufacturing practices.  </P> <P> The story quoted from an AQMD list of materials that could have contributed to  the pollution the residents complained about. Unfortunately, it was superficial  and incomplete, so medical problems directly resulting from the pollution  cannot be resolved.  </P> <P> I get the impression from the story that there should be a happy ending, but it  appears that this won't happen.  </P> <P> DIANE HAGGART  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

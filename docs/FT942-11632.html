			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Strengthening D-Mark rattles the Bundesbank 'Too strong an appreciation of the D-Mark, against the dollar, for example, is not in the interests of our economy.' This one sentence from a speech due to be delivered at lunchtime by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, released early yesterday, provided the first hint of the concerted international intervention in support of the US currency which was to follow. It was not until late afternoon that the usually taciturn German central bank confirmed widespread rumours that it had been in the market. The full speech failed to enlarge significantly on the key sentence, but in a characteristically roundabout way, it left no doubt that Mr Tietmeyer was unsettled by recent developments. The D-Mark was rated 'stronger rather than weaker,' Mr Tietmeyer said. Faith in its stability remained intact, as recent volatilities connected with the reversal of US interest rate trends had shown. But as he tried to say in his keynote sentence, the German economic recovery - dependent on improving exports - could be endangered if revaluation cost the domestic industry competitiveness in terms of price. The quotation had an immediate beneficial impact on the dollar, which was later enhanced by an intervention from Mr Hans-Jurgen Koebnik, a more junior member of the Bundesbank's decision-making council. Mr Koebnik markedly reinforced expectations of further cuts in the Bundesbank's 5 per cent discount lending rate, in an apparent attempt to lessen the downward pressure on the dollar. All economic indicators, with the exception of the eccentric M3 measure of money supply growth, spoke in favour of a clear reduction 'before too long,' he said. By 'clear,' he clarified later, he meant at least half a percentage point. As to timing, he suggested before the end of June. Although he stressed that this was his personal view, he said he wished that the last discount cut - a quarter-point on April 15 - had been bigger. Mr Tietmeyer was, as usual, no more than vaguely encouraging. He was still worried about the extraordinary growth in M3, which is ballooning at around 2.5 times the bank's targeted annual expansion rate. Because M3 growth is regarded as an early warning system for potential inflation, the bank had to tread warily. Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist and a member of its permanent directorate, was in little doubt where most of the blame lay. In a speech last night in Frankfurt, he blamed free-spending federal and local governments and national institutions. Their aggregate borrowings last year almost doubled to DM130bn, he noted. M3's recent behaviour 'can be traced to reasons which have little or nothing to do with monetary policy,' he said. He echoed another passage from Mr Tietmeyer's speech in which the government was told that spending cuts, now being introduced, had to be continued for several years. The implication was that it was Bonn rather than the Bundesbank which was to blame for the slowness of interest rate cuts.</p>

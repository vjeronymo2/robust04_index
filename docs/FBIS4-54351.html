			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  hinted at legislation Thursday [26 May] to prepare for possible  United Nations sanctions against North Korea in connection with  Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons development.    "Japan would, as a matter of course, do what it can in  response to (UN) sanctions if there is anything it cannot do  because of lack of legislation," Hata said in answering  questions before the House of Representatives Budget Committee.    The remarks referred to the possibility of emergency  legislation to enable Japan to participate in possible sanctions  against Pyongyang, which are likely to include blocking of sea  routes.    Hata ruled out the possibility that Tokyo may resort to  force, saying Japan will act within the framework of its  war-renouncing constitution in a case of collective security  under the UN banner.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told the same Diet committee  session that it is impossible to give a wholesale answer on how  Japan would deal with a collective security case, saying a  variety of situations could arise, such as calls for Japan to  join UN peacekeeping operations or future UN forces.</p>

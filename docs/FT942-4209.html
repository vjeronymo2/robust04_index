			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Pricing of Ontario's Dollars 1bn global offering pays off The Province of Ontario's decision to play safe on the pricing of its first dollar global offering of the new fiscal year paid off yesterday when the Dollars 1bn issue of 10-year bonds was priced at the lower end of the indicated range. When the bonds were freed to trade, the yield spread tightened in further to 65 basis points over US Treasuries from the launch spread of 67 basis points. 'There is a fine line between getting no response from investors and an overwhelming response, which makes this market difficult to call,' said joint bookrunner Goldman Sachs. Goldman added that the global bond structure also helped to arouse interest in the offering. Nevertheless, the bulk of the bonds - around 60 per cent - was from the US while European investors took up 30 per cent. The remainder went to the Far East. A similar demand split was detected for the CDollars 1bn five-year global offering from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp, the housing agency. The bonds were priced to yield 16 basis points over Canadian treasuries and when they were freed to trade the spread remained unchanged. Signs that investors were coming out of the woodwork prompted further dollar-denominated issuance. Syndicate managers said the European Investment Bank's Dollars 500m five-year offering was in reasonable shape despite the typically aggressive pricing of 10 basis basis points over Treasuries. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened only marginally to 12 basis points. By contrast, the pricing on Unilever's Dollars 250m offering of 10-year eurobonds was thought to be overly generous at 28 basis points over Treasuries considering its triple-A rating and its wide following among investors. Joint lead manager JP Morgan, which had sold out of bonds by early afternoon, said the pricing reflected the widespread view that the market was still tender, especially at the longer end. Elsewhere, Eurofima and Sweden took advantage of arbitrage opportunities in the euro-guilder sector to achieve enviable funding levels. ABN Amro, which arranged both deals, noted that Sweden's Fl 250m five-year offering of floating-rate notes represented the first such offering in the guilder sector for two years. In the international equities arena, the Dollars 100m issue of global depositary receipts (GDRs) by Grasim Industries, one of India's leading industrial companies, was priced at Dollars 20.50 per GDR, lead manager BZW said. BZW is in the process of launching a Dollars 70m offering of GDRs for Hocheng, Taiwan's leading toilet manufacturer. The UK's Co-Operative Bank has set up a Pounds 400m euro MTN programme under which it can issue ordinary and subordinated notes denominated in any currency.</p>

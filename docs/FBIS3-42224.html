			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Spelling of all Iranian names as received] </F>   [Text] Tehran, Jan 31 (AFP) -- The murder of an Iranian  pastor, Hayk Hovsepian, whose body was recovered recently, was  connected with the religious activities of the small Protestant  sect he led, Hovsepian's relatives told AFP Monday [31 January].    One member of the victim's family, requesting anonymity,  said  the leader of the "Assembly of God" had felt he was "in danger  since he brought to the world's attention in January the case of  fellow Assembly of God pastor Mehdi Dibaj, originally a Moslem,  who was sentenced to death for having converted."    Hovsepian disappeared on January 19 while he was travelling  by car to Tehran airport.    Police photographs of his body, shown to the family,  indicated wounds to the abdomen and chest.    The body was found the following day in a street in the  Eslamabad area, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) west of Tehran.    However, the family said they were not informed of  Hovsepian's death until Sunday, and they were unable to see the  body, because it was buried unusually quickly at Tehran's huge  Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery.    On Monday they were granted permission to bury the body with  a religious ceremony at a Protestant cemetery.    No official account was given to the family about the  circumstances of Hovsepian's death, the authorities saying  simply that an investigation was in progress.    Another relative who requested anonymity said Hovsepian "had  no enemies -- the only problem was that he led the Assembly of  God."    "Our church is very active in trying to spread the message  of  the Bible, and the government asked us to stop propagating our  religion," the relative said, adding that the authorities  recently closed several of the Protestant sect's places of  worship, after it refused to stop spreading the faith.    The sect says it has some 3,000 members in Iran.    Several of its members told AFP that the Assembly of God  followers had been subjected to "pressure and intimidation" from  the authorities throughout Iran in recent months.    Relatives said Hovsepian's death was connected with his  campaign to alert the world community to the case of Mehdi  Dibaj, detained for nine years and recently sentenced to death,  according to the Assembly of God, for having converted to  Christianity.    Dibaj was freed on bail on January 15 following  international  pressure, particularly from the Vatican and other European  countries, including France.    The Iranian authorities denied that Dibaj had been sentenced  to death, and said he was simply accused of "offences against  the Moslem Prophet (Muhammad) and Imam (Ayatollah) Khomeyni,"  founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs urge move on Maxwell funds MPS FROM both sides of the House of Commons last night urged the government to ensure that leading City institutions which undertook commissions for the late Robert Maxwell contributed to the restoration of the pension funds he plundered. Mr Frank Field (Lab Birkenhead), chairman of the Commons social security committee, suggested appropriate sums paid on a voluntary basis might enable some 'grand City institutions' to avoid having their reputations fatally flawed in legal pro-ceedings. He was strongly supported by Mr David Shaw (C Dover), another member of the committee, who envisaged the largest contribution being in the region of Pounds 100m. Mr Shaw argued that directors and other individuals associated with Maxwell companies who had been paid large sums to remain silent should be asked for smaller contributions of around Pounds 50,000. He was particularly critical of the investment bank Goldman Sachs, claiming that the company must have known that Maxwell was a desperate man involved in strange deals. Both Mr Field and Mr Shaw praised the government for the action it had taken to mitigate the hardship suffered by the members of Maxwell pension funds but insisted that tax-payers should not be asked to shoulder the burden of restitution.</p>

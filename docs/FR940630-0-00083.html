			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> A. Clarification and Update to Preamble Explanation of Copper MCLG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The preamble to the final lead/copper NPDWR in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contained EPA's rationale for setting the Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) for copper at 1.3 milligrams per liter (mg/L). In referencing the medical and epidemiological literature regarding health risks posed by copper, EPA provided an incomplete discussion that is corrected.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> On 56 FR 26471, it is stated that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``This MCLG of 1.3 mg/L is based on a Lowest Observed Adverse Health Effect Level (LOAEL) of 5.3 mg/day from human clinical case studies in which 5.3 mg was the lowest acute oral dose at which gastrointestinal effects were seen (Chuttani et al., 1965).''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Chuttani et al. described the clinical course and treatment of patients who were hospitalized after suicidal ingestion of large quantities of copper sulfate (>250 mg). In fact, the 5.3 mg/day LOAEL was derived in EPA's Drinking Water Criteria Document for copper (EPA, 1987; p.VIII&hyph;10) from analysis of a number of studies, briefly summarized here, in which individuals developed gastrointestinal illnesses after ingesting much lower levels of copper than in the Chuttani et al. study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wyllie (1957) treated nurses for acute effects of copper poisoning (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting) caused by the dissolution of copper contained in a cocktail shaker. Analysis of cocktail fluid prepared in the shaker allowed an estimate of the amounts of copper ingested (5.3&hyph;32 mg copper; EPA, 1987, p. VI&hyph;6). The following day, 10 of the 15 nurses were still too ill to resume their duties and suffered from weakness, abdominal cramps, dizziness, and headaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similar findings cited in the Criteria Document were reported among British workers who experienced nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting after ingesting single dosages of approximately 7&hyph;10 mg copper in their tea (EPA, 1987, p. VIII&hyph;9; Semple et al., 1960; Nicholas and Brist, 1968).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spitalny et al. (1984) reported that one adult and two children, ages 5 and 7, of a Vermont family had recurrent episodes of vomiting and gastrointestinal pain after drinking water in a newly built home which contained 2.8 to 8 mg/L copper. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control reported 112 cases of copper intoxication between 1977 and 1982. The majority of cases involved leaching of copper into drinking water from plumbing with reported copper levels ranging from 4.0&hyph;70 mg/L (CDC, 1977&hyph;1982; EPA, 1987, p. VIII&hyph;8).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several other epidemiological and controlled exposure studies, cited in the 1987 Criteria Document, have found acute copper intoxication associated with higher exposure levels among a wide variety of populations. Based on a review of human and animal toxicity, including the studies summarized above, the Criteria Document concluded (p. VIII&hyph;15):  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> ``A level of 1.3 mg/L is recommended to be the basis for the drinking water standard for the following reasons: 1) this level would satisfy the nutritional requirements for copper: the National Academy of Sciences (NAS, 1980) estimated that ``an adequate and safe'' intake of 2&hyph;3 mg copper in a 70 kg adult and 1.5&hyph;2.5 mg/day for children will satisfy nutritional requirements and be protective of human health; and 2) assuming consumption of 2 L of water per day, 1.3 mg/L copper in the drinking water would result in a daily intake of less than the lowest levels that were seen to result in gastrointestinal effects in humans (5.3 mg/day, 3&hyph;8 mg/L). This value would thus be protective against acute toxic effects in humans. This value is not protective against copper toxicity in sensitive members of the population, such as those rare individuals with Wilson's disease. These individuals would have to further limit their intake of copper from all sources.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B.

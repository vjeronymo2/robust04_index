			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Stay in the ERM vice THE BUNDESBANK appears to have achieved the seemingly impossible. By raising the largely symbolic discount rate by three quarters of a percentage point, it has sent an emphatic signal of anti-inflationary resolve, but without forcing up European interest rates. Yet Europe's finance ministers should allow themselves only shallow sighs of relief. The Bundesbank intends to rein in German credit growth, and further monetary tightening may yet be necessary. The Bundesbank remains beyond reproach. A 4 per cent inflation rate is intolerably high for an institution committed to price stability. By leaving money market rates unchanged, and instead biting into the profit margins of Germany's banks, it is attempting to slow the pace of bank lending at the minimum cost to its partners in the European exchange rate mechanism. Yet the Bundesbank council has also staked its anti-inflationary credibility on hitting the reconfirmed broad money target range before the year-end. This will be almost impossible; and the gap between the Lombard rate ceiling and discount rate floor is now so narrow that a rise in the Lombard rate may soon be necessary. The prospect of lower European interest rates this year thus looks increasingly remote, while the possibility of higher rates remains. Economic growth outside Germany may be slow, and unemployment rising fast, but monetary policy looks set to remain punishingly tight well into 1993. Nor are there any easy solutions. No ERM member has managed to maintain lower rates than Germany for any significant period of time, and no country appears willing to try; while a unilateral devaluation would deliver nothing but lost credibility and higher rates. Equal partner A general realignment, which revalued the D-Mark, offers a theoretically more attractive, but politically impossible, alternative. France must join any realignment that is to deserve this label. But economically, France has no compelling need to do so, and politically it would involve both loss of face and a catastrophic weakening of France's desire to be an equal partner with Germany in shaping the future of the European Community. Nor dare Italy consider talk of a devaluation, however necessary, until it has first put its fiscal house in order. Accordingly, it used yesterday's opportunity to raise its interest rates. Double defeat Any European country which wants to reduce interest rates below those of Germany can do so only outside the ERM. Those in Britain who would cut rates must acknowledge this inevitability. A case can be made for such a British exit. The UK is suffering a deeper and longer recession than any other developed country. An independent Bank of England could, at least in theory, do as good an anti-inflationary job. Yet for the current government to leave the ERM now would be to admit a double defeat. Entry to the ERM, in October 1990, signalled both a political desire to be at Europe's centre and an unrelated economic desire to secure low and stable inflation after the errors and convulsions of the 1980s. Neither task is complete. Europe's political future may be uncertain: the ERM might not survive a popular rejection of the Maastricht treaty at the forthcoming French referendum. But departure from the ERM now, during Britain's EC presidency and with the future of Maastricht so uncertain, would squander to no purpose the UK's position of growing influence in Europe's future. Nor has the government met its objective of low and stable inflation. Although the annual growth rate of average earnings has finally fallen below the 7 per cent barrier, it remains unsatisfactorily high. The government should ignore the siren voices within its ranks. Low inflation, regardless of the European political context, will remain this government's central objective. Only when inflation has fallen below 3 per cent, and unit labour cost growth below 2 per cent, will it have met this objective. For the present, the ERM provides the most credible means of achieving it. The government must press on until it has achieved the kind of inflation targets it would set an independent Bank of England. For now, there is no alternative.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEAVY SNOWFALL, COLD PLAGUING MUCH OF NATION  </P> <P> Up to 18 inches of snow fell Sunday over parts of the Northeast, and cold air  covered much of the nation east of the Rockies, with highs only in the teens  from Minnesota to northern New England.  </P> <P> A storm centered off Maine dumped heavy snow over much of the state, and high  wind in the wake of the storm produced squalls with heavy snow in the Great  Lakes region.  </P> <P> Southern and central Maine got 6 to 14 inches of snow from late Saturday into  Sunday, while snow squalls in the lower Great Lakes region buried parts of  western New York state, with 18 inches in the town of West Valley.  </P> <P> Up to 8 inches of snow blanketed Vermont from Saturday into Sunday, and totals  along the northern and western lake shores of Michigan ranged up to 13 inches.  In northern Indiana, up to 13 inches fell at Michiana, and up to a foot fell  along the Lake Erie shore in Ohio.  </P> <P> Strong, gusty wind accompanied the snow in the Northeast, causing considerable  blowing and drifting and producing wind-chill readings well below zero.  </P> <P> Overnight temperatures in the teens forced Chicago's homeless to seek the 827  beds in 17 warming centers. A shelter program spokesman said one or two more  centers would be opened.  </P> <P> Low temperatures early Sunday dipped into the teens and single digits from the  northern and central High Plains through the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes to  northern New England.  </P></p>

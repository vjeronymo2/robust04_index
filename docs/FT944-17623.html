			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Linkmen to paramilitaries play down hopes of loyalist ceasefire: Stewart Dalby cautions against premature expectations Intense speculation in Belfast that Ulster's loyalist paramilitaries will announce their expected ceasefire within two weeks appears to be over-optimistic. Mr David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party, who is described as having an insight into loyalist paramilitary thinking, said: 'I am confident there will be a ceasefire. But the speculation that it will happen within the next two weeks is unrealistic.' The Rev Roy Magee, who is also ascribed an insight into paramilitary thinking, agreed . He certainly speaks to the unnamed shadowy loyalist paramilitary leaders, if not for them. Asked whether he thought there would be a loyalist ceasefire, he said: 'Yes, but I am not sure it is imminent. 'I have been saying all along that the paramilitaries must be given time to consult everybody. After all, it has taken nearly nine months since the Downing Street declaration for the IRA leadership to get everyone on board. The Protestant leaders must be given time.' The loyalist groups made four conditions for a ceasefire: A cessation of violence by the republican splinter group the Irish National Liberation Army. Evidence that the IRA ceasefire is permanent. Conviction that there was no secret deal with the IRA. An assurance that nothing in the framework document being drafted by the London and Dublin governments would weaken the union with Britain. The paramilitaries, like some of the constitutional unionists, believe that Mr John Major, the prime minister, did not make a secret deal with the IRA. The INLA is thought not to have the wherewithal to go against the wishes of the bigger Provisional IRA, whose ceasefire looks more solid every day. The sticking point is thus the framework document, being drawn up by the two governments to lay the basis for discussion about possible cross-border arrangements. A problem here is that the framework document keeps disappearing over the horizon. It was to have appeared in September, then by the end of October. Now it seems it will not be ready until November. Mr Ervine suggested an actual sighting of the document may not be entirely necessary to calm loyalist fears. An assurance by the governments that the framework document was a discussion document and not a rigid agenda might do the trick, he said. Mr Magee said any ceasefire would mirror that of the IRA - it would not be declared permanent or involve handing over the considerable arsenal of weapons the Protestant paramilitaries have been augmenting recently. As with the IRA, a return to violence at some future date would remain on the cards. In the past the unionist community has shown a remarkable ability to cohere and co-ordinate resistance when it felt really threatened. This cohesion may no longer be possible because, according to Mr Magee, the paramilitaries have made it clear they will no longer be at the beck and call of the constituency politicians. 'They feel they have been let down in the past by the politicians.' Mr Jim Rodgers, a Belfast councillor for the Ulster Unionist Party and another man with an insight into paramilitary thinking, said that the Protestant paramilitaries used to be regarded as less efficient than the IRA but this has changed. The Combined Loyalist Military Command embraces and speaks for the main paramilitary groups - the Ulster Defence Association, which has subsumed the Ulster Freedom Fighters, and the separate Ulster Volunteer Force. Mr Rodgers said there were 10,000 men under arms in the joint UDA/UFF and about 2,500 in the UVF. Others said there were about 4,000 in the UDA and 1,500 in the UVF. Mr Magee estimated there were about 1,000 active Protestant paramilitaries. But more important than numbers was the increasing sophistication of the Protestants. The army confirmed that they had developed bomb-making abilities and they also had better arms. Mr Magee believed that in order to avoid conflict with the largely Protestant British army or the RUC and Royal Irish Regiment, they would target places in the Republic. The violence would therefore move south.</p>

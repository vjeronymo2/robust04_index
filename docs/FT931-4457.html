			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Falling competitiveness in Japan worries Miti JAPAN's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) believes important parts of Japanese industry have lost their international competitiveness. The ministry, widely regarded in the west as the architect of the country's industrial success, believes significant parts of Japanese industry will need far-reaching restructuring to respond to the protracted slump in the economy. Senior Miti officials are drawing up plans for a wide-ranging information technology investment programme to help revive the economy by upgrading its telecommunications infrastructure. They believe the government's plan to stimulate the economy with another emergency spending package being drawn up now should not be confined to traditional public works programmes, which mainly benefit the construction industry and heavy industries such as steel and chemicals. Miti wants to develop so-called telecommunications data highways (sophisticated high-speed communications links) which should stimulate demand for the hard-pressed electronics sector. A linked Miti plan for schools and universities to use government funds to buy computers has won the tacit backing of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister. The electronics industry and other sectors with chronic overcapacity may need further restructuring even if a pump-priming programme is introduced, senior officials believe. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, Japan's vice-minister for international affairs, said: 'In industries such as automobiles and electronics where saturation has developed, this recession has exposed real problems with Japan's industrial structure which will need to be addressed.' Mr Hatakeyama said he would not be surprised if more companies followed the recent lead of Nissan, which shocked the automobile industry by announcing plans to close its Zama production plant. He said too many Japanese companies had been lax during the high growth in the late 1980s and had let their costs grow out of control. There were particular concerns about Japan's position in some key areas of electronics, such as microprocessors and computer work stations, where Japanese industry was losing its competitiveness, Mr Hatakeyama said. In the past few months Japanese personal computer manufacturers faced a mounting challenge in their domestic market from US producers such as Compaq, while many Japanese semiconductor makers acknowledge US competition has become tougher. Mr Hatakeyama said research and development in the electronics industry was a candidate for special attention from Miti programmes.</p>

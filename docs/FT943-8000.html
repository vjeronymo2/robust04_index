			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Volvo on why Renault link failed The terms of a French government 'golden share' and uncertainty over the privatisation of Renault were key issues which led to the collapse last year of Volvo's plan to merge its car and truck operations with Renault, an internal inquiry by the Swedish manufacturer has concluded. The inquiry's author, Mr Arne Wittlov, head of Volvo Aerospace, also indirectly criticised Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the former Volvo chairman who resigned when the merger was blocked by a shareholder and management revolt, for not tackling the deep concerns raised by the merger plan. Although Volvo has not published the report, Mr Wittlov outlined his conclusions in an interview in the company's internal magazine Volvo Now. He said he had interviewed some 50 shareholders, executives, board members and trade union members in the course of preparing his report. He said the terms of the golden share the French government intended to keep in the new Renault-Volvo after privatisation meant there was a risk that Volvo's 35 per cent share in the merged company could ultimately be driven down to 20 per cent.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Union leaders recommend Ford 6% offer LEADERS of 23,000 Ford car workers last night decided to 'strongly recommend' acceptance of a pay offer worth 6 per cent over two years. Ford of Britain offered unions an increase of 2.5 per cent now and 3.5 per cent or inflation, whichever is greater, from next November. The offer, although higher than the inflation rate of 1.8 per cent, is the lowest proposed settlement in percentage terms at Ford for more than 20 years. The company increased its original offer of 1.8 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent next year during 10 hours of talks in London yesterday. The company reaffirmed its intention not to make any compulsory redundancies and promised to maintain lay-off pay at 100 per cent after earlier proposing a reduction to 80 per cent. Ford also agreed to appoint union trustees to its pension fund. Mr Tony Woodley, national secretary of the TGWU general union, said he was 'very pleased' with the offer which will be put to Ford workers at a series of factory meetings next week. He said: 'I am not shouting around the houses about this deal but there is no doubt that with an above-inflation settlement this year and keeping pace with inflation next year, we are more than pleased.' Mr Jimmy Airlie, chief Ford negotiator for the AEEU engineering and electrical union, said unions would be strongly recommending the offer. Unions said the offer was worth about Pounds 17.50 a week. Some of Ford's plants are on short-time working and the company has announced a series of non-production days into the new year because of recession in the European market. The company turned down the unions' claim of a shorter working week. Earlier this week Vauxhall workers at Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool, voted narrowly in favour for a strike over pay. But it is unlikely to go ahead without support from other plants.</p>

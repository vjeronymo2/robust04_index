			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Japanese party finds fund raising harder UNCERTAINTY over the future of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) has prompted the country's leading banks to reconsider loans to the party. The LDP asked the banks for Y20bn (Dollars 187m) in low-interest loans, but the banks are likely to scale down the amount to Y15bn following the split in the party earlier this week. Until now, the LDP's ability to maintain stable rule over the country had served as a 'collateral' for bank loans. Meanwhile, Japanese business groups, which have traditionally backed the LDP, expressed the need for a more flexible approach. Although Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the most powerful group of business leaders federation of economic organisations, which donates an annual Y13bn to the LDP, has pledged its continued LDP support, leaders of the Keizai Doyukai, the Japan association of corporate executives, and the Nikkeiren - the Japanese federation of employers' associations - said political donations should be made on the basis of party plat-forms. The construction industry, known for its strong ties with LDP politicians, is also reviewing rules for political donations. A study group for the association of leading contractors is considering prohibiting donations to individual politicians.</p>

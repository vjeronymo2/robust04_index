			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / IMF will advance Moscow Dollars 1bn THE International Monetary Fund, softening its demands on the Russian government, is expected to announce shortly that it will advance Dollars 1bn (Pounds 540m) to Moscow to assist reform. The sum, agreed last week in talks between Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian prime minister, and Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's director general, represents a highly qualified support for the government of President Boris Yeltsin. It also a sign that the IMF has softened its approach markedly in recent days after an internal review of its policy towards the former Soviet Union. The Fund has come under concerted attack in Moscow where Mr Yeltsin, the Russian government and its advisers - especially Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economist - have publicly accused it of an over-rigid and unresponsive attitude. In recent weeks it has abandoned a number of conditions it had set down for the Russian government. The IMF has: accepted that oil prices will rise slowly over the next two years to world market levels; prepared to soften its insistence that the Russian budget be in balance this year without recourse to the Dollars 24bn aid package; and stopped trying to force all former Soviet states to remain within the rouble zone. The move was prompted by Ukraine's decision to expand credit by more than Rs300bn to bail out struggling enterprises. Much of this will come back to Russia in the form of inflation. However, the Dollars 1bn advance is not an endorsement of Russia's economic programme and talks will continue on the crucial areas - the budget deficit, foreign debt repayments and stability in the rouble zone. The granting of Dollars 6bn out of the Dollars 24bn for use as a stabilisation fund remains contentious. The Russian government wants access to it soon, and would use it to support the rouble at a level of Rs85 to the dollar. The IMF believes that the Dollars 6bn can only be 'granted' when the conditions are such that it does not need to be used.

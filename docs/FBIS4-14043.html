			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Israeli occupation troops stationed on the  'Alman and al-Shumariyah hills shelled the al-Litani River basin  with artillery this morning. The nearby forests and valleys  also came under bursts of machine-gun fire. At dawn today, the  occupation troops fired several shells at Mimis, the al-Dahr  hills, and the outskirts of (Mazra'at 'Ayn Bashshur). Several  shells were also fired at Maydun and Birkat Jabbur in Western  al-Biqa'. At 0700 this morning, three vehicles from the Lahd  [South Lebanese Army] militias strafed areas on the  al-Hasbani-Zymmarayya combat line for approximately 90 minutes.    At 0830, the occupation troops reopened the Zummarayya  crossing gate, which they closed on Friday. A heavy traffic  flow made up of civilian cars entered the liberated areas.  [passage omitted]    The Islamic Resistance issued a statement today saying that  to avenge the martyrs of a massacre in 'Aramta, one of its  groups detonated an explosive device against an occupation  patrol on a search campaign along the Kafr Huna-Jazzin road.  One M-113 armored personnel carrier was destroyed and those  inside either killed or wounded. Ambulances were seen rushing  to the scene of the incident to evacuate the dead and wounded.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / US arms policy in firing line: Export credit debate holds up rethink The Clinton administration's plans to draft a new policy on arms sales overseas remain hobbled by an argument over whether to provide government financing to arms exporters. A draft presidential security directive on conventional arms transfers, originally intended to be completed by the end of last year, has been sitting in President Bill Clinton's in-tray at the White House for nearly two months. Although the different government agencies that have contributed to the review have reached general consensus on most of the policy, they remain divided over the question of an export financing facility. The defence industry has lobbied hard for an agreement that would give them access to export credit guarantees once the US government has decided on national security grounds whether a particular weapons system can be sold to a particular country. Administration officials involved with the directive say there has been 'no recent movement' towards a decision, but remain hopeful one can be taken soon. However, Mr Clinton will have to resolve the export financing dispute between government agencies before he signs the directive. 'It's an important issue, but it's not driven by an immediate crisis, like everything else around here,' said one administration official. 'It's chicken and egg. We can't have an export financing facility until we have a conventional arms transfer policy, but one of the reasons they're having trouble with the policy is that they are held up on export financing,' said a defence industry executive. The basic lines of the directive are understood not to differ much from existing policy. 'The basic reason for selling weapons overseas has been to advance our foreign policy goals. It will remain to advance our foreignpolicy goals,' said Mr Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman. Nevertheless, the draft directive includes a recommendation that the US pay explicit attention to the strength of the US defence industrial base in its decisions. Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, said that the impact of foreign sales on the industrial base could play a particular role in a decision on whether to sell Lockheed's F-16 fighter aircraft to Latin America. But Mr Perry, who is visiting Brazil, said the health of the US defence industry would be 'a secondary consideration'. The US has previously been reluctant to sell advanced fighters such as the F-16 to Latin America. Industry officials say the industrial base issue is unlikely to make much difference, since most arms sales are made to close allies where little controversy arises. 'We're not going to start selling aircraft to Iraq in order to keep one of our fighter lines open,' says Mr Joel Johnson, vice-president for international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association, a Washington-based trade group. The issue of US arms sales has become more sensitive in the light of recent statistics showing that the US has become the world's leading arms supplier. Between 1990 and 1993, according to a study by the Congressional Research Service, the US's share of world arms sales rose from 42 per cent to 70 per cent. Industry officials point out, however, that much of this apparent surge results from an increase in arms exports to Middle Eastern allies in the aftermath of Desert Storm and from the dwindling of Russian exports. The Pentagon says that US overseas military sales declined from Dollars 33.2bn (Pounds 20.2bn) in the 1993 fiscal year to Dollars 12.9bn in fiscal 1994, which ended on September 30. These sales are expected to range from Dollars 9bn to Dollars 10.5bn over the next three years. But overseas sales are going to be particularly vital in an environment where the Pentagon's own military procurement has halved and where Mr John Deutch, the undersecretary of defence, is on the point of deciding which of a long list including virtually all the big weapons systems under development should be axed.</p>

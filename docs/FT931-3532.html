			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd wins backing over call to China A CALL from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, for the Chinese government to end the 'stalemate' over political reform in Hong Kong yesterday won rare all-party backing from the Commons. His decision to combine support for plans by Mr Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, to extend democracy with a renewed invitation to China to restart negotiations was supported by both Labour and the Liberal Democrats. With only a handful of backbench MPs challenging his strategy, the foreign secretary said that the 'talks about talks' with Beijing which broke down last week could resume at any time. 'We will continue to pursue steadily the path of co-operation with China: we look to the Chinese side to do the same,' he added. Mr Hurd said Britain's objective remained 'sensible arrangements for the future which could be continued after 1997'. He was joined by Mr Jack Cunningham and Sir David Steel, his Labour and Liberal Democrat counterparts, in warning Beijing that Britain could not ignore the strong pressures for greater democracy in the colony before its transfer to China. Mr Cunningham said Labour would support efforts to 'safeguard' the legitimate interests of the people of Hong Kong alongside its willingness to hold talks with China without preconditions. That view was echoed by Mr David Howell, Tory chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, who said Mr Patten's proposals would simply put into practice agreements already made with China. Sir David, the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, said that if Beijing considered that Mr Patten's proposals broke previous agreements on the future of the colony, the matter could be referred to the International Court of Justice.</p>

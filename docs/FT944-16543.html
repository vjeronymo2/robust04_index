			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Seoul share purchases eased Foreigners residing in South Korea will be exempt from curbs on foreign shareholdings in listed companies starting next January, John Burton reports from Seoul. An announcement yesterday by the finance ministry follows its decision to raise the foreign shareholding ceiling from 10 to 15 per cent next year. The measure is the latest indication of the government's apparent determination to open the stock market gradually to foreign investment, until now severely restricted. Mr Park Jae-yoon, the new finance minister, said the band for permissible daily stock price movements would be eased next year; the deposit requirement for stock purchases would also be changed.</p>

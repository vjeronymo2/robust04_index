			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Arts: Massenet's 'Cendrillon' - Opera The competition between the music colleges in Britain is as intense as ever. Following the wide acclaim that greeted its spring term production of Vaughan Williams's The Pilgrim's Progress, the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester has gone into the lead by ambitiously putting out a complete live recording of the opera on CD - surely a first in student circles. There is every sign that the RNCM sees itself as the music college that intends to go to the ball. For its winter opera this year it has chosen Massenet's version of the Cinderella story, Cendrillon, an enchanting but flawed minor masterpiece, which has never won the popularity it craves. It has rarely been staged in Britain, though by chance the Royal College of Music also put it on for their students a couple of years ago. The comparison mostly goes London's way. There the opera was given a sleek modern look, which admittedly seemed questionable at the time. At the RNCM the producer Stefan Janski and his designer Richard Marks just threw open the gates of Walt Disney world and plunged in. The show was so heavy handedly twee, it had to be tongue-in-cheek. Indeed, by the end the ghastliness of it all had become quite compulsive: surely those sets were the very same as at my local theatre when they put on a panto called 'Cinders' in the early 1960s? Massenet's score, however, does not support a send-up, as it includes some of the most enchanting fairy-tale music to be found in French opera. David Lloyd-Jones dealt with those pages in a heavy-handed fashion, though he drew extremely fine playing from his student orchestra. He deserves our thanks, too, for including the ballet music, which is usually cut, for dancers of the Northern Ballet School. As for the young singers, the RNCM fielded an impressive team, as usual. The title-role was taken by Sara Fulgoni, who has a deep mezzo which stretches up to a high D no less, a voice with a range, strength, and colours unusual for a student singer. The future would seem to hold various long-term possibilities (might she perhaps be a soprano?). For the present, though, she really is not right for Massenet's fragile waif of a Cinderella. It might have been better to follow the composer's original intentions and have the tall, elegant Miss Fulgoni play a mezzo Prince Charming. Instead, that role went to Stephen Chaundy, who should prove a tenor worth watching, though he has a set of contorted French vowels that would give Jacques Delors nightmares. Kathleen Wilkinson made a strong impression as the haughty stepmother and Craig Smith offered a useful high baritone as her husband. In the role of the fairy-godmother Louise Walsh, dressed as head-girl fairy waving a huge magic wand, ran up and down her sparkling high scales with no trouble. Each time she appeared, there were clouds of dry ice, ballet-girl fairies did pirouettes and hordes of pixies galumphed around, but all to little avail. As a true revival of Massenet's lovely Cendrillon, this was an evening when the RNCM's magic dust refused to do its tricks. Further performances: December 9, 12</p>

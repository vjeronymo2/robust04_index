			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo The last-minute passage of the coalition government's political reform bill over the weekend may further dampen sentiment on the Japanese government bond market. Bond traders fear an economic stimulus package, likely to be announced this week, will mean extra supply and a formal announcement may prompt profit-taking. The bond market has already been hit by fears of oversupply, triggered by a recent government announcement that it will auction bonds outright rather than with repurchase agreements. Also, while the government has indicated that an income tax cut to boost the slumping economy will ultimately be funded by an increase in consumption taxes, an immediate rise is impossible. Last Saturday, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, said he was not considering a sales tax hike at the moment, and Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, on Sunday said the income tax cut will be funded by government bonds. An income tax cut larger than Y6,000bn to Y7,000bn is likely to discourage investors and profit-taking by institutional investors ahead of the March book closing may also weigh on the bond market. A recovery in the stock market is also negative for bonds, as hopes of a cut in the official discount rate cut fade with a rally in share prices.</p>

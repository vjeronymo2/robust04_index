			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / World Trade News: No accord in chip talks JAPAN and the US ended the two-day talks over semiconductor trade in Kyoto yesterday, with both sides reiterating conflicting opinions over setting share targets for foreign suppliers in the Japanese market, writes Emiko Terazono. Officials at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said the US expressed satisfaction with Japanese efforts to increase market access to foreign chip makers. However, the Japanese side rejected calls for a 20 per cent average foreign market share for the current year. Japan has been insisting that it was never committed to the 20 per cent market share goal for foreign chip makers stipulated in the 1991 bilateral semiconductor trade agreement.</p>

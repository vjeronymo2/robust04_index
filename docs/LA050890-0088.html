			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DECLINE IN FIXED-RATE MORTGAGES EXPECTED SOON;  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE: RATES HAVE RISEN A PERCENTAGE POINT SINCE CHRISTMAS TO THEIR  CURRENT HIGH OF 11%. THEY MAY DROP TO 10.25% BY YEAR-END.  </P> <P> Interest rates on fixed-rate home mortgages should soon end their recent steep  climb and settle back well below 11% in the months ahead, real estate and  housing economists believe.  </P> <P> Fixed-rate home loans -- by far the most popular loan with consumers because  they provide for level payments every month -- have risen about a full  percentage point since Christmas and are now approaching or have even surpassed  11%, their highest level in nearly a year. That has been bad news for  prospective home buyers and homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages.  </P> <P> Many economists believe, though, that these mortgage rates will rise another  quarter of a percentage point at most before settling back below 11% and will  end the year between 10.25% and 10.75%.  </P> <P> At the same time, housing economists are closely watching how investors --  those from Japan in particular -- will react to this week's expected sale of  $30.5 billion in U.S. Treasury securities.  </P> <P> The interest rates on those bonds have a direct impact on the rates that  American consumers pay on their mortgages and illustrates the profound impact  that Japanese investors have on U.S. homeowners.  </P> <P> The mortgage-rate increases of the past five months have hurt the U.S. housing  market, cutting into new-home sales nationwide and retarding the pace of  housing resales in California. The increases also make it harder for borrowers  to qualify for home loans.  </P> <P> Monthly principal and interest payments on a $175,000 loan total $1,666 when  the interest rate is 11% versus $1,536 when it's 10%, according to figures from  the California Assn. of Realtors. The median price of a resale house in  California is now more than $196,000.  </P> <P> A jump in mortgage rates from 10% to 11% also squeezes another 135,000 renters  out of the housing market statewide, a spokeswoman for CAR estimated, adding  that California has about 4.7 million renters.  </P> <P> Rising mortgage rates are a key reason why housing sales in California are  suffering this year, economists say. According to data released Monday by the  California Assn. of Realtors, the pace of first-quarter sales of existing  single-family homes ran at more than 13% below the torrid level in the first  three months of 1989, although it was up 2.9% on an annualized basis from the  fourth quarter of 1989. The realtors group said it expects that housing resales  will drop 11% for all of 1990.  </P> <P> The sales of single-family homes nationwide have been falling for months,  according to Commerce Department figures. The annual pace of new-home sales  fell to 574,000 in March, below 1989 levels when sales were at their weakest  pace in years.  </P> <P> "This is a recession year for real estate . . . and that includes California,"  said Sanford Goodkin, a real estate consultant in San Diego for KPMG Peat  Marwick.  </P> <P> The news is also bad for consumers with adjustable-rate mortgages whose monthly  payments vary according to a volatile index based on one-year Treasury notes.  The more the index rises, the more their monthly home-loan payments rise.  </P> <P> One large savings and loan based in Los Angeles, California Federal Bank, has  about 35,000 borrowers and $2.73 billion in home loans tied to the one-year  Treasury index, which rose from 7.72% in December to 8.35% in March. The April  figure is due out today and "it should be a lot higher," a bank spokeswoman  said.  </P> <P> Long-term fixed-rate mortgages typically are 1.5 to 2 percentage points higher  than rates on long-term U.S. Treasury securities, economists say.  </P> <P> That's because most fixed-rate home loans today are sold by lenders to  quasi-government agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie  Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Assn. (Fannie Mae). These agencies, in  turn, package the loans as securities and sell them to investors, who usually  buy them at a premium above long-term Treasury rates.  </P> <P> Thus, the bond market in Treasury securities, which is affected by national  trends in employment and inflation, has become the major force behind  fixed-rate mortgages. That explains why the rise in mortgage rates in the past  five months "is really a bond market story," noted Mike Penzer, senior  economist at the Bank of America.  </P> <P> The nation's bond market was jolted last month when consumer prices rose much  faster than expected. The news drove down bond prices and was a major reason  why mortgage rates jumped about a half percentage point in April. Interest  rates rise when bond prices fall.  </P> <P> On the other hand, bond prices rose and interest rates fell last Friday on the  news that unemployment rates were up, possibly indicating that the economy was  not as strong as many experts had thought. A strong economy fuels investor  fears that inflation will get worse and cut into profits on their fixed-income  securities.  </P> <P> Investors are now concerned about what role the Japanese will play in this  week's Treasury-bond sale. Japanese investors traditionally have been big  buyers of U.S. government securities, but recent financial turmoil in the Tokyo  stock market have raised questions about how active they will be in this week's  bond auction.  </P></p>

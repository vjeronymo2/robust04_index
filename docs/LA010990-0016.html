David Gross, who joined the Jerusalem Post in 1950, was named managing  editor and Matt Nesvisky, a 15-year veteran, was appointed editor of the  paper's new weekly magazine. They are the first replacements for about 30  senior editorial staffers who quit Israel's only English-language daily last  week in a dispute over the newspaper's editorial policy. The paper got a new  president and publisher, Yehuda Levy, a former career army officer, in July.  </P></p>

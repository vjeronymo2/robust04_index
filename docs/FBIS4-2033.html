			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yan Liqiang (0917 0500 1730) "It Is Necessary </F> To Reinforce the Dynamics in Making Up Deficits and To Take  Stopgap and Radical Measures Simultaneously"]    [Text] On the morning of 18 March Chen Xitong, secretary of  the municipal party committee; Li Qiyan, mayor of the  municipality, sponsored a forum with the responsible personnel  from some enterprises that had suffered losses. During the  forum, they discussed the plan for making up deficits and  increasing profits and stressed that efforts should be made to  emancipate minds; to seize the opportunity; to reinforce the  dynamics; to take stopgap and radical measures simultaneously;  and to accelerate the handling of the knotty problems of losses  with greater boldness and determination.    The municipal party committee and the municipal people's  government always attach great importance on the work undertaken  by the state-owned industrial enterprises to make up their  deficits and to increase their profits. Over the past few  years, the municipality has scored certain achievements in this  regard through the arduous efforts made by various social  circles and achieved good progress each year. However, the  number of money-losing enterprises is tending toward an increase  due to a series of internal and external reasons, which have  become knotty problems tolerating no neglect at present.    Yuan Zhenguo, manager of the Beibingyang Foodstuffs Company;  Lin Shichang, director of the first knitwear mill; Zhang Kean,  director of the printing and dyeing mill; Song Borao, director  of the chemical briber plant; Qiao Guichen, director of the  battery plant; Liu Zhizhan, director of the No.1 plastics plant;  Chen Jianguo, director of the No.10 plastics plant; and Guo  Zhaoshun, director of the No.2 electric wire and cable factory,  spoke at the forum to report their business situation, their  reasons for losses, their existing difficulties, and their plans  for further switching their losses to profits.    Chen Xitong and Li Qiyan earnestly listened to the speeches  made by these managers and directors and also joined in the  discussion by frequently raising questions.    In his speech Li Qiyan said: Boosting the state-owned large  and medium-sized enterprises represents the work emphasis of the  municipality this year and the issue of how to have the  money-losing enterprises switch their losses to profits  represents the focal point of the work emphasis. The  fundamental key to successfully conducting this work lies in  emancipating minds and seizing the opportunity. Money-losing  enterprises should work out every possible way and means by  proceeding from their reality and according to their own  conditions and adopt the methods suitable to their own work in  this regard. We should note that in the transition from the  planned economy to the socialist market one, enterprises will  encounter pains -- some of them will survive and some will die  out. As for enterprises that are hopeful for switching their  losses to profits, we should actively support them and the  municipal authorities should actively give a helping hand to the  money-losing enterprises that deserve to receive their  assistance. Enterprises should enhance their contingent of  personnel in charge of scientific research and product sales.  Only by successfully conducting technical renovations and  overcoming the scientific and technological difficulties can  enterprises obtain their vigor. Having the money-losing  enterprises switch their losses to profits represents not only  an economic matter but also a matter having a bearing on the  people's lives and social peace. It is hoped that plant  directors should set an example in emancipating minds, conduct  more consultations with workers, explore methods, and work out  their own way of switching losses to profits and achieving  development.    In his speech Chen Xitong said: These money-losing  enterprises have reflected the large number of contradictions  cropping up among industries and the problems cropping up in the  economic operation. The appearance of money-losing enterprises  is inevitable. However, having too many of them is abnormal  because they have a bearing on the people's lives, on  maintaining stability, and on having the municipality  overfulfill the plan of becoming better-off. Leadership at all  levels must attach great importance on the work in this regard  and earnestly deal with the problems in the work. "In doing  everything in the world, all problems can be revolved through an  earnest attitude and the Communist Party mostly stresses  earnestness." Only by earnestly grasping the work can the  leading personnel of party and government organs at all levels  deal with the difficulties encountered by the money-losing  enterprises. Chen Xitong said: Although we have dealt with some  problems that have caused a large number of state-owned  industrial enterprises to lose money, the dynamics used to deal  with these problems has not been enough. It is imperative to  reinforce the dynamics in this regard and to work out new  methods by applying the basis of successful experience gained in  this regard. Efforts should be made to put forward practical  measures to accelerate the handling of these problems. Building  the socialist market economy represents a great opportunity.  Through the measures of regulating the markets, enterprises  should carry out again the rational allocation of essential  factors of production. There are so many ways to remove the  difficulties, however, the key to this regard lies in finding  out a way by deepening the reform.    Chen Xitong pointed out: In encouraging the money-losing  enterprises to switch their losses to profits, we must take  stopgap and radical measures simultaneously. By no means should  we deal with the problems by treating symptoms but not the  disease. As for some enterprises that have suffered production  suspension or semisuspension at present, we should work out  methods for enabling workers to have a job and certain income.  This is the practice of dealing with the temporary problems on  a long-term basis and of taking radical measures to let  enterprises achieve prosperous development. Leadership should  make early determination and vigorously readjust the structure  of industries, enterprises, and products to emancipate the  fettered productive forces. A good job should be done in  closing the money-losing enterprises, suspending the production  of them, merging their production with others, and transferring  their production to others. Efforts should be made to  popularize the experience gained by the first light industrial  front in conducting comprehensively auxiliary reforms; to  accelerate the utilization of foreign capital; to push forward  the shareholding system; to make smaller units on the basis of  cost accounting; and to enforce integration among technology,  industry, and trade.    Chen Xitong stressed: In dealing with the problems caused by  the money-losing enterprises, we must uphold the emancipation of  minds and break away the fetters of idealism and metaphysics.  By no means should we divorce from the reality and blame  everyone and everything but ourselves. We should boldly face  the fierce market competition and foster the lofty aspiration  and great ideals of being the boss of our business. In  readjusting the structure, we should resolutely overcome the  "three bad habits" (overly stressing the famous trade mark,  giving priority to the high position occupied by enterprises in  the national economy, and being concerned about face-saving);  and particularly overcome the fetter of "three ownerships" (such  as the state, collective, and individual). We should encourage  the enterprises of various industries and trades and under  various departments to set up economic associations or to merge  their production.    Chen Xitong urged leadership at all levels to show greater  boldness and determination in having the money-losing  enterprises switch their losses to profits. They should  vigorously seize the opportunity and accelerate the pace, in  addition to not putting off the work by giving up the decisions  on enterprises that deserve to be made. By paying great  attention to the interests of the state, enterprises, as well as  staff members and workers, we should go ahead with the work as  long as the targets have been fixed. Various departments,  commissions, offices, and bureaus should work out methods for  the money-losing enterprises to switch their losses to profits.  As for things that cannot be decided by enterprises, they  should help enterprises make determinations and do more  practical deeds for enterprises. The plant directors and party  secretaries of money-losing enterprises should heighten their  spirit, boldly face the difficulties, and switch their losses to  profits as soon as possible by relying on the masses.    Attending the forum were leading personnel from the  municipal  level organs, including Wang Baosen, Duan Bingren, Li Runwu, and  Fan Yuanmou; as well as responsible persons form the relevant  commissions, offices, bureaus, and banks.</p>

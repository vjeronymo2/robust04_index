			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Emergency declared in Zambia PRESIDENT Frederick Chiluba declared a state of emergency in Zambia last night, citing a threat to security, Reuter reports from Lusaka. He made no specific allegations but diplomats said he was referring to an alleged coup plot to overthrow his 15-month-old government by fomenting civil strife. Reports of a possible coup plot codenamed 'Zero Option' surfaced last week. The president of the main opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP), Mr Kebby Musikotwane, subsequently said he had received a copy of the plot from radical elements in the party. He said this was not official UNIP policy and he had passed the information to the government for further investigation. Police questioned Mr Musikotwane and other senior UNIP officials.</p>

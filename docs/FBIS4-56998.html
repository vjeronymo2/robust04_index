			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal has stated that  Nicaragua will not be affected by the amendment on the  expropriation of U.S. citizens' property that was recently  approved by the U.S. Senate, because Nicaragua has domestic  procedures for returning property to U.S. citizens. The  amendment on the expropriation of U.S. citizens' property  recently approved in the United States does not affect  Nicaragua. The amendment contains three key points required for  its application:    1. If the governments that have entered a democratic  process have not returned the property in three years.    2. If an effective compensation process has not been  implemented, or if the compensation is not adequate.    3. If a domestic procedure that foresees the prompt,  adequate, and effective compensation according to international  law has not been established.    [Begin Leal recording] The recently approved amendment is  not  applicable in the case of Nicaragua. Why? Because for the last  two years... [pauses] or for the last 18 months, we have been  implementing an effective process. Some U.S. citizens have  already received compensation bonds. Some U.S. citizens already  have been given back their properties. The amendment is  accordance with international law. [end recording]    According to international law, the citizenship which is  recognized is the citizenship one had at the time of the  confiscation. At present, Nicaragua has 22 cases of U.S.  citizens pending, Foreign Minister Leal explained. He said that  any local or foreign citizen who does not agree with the value  assigned to his property by the Confiscations Quantification  Office may resort to international arbitration. Leal said  Nicaragua is the only country that has a high number of claims  by U.S. citizens, but it is trying to resolve them.    [Begin Leal recording] We have the political will to resolve  these cases. The president of the Republic has ordered the  creation of a compensation system, a process whereby the  property can be compensated for or returned. In addition,  several ministers, such as the finance minister, myself, and  others, are constantly meeting to review the progress of these  cases. [end recording]    This amendment is applicable to more than 30 countries  worldwide.</p>

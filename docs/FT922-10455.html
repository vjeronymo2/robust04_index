			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (10): Growing pains with economic success - Malaysia OVER the past five years, Malaysia's economy has grown at an average annual rate of 8 per cent. In its latest economic forecast, the Asian Development Bank predicts that in the coming years Malaysia will achieve the fastest economic growth rate in the Asian region. The Malaysian government says that in the period 1991-95, the years covering the country's sixth economic plan, annual growth will average about 7.5 per cent in real terms. Over the past 20 years, Malaysia's economy has become manufacturing-based rather than dependent on commodities. Economic success has brought considerable benefits in terms of higher living standards and full employment. But anyone who has threaded their way through the traffic jams of Kuala Lumpur's narrow streets or driven through the fast-industrialising state of Johor in the south realises that economic success is causing Malaysia considerable growing pains. Dr Gan Khuan Poh, director of the infrastructure section in the office of Dr Mahathir Mohammed, the Malaysian prime minister, admits that there is serious congestion on some of Kuala Lumpur's roads and infrastructure problems in other areas. But he feels Malyasia's difficulties are small compared to other countries in the region. 'Everything is relative. There is congestion everywhere. Look at the problems faced by Taipei or Bangkok,' says Dr Gan. 'Our difficulties are nothing compared to those faced by the authorities there.' According to Dr Gan, the most serious bottle-neck in Malaysia at present is not in relation to inadequate infrastructure but more to shortages in the labour sector - a view shared by both local and foreign employers. 'In some senses, of course, the two things are closely related,' says Dr Gan. 'The completion of the north-south transMalaysia highway, due in 1994, and the building of another east-west highway, is aimed at not only modernising our road network but also at dealing with problems of labour shortages. In some rural areas there are still pockets of excess labour. Once these roads are completed, people will be able to travel to work much more easily.' Infrastructure development is the priority in the present sixth economic plan. During the period 1987-91, MDollars 15.5bn was allocated by the government to the transport and communications sector. In the 1991-95 period, the government is allocating MDollars 25.1bn to the sector - MDollars 10.7bn from federal government coffers, the remainder from state enterprises or already partly privatised bodies such as Telekom Malaysia Berhad, the telecommunications service. The government emphasises the increased role it anticipates the private sector - both local and foreign - will have in infrastructure development. Already, some port facilities have been privatised. What appears to be a highly successful partial privatisation of the state electricity service is under way. Completed sections of the 550-mile transMalaysia highway have been privatised. Roads will be the priority area in the sixth plan, receiving nearly two thirds of the total allocation for the transport and telecommunications sector. Work will be completed on the north-south and east-west highways: urgently needed improvements to urban transport, particularly in the Klang Valley area round Kuala Lumpur, will also be undertaken. Registration of new vehicles has been growing at more than 4 per cent per annum, nearly 50 per cent of the total in the Kuala Lumpur area. Some have advocated limiting vehicle access to the capital city, as is the case in Singapore, or putting higher taxes on cars. The government has shown no inclination to implement such policies: rather it wishes to support the country's own fledgling car industry by encouraging vehicle ownership. Congestion around Kuala Lumpur is likely to be eased when the first phase of a light railway project is implemented in early 1994. Significant amounts of the rail network, due to be 'corporatised' before 1995, will be double tracked and electrified over the next four years. Total air passenger traffic has increased by 11 per cent a year over the past seven years and is expected to grow by between 7 and 10 per cent a year over the next three years. While existing airport facilities are felt to be adequate, Subang International airport outside Kuala Lumpur is being upgraded and construction of a new international airport south of the capital is due for completion by 1997. Port facilities, at Port Klang near Kuala Lumpur, in Johor along the east coast and in East Malaysia, are being upgraded and expanded. There are also plans to expand the Malaysian merchant fleet although so far the government has had little success in encouraging investment in the shipping industry. There are other problem areas: some government critics feel that not enough attention is being paid to the develpopment of infrastructure in East Malaysia. There are also those who question the environmental impact of some of the development schemes, while others feel that targets set by the government for private sector infrastructure investment are too ambitious. In recent years, Malaysia has gained a reputation for not merely producing detailed development plans but implementing them. If only 75 per cent of infrastructure projects in the sixth plan are achieved, the face of Malaysia will be significantly changed.</p>

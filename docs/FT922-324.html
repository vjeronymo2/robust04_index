			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Goldman defends its role in attempted GPA float GOLDMAN Sachs, the US investment house, yesterday said GPA failed to get a public listing because of institutional uncertainty over the nature of its business. It was not because of general problems in the airline industry.

Mr Dobkin added: 'When it came to GPA they were just too uncertain about the outlook for the business. In addition the current state of the global equity markets made it a bit more difficult.' Goldman Sachs has been criticised by some of GPA's other advisers for failing to persuade US institutional investors to buy shares. GPA has also said it was deeply disappointed with its advisers' failure to ensure US institutional support. It added that it was forced to abandon its flotation at the last minute because support from US institutional investors suddenly collapsed. Mr Tony Ryan, GPA chairman, has said that he is still committed to seeking a public listing for GPA. One of the options available to the group is trying for a public listing in either New York or London. Mr Dobkin said he had been surprised at the lack of support from institutions in the UK, which was supposed to have been the home market for GPA. 'The US institutions were looking to the UK for support and did not find it.'</p>

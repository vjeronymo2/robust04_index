			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / A struggle to stay on track: Alcatel's chairman is optimistic in spite of a legal investigation and difficult European markets These are critical times for Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, who has built his telecoms, transport and engineering group into one of France's largest industrial concerns. Earlier this month, the Alcatel chief was placed under investigation concerning allegations of fraud relating to payments for work at his Paris properties. Before that, Mr Suard found himself in the unfamiliar position of issuing a profits warning. In January, he forecast that Alcatel's net profits would shrink by between 10 and 20 per cent this year, the first decline since 1987 when the company's rapid expansion was launched with the acquisition of the European telecoms equipment operations of ITT of the US. The purchase of Fiat's telecoms operations, aggressive exports, and a joint venture with GEC of the UK, which manufactures the high-speed Train a Grande Vitesse, have since fuelled the company's growth. Has Alcatel been derailed by this year's events? Sitting in the company's smart Paris headquarters, Mr Suard is unruffled. 'I feel calm and confident,' he says, referring to the investigation. As for business: '1994 is a difficult year . . . but I am more optimistic than I was in January,' he says, citing the success of the group's technical programmes and the economic recovery in some of its markets. Most industry analysts concur, predicting a return to profits growth in 1995. Mr Suard is aggrieved by the legal wrangles, which included more than 12 hours of interrogation on July 4, before the announcement of a formal investigation. 'I feel the events are a profound injustice,' he says, firmly denying allegations that he underpaid company suppliers for building work worth about FFr440,000 (Pounds 52,900) at his former Paris residence. He says that the FFr300,000 worth of security work done at his home, also under investigation, was approved by Alcatel's board following express instructions from the government to tighten security after the 1986 assassination of Mr Georges Besse, then head of Renault. Mr Suard claims there have been irregularities in the conduct of his investigation. 'Some portions of the file under the control of the investigating judge appeared in the press on Wednesday (July 6), which is very improper and against the law.' A stock exchange inquiry, demanded by Mr Suard, is examining the way that news of his detention was released. Shares fell by 8.3 per cent after his detention was revealed, although the losses have since been recouped. The Alcatel chairman says that the investigation has not unduly disrupted his management. More serious, he believes, is the impact of the affair on the image of the group as it battles for overseas contracts. This is of particular concern as the company struggles to adjust to a fall in earnings and a deterioration in some markets - particularly for telecommunications equipment, its largest sector. 'Alcatel, like other telecoms equipment groups, is confronted by the fact that traditional digital switching systems and transmission markets have shrunk in absolute terms and more in margin terms,' says Mr Evan Miller, European telecoms analyst at Lehman Brothers. Alcatel has not been a laggard in new markets, either in terms of geography or technology. According to Dataquest, it vies with Nokia and Motorola for second place in the European infrastructure market for new mobile phone networks built to the international GSM standard. Alcatel established itself in China, the world's fastest-growing telecoms market, before many of its competitors, and this year expects to sell China 7m lines of switching equipment - more than for the whole of Europe. The company has also made notable acquisitions in Europe and the US. Three years ago it acquired the transmission division of Rockwell of the US, and claims now to be the second-largest supplier of telecoms cables in the US. The groups's undersea cables division has been boosted by last year's acquisition of STC, the UK-based submarines cables division of Northern Telecom of Canada. 'We are maintaining our research and development effort to be competitive in tomorrow's products,' says Mr Francois de Laarge de Meux, chief operating officer. He cites the companies leading-edge technology in land and submarine fibre-optic cables, in SDH - the next generation of line transmission technology - and in broadband telecoms switches. The big pay-off, claims Mr Suard, will come with the development of multimedia networks and fibre-optic superhighways. 'We have been preparing for several years, for example in the areas of broadband transmission. It is at the centre of our strategy.' However, weaknesses are also evident, even in leading-edge markets. In the cellular infrastructure market, Alcatel is not only behind Ericsson, the Swedish supplier, but is regarded by many analysts and operators as inferior to Nokia, the fast-growing Finnish company, in terms of products and customer-responsiveness. In its traditional switching and transmission markets, its prime weaknesses have been in Italy, Spain and, in particular, Germany. Mr Jozef Cornu, Alcatel's technical director, accepts that the German operations will suffer a loss in 1994, although he believes a return to profit can be achieved in 1995. 'There has been a radical change in the German market,' says Mr Cornu. Demand has contracted, with investment in eastern Germany no longer offsetting the downturn in the western regions. Another aspect of the malaise, says Mr Cornu, is a policy shift by Deutsche Telekom, the German state telecoms operator, in the direction of international specifications and tenders for its supplies, leading to increased competition and reduced prices. Alcatel has responded with a series of restructuring efforts, including the closure of a plant in Stuttgart. But even if cable demand picks up on the back of 'superhighways', the more open procurement policies which are costing Alcatel dearly in Germany can only extend further to the company's disadvantage. Deutsche Telekom is about to be privatised; France Telecom and other European operators are bound to follow. In every case, cosy relationships will break down - and the main losers are likely to be established suppliers such as Alcatel and Siemens of Germany. Much rests on Alcatel's ability to build the superhighways and supply the other artefacts - from advanced switches to mass mobile phones - which will be integral to 21st century communications. Can they do it? 'In terms of product lines, they are second to none,' says Mr Miller of Lehman. 'Their frustration is that it isn't happening yet.'  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ALCATEL ALSTHOM: A TURN FOR THE WORSE  --------------------------------------------------------------------- (FFr billion)                1989      1990      1991     1992     1993   1994  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sales        143.90    144.05    160.08   161.68   156.33     - Capital  expenditure   6.88      6.99      7.62     7.00     6.49     - R&amp;D  expenditure  10.85     12.14     14.74    15.12    15.24     - Net income     3.90      5.03      6.18     7.05     7.06  5.6-6.4*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Company has warned of 10-20% fall in income this year  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Alcatel Alsthom Group/Datastream  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

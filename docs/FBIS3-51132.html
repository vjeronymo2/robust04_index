Ross reported that, in the first stage, approximately  485,000  union leaders will discuss ways to solve the internal financial  problem, one of the most complex and important problems with  regard to the island's serious economic situation.    In statements to the local press, the worker leader said the  workers' opinions must be gathered because "they are the  backbone of everything that may be done with regard to this  topic."    He also mentioned that, at the last session of the Cuban  Parliament -- 27 and 28 December -- President Fidel Castro said  none of the measures that Cuba may need to adopt can be decided  without the support and consensus of the workers.    The Cuban deputies did not reach agreements because -- as  was  learned -- they previously decided to carry out a profound  consultation and clarification process among the entire  population and later convoke an extraordinary meeting of the  parliament to continue debating the affair, with a higher level  of information.    For the parliament members and the country's directorate the  meeting served as a way to reflect and exchange ideas on how to  improve the existing financial imbalance.    In this regard, it was learned that the excess circulating  currency amounted to over 10 billion pesos (the same amount in  dollars, according to the official exchange rate), the subsidies  due to losses in 1993 amounted to 4.6 billion pesos, and the  state budget deficit amounted to 4.2 billion pesos, most of it  in subsidies.    Of those, the excess circulating currency is the most  harmful  as it contributes to decreasing efficiency, decreasing  productivity, as well as declining labor discipline.    Some of the solutions viewed by the Cuban deputies were:  changing the currency, implementing a new tax system and price  policy, as well as charging for some services that are currently  offered gratuitously.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Arts: Today's Television How long before sexy Sister Gabriel gives up her nasty habits and starts strutting her stuff in patent stilettos and high sheen Lycra tights? Body And Soul is one of those splendidly slushy family sagas which we are no longer supposed to call 'women's stories', involving a nun who has been hidden away in an enclosed order for umpteen years and has emerged because her brother killed himself in Episode 1. Now (I am not making this up) there's trouble at t'mill. Mark my words, Sister Gabriel will turn out to have the business brains of a Getty under that wimple and the villainous Stan Beattie will find he has bitten off more than he can chew (9.00 ITV). Gratifyingly Joan Bakewell returns to the screen with a brand new series: Memento (8.00 C4) which admits to being inspired by 'Desert Island Discs'. The guests - today's is David Attenborough - choose their 10 most prized personal possessions. True Stories is a 1 3/4 hour documentary about Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute on America's death row who admits to killing seven men and has been called 'the first female serial killer' (9.30 C4).</p>

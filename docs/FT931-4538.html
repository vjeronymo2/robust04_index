			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (5): Fingers on the pulse - Factors and discounters THE factors and invoice discounters believe that the economic upturn, when it comes, will be their golden opportunity for growth. Not just because increased economic activity will boost business but because the banks, chastened by their losses during the recession, will be very cautious with their lending. The factors, too, have had to absorb losses. But because they monitor their clients' performance far more closely than the bank manager does his, they are in a better position to spot when a company is running into trouble. The factors themselves have been advancing this argument for many years but there are now signs that the banks, which own most of the larger factoring companies, are realising this too. In an appeal for closer cooperation between the banks, government and small business launched last month, Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, suggested that the banks should widen their use of factoring and invoice discounting to help businesses recover from the recession. Although the banks own most of the large factoring companies, the relationship between the main branch networks and the factoring divisions has been uneasy. Many bank managers have regarded factoring as only suitable for their less creditworthy customers. The factors for their part have welcomed business which came to them by means of the branch network but have been reluctant to become too dependent on it. Factoring involves a company handing over the management of its sales ledger to the factor in return for an immediate advance of up to 80 per cent of the value of its invoices. This represents a far more generous valuation of trade debts than the 35-50 per cent most bank managers would allow and can lead to a dramatic improvement in the company's cash flow. The factor monitors when his client's customers settle their bills and can warn of impending difficulties. Factoring is typically used by the smaller company which has not yet developed a sophisticated system of managing its sales ledger. For the larger company, with more highly developed credit management system, invoice discounting is more appropriate. The invoice discounter provides cash against invoices but the client retains control of his sales ledger. Although concrete proof of the upturn has yet to come through there are already signs of an increase in factoring volumes. Sales financed by the UK's 11 largest factors rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 16bn in 1992 compared with a rise of only 2.5 per cent the year before, according to the Association of British Factors and Discounters (ABFD). The number of companies using factoring increased by 7 per cent to 9,221. 'We must be the only business financing sector which can point to growth,' comments Mr Alan Hughes, chairman of the ABFD and managing director of Griffin Factors (part of Midland Bank). Domestic factoring rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 5.6bn while invoice discounting increased by double that rate to Pounds 9.7bn. In spite of the imminent creation of the single European market and publicity given to the importance of overseas trade, import and export factoring continued to be the laggard of the industry, rising just 7 per cent to Pounds 643m. An encouraging development was a 1 per cent fall in bad debts absorbed by UK factors to Pounds 13.1m - the first drop in six years. One niche where factoring has established itself is in the financing of management buy-outs and venture capital deals. More than 10 per cent of the Pounds 3bn of finance advanced by factors and invoice discounters over the past two years has been linked to venture capital transactions, the ABFD calculates. Increased enthusiasm on the part of senior bankers for factoring and the effects of an intensive marketing campaign over the past four years by the industry may succeed in breaking down residual resistance to it as a method of finance. For some business owners and managers, factoring retains an image as being a slightly unsavoury form of finance suitable only for companies about to fold. Even ownership of the main factors by the banks has not succeeded entirely in erasing this impression, which dates from irresponsible factoring activities as far back as the 1960s. A continuing problem for the industry is a perception among many businesses that it is an expensive way of raising money. Apart from typically paying 3 per cent above bank base rate for the cash provided against invoices, a company would also pay between 0.75 and 3 per cent of turnover for the factoring service. Invoice discounting, which does not involve so much work on the part of the factor/invoice discounter, can cost between 0.1 and 1 per cent of turnover. For companies working on very narrow margins the cost of the service could prove a deterrent. For others, the factors argue, the savings achieved on the cost of running a sales ledger department and from being paid more promptly, more than outweigh the costs. Now that all the large UK banks have their factoring arms there has been little change among the bigger players over the past year or so. Lloyds Bank has two separate factoring divisions, Alex Lawrie and International Factors. Barclays has Barclays Commercial Services, National Westminster has Lombard NatWest Commercial Services while Midland has Griffin. The past year has seen some changes among the smaller players, however. AIB Commercial Finance, part of the Irish AIB banking group, withdrew from invoice discounting at the end of 1992 after failing to achieve the scale of business it had hoped for. Kellock, a Bank of Scotland subsidiary, took on the continuing business in AIB's portfolio. Venture Factors, which had been owned by the United Bank of Kuwait, was acquired in mid-1992 by IFN Factors, part of the Dutch ABN Amro Bank group. This made it the second Dutch-owned factor/invoice discounter in the UK alongside De Lage Landen, which is owned by Rabobank. Venture Factors plans to concentrate on providing invoice discounting to the UK subsidiaries of continental European companies, says Mr Tony Cox, managing director. A third development in the industry was the expansion of Causeway Invoice Discounting into factoring through the purchase of Finance for Business (Europe), a private company owned by a group of individual investors in the north west of England. 'By offering only invoice discounting we were precluded from doing business with quite a lot of companies which were fundable but where the administration and sales ledger management left something to be desired,' says Mr Brian Sumner, managing director. Causeway's move represents an intriguing development following several years in which invoice discounting has been the fastest growth sector.</p>

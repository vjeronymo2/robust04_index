			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Further losses at ABB Transportation ABB Transportation, the UK train maker formerly known as Brel, reported another period of pre-tax losses and warned that order books are running out because of the government's plans for railway privatisation. Pre-tax losses were reduced to Pounds 6.9m in the 15 months to December 1992, compared with Pounds 41.3m in the year to September 1991; turnover rose from Pounds 299.5m to Pounds 401.2m. However, the previous figure was struck after exceptional restructuring costs of Pounds 37.6m, so the outcome marked a deterioration from losses of Pounds 3.7m before exceptional items last time. The group, privatised in 1989, is now owned 85 per cent by Asea Brown Boveri and 15 per cent by its employees. It started running into difficulties soon after privatisation when it failed to meet production schedules on new trains for BR.</p>

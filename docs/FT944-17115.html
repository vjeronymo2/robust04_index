			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up Investors in emerging markets have been warned that while prices could advance by a comparatively modest 20 per cent over the next six to 12 months, a substantial setback was likely to follow. Mr David Shaw, strategy director at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, said that the trigger was likely to be an increase in US short-term interest rates to the critical 6 per cent level, which would prompt selling by private US investors and mutual funds. 'While there continues to be a compelling, secular case for emerging markets, the purely cyclical justification is near the end of its shelf life,' said Mr Shaw, who advised taking profits when the IFC Composite Investable index breached the 400 level. PAKISTAN Hub Power Company, which is building a 1,292MW plant near Karachi, is to issue shares worth Rs8.17bn (Dollars 266 million) to foreign and domestic investors. The prospectus was due to be published last Saturday and the one-day subscription for next Sunday. The offer price was said to be Rs13.26 but, in the kerb market, shares were trading at Rs18.50. POLAND Creditanstalt Bankverein of Austria plans to create a Polish investment fund with a domestic partner.

THAILAND Thai Petrochemical plans to raise money through an IPO of 167m shares, at a price to be disclosed later, partly to finance its Bt40bn fully integrated petrochemical complex.</p>

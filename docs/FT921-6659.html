			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Fearful consumers hurt dollar A QUIET day for the dollar was transformed by the publication of the Conference Board US consumer confidence index at 3pm London time. The index dropped to 46.3 in February, the lowest level since the survey started in 1967. The confidence numbers pushed the dollar down sharply from DM 1.6480 to DM 1.6350 in what one observer described as 'very aggressive selling' - though this was mostly interbank dealing, he said, not corporate interest. The drop in the confidence index called into question belief in an imminent US economic recovery based on stronger recent retail sales figures and monetary data, said Gerard Lyons of DKB International. Traders also noted that Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a US senate committee that the drop in the index was 'quite disturbing' and that 'there is room for the Fed to move (to ease interest rates) if we have to move further'. In spite of the burst of dollar selling, the market was heartened, said Mr Christian Dunis of Chemical Bank, by very good resistance around the DM 1.6375 level. The dollar ended London trading at DM 1.6390, after a DM 1.6460 London start and Monday's close of DM 1.6510. It rallied to end at DM 1.6575 in New York. Against the yen, the dollar had performed more strongly, helped by an absence of the half-expected Japanese government intervention and by political pressure for lower yen interest rates. On Tuesday, the dollar closed in Tokyo at Y 129.32, and moved in a narrow range in European trading, reaching a high of Y 129.91 before ending at Y 129.20, slightly above Monday's close of Y 129.15. Against sterling the US unit closed at Dollars 1.7610, down from an opening Dollars 1.7525. Among European currencies, there was an easing of Spanish interest rates as the Bank of Spain's intervention rate fell from 12.65 per cent to 12.40 per cent. The move was primarily a result of strains within the EMS, not domestic concerns, said Carlos Solchaga, Spain's economy minister. 'The peseta has been in the higher band of the ERM, and we thought we could achieve a more balanced situation with a small reduction in rates,' he added. His comments were a clear reference to the way in which the peseta's strength has kept sterling trapped against its lower ERM limit. Yesterday's move on peseta interest rates produced no corresponding easing from the UK authorities, but the pound stayed close to its peseta floor. There was little activity: 'The pound was really completely sidelined,' commented one trader. Sterling opened at DM 2.8802, slightly weaker than its previous close of DM 2.8835. During the morning, the pound dipped to DM 2.8791, climbing back to DM 2.8803 at 3pm. The dollar weakness thereafter, which pushed up the D-Mark, left sterling a little easier and it closed at DM 2.8787. In spite of very good trade figures, the French franc closed slightly lower.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> About 500 Burmese troops clashed with Thai soldiers after crossing the border  into northern Thailand to attack a Karen rebel stronghold, a Thai officer said.  Other attacking troops, perched on hills on the Burmese side of the border,  fired shells on the Kaw Moo Ra camp, setting much of it ablaze in the third day  of heavy fighting. About 1,200 guerrillas were defending the camp against 3,000  soldiers, the officer added. Thai forces eventually fired at the attacking  soldiers, who later moved on to another area inside Thailand, he said. No  soldiers were reported hurt in the clashes. Thailand in the past has given  sanctuary to the rebels, who have been fighting for four decades for greater  autonomy.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- The National People's  Congress [NPC] Law Committee submitted three reports to the  seventh meeting of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee that opened  today. The reports disclosed the results of the committee's  deliberations of the draft Foreign Trade Law, the draft State  Compensation Law, and a draft decision on meting out punishment  for offenses in connection with company and enterprise  management.    The Law Committee states: Following the preliminary  deliberations of these three draft bills by the fourth and fifth  meetings of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee, the Law Committee  distributed copies of the drafts to all provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities directly under the central  government, as well as to relevant central departments. It also  held informal discussions with relevant central departments,  specialists, and foreign trade enterprises to canvass their  opinions. The committee amended the drafts in accordance with  the views of NPC Standing Committee members as a result of  deliberations, as well as the views of people in other sectors.  Believing that formulation of the three statutes was necessary  and the drafts were basically feasible, the Law Committee would  like to propose the NPC Standing Committee examine and approve  them.    Xiang Chunyi, Cai Cheng, and Wang Shuwen, vice chairmen of  the NPC Law Committee, today submitted three separate reports to  the Standing Committee on the results of their deliberations.  The reports contained the Law Committee's suggestions for  amendments.    On the draft Foreign Trade Law, Xiang Chunyi said: The NPC  Financial and Economic Committee and some localities have called  for encouraging localities to engage in foreign trade, saying  the law may not provide for such issues as not exercising  management through mandatory planning, integrating industry with  trade, and implementing the agency system. To this end, we  would like to propose the draft be amended to read: "The state  shall implement a unified foreign trade system, safeguard the  order of free and fair foreign trade in accordance with the law,  inspire local governments' enthusiasm, protect the operational  autonomy of foreign trade operators, and promote the development  of foreign trade." Some departments have expressed the hope the  draft will be amended to reflect the fact that economic  organizations are not the only units engaged in foreign trading  activities in our country but quite a few scientific research  institutes have been granted the right to engage in foreign  trade pursuant to relevant state provisions. To this end, we  would like to propose the draft be amended to read: "The  foreign trade operators referred to in this law are legal  entities and other organizations engaged in foreign trading  activities in accordance with the provisions of this law."    Xiang Chunyi said: The NPC Financial and Economic Committee  and some localities have noted that although the requirement for  obtaining the permission of competent departments before  securing the right to engage in foreign trade confirms the  practice currently in effect, a registration system should be  established in light of the long-term demand for reforming the  foreign trade system. Also, we would like to propose the law  specify the qualifications of foreign trade operators in order  to increase its own transparency. Some members and localities  prefer the draft's provisions on obtaining the permission of  competent departments before securing the right to engage in  foreign trade. After canvassing the views of relevant  departments, the Law Committee concluded that more provisions  should be introduced regarding the qualifications of foreign  trade operators. However, considering our country's reality, we  would like to propose retaining the provisions in the State  Council's draft regarding the licensing system, and amending the  draft to read: "A foreign trade operator engaged in the export  and import of goods and technologies must possess the following  qualifications, and may only engage in foreign trading  activities with the permission of the authorities under the  State Council in charge of foreign economics and trade: 1)  having its own name and organizational setup; 2) having a  clearly defined operational scope within which to conduct  foreign trade; 3) having the premises and funds for carrying out  its foreign trading business; 4) having professional personnel  needed for its foreign trading business; 5) possessing actual  export and import credentials or sources of export and import  goods; and 6) other qualifications as specified by law and  administrative rule." "The State Council shall enact  implementation measures provided for in the preceding  paragraph."    Speaking on the views about amending the draft  State Compensation Law, Cai Cheng said: Certain departments  pointed out that, for administrative compensation, there should  be a specific clause noting that the state shall bear the  responsibility of compensating for the damage caused by unlawful  compulsory measures taken on property. We propose this clause  be added: "When compulsory administrative measures were taken  to seal, withhold, or freeze property and damage has been made,"  the victim is entitled to compensation. Some Standing Committee  members noted the draft should have the specific clause that  authorities obligated to make the compensation should take the  initiative to pay the victim according to this law. Thus we  propose a clause should be added to each of the relevant  articles. Cai Cheng said: Some Standing Committee members  pointed out that it is not enough simply to make state organs  personnel -- whose wrongdoings were intentional and serious --  bear economic liabilities, but that they must also have their  administrative and criminal responsibilities investigated. We  propose, therefore, that this clause be added to the draft law:  "Relevant authorities shall discipline these personnel  according to law; and if their wrongdoings constitute a crime,  their criminal responsibilities shall be investigated according  to law."    Cai Cheng said: Some departments pointed out that  compensation for detainees, whose legitimate rights and  interests have been violated as result of the lawless exercise  of power by authorities in charge of prisons, should also be  specified in the part about criminal compensation. Some  departments pointed out that the part about criminal  compensation should have provisions governing the power of the  People's Liberation Army's security departments to investigate  criminal cases in the military. We propose these words in the  draft law -- "public security organs, security organs, and  procuratorial organs as well as their personnel" -- be amended  to read: "Organs exercising investigating, prosecuting, trying  powers as well as their personnel."    Cai Cheng said: Some Standing Committee members and some  departments pointed out that more flexible rates should be set  so that they can adapt to wage and price changes in the future.  We propose the draft version be amended to read: "When a  citizen's personal freedom has been violated, the daily  compensation shall be calculated according to the average daily  wage the state paid him in the preceding year." Many experts  and local people's congresses and departments pointed out that,  to facilitate operations, a ceiling should be set for state  compensation. Some comrades pointed out that the ceiling should  be set in such a way that it can adapt to future changes. On  the basis of these views, we propose that a ceiling of  compensation should be set. The ceiling should be assessed  according to the state's average wage for workers during the  preceding year as announced by the State Statistics Bureau.  Specific rates can be set according to three kinds of  situations: The reduced amount of income as result of physical  injury "shall be calculated according to the average annual wage  which the state paid the worker in the preceding year, and the  ceiling should be five times the worker's average annual wage  in the preceding year"; compensation for physical disability  "should be set according to how much the working capability is  lost, and the ceiling should be 10 times the worker's average  annual wage in the preceding year; and in the case of death, the  total compensation, including funeral expenses, should be 20  times the average annual wage of the worker in the preceding  year." Some Standing Committee members, legal experts, and  departments proposed that the reputation of those whose  reputation and honor have been infringed upon should be  reinstated. We propose this clause be added: "When a person's  reputation and honor has been infringed upon, the organ liable  for compensation shall, within the area in which the conduct of  infringement has produced influence, remove the influence on the  victim, reinstate his honor, and apologize to him."    Wang Shuwen reported on the NPC Law Committee's views about  amending the draft decision on punishing offenses in connection  with company and enterprise management. He said: In addition  to prescribing punishments for the offenders -- such as fixed  prison terms, criminal detention, and deprivation of personal  freedom -- the draft also provides that "fines may also be  imposed." Some departments and local authorities pointed out  that punishments should be based on the offenses'  characteristics, and the offenders should be deprived of their  personal freedom and penalized economically. Certain offenders  may only be fined. Thus, we propose the phrase be amended to  read: "Fines may be imposed together or separately."    Wang Shuwen said: Some members, local authorities, and units  pointed out that the Company Law's Article 214 provides that  when a company's directors, supervisors, or managers accept  bribes, or seize or misappropriate the company's assets, and  that their acts have constituted a crime, their criminal  responsibilities shall be investigated according to the law.  Since the draft decision has no provisions governing bribery,  it should be supplemented. Thus, we propose this provision be  added: "When a board director, supervisor, or worker of a  company uses the convenience of his office to solicit or accept  bribes, and the amount is quite substantial, he shall be  sentenced to prison, or criminal detention, of up to five years;  and if the amount is enormous, he shall be sentenced to prison  for longer than five years and also have his property  confiscated. If state functionaries, workers of collective  economic organizations, or other personnel performing public  duties commit the aforementioned crime, they shall be punished  according to the Supplementary Regulations For Punishing  Corruption and Bribery."    He said: Some local authorities and units pointed out that  the criminal elements stated in this law should not only be  punished in terms of their personal freedom and economic  interests, but their credentials for continuing to assume the  company's leading offices should be restricted. Thus we propose  this clause be added: "For those who have committed the crimes  stated in this decision, the people's court may also impose on  them the additional sentence that they may not assume offices as  the company's directors, supervisors, or managers, as well as  other senior supervisory offices for a period from three to five  years."</p>

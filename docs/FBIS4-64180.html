			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at  0430 GMT on 31 May carries a 4-minute report by correspondent  Innart Skunj from Riga on some preliminary results of the local  elections in Latvia.    Skunj says: "About 60 percent of voters have taken part in  them. Rural areas had a better turnout, while in Riga the  turnout was just over 50 percent. In the opinion of  international and local observers, there have been no serious  violations at the elections."    He says further: "In rural areas, the Latvian Peasants  Association and the Latvian National independence Movement will  receive the majority of mandates. In Riga, the opposition to  the present government and to the majority in the Seimas have  come to power, namely united national forces -- the Latvian  National Independence Movement, the For the Fatherland and  Freedom, the People's Front, the Christian Union, and the  Latvian Peasants Association. They received 52 percent of  votes, and they have received 32 mandates out of 60 seats. This  bloc will name their representatives on Friday."</p>

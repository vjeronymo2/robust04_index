			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH TORRANCE SUSPENDS COACH FOR PULLING TEAM  </P> <P> South Torrance High girls basketball Coach Gil Ramirez was suspended by the  school Thursday for the rest of the season for violating the Southern Section  sportsmanship rule. Ramirez pulled his team off the court at halftime Wednesday  with his team trailing Inglewood Morningside, 102-24.  </P> <P> Ramirez's action prevented Morningside's 6-foot-5 senior center Lisa Leslie,  who scored 101 points in the first half, from breaking the national record of  105 points set by Cheryl Miller of Riverside Poly against Norte Vista in 1982.  </P> <P> South Torrance (3-17) completes the regular season this afternoon with an Ocean  League game against visiting North Torrance. Assistant coach Ron Omoto will  serve as coach, said South Torrance's principal, Dr. John Schmitt.  </P> <P> Ramirez, who met with Schmitt and his players at school Thursday, refused to  comment on his decision to remove his team at halftime. South Torrance was down  to four players because two of the team's seven players had fouled out in the  first half and one could not play because of an injury, Schmitt said.  </P> <P> "We talked with the (Southern Section office) and we are forwarding an incident  report," Schmitt said. "We are also forwarding a letter of concern for them to  react to. We are well aware of the (sportsmanship) rule. I think it needs some  interpretation in this case."  </P> <P> Lopsided Ocean League victories are common for Morningside, the defending State  Division I champions. Morningside Coach Frank Scott said that Wednesday's game  was the first time he let the Monarchs (21-3) loose all season.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lonnie White contributed to this story.  </P></p>

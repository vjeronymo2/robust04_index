			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Private ambitions on public priorities: Mexico's attempts to attract investment in its infrastructure Constrained by an acute shortage of public funds and eager to overhaul the country's deteriorating infrastructure, the Mexican government is inviting the private sector to buy, build, and finance projects on a scale that few other governments in the world have envisaged. Mexico's telephones, motorways, ports, airports, power plants, water recycling projects and prisons are all now open to private investment. The government also plans to remove the constitutional block on the private operation of railways. For the programme to succeed, the government will have to persuade both foreign and domestic investors to provide tens of billions of US dollars in funding. It is keen to press ahead because, without sound infrastructure, Mexico would find it harder to compete in the world economy, particularly within the proposed North American Free Trade Area. But Mexico is only just leaving behind it the problems of excessive debt which it experienced in the 1980s. As a result, many investors are wary of a long-term commitment to it. The investment envisaged by the government would involve selling off existing state-owned companies and persuading the private sector to build and pay for new projects. The government's current plans would build on reforms initiated three years ago when it sold Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the telephone monopoly, for Dollars 5.8bn (Pounds 3.94bn). The deal required Telmex to invest about Dollars 14bn over five years modernising one of the world's most inefficient telephone companies. Since then, banks and construction companies have been awarded concessions to build about 4,000km of toll roads, costing more than Dollars 10bn. Next month, bidding begins for Mexico's first private electricity generating plant. Later this year, or early in 1994, ports and some airports are scheduled to go on sale. Mr Bill Reinhardt, editor of the US newsletter Public Works Financing says Mexico has 'the world's most ambitious privately-financed infrastructure programme.' He adds: 'While most governments talk about this stuff, few want to give up the monopoly power. Mexico is one of the exceptions.' The impetus has been the poor state of Mexico's basic communications and other amenities. In the 1980s, after Mexico defaulted on its foreign debt and inflation hit triple digits, real public spending on infrastructure fell by an average 9 per cent a year, or more than 50 per cent in a decade. The effects are evident. In parts of the country it can take a year to get a telephone. Many trunk roads are riddled with pot-holes. And poor water supply in the arid north has curbed industrial expansion. In spite of recent improvements in Mexico's economy, including a fall in inflation to single figures, President Carlos Salinas has made economic stabilisation and debt repayment, rather than public investment, the government's priorities. The government ran a budget surplus last year, and is currently running another, indicating the squeeze on public funds continues. While the government is convinced of the desirability of private involvement in infrastructure investment, there have, however, been difficulties. Some toll motorways have run into financial trouble, as construction costs have soared and traffic flows have been lower than expected. The Dollars 1.7bn road linking Mexico City to Acapulco is a case in point. It cost twice as much as originally projected. Many construction companies involved have been unable to sell off their equity in it and other roads they have built. And the banks involved have been left with about Dollars 1bn of under-performing debt tied to motorways. The main cause of difficulties is the high cost of capital in Mexico. Moreover, many low-paid Mexicans cannot afford to use the privatised facilities, such as roads, which affects turnover and, with it, profitability. With interest rates highly volatile, but averaging about 7-8 per cent in real terms in recent months, investors are willing to lock in capital for only five to 10 years. This has meant they have sought to recoup their capital quickly by setting high motorway tolls - at about 13 cents a kilometre, five times higher than in the US. This has made the roads too expensive for most Mexican truck and car drivers. In an attempt to spread capital costs over a longer period, a category of Mexican infrastructure bond has been introduced. The hope is that, as the economy stabilises, demand for these longer-term bonds will increase. 'Mexicans are not used to thinking about the long-term. But once the economy stabilises, then you can go to long-term financing. We are almost there,' argues Jacques Rogozinski, head of Banobras, the state development bank. In the hope of stimulating a market in private sector financing of roads, the government is to approach international financial markets next month with an offer of Dollars 600m in long-term bonds backed by the state-owned Mexico City-Cuernavaca toll road. These bonds, 'could constitute a multi-billion dollar market in a couple of years, given Mexico's infrastructure needs', suggests Christopher Lee, finance director at Tribasa, Mexico's second-largest construction company. Wall Street investors, however, are not so confident. Fears of a peso devaluation, or an abrupt change in Mexican economic policy when President Salinas steps down next year, make many institutional investors nervous about committing themselves to Mexico. For example, a toll road bond launched last year, and secured on a road between Mexico City and Toluca, attracted little international interest, and about half were unsold initially. 'There is still a large amount of economic and political uncertainty in Mexico and investors are wary,' says Mr Ron Perry, of Public Financial Management, a consultancy in San Francisco. Infrastructure bonds generally face more hurdles than corporate bonds, he argues, since the foreign currency revenues of an infrastructure project can be hard to predict, are sensitive to exchange rate devaluation, and susceptible to price controls or appropriation. Mr Lee says the development of a long-term market for Mexican bonds depends on Mexican foreign debt being promoted from 'junk' to 'investment' grade status by one of the main rating agencies, opening up Mexican paper to many US institutions. Both Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's rate Mexican foreign debt at the equivalent of BB+, one level below 'investment' grade. Until Mexico gains access to long-term debt markets for project finance, bank loans or direct investment may prove the only alternative to bond financing. For now, the government is looking to foreign power companies to foot the bill directly for the planned construction of 40 electricity power plants, each with an output of 350 megawatts, regarded by ministers as necessary to meet future energy demands. Even if the Dollars 18bn needed for these plants is forthcoming, investors are likely to stay clear of Mexico's poorest regions, which are in greatest need of improved roads and water supply systems but whose residents have little money to pay expensive tolls or user fees. After failing to convince any banks to finance a motorway linking one of Mexico's poorest states, Oaxaca, with the capital, the government recently agreed to pay for the Dollars 600m motorway, ironically with proceeds from the recent sale of state-owned television stations. The Oaxaca project highlighted the difficulties of extending the government's free-market principles in the face of Mexico's widespread poverty and inexperience in long-term financing. It also shows that privatisation may not be the straightforward and trouble-free solution to a crumbling infrastructure that the government likes to think.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mexico's top 10 privatisations  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                                       Date              Amount  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex)                Dec 90      Dollars 5.87bn Banco Nacional de Mexico                    Aug 91     Dollars 3.187bn Bancomer                                    Nov 91     Dollars 2.776bn Banca Serfin                                Feb 92      Dollars 911.2m Multibanco Comermex                         Feb 92      Dollars 871.2m Controladora Mexicana de Communicaciones    Jul 93      Dollars 611.9m Banco Mexicano Somex                        Mar 92      Dollars 603.3m Banco Mercantil del Norte                  June 92      Dollars 587.1m Compania Minera de Cananea                 Sept 90        Dollars 475m Banco Internacional                         Jul 92      Dollars 474.4m  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

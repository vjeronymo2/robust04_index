			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Cosalt Losses at Cosalt, the diversified industrial group, were cut from Pounds 906,000 to Pounds 232,000 pre-tax for the year to August 29. Turnover from continuing activities fell from Pounds 62.6m to Pounds 61m. Directors said the group would have returned to profit but for their decision to sell the fishing-related rope, net and twine business which resulted in an above-the-line provision of Pounds 700,000. Exceptional items accounted for Pounds 357,000 (Pounds 2.14m) and interest for Pounds 1.06m (Pounds 1m). Losses per share emerged at 2.7p (7.4p). All comparative figures have been adjusted to conform with FRS 3. A final dividend of 3.25p is to be paid from reserves for a 5.375p (10.75p) total.</p>

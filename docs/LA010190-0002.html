			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY'S PLAN IS GARBAGE;  </P> <P> TRASH DISPOSAL: IF SOMETHING ISN'T DONE QUICKLY, LOS ANGELES CITY RESIDENTS  WILL END UP MAKING UNJUSTIFIED CONCESSIONS.  </P> <P> The County of Los Angeles, which has historically embraced some of the nation's  sharpest land swindles, is out to break new ground in its legacy of shady  real-estate deals.  </P> <P> Purportedly acting to provide a badly needed garbage facility, the Board of  Supervisors has secretly approved a plan that will enrich the county  bureaucracy and a high-powered developer at the expense of Los Angeles city  taxpayers and Santa Monica Mountains park users. Because the City Council  tentatively approved the plan with little public notice or review, aggressive  citizen action is needed to keep it from becoming reality.  </P> <P> The supervisors' plan begins with a worthy enough goal: to construct a readily  accessible, environmentally sound garbage-disposal facility that can meet  countywide needs for half a century. The location, Elsmere Canyon, lies in the  San Gabriel Mountains just north of the city-county line and along the Antelope  Valley Freeway. Virtually all the experts agree that Elsmere is the appropriate  place for the county's major disposal facility.  </P> <P> Rather than seize with principle this opportunity to meet public needs, the  supervisors' program threatens establishment of the dump by attaching illegal  and unwise conditions to Elsmere's use by all county residents. Like an  entrepreneur in control of a hot property, the county sees Elsmere as an  opportunity to maximize profits, broaden its options for future trash disposal  and realize revenge against an old adversary, the city. Taking advantage of its  public power to condemn the Elsmere land, the county seeks to extort  unjustified concessions from city residents.  </P> <P> In particular, the supervisors demand as a condition of dumping Los Angeles  city garbage in Elsmere Canyon:  </P> <P>  -- That dumping in Lopez Canyon be expanded and continued until 1996, even  though the site violates state standards;  </P> <P>  -- That dumping in Sunshine Canyon also be expanded, even though the operation  violates a 25-year-old city permit;  </P> <P>  -- That the city pay an extra "tribute" of at least $1 dollar a ton for  dumping at Elsmere that can be increased at the sole discretion of the county  and its Sanitation District;  </P> <P>  -- That Rustic and Sullivan canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains be sold at  market value, rather than released to park agencies at acquisition costs, as  state law requires. (The sites are no longer suitable for dumping but held in  trust by the county Sanitation District for public recreation.)  </P> <P>  -- That Mission Canyon, county-owned under the same trusteeship as Rustic and  Sullivan canyons, not be released for recreational use but be sold to developer  Ray Watt, providing necessary access to his ambitious and adjacent development.  </P> <P> Extortion of the city is the only glue holding together the Elsmere plan.  County supervisors have been angry ever since the city closed the county's  Mission Canyon garbage site in 1981. The city used its land-use authority to  end dumping at the facility, located within city limits, citing harm done to  surrounding neighbors. In response, the county has prohibited the city from  dumping garbage at county sites open to other municipalities.  </P> <P> This policy of blackmail, designed to force the city to place new garbage dumps  within its borders, regardless of the environmental consequences, did not work  so long as existing city facilities had not reached capacity. But with Lopez  and Sunshine canyons nearing their limits, the extortion becomes more  effective.  </P> <P> Alternative solutions exist that would create a garbage facility for all county  residents, expand recreational opportunities in the Santa Monica Mountains and  end existing conflicts over garbage dumping next to established neighborhoods:  </P> <P>  -- The Elsmere facility, designed to prevent harm to existing neighbors,  should be established as soon as possible;  </P> <P>  -- Elsmere should be open at uniform fees to all residents;  </P> <P> </P> <P>  -- Garbage dumping in Lopez and Sunshine canyons should terminate when current  permits expire;  </P> <P>  -- Rustic, Sullivan and Mission canyons should be transferred to the Santa  Monica Mountains Conservancy for recreation at acquisition cost;  </P> <P>  -- Elsmere's uniform disposal fees should be used to reimburse the county and  its Sanitation District for the transfer of the canyons, because all county  residents will benefit from this new parkland;  </P> <P>  -- The state attorney general should immediately prosecute county officials  who maintain the policy of extortion.  </P> <P> Now that the county's secretly formulated plan has been exposed, citizens and  their representatives at City Hall can force a publicly acceptable substitute.  As shown by its vote last month to require separation of household trash, the  City Council can make sound policy. Los Angeles citizens and their council must  undo the county's attempted swindle of public resources.  </P></p>

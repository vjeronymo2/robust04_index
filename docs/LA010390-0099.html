			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA'S WALKER GETS FRESH START;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: SENIOR CENTER PUTS SCORING SLUMP BEHIND HIM IN PREPARATION  FOR GAME AGAINST USC TONIGHT.  </P> <P> While his starting center struggled to escape a four-week slump, UCLA Coach Jim  Harrick refused to criticize Kevin Walker.  </P> <P> Walker knew, however, that Harrick's patience was wearing thin.  </P> <P> For one thing, Walker was a starter in name only, introduced to the crowd after  pregame warmups, but spending more than half of the next 40 minutes on the  bench.  </P> <P> Then, an assistant coach pulled Walker aside one day and told him what Harrick  would not publicly state, nor even suggest.  </P> <P> "He sat me down and told me that my (limited) production was putting a strain  on (Harrick) keeping me as a starter," Walker said.  </P> <P> He also suggested a meeting.  </P> <P> Last Friday, Walker and Harrick met for more than an hour. Afterward, during a  115-66 rout of East Tennessee State, Walker made six of nine shots, including  three of three from three-point range, and scored a season-high 15 points.  </P> <P> "I think I can definitely use this as a start and consider this the first game  of my season because everything before this was so bad," Walker said Tuesday,  as UCLA (8-1 overall and 2-0 in the Pac-10) prepared to play USC (5-3 and 0-2)  tonight at Pauley Pavilion.  </P> <P> What did Harrick tell him?  </P> <P> "He basically said, 'Your play will dictate your minutes,' so I figured I'd  better start playing a little better and hopefully my minutes and my production  would pick up," Walker said.  </P> <P> Harrick said: "All his problems were mental. He doesn't forget the past and  think about the future."  </P> <P> Last season, when he started all 31 games, Walker averaged almost 10 points,  shooting 46.1% from the field, including 66.7% from three-point range.  </P> <P> A 6-foot-10 shooting guard trapped in a center's body -- he averaged only four  rebounds a game last season and has averaged only three this season -- Walker  helped open the inside for forwards Trevor Wilson and Don MacLean, who between  them averaged 37 points and more than 16 rebounds.  </P> <P> But in UCLA's first eight games this season, Walker averaged only three points,  shooting 29% from the field and making only one of 16 three-point shots.  </P> <P> It got so bad that when Harrick brought him off the bench near the end of last  month's 68-64 victory over Washington State at Pullman, Wash., a fan called out  from the stands: "Thanks, Coach." Walker made only one of seven shots and  scored two points.  </P> <P> "My minutes were starting to dwindle and I didn't want the starting job to be a  consolation prize," Walker said.  </P> <P> More and more, he was pulled in favor of freshman Tracy Murray.  </P> <P> Walker's frustration increased.  </P> <P> "To me, that's not a senior season," Walker said. "I kept thinking how bad the  season was going after I had worked so hard during the summer. I'd think about  it 24 hours a day. I'd play pretty well in practice, but the games would be a  totally different situation.  </P> <P> "I started off the first couple of games not shooting well and when I don't  shoot well, my whole game tends to suffer. I was letting my (poor shooting)  dictate how I was going to play.  </P> <P> "I was still trying to rebound as best I could and defend, but everything  revolved around my shooting because I'm known as a shooter. I just put too much  pressure on myself and I think a game like the other night's can stop all that  and I can think more positively."  </P> <P> A 230-pounder, Walker is two inches taller and 20 pounds heavier than Murray,  who is more suited to play forward than center.  </P> <P> "You need Kevin Walker when you face Chris Munk," Harrick said of USC's 6-9,  230-pound center. "You need him when you face (Louisville's) Felton Spencer and  when you face the (tall lineups) at Arizona State and Arizona."  </P> <P> After what he has been through, Walker is happy to be needed against anybody.  </P></p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Elf acquires BP refining units in West Africa ELF Aquitaine, the acquisition-hungry French oil group, has bought British Petroleum's refining and marketing businesses in West Africa and Tunisia, boosting its position in the region. The deal is the latest in the strategy of Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, Elf's chairman, to increase its downstream activities across the world and to reduce Elf's former over-dependence on exploration and production. It includes more than 650 service stations representing 14 per cent of the regional market and three refineries in Gabon, the Ivory Coast and Senegal. The service stations are in 12 countries across West Africa. This reaffirms Elf's plans to 'reinforce its increasing balance between production and distribution activities'. Elf is not disclosing the price. Elf has substantial exploration and production interests in Africa: in Gabon, Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Niger, Nigeria and Tunisia. It is less strong in marketing there, with 110 service stations in Nigeria, representing 5 per cent of that country's market, but it has interests in refineries in six countries in the region. Elf approached BP, which agreed to sell as part of its policy of focusing on what it considers to be strategic markets. BP said yesterday it did not see the West African assets being built into a core business and had agreed to sell after an approach by Elf. Elf said the price was not material; analysts have estimated it at between Pounds 20m (Dollars 34m) and Pounds 30m. Over the past year, Elf has acquired refineries and service stations in Britain, Spain and Germany, where in January it bought Minol, the former East German service station monopoly. It has actively developed its upstream activities, having bought 48m tonnes of proven reserves last year, which, with 41m tonnes of discoveries lifted total reserves 13.6 per cent to 475m tonnes.</p>

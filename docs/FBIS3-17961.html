			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arif Useynov: "Manats Float"] </F>   [Text] Baku -- The manat -- the national monetary unit of  Azerbaijan -- has had a difficult time. It is losing value not  by the day but by the hour. To cover up this patent devaluation  the National Bank of Azerbaijan periodically sets a new manat  rate against the currencies of the former Union republics.    The initial rate was confusing -- one manat to 10 Russian  rubles [R]. Why not 20? Commercial bank specialists have  reason to call a "ceiling" -- this arbitrarily established rate  has not been borne out by any exchange trading. So what  prompted the new rate of one to 14?    As a rule, attempts to discern the economic laws on which  the  exchange rate is based prove pointless.    On the currency black market -- the famous "Molokanka" (from  the name of a pleasant little square in downtown Baku) -- people  are trading at a rate of R1,000 to 275 manats, paying no  attention to the bankers' sluggishness. The people on the  square do not rule out the possibility that in a month or so a  ruble could be worth the same as a manat.    Hyperinflation has long been part and parcel of the  Azerbaijani economy, forcing the manat into the most improbable  contortions. This was to be expected: Deformations in the  economy seem to happen on their own, and the manat has been left  to its own devices, as if orphaned. Despite the fact that state  property has not been privatized and the mechanism of market  relations has not been fully realized, the new manat has been  allowed to float. No currency can function normally without a  weight of goods to back it -- and home-produced goods at that.  Having failed to make deliveries of output and goods outside  the republic under the clearing system, enterprises have been  deprived of reciprocal shipments worth 6 billion manats. Half  of last year's cotton and grape crops were not harvested.  Meanwhile 80 percent of foodstuffs are bought on the side for  foreign currency -- weak petrodollars. And these are getting  fewer and further between, since oil extraction in the republic  has fallen by 800,000 tonnes.    There is no harm in admitting that home-grown businessmen  are  making a good living from the people's baleful position. The  state owes 22 billion manats in wages and pensions, while  ministries, departments, enterprises, and commercial structures  are keeping R27 billion that they owe to others in Russian bank  accounts, earning fabulous rates of interest.    President Heydar Aliyev has demanded that the leaders of  debtor organizations repatriate forthwith their exported capital  or the products that have been bought with it. Meanwhile  specialists believe that the hidden billions are unlikely to  save the Azerbaijani economy. The following weighty argument is  also quoted: Transactions with Russian banks are not effective  [ne deystvuyut], and the Central Bank of Russia is hardly likely  to agree to such operations, recalling Azerbaijan's large debts.    Has not the time come to print larger-denomination manats?  Those in circulation cannot keep up with galloping prices. The  consignment of manats expected to arrive from France will be  enough to pay the wage and pension backlog.    And the manat continues to float.</p>

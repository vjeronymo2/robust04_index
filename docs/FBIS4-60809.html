			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Golub: "The Fleet Is Not a Hunk of </F> Bread, and You Cannot Divide It in Half. L. Kravchuk in Search  of `Historical Enemy'"]    [Text] Lvov -- As might have been expected, the failure of  the Ukrainian-Russian talks on the parameters of the division of  the Black Sea Fleet is being actively discussed in Ukraine.  Rejecting accusations of revising the Moscow agreements  previously reached by the presidents of the two states,  Ukrainians are pinning the entire responsibility for the  conflict on the Russian side.    Naturally, the fuss that has been raised does not help the  majority of Ukrainian citizens, who are already following all  the divisions ensuing from the Belovezhskaya Forest agreement  with great pain, to remain calm. The only people who have  benefitted from the tension have perhaps been the right-wing,  radically inclined nationalist forces. With support from the  Kiev authorities, they have tried to unleash an appropriate  propaganda campaign. They are presenting the essence of the  problem as the eviction of sovereign Ukraine from its own  territory in Crimea through the "occupation" of the latter by  the Russian Federation Navy. The Ukrainian leadership is being  blamed for serious mistakes in respect of the Black Sea Fleet  and Crimea, which have "made it possible to turn the peninsula  into the bridgehead of Russia's permanent threat of aggression  against the Ukrainian state."    The Ukrainians are also very pained about the results of the  meeting between Pavel Grachev and admirals and officers of the  Black Sea Fleet staff and the promotion in rank of the commander  of Cheleken who, according to the Ukrainian side, took stolen  radiological equipment worth millions of dollars out of Odessa.  Moscow's attempts to include Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov in  the negotiating process are also being received in a mixed way,  to say the least. This attempt may help intensify separatist  moods in Crimea and reinforce Meshkov's own position.    The national democrats are demanding the adoption of  resolute  and tough measures by official Kiev. They insist on restricting  the topics for discussion during the Ukrainian-Russian talks to  no more than the division of the Black Sea Fleet, with the  gradual withdrawal of all Russian military structures from  Ukrainian territory, which, in their opinion, is the main object  of the claims of the neighboring state. By trying to impose on  Russia a territory outside Ukraine by way of a permanent main  base for the Black Sea Fleet, for example Novorossiysk, people  here are trying to create problems for Moscow with the so-called  "floating stock." The Ukrainian authorities do not agree with  the assertion made by P. Grachev during a press conference that  the Ukrainian Navy has seized 126 Black Sea Fleet ships, and  apart from that, a 20-percent share seemed too small for the  infrastructure of the fleet.    Strange as it may seem, the explosive situation has proved  advantageous to Leonid Kravchuk in terms of settling his own  domestic problems. And if it does not prove possible to put a  stop to the early elections, which do not bode well for the  president, then the chance remains of least somehow keeping  afloat, using the image of savior of the nation and the state in  the face of intervention by the "historical enemy," which is on  the point of beginning tomorrow. That, perhaps, is precisely  where one of the roots of the conflict lies. That is why,  despite the statement made by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense  Press Service on its readiness to resume the negotiating process  at any time, to be honest, there is not much certainty that this  will happen.</p>

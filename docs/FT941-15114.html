			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Treuhand in big east German utility sale The Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, will tomorrow sell a majority stake of a large eastern German utility group to PreussenElektra, the electricity division of Veba, and Germany's second largest utility company. The sale, which follows a long drawn out dispute about ownership rights of eastern Germany's utility assets, will be followed by the privatisation of the region's remaining 14 utility groups to RWE and Bayernwerk, western Germany's other two largest utility companies. PreussenElektra, which owns and operates nuclear, hard coal, and brown coal power stations, will acquire the eastern German regional utilities of Frankfurt/ Oder, Magdeburg, Neubran-denburg, Potsdam and Rostock. It is expected to invest at least DM800m (Pounds 312.5m) in the modernising and upgrading of the power stations. Veba and its other subsidiaries plan to invest DM8.4bn in eastern Germany over the next four years. The sale will give Preussen-Elektra a virtual monopoly over the generation and distribution of electricity in the region as a result of the Stromvertrag, or Electricity Contract signed in 1990 between the former east German and west German governments. Under the terms of the contract, west Germany's utility companies are legally permitted to own 51 per cent of eastern Germany's fifteen utilities groups, with the remaining 49 per cent held by the municipalities. However, in order to underwrite investments of about DM46bn by western German utilities, the contract stipulated that eastern Germany's regional utilities must, over the next 20 years, buy 70 per cent of their energy from Veag, eastern Germany's largest major utility company. This group is controlled by western Germany's eight electricity companies, including Preus-senElektra. However, Veba officials said that although PreussenElektra will enjoy a virtual monopoly, they added that the company fears increasing competition from the gas sector, as well as a continuing decline in energy consumption. Energy consumption in eastern Germany has fallen 40 per cent since 1989 largely due to the collapse of manufacturing.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STATE REJECTS APPEAL FOR SPRAYING EXEMPTION  </P> <P> State agricultural officials on Wednesday turned down an appeal by Pomona Mayor  Donna Smith to exempt her city from aerial spraying of malathion because of  earthquake damage to roofs and chimneys in the area.  </P> <P> Portions of Pomona are scheduled to be sprayed tonight as part of the state's  Medfly eradication effort.  </P> <P> Smith said she believes malathion could pose a health risk if it enters homes  damaged in last week's Upland quake.  </P> <P> State agricultural officials toured Pomona Wednesday afternoon and met with  city officials before deciding to proceed.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Azusa, which, like Pasadena, has banned low-altitude formation  flying, officials have asked for the use of a Pasadena police helicopter during  spraying Friday. Pasadena officials agreed to fly an Azusa police officer into  the spray zone, where the officer will inform state helicopter pilots of the  city ordinance and inquire whether they intend to continue spraying.  </P></p>

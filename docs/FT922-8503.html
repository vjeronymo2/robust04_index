			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Holmes Protection improves restructuring terms HOLMES PROTECTION, the US security company, yesterday said it had improved the terms of a restructuring agreement with its lenders and expects to announce a crucial Dollars 37m (Pounds 21m) share issue next month. The company, which does most of its business in the US but has a London quotation, first agreed a restructuring in February with seven North American institutions which are owed Dollars 70.5m on loans now in default. New management, under the chairmanship of Sir Ian MacGregor, former chairman of British Steel, still has to raise at least Dollars 27m through the share sale in order to remain a going concern. The new deal involves the lenders swapping their debt into a minimum of 19 per cent of the equity in return for Dollars 28m raised in the share sale. The earlier agreement envisaged lenders taking 15 per cent in return for a payment of Dollars 33.5m. The new structure will give Holmes an additional Dollars 5m of working capital and was good for shareholders, said Mr Eric Kohn, chief executive. The seven lending institutions have also agreed to subscribe up to Dollars 10m of the Dollars 37m share issue if necessary, which would leave them with a 40 per cent stake in Holmes. Under the new deal, lenders will also hold unquoted warrants equivalent to 5 per cent of the enlarged capital. These can be exercised at the issue price after 12 months. Smith Barney Harris Upham, the US securities house, is acting as agent for the US private placement; Peel Hunt is acting as the company's stockbroker; and Brown Shipley, the London Merchant bank, is sponsoring the deal which still requires shareholder approval.</p>

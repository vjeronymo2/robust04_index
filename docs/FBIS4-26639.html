			<p>BFN     [Text] The Gansu Provincial Economic and Trade Commission,  the Gansu Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China, and  the Gansu Provincial Branch of the Industrial and Commercial  Bank of China jointly issued a circular yesterday, calling on  financial and banking departments at all levels in Gansu to  provide loans to state-owned industrial enterprises so as to  guarantee them sufficient circulating funds.    The circular also laid out specific measures for providing  loss-making state-owned industrial enterprises with bank loans,  stipulating: State-owned industrial enterprises which are  capable of producing readily marketable products and generating  good economic results but lack circulating funds, shall apply to  specialized banks for loans so as to acquire sufficient  circulating funds. The local economic and trade commissions at  all levels across the province shall take the initiative to  assist the relevant specialized banks to investigate and verify  the operational needs of state-owned industrial enterprises.  Furthermore, the specialized banks shall actively assist  state-owned industrial enterprises in this connection,  particularly those enterprises that are capable of producing  marketable products and generating better economic results,  thereby enabling loss-making state-owned industrial enterprises  to resume normal operations at an earlier date. Nevertheless,  the circular stated, different situations should be handled in  different fashions. For example, specialized banks shall  provide proper assistance to state-owned industrial enterprises  capable of reducing losses or turning losses into profits before  the end of this year, thereby helping them tide over the current  difficulties as quickly as possible.    The circular noted: Under the leadership of the local party  committees and people's governments, economic and trade  commissions at all levels across the province shall cooperate  with the specialized banks and departments in charge of  enterprises in amalgamating and combining long-standing  loss-making state-owned industrial enterprises that are  incapable of repaying bank loans or cutting losses in order to  enable these enterprises to either transform their production  lines, develop readily marketable products, or engage in  tertiary industrial development. Those state-owned industrial  enterprises that are unable to improve operations after being  amalgamated or combined should be declared bankrupt without  delay in accordance with the law. In so doing, the circular  stated, appropriate measures should be adopted to guarantee the  basic livelihood of the staff and workers.</p>

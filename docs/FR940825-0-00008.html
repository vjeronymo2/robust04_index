			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  APHIS has not accurately characterized the potential economic impact on domestic growers of allowing the import of various fruits and vegetables. Specifically, APHIS has failed to note the significant economic impact on Florida tomato growers of allowing tomato imports from Almeria, Spain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, APHIS has underestimated the economic impact on California artichoke growers of allowing artichoke imports from Argentina and South Africa. Also, by using the price elasticity for fresh vegetables in general to determine the impact of artichoke imports on domestic artichoke prices, APHIS has underestimated the potential economic impact, especially on California growers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Spanish officials estimate that tomato imports from Almeria into the United States will range from 440,000 to 660,000 pounds. These imports will occur from December to April and overlap Florida's tomato season, which is November through June. If the volume of tomatoes to be imported from the Almeria Province were to reach 660,000 pounds, it would constitute only about 0.039 percent of Florida's tomato production for the fresh market (estimated at 1.7 billion pounds in 1993 by the National Agricultural Statistics Service). We anticipate, therefore, that the economic impact of these imports on Florida growers will not be significant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We continue to support our original contention (explained below) that allowing artichokes to be imported into the United States from Argentina and South Africa will not have a significant economic impact on domestic artichoke growers. A price elasticity specifically for artichokes is not available. Regardless, we anticipate that the maximum possible artichoke imports from Argentina will constitute less than one-tenth of one percent of both domestic production and domestic total supply. Moreover, California growers account for nearly all domestic artichoke production. Therefore, we anticipate that these imports will not have a significant economic impact on California growers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  APHIS has proposed to allow ivy gourd ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coccinia grandis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) from Jamaica to be imported into the United States without recognizing the pestiferous nature of ivy gourd. The State of Hawaii has declared ivy gourd to be a noxious weed and established a statewide eradication program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are adopting this provision of the proposal as part of the final rule without change, as we do not recognize the ivy gourd as a noxious weed under either the Federal Noxious Weed Act or the Federal Seed Act. Furthermore, we do not anticipate that ivy gourd from Jamaica will be imported to Hawaii.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  APHIS is proposing to allow the importation of dasheen ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Colocasia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spp.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alocasia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spp., and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Xanthosoma <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spp.) from Indonesia without sampling for exotic nematodes, thus risking the introduction of exotic nematodes into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In many tubers, including dasheen, parasitic nematodes produce symptoms through their feeding on the cellular contents of the plant; breakdown of tissue is followed by the invasion of secondary fungi and bacteria, causing necrotic lesions to develop. These necrotic and decayed tissues are obvious, visible symptoms that an inspector would look for during an inspection. Therefore, we continue to believe that, for dasheen, visual inspection is adequate to prevent the introduction of nematodes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  APHIS is proposing to allow blueberries ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vaccinium <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spp.) to be imported from Ecuador and Peru into the United States after treatment only for Medfly. APHIS should not allow blueberries from Ecuador and Peru to be imported until they have undertaken entomological and pathological studies to determine whether other pests may be introduced by the imports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Prior to proposing that blueberries from Ecuador and Peru be allowed into the United States, APHIS researched the pests afflicting blueberries in those countries. Results of that research indicated that blueberries may be imported into the United States after treatment only for Medfly with little or no risk of introducing exotic plant pests. We believe that visual inspection of the blueberries by APHIS upon arrival will detect the presence of any pests other than Medfly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  APHIS has proposed to allow fresh litchi ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Litchi chinensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) from Taiwan to be imported into the United States subject to cold treatment only for fruit flies of the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bactrocera <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and for the litchi fruit borer,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conopomorpha sinensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Other exotic pests, not affected by this treatment, may be introduced, including those which infest litchi stems and leaves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Prior to proposing that litchi from Taiwan be allowed into the United States, APHIS researched the pests afflicting litchi in Taiwan. Results of that research indicated that litchi from Taiwan may be imported into the United States after the prescribed cold treatment with little or no risk of introducing exotic plant pests. We believe that visual inspection of litchi by APHIS upon arrival will detect the presence of any pests other than those killed by the treatment. As for pests afflicting litchi roots and stems, APHIS will only allow litchi fruit into the United States; litchi stems and leaves will be prohibited from entering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The cold treatment proposed for litchi will not effectively eradicate infestations of fruit flies of the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bactrocera <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or the litchi fruit borer,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conopomorpha sinensis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Furthermore, APHIS needs to specify where cold treatment of fresh litchi from Taiwan will be conducted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Research conducted by Taiwanese agricultural agencies, the results of which were reviewed and confirmed by USDA, show that the cold treatment proposed for litchi will effectively eradicate infestations of fruit flies of the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bactrocera <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the litchi fruit borer,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conopomorpha sinensis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Also, the regulations under &sect;319.56&hyph;2d require that fruit and vegetables requiring cold treatment as a condition of entry into the United States undergo cold treatment either prior to arriving in the United States or upon arrival at designated U.S. ports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Taiwanese litchi growers currently use pesticides not approved in the United States. Imported fresh litchi from Taiwan therefore may contain residues of these pesticides and pose a public health risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) samples and tests imported fruit and vegetables for pesticide residues. If residue of a pesticide unapproved in the United States is found in a shipment of imported fruit or vegetables, the shipment is denied entry into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

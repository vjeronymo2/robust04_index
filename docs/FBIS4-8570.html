			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 12 April 12 (MTI) -- After Romanian  Government complaints about Hungarian politician Geza Entz's  visit to Romania, a Hungarian Government spokesman said today  that Romania had made no objections beforehand to the visit's  itinery, and that requiring a visa for a diplomatic  passport-holder went against both international practice and the  Hungarian-Romanian no visa agreement. Both President of the  Romanian Assembly of Deputies Adrian Nastase, and the Romanian  Foreign Ministry spokesman, have raised objections since a visit  by Hungarian State Secretary Geza Entz to Romania.    The Hungarian spokesman, Janos Herman, said the visit had  been coordinated in advance with the Romanian Foreign Ministry,  and Hungary had also announced that, for the Hungarian  President, Entz would decorate church dignitaries living in  Romania who were persecuted for their sympathy with the 1956  Hungarian revolution.    The Romanian Foreign Ministry was also informed that the  State Secretary would meet leaders of the Hungarian Democratic  Union of Romania, on the basis of their invitation. With this,  the Hungarian Embassy in Bucharest met the prescriptions of the  1961 Vienna agreement on diplomatic relations.    No objections came from the Romanian side. In the light of  the circumspect proceedings, the Hungarian foreign affairs  spokesman found incomprehensible the remarks made by the  spokesman of the Romanian Foreign Ministry at his press briefing  on March 30.    Regarding semi-official remarks made about compulsory visas  for Hungarian diplomatic passports, Herman said it is a well  known fact that the bilateral visa agreement does not make it  possible to unilaterally suspend it. And Hungary is not aware  of any Romanian proposal to amend this.    Even so, introducing compulsory visas for diplomatic  passports, while upholding the no visa obligation for private  passports, would be unparalleled in international practice, he  continued.    The spokesman also added that the Hungarian Foreign Ministry  would not, for its part, see it as desirable to introduce  compulsory visas for Romanian citizens entering Hungary with  diplomatic passports. Romanian citizens with valid and regular  travel documents will be able to enter Hungary without central  controls, and then meet anyone in Hungary.    The Hungarian Foreign Ministry hopes no statements of  similarly unusual tone and content will burden  Hungarian-Romanian relations in the future, and that an  atmosphere can be created in which talks begun on the bilateral  basic treaty can continue.    Herman declined to speculate on a date for signing the basic  treaty. He said his aim was to settle genuine problems.    In answer to another question, Herman confirmed that a  possible visit of Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat to Budapest  was raised, but no agreement has been reached as to its date.</p>

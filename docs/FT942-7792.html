			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Arts: Self-indulgent attitude - William Packer finds Spanish conceptualism in Manchester all too familiar To enter the exhibition, Ideas &amp; Attitudes, at Manchester's Cornerhouse, is to go back in time. The work may have come from the far-away-and-long-ago of Spain in the 1970s and General Franco's declining years, yet how familiar it all seems, and how comfortably old-fashioned. Switch a few names, English for Spanish - Keith Arnatt, John Hilliard, Tony Carter, Stuart Brisley, Rita Donagh or Michael Craig-Martin for Josefina Miralles, Antoni Muntadas, Carles Pujol, Jordi Benito, Pere Noguera or Benet Rossell - and would we notice a difference? Not much. Those were the days, as though Dada and Surrealism had yet to be dreamt of, Duchamp yet to rip the bowl from the lavatory wall. Ideas &amp; Attitudes catches exactly the lost, earnest innocence of the times, for the Idea was most certainly the thing. Art assuredly had to be about something, that wonderfully empty phrase still the mantra of the more advanced of our art schools. It was all so simple. Take an idea, any idea, and strike an attitude about it, and the form, the realisation, would look after itself. Thus at last was the tyranny of technique broken. All one needed were a few snaps for illustration, or some plastic bags to fill with nail-clippings or pubic hair, or, as we have here, rubber bands, tooth-picks, post-cards, postage stamps . . . (Eugenia Balcells). Or what about putting some notices in the papers, to see what response we get (Grup de Treball)? Or filling in a map with mud (Pere Noguera)? Or throwing oneself against a brick wall and bouncing off again, with photographs to prove it (Jordi Benito)? Or floating the letters SCULPTURA in a tank of water (Damien, I mean Francesc Torres)? A number of the ideas are bright enough. Josefina Miralles, who solemnly shows herself standing thigh-high in the earth, or turning by simple stages into a woman of straw, has also made herself a pair of shoes that prints her name as she walks along. Francesc Abad goes through his 'Actions with Air, Fire and Water' with dead-pan simplicity, breathing into a glass, lighting a cigarette, having a drink. Jordi Pablo's stone has a handle by which to pick it up, his bread a hinge by which to break it. 'What goes through the head?' asks Jordi Cerda, with headshots to show us, and a motor-bike, a rubber glove, a basket, the Tower of Pisa, variously sprouting from his cranium. Ferran Garcia Sevilla has a rubber stamp which reads 'Art Es Just Un Mot'. Indeed it is. In the lower gallery, Catalonia Incognita is a small show of conventional modern painting and sculpture from around the city of Girona. Only when we read in the publicity that 'perhaps (its) most fascinating aspect is its faith in traditional disciplines; painting, drawing and sculpture', do the eyebrows rise a notch or two. There are several rather good abstract paintings that are yet redolent of landscape, and among the sculpture a piece cast in aluminium, by Xicu Cabanyes, that besides being deeply in Moore's debt, was clearly modelled in the old way. But as for tradition, of drawing there is nothing at all, unless some linear gestures in a few paintings count as drawing. And while the thick impasto surfaces of Patxe are entirely acceptable, and Montserrat Costa's thinner washes rather lovely and effective, such works are traditional only in the sense that the paint is still being laid on a flat surface, and with some competence. Reference to the external and visible world? The critical measuring of the thing seen against the mark made, and the mark made against the mark intended? Forget it. For the mark made we go on to Antoni Tapies at the City Art Galleries, and a show of his Profound Certainties of 1991. And again of critical self-measurement there is nothing, but only self-indulgence. It is sad to have to say as much, for Tapies remains a serious and significant artist on the strength of his work of the 1950s and 60s, bleak and physical abstraction, heavy with ambiguous symbolism. All we have now, it seems, are these vacuous graphic exercises on unstretched and grubby sheets of synthetic fabric, curling off the wall. Even these evince still a certain natural painterly delicacy and an educated hand, but such qualities, alone and unwitting, are not enough. The mystery is only how it is that an artist of such proven quality should now imagine his every move, his every gesture, take it or leave it, to be fraught with significance. His dealers and curators, perhaps, have told him so.

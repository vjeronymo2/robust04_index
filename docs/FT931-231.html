			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / London Transport warns on spending LONDON'S BUSES as well as its Underground will suffer under government spending cuts in the coming financial year, London Transport warned in its annual business plan published yesterday. The plan says London Transport's programme of improvements has had to be sharply cut because of a 30 per cent reduction in government grant from Pounds 768m in 1992-93 to Pounds 540m in 1993-94. Sir Wilfrid Newton, London Transport's chairman, says in the report: 'Having raised the expectations of passengers, suppliers and staff, London Transport is now faced with the prospect of cutting back programmes, winding down project teams and releasing skilled resources.' One casualty will be an extension to the dot-matrix passenger information system at bus stops, introduced last November on one route. The system will now be delayed. The biggest project still going ahead this year will be the upgrading of the Central Line, which involves the introduction of new trains and a resignalling of much of the route. But similar work on the Northern Line has been postponed. The planned extension of the Jubilee Line to Docklands remains uncertain because a funding scheme has still not been agreed with the private sector. Annual Business Plan 1993-94.

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / French unemployment up Unemployment in France rose 15,200 to 3.34m in August, offsetting the improvement of the previous two months, according to statistics published by the labour ministry. Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, described the increase, which left the overall unemployment rate at 12.6 per cent, as a 'hitch along the way'. He said that the reduction in unemployment ahead of presidential elections next spring, was an uneven process. The centre-right government of prime minister Edouard Balladur is counting on such a reduction. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said this week that between 260,000 and 300,000 jobs would be created in 1995.</p>

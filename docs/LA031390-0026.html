			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COURT OFFICIALS ARREST WOMAN, SEIZE PISTOL  </P> <P> A 35-year-old Los Angeles woman was arrested Monday after an X-ray machine  detected a small-caliber handgun in her purse as she entered the Van Nuys  Municipal Courthouse, officials said.  </P> <P> Valerie Denise Richburg was taken into custody without resistance at about 7:30  a.m. after courthouse security officers found a .25-caliber semiautomatic  pistol in her handbag, said Los Angeles County Safety Officer Kim Murray.  </P> <P> Richburg told security officers she came to court to pay a traffic ticket and  forgot to remove the weapon, said Murray. She said she began carrying the gun  for protection after someone threatened her in a business dispute, Murray said.  </P> <P> Richburg was arrested on suspicion of carrying a deadly weapon in a courthouse,  a felony, and held in Van Nuys Jail in lieu of $5,360 bail, Murray said.  </P> <P> Murray said Richburg does not have a concealed-weapons permit. She has no  criminal record and the gun was not stolen, he added.  </P> <P> The X-ray machine and a metal detector were installed in the municipal  courthouse in response to a March, 1988, incident in which a man with a history  of mental problems held a prosecutor hostage. The man, Jeremey Sigmond, a  Woodland Hills chiropractor, was shot to death and a bailiff was wounded in an  ensuing gun battle.  </P> <P> It was the fourth time a gun has been confiscated since the courthouse opened  13 months ago, said county Safety Police Officer Robert Reynolds.  </P></p>

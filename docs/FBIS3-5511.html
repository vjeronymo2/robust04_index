Nakamura, 44, a House of  Representatives member of the main opposition Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP), is suspected of taking a 10 million yen kickback  from leading general contractor Kajima Corp. in January 1992,  investigative sources said.    Prosecutors applied for a warrant of arrest for Nakamura  from  the Tokyo District Court. Nakamura has repeatedly refused to  voluntarily face questioning, the sources said.    The prosecution's request for Diet permission to arrest a  legislator is the 15th in the postwar period and the first since  a 1967 case involving taxi operators in Osaka and a then LDP  member.    The cabinet approved the arrest permit issued by the Tokyo  District Court. [passage omitted]    The lower house will hold a plenary session to decide  whether  to give the go-ahead to Nakamura's arrest.    Prosecutors of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors'  Office,  meanwhile, raided Nakamura's office in Tokyo's Chiyoda ward and  the head office of the Japan Federation of Construction  Contractors, a major association of builders, on Tuesday  afternoon to search for evidence, the sources said.    Prosecutors have also rearrested Shinji Kiyoyama, a former  senior vice president of Kajima. [passage omitted]</p>

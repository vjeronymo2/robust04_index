			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Maxwell disaster's silver lining: Norma Cohen investigates growing pressure for reform of pensions law IF THERE is any irony in the death of Robert Maxwell, it may well be that he has inspired an overhaul of UK pensions law giving future workers the security and comfort in retirement that he denied his own employees. The disappearance of about Pounds 400m from pension funds he controlled has sparked calls from all quarters for pension reform. Most recently, the UK's most influential group of employers has given its support for new laws designed to make schemes more secure. It is widely acknowledged that employers' support will be necessary to secure genuine reform of UK pensions law. The 100 Group of Finance Directors, which includes 145 of Britain's largest companies, is preparing to publish the results of a survey of members which broadly endorses calls for pensions reform. It supports demands for tighter controls on fund assets and suggests a 'code of conduct' for pension fund trustees. In particular, it urges trustees to ban investment managers from purchasing 'shares, bonds or other assets' of the company or of the investment manager itself. Furthermore, the report urges pension funds to disclose more about their affairs to members and urges that trustees hold an annual general meeting for beneficiaries at which their actions could be subject to questioning and challenge. The survey covers companies controlling about Pounds 97bn in assets, about a third of all UK pension fund assets. However, the report contains a stiff warning to those arguing that pension reforms should clearly state that surpluses  - built up by successive years of high investment returns  - are the sole property of fund members. 'The lack of clarity as to who owns the surplus often works to the advantage of the members for it can mean that employers are willing to see their pension schemes well funded in the confidence that surpluses arising are not irrevocably 'lost' to the employer,' the report concludes. It goes on to say that if employers are forbidden from securing surpluses for their own use, they will fund schemes less generously and possibly place benefits at risk. The consequences of this would have significant fiscal ramifications. Unlike most European Community countries, the UK relies heavily on voluntary employer-sponsored schemes to provide retirement income. Indeed, says Mr Alan Jenkinson, policy director at pensions consultants Noble Lowndes, a cut in employer-sponsored benefits would be likely to spur political demands for more generous state pension benefits. Significantly, 100 Group members overwhelmingly believe that surpluses should be shared between plan sponsors and beneficiaries. Seventy-four of the 91 companies surveyed said they would either use a surplus to take a contributions holiday or repay some of it to the company. An equal number would also enhance benefits to members. Only 6 of the companies said they would rule out an improvement in benefits while 50 were against repaying some of the surplus to the company. However, employers show little enthusiasm for suggestions that employees should have a greater say in pension fund activities. The National Association of Pension Funds has called for at least half of each scheme's trustees to be either independent or representatives of members. The 100 Group found only nine companies among its members which had employee or independent trustees. The overwhelming majority have a trustee body on which decision-making is in effect controlled by company representatives. Employers also expressed a desire to be able to use their surpluses to reward their executives more generously. Most members supported lifting the government's Pounds 60,000 ceiling on the portion of salary which can be taken into calculation for pension purposes. More than half of those surveyed had replaced their fund manager within the previous five years because of poor investment performance.</p>

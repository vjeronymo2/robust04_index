			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Europe's biotech sector 'is lagging US through lack of investment' Europe's biotechnology industry is falling behind its competitors in the US because of lack of investment and unhelpful regulation, according to Professor Horst Schlumberger, head of Biotechnology Co-ordination at Bayer, the German chemicals company. Mr Schlumberger said that if the current level of investment in Europe was not reversed, scientific talent would be unable to renew itself. He told delegates at the second day of a Financial Times biotechnology conference in London that the consequence would be an erosion of the competitive strength of Europe's research-dependent industries. 'Europe will become a net importer, not a producer and exporter of products of modern biotechnology,' he said. His argument was countered by Mr Jurgen Drews, president of international research and development at Roche, the Swiss drugs company. Mr Drews said that European governments spent more than the US on funding basic research, which forms the foundation for the next series of medical advances. This meant that the present US lead in biotechnology could be 'eroded over the long term', said Mr Drews. In a lively debate, Mr Schlumberger said this was like having a modern luxury limousine parked outside one's home, but the regulatory constraints in Europe meant 'its fuel is of low quality and it cannot fulfil its potential.' In an earlier session, Mr Carl Feldbaum, head of the Washington-based Biotechnology Industry Organisation, said that Mr Newt Gingrich, Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, had stated his intention to dismantle the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA controls which drugs are approved to sale in the US, the world's biggest medicines market. The FDA has been criticised in the pharmaceuticals industry and among conservative politicians for its slowness and bureaucracy. 'Many in the biotechnology industry hope it (the dismantling) comes true,' said Mr Feldbaum. But Mr Feldbaum, a former chief-of-staff for Republican senator Arlen Specter, advised caution. He said there was only a small window of opportunity for substantive legislation before politicians' attention turned to the 1996 presidential elections. In his opening address, Mr Drews forecast that gene therapy, which uses DNA as a medicine, would take the place of many conventional drugs. He held out a vision of a drug which need only be taken once a year rather than daily for diseases such as Parkinsonism and Alzheimers.</p>

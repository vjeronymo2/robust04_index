			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HORNETS WIN ON RAMBIS' SHOT AT BUZZER, 89-88  </P> <P> Kurt Rambis, noted for his rebounding and not for his scoring ability, would  not be the likely candidate to take the last shot with time running out and his  team trailing by a point.  </P> <P> And while that wasn't part of the game plan, it was Rambis who grabbed a loose  ball and scored at the buzzer Thursday night, giving the Charlotte Hornets an  89-88 victory over the Utah Jazz at Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> "I knew it was good because I was standing right under the red light that went  off with the buzzer," said Rambis, who scored 8 points and grabbed 15 rebounds.  </P> <P> Utah had gone in front, 88-87, on a basket by Eric Leckner with 47 seconds  remaining. After misses by both teams, the Hornets called time out with 8  seconds left.  </P> <P> Kelly Tripucka inbounded to Michael Holton, who drove the left baseline but had  his shot blocked. Rambis picked up the ball and gave his team the victory.  </P> <P> "Michael didn't want to take the jumper, so he drove to the basket and got his  shot blocked," Rambis said. "The ball bounced into my hands, and I just put it  up and in as time ran out."  </P> <P> Rambis faces his former team tonight when the Hornets play the Lakers at the  Forum.  </P> <P> Tripucka, returning to Utah for the first time since being picked in the  expansion draft by Charlotte, said the last play was designed for him.  </P> <P> "I was going to take it to the hole, but Holton was wide open, and I thought he  would jump it in," Tripucka said. "But he took it inside. Fortunately, Kurt was  in the right place at the right time."  </P> <P> The Hornets' win, only their third on the road this season against 18 losses,  ended a 4-game losing streak. The Jazz, meanwhile, lost for only the third time  at home.  </P> <P> Denver 129, Miami 108 -- Alex English scored 34 points, and Walter Davis came  off the bench for 17 to lead Denver past the Heat at Miami.  </P> <P> Davis scored all of his points in the second half and 13 during a 20-5  fourth-quarter run that sealed the victory, which ended a 4-game losing streak.  The Nuggets had lost their 9 previous games on the road.  </P> <P> Denver played with only eight players after a trade earlier in the day sent  Calvin Natt and Jay Vincent to the San Antonio Spurs for David Greenwood and  Darwin Cook. Greenwood and Cook did not make it to Miami in time for the game.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 127, Portland 109 -- Larry Krystkowiak scored a career-high 31  points, and Ricky Pierce came off the bench to add 25 as the Bucks won at  Portland.  </P> <P> Washington 126, Indiana 106 -- The Pacers lost at Landover, Md., to match the  Miami Heat for the worst road record in the National Basketball Assn. at 1-19.  </P> <P> The Bullets, playing the second half without Coach Wes McLeod who was suffering  back spasms, led by as many as 23 points early in the third period.  </P> <P> Sacramento 112, New Jersey 109 -- Kenny Smith had 24 points and 10 assists, and  rookie Rick Berry scored 20 points as the Kings won at East Rutherford, N.J.  </P></p>

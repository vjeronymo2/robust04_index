			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- China launched a green  certificate training project today in an ambitious drive to  educate millions of its farmers in applied technical theories  and expertise in agriculture.    The project, set in motion after the approval of the State  Council, is designed to incorporate scientific and technological  advances with China's agricultural development.    "The implementation of the project is in line with  establishing a socialist market system in rural China and  promoting a high-yield, high-quality and high-efficiency  agriculture," said Deputy Agriculture Minister Zhang Yanxi.    "It is an undertaking that will be beneficial to the country  and the people, to our generation and future generations," he  said at a press conference today.    The green certificate was referred to as a proof of a  farmer's knowledge, expertise and other necessary qualifications  for a certain technical job in agriculture.    It will normally take two years of successful completion of  theoretical as well as practical study in a certain subject  before a farmer can be awarded a green certificate, issued by  the Agriculture Ministry. But for some specialties, such as  plantation and husbandry, the study period will be longer.    China has a 430-million-strong rural labor force, out of a  total of 900 million rural population. Farmers' poor education  in science and technology is regarded as a major obstacle to the  development of China's agricultural productivity.    The booming of the rural economy calls for a new generation  of farmers, better equipped with scientific knowledge and  technical expertise, thus necessitating vocational technical  training for farmers who have already undergone secondary or  high school studies.    Initial work for the farmers' green certificate training  program began as early as 1990, with experimentation being  carried out in 362 counties in 29 provinces and municipalities  across China.    So far the number of trainees has totalled more than  300,000,  over 80,000 of whom have obtained green certificates, according  to the Agriculture Ministry.    Under the project, about 2 million farmers will be trained  to  be qualified for the green certificates during the 1990-1995  period. By 2000, an estimated 8 million to 10 million trainees  are to become green certificate holders -- which means one for  every 20 households in rural China.    The green certificate system covers sectors such as  plantation, agricultural machinery, management of rural  cooperative economy and rural environmental protection.    The green certificate holders will be in a better position  for contracts and loans, technical instruction, agricultural  information and necessary government support.    At present less than 40 percent of China's agricultural  research results in agriculture can be applied and popularized  in the vast countryside. The government has vowed to raise the  ratio to 60 percent by the turn of this century.    This makes the green certificate system even more meaningful  because those trained are expected to bridge the gap between  researchers and millions of farmers, Zhang said.</p>

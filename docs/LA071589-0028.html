			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VAN NUYS JURY STUDIES LIABILITY;  </P> <P> BLAME IN MOLESTATION WEIGHED  </P> <P> As a police matter, the facts of the case seemed clear.  </P> <P> A 6-year-old boy reported that he had been with two elders from his Torrance  church on a Sunday afternoon mission to Harbor Convalescent Hospital when a man  he had never seen before lured him into a treatment room and sexually molested  him.  </P> <P> The boy said he will never forget his attacker -- a toothless, bearded man with  horribly swollen legs that were covered with open sores.  </P> <P> That description pointed investigators to Alfred Ray Hatch, a mentally  disturbed patient at the hospital, who admitted that he molested the boy,  sheriff's detectives said.  </P> <P> That was more than five years ago, and authorities say the 52-year-old  schizophrenic, who was committed to a state mental hospital for an indefinite  period after a competency hearing, probably will never face criminal charges.  </P> <P> But the question of who should be held accountable for the assault has not been  entirely resolved.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Van Nuys Trial  </P> <P> A Van Nuys Superior Court jury last week began deliberating the question of  whether the administration and staff of Harbor Convalescent Hospital should  share the blame for the assault. No verdict had been reached by Friday;  deliberations will resume Monday.  </P> <P> In closing arguments Tuesday, lawyer Richard Farnell asked the jury to award  more than $10 million in damages to the boy, now 12, and his mother. Farnell  argued that the hospital was negligent because it let the boy wander unattended  down its hallways on Jan. 22, 1984.  </P> <P> The boy "is going to have to live with this for the rest of his life," Farnell  said. "This is probably the most horrible series of events you will ever hear  about."  </P> <P> But Ray Moore, representing the hospital, argued that the attack could not have  been foreseen and that the hospital could not properly treat patients if it had  to constantly police its visitors. "The real question is: Did the hospital  properly balance security with its therapeutic duties?" Moore said. "This was  an open facility, not a prison."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Warning Given  </P> <P> Moore said Hatch was transferred to Harbor Convalescent Hospital from another  facility that gave no warning that he might be dangerous.  </P> <P> Moore also contested assertions by the boy's mother that he was a normal child  before the attack. Moore said he presented witnesses who said the boy had a  history of behavioral problems and learning disabilities that dated back to the  age of 2.  </P> <P> The lawsuit filed by the boy and his mother, who now live in Huntington Beach,  originally included a second defendant, Faith of Our Fathers Church in  Torrance.  </P> <P> On the day of the alleged attack, the youngster went to the convalescent  hospital with two church members for a regular Sunday prayer meeting with  patients. The lawsuit charged that the church, now called the Living Word  Fellowship, was partly liable for the assault because the two parishioners left  the boy unattended while they conducted the prayer meeting.  </P> <P> The mother sometimes left the boy in the care of other parishioners.  </P> <P> But the church was dropped from the lawsuit last month when it agreed to a  settlement, without admitting liability. The church will pay the boy and his  mother $200,000 each immediately and guarantee that the youngster will receive  at least $600,000 more. The future payment will be reduced by any damages that  the convalescent hospital is ordered to pay, said the church's lawyer, Tony  Serritella.  </P> <P> Serritella had argued that the Torrance congregation could not be held liable  because the hospital visits were the personal ministry of the two men and not  church-sanctioned events.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Church Denies Liability  </P> <P> "The church still denies any liability in this matter," Serritella said. "The  settlement was a financial decision by the church's insurance carriers."  </P> <P> Farnell argued Tuesday that Harbor Convalescent Hospital, 21521 S. Vermont Ave.  in the Harbor Gateway near Torrance, had been negligent in several ways.  </P> <P> He said that the hospital was not licensed to provide special care for a mental  patient like Hatch and that administrators failed to properly research the  patient's background. Hatch was admitted to the hospital on the recommendation  of a physician. A background search would have shown that Hatch had previously  been committed for 10 years to a state mental hospital and had previously been  accused of child molestation, Farnell said.  </P> <P> Hospital employees lost track of Hatch for at least 45 minutes on the afternoon  of the alleged assault, Farnell said. "If they had supervised him properly,  this never would have happened," he argued.  </P> <P> Farnell said the hospital should have been on notice that its supervision was  inadequate because of two previous incidents: A month earlier, police picked up  a patient who wandered away from the hospital undetected and, just four days  before the alleged assault, a state inspector told administrators that they  needed more supervisors  </P> <P> on duty.  </P> <P> Farnell said the damage to the youngster cannot be calculated. The boy has been  hospitalized for severe depression and anxiety and has attempted suicide 10  times.  </P> <P> The youngster attends public school but requires tutoring and has trouble  communicating with other children, Farnell said.  </P> <P> He said the boy should be put in a residential treatment program for at least  six months and then given outpatient counseling, along with his mother. Farnell  asked the jury to award about $400,000 to cover past and future costs of  therapy and hospitalization and $10 million for pain and suffering.  </P> <P> The youngster "looks at himself as spoiled goods," Farnell said. "The quality  of his life will never be what it should have been." He is "permanently  scarred."  </P> <P> Moore asked the jury to put aside such emotional pleas and to judge the case  logically.  </P> <P> He said the hospital had provided a reasonable amount of security without  jeopardizing its goal of providing a "homelike therapeutic atmosphere" for  patients. "Foolproof security can't be provided," he said. "The standard for  licensed nursing facilities does not require a foolproof system."  </P> <P> Moore conceded that the boy had been molested but said the hospital could not  have foreseen the crime. The facilities where Hatch lived before gave no  indication that he had been violent or sexually active, and he did not show  those tendencies in his first 13 months at Harbor Convalescent Hospital, Moore  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Interfering With Recovery'  </P> <P> Further, an outside doctor who ordered Hatch, a Medi-Cal patient, admitted to  the hospital did not order that he should be restrained or kept away from other  people, Moore said.  </P> <P> Moore also charged that after the incident, the boy's mother had failed to  bring him to psychotherapy appointments and had not given him drugs ordered by  his doctors.  </P> <P> She "has actively been interfering with the recovery of the boy from the time  of this incident," Moore said. "She has actively interfered with his therapy  from the beginning."  </P></p>

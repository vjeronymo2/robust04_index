			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 23 Apr -- At nine o'clock yesterday Boris  Kakubava, a deputy in the Georgian parliament and chairman of  the Abkhazian Liberation Union, was abducted after he had taken  part in an Alioni program on Georgian television.    Threatening to execute him, the kidnappers demanded that  Boris Kakubava cancel the congress of the displaced Abkhazian  population scheduled to he held in Tbilisi 23-25 April. The  organizers of the terrorist act seem to be afraid that the  congress could make the Georgian leaders' political course on  the Abkhazian issue look negative. A probable tragic end has  been prevented by the prompt intervention of the Abkhazian  Liberation Union.    This, as well as other events (delegates of the congress  have  been denied transport by rayon authorities; transport routes  have been closed), demonstrates a desire of the authorities to  prevent the congress.    The Abkhazian Liberation Union places the entire  responsibility for the incident and its consequences on the  leadership of the Republic of Georgia.    This statement was made public by the press service of the  Abkhazian Liberation Union at a news conference in Tbilisi on 23  April.</p>

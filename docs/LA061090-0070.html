			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AIRPORT SITE  </P> <P> When I read Jeffrey Perlman's report "Orange County Is Out as Site for New  Airport," I was thoroughly disgusted with our politicians who are supposed to  work for and protect the best interests of the public. Apparently this is not  true, as they flagrantly make decisions that cost the taxpayers hundreds of  millions -- making the same mistakes they overlooked at John Wayne Airport, Los  Angeles International and hundreds of others throughout the United States!  </P> <P> Two years ago, the Airport Site Coalition was charged with the responsibility  of selecting a site that was centrally located, had rail and freeway access, no  noise pollution of residential areas, no obstructions to takeoffs or landings  and convenient to the counties of Orange, San Diego, Imperial and Riverside!  </P> <P> The beachfront Las Pulgas site at Camp Pendleton has 100% of all these  requirements and, in addition to being the safest, could be rated as a AAA  World Class International Airport!  </P> <P> However, the Marine Corps doggedly refuses to give up the small area needed,  even when they know the site would not be completed and operational until the  year 2010!  </P> <P> It is the only airport site that could take the overload from John Wayne  Airport and relieve the residents of Newport Beach from the stress they are now  suffering. It could also take a sizable portion of the overload from LAX.  </P> <P> Why does the Marine Corps spitefully ignore the chronic needs of 40 million  airline passengers -- the predicted shortfall by 2010? Camp Pendleton was  labeled "a wartime need" when it was wrested from the Flood family in 1939.  Since 1945, a very large part of this acreage is seldom, if ever, used.  </P> <P> OTTO C.

			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Running-mates eliminated The choice of Senator Bill Bradley from New Jersey and Governor Anne Richards of Texas for prominent speaking roles at next month's Democratic convention is believed to be a sign that neither will emerge as Mr Bill Clinton's presidential running-mate, Jurek Martin reports in Washington. The vice-presidential nominee traditionally makes his acceptance speech on the penultimate night of the convention and is not given any other speaking slot. Mr Bradley has been selected as one of the keynote speakers in New York and Governor Richards has been named convention chairman.</p>

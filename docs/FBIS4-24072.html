			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 22 SAPA -- The Conservative Party [CP]  on Wednesday [22 June] strongly objected to the five per cent  levy on income tax imposed on "already overtaxed taxpayers".    "The CP strongly objects to the squandering of R4 billion  [rand] by the Transitional Executive Council and the Independent  Electoral Commission," the party's finance spokesman Cas Uys  said in a statement. He said the amount now had to be made up  for through a five per cent levy.    Mr Uys said the insufficient increase in social, military  and  civil pensions resulted in a further lowering of living  standards in a sector of the community which, in some cases, was  already below the breadline. "The budgeted shortage in the  current financial year of R29.3 billion will once more result in  a drastic increase in government debt," he said.    He said if the government did not succeed in bringing about  law and order and stability there would be no influx of capital  to South Africa and its entrance to international markets would  fail.</p>

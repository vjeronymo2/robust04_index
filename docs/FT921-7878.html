			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bauxite producers undaunted - Jamaican plans to expand production THE ALUMINIUM market may be depressed, but this apparently is not daunting Jamaica's miners and refiners of bauxite, the ore from which aluminium is produced. In a display of confidence in the ability of the market to rebound, the industry is pursuing projects to expand refining capacity. Basing its faith on the cyclical nature of aluminium demand the industry is spending heavily this year so that it will be able to take advantage of the improvement it expects in the market. Jamaica, the world's third largest bauxite producer after Australia and Guinea, has nearly run out of spare bauxite refining capacity. Its installed capacity of 3.1m tonnes a year will allow for only marginal growth in output this year from last year's 3.01m tonnes. 'The problems affecting the aluminium market are short term,' says Mr Carlton Davis, executive chairman of the Jamaica Bauxite Institute. 'There is a bright future for aluminium in developments which will have a longer term impact, such as increased efforts towards energy conservation'. Mr Davis also sees good prospects for growth in aluminium consumption - and consequently in demand for bauxite ore and alumina - in the motor and food industries. The aluminium beverage can has yet to make its mark on the European and Japanese markets, he says. A similar conclusion about the ability of the market to recover and the need to expand capacity now is drawn by Mr Billy Foster, director of process modernisation for Kaiser Aluminum of the US. 'You always run the danger of building a plant only to see the market drop,' he says. 'But if we were to wait for a stable market before building plants then none would be built.' Consequently, Kaiser and Norsk Hydro of Norway, which own Alumina Partners of Jamaica, the island's largest refinery, are investing Dollars 180m to expand output. Kaiser has a 65 per cent share in the refinery. Alumina Partners has a rated capacity of 1.2m tonnes a year and will initially be modernised to produce 1.55m tonnes a year. The project is being financed through the floating of bonds in Puerto Rico through a financing facility established by the island's administration. The first issue of bonds, amounting to Dollars 60m, was completed in December. 'The funding which is in place is intended to get the first phase of the modernisation started,' says Mr Foster. 'A second bond issue of another Dollars 60m will be sought when the first is consumed, maybe in August or September, and this second issue will allow us to complete the upgrading of the plant.' The expansion will be completed in the next 12 months, with the remaining funds coming from the resources of the two companies, which are already contemplating another increase in capacity to lift output to 2m tonnes per year. This second project will depend on demand for alumina, Mr Foster says. Another refinery, Jamalco, jointly owned by the Jamaican government and the Aluminum Company of America, is also being upgraded. Some Dollars 30m is being spent on the plant this year in a programme aimed at increasing its output from 800,000 to 1m tonnes a year. Alcan of Canada is concluding a Dollars 60m investment in its mines and two refineries in Jamaica, improving its ore transportation and port facilities and lifting output from its plants to 1.1m tonnes a year, 200,000 tonnes more than average production in recent years. The government and Alcan are studying the feasibility of a new 1m tonnes-a-year plant on the island's north coast. If the project is approved, the plant is likely to cost about Dollars 1bn, with ownership by Alcan, the government and at least one other company from either Japan, the UK or another European country. In another effort to expand the industry, negotiations are continuing between the government and interests from the Ukraine and the US on the start of a joint venture to operate a bauxite mine in Jamaica. The Nikolaev Alumina Company of the Ukraine, Pioneer Windows of New York and Jamaica Bauxite Mining, a state-owned company, plan to rehabilitate and work mines in northern Jamaica that were closed eight years ago by Reynolds Metals of the US. It is to the Alumina Partners expansion, however, that the Jamaican industry is looking for almost immediate relief from the shortage of capacity that has caused a slowdown in the industry. Bauxite ore production rose by 5.5 per cent last year to 11.5m tonnes, compared with the 19.8 per cent expansion of 1990. The growth in alumina production also slipped last year to 5.5 per cent, from 30 per cent in 1990. 'It is now accepted in the industry that the four refineries in Jamaica are the most competitive in the world, except perhaps for the plants located in Western Australia,' says Mr Davis. 'They are, therefore, very good ventures for anyone with an eye on the long term market.'</p>

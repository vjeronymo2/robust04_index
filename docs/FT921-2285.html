			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Germans draw line at two sets of accounts MARK TWAIN once observed that it ought to take an intelligent person about 30 hours to master the English language, 30 days to get on top of French  - and about 30 years to master German. In broad terms, the same holds true for accounting, the business language. English, even French accounting is relatively easy to get to grips with  - but it takes many years to make any sense of German accounting. Indeed, the more sceptical analysts say that it can never be done  - that the very term German accounting is a contradiction in terms. UK accounts at least pay lip-service to the notion that accounts should provide a 'true and fair' representation of what is happening at the company, but German accounting does not aim to give outsiders such as analysts or investors a 'true' or merely 'fair' picture of a companies' financial condition. If this makes it difficult for international fund managers to make informed investment decisions about German companies, it also denies German companies access to the world's largest capital market. The fact that not a single German company has a full listing in the US is directly due to German accounting. Last year, a number of Germany's largest companies  - including Daimler-Benz, Bayer, Hoechst and BASF, and a number of large banks  - approached the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission in the US with a view to obtaining a listing in the US. The talks came to nothing. The main obstacle was the SEC's requirement that the German companies - like all companies listed in the US  - should comply with the generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) in the US. The German companies refused to give way, and the SEC would not compromise: hence an impasse. The issue has rumbled on since then. Last month the Federation of German Stock Exchanges said it was likely the European Commission would enter into direct negotiations with the SEC on behalf of all European countries. The EC may well take up the 'reciprocity' argument used by the German companies last year  - that a company which had complied with German listing requirements ought to qualify automatically for a listing in the US, without having to comply with US GAAP. Since German listing requirements are much less strenuous, US companies have no difficulty gaining a quote there. Apart from the general principle that German companies give away very little financial information, the main practical difference between Teutonic accounting and the Anglo-American variety is that German accounting invariably understates both assets and profits, as compared to figures presented under UK rules or US GAAP. An exercise conducted last year by Mr Gary Schieneman, an analyst for Smith New Court in New York, showed that shareholders' equity at Mannesmann  - a large German engineering company  - at the end of 1989 would have been at least 40 per cent higher if presented under US GAAP, while net profits would have been 50 per cent and 36 per cent higher in 1988 and 1989 respectively. In another study, Mr Schieneman showed how the Volkswagen car company's 1989 profits would grow from DM1.04bn under German rules, to DM1.5bn under UK rules and DM1.9bn under US rules. In the answer to the question 'what did Volkswagen really earn in 1989?', Schieneman was forced to conclude that it depended entirely on your accounting perspective. What was true for the 1989 figures, applies equally to those produced by large German companies in 1990 and 1991, says Schieneman. The differences between the German and the UK and the US versions of the figures are in part due to German conservatism on specific issues such as accounting for goodwill and depreciation, but there are also more fundamental factors at work. Mrs Heidrun Haase of Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt identifies some of the underlying causes of the differences between German and Anglo-American accounting: German law insists that the interests of creditors take precedence over those of shareholders. The so-called Glaubigerschutzprinzip, in which this principle is enshrined, means that companies are under legal pressure to understate reported profits and assets. There is no distinction between tax accounts and published accounts, as there is in the UK or the US: the Massgeblichkeitprinzip ordains that in order to get a deduction for tax purposes it must be booked in the published accounts. Thus there is a cash incentive for German companies to keep reported profits as low as possible, because lower profits mean lower tax bills. The structure of the German capital market does not bring pressure on companies to ramp up their reported profits. Only about 650 German companies are listed on the stock market, and of these the vast majority are controlled by banks or families with long-term investment horizons. These shareholders have access to the management accounts, which tell the full story denied to those who must rely on published figures. Despite recent developments such as the Continental-Pirelli saga and Krupp's takeover of Hoesch, there is no vigorous 'market for corporate control' in Germany and managers do not have to present spectacular profits growth to fend off takeover. A further, unspoken reason why German companies do not want to present US-style figures is that it would weaken their hand in negotiations with unions: Germany's labour costs are already higher than anywhere else in Europe and the fear is that they could get higher if the unions saw the profits restated upwards under US or UK GAAP. Moreover, German managers worry that if they adopted US GAAP, they would be taking the first steps down the slippery slope to short-termism, that is, that industrial strategy would have to be sacrificed to the need to boost reported profits. There are signs that despite these forces for conservatism, German accounting is changing: big companies are obliged to compete in international capital markets for funds and get better rates the more they disclose. But they still draw the line at presenting two completely different sets of accounts, as they would have to if they listed in New York. Mrs Haase of Deutsche Bank says that the best German companies will in future strike a balance between 'being prudent and making their figures understandable for the foreign capital markets'.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Motorola to spend Pounds 50m on Scots plant expansion MOTOROLA, the US electronics group, is to spend Pounds 50m expanding its semiconductor plant at East Kilbride near Glasgow to meet what it calls 'exceptional demand' for its products. The expansion will create 180 jobs, taking the workforce to more than 2,000. It follows the completion of a Pounds 40m expansion project announced just over a year ago. The project, which involves installing new equipment and building extra cleanroom facilities, will enable Motorola to expand its capacity to make 6in wafers for customer-specific integrated circuits. The investment also involves accelerating production of digital signal-processing chips to meet a 'huge surge' in demand throughout Europe. The 400,000 sq ft plant's total production capacity will increase by up to 25 per cent. Mr Steve Hanson, Motorola's assistant general manager for Europe, said: 'This is in response to an exceptional demand for our products which has outstripped our expectations, even since our announcement just last summer.' He added: 'Motorola East Kilbride is playing a leading role in Europe in meeting these demands.' Some of the extra demand is for semiconductors for use in telecommunications equipment such as mobile telephones, especially from China and eastern Europe. There is strong demand from the personal computer and workstation markets, and from automotive products. Motorola manufactures mobile telephone equipment at its plant at Easter Inch in West Lothian, which opened in early 1992 and is already being expanded.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hellenic Bottling rises 41% to Dr13bn Hellenic Bottling Company, the Coca-Cola franchise holder for Greece, Bulgaria and Northern Ireland, reported a 40.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Dr12.8bn (Dollars 52m) for the first half, helped by a strong performance by its fruit juice division. Turnover rose 24.5 per cent in the same period to Dr68.1bn. HBC, part of the Cypriot-owned Leventis group which holds the Coca-Cola franchises for Nigeria and Northern Ireland, said first-half income generated outside Greece amounted to Dr1.1bn. The company said sales volume in Greece showed healthy growth, in spite of increased competition in soft drinks and juices. HBC has a 65 per cent share of Greece's soft drinks market and about 40 per cent of the fruit juice market, where its Amita brand has maintained its position in spite of the arrival of a wide variety of refrigerated juices. In Bulgaria, where HBC controls five joint ventures with local soft drinks bottlers, sales of Coca-Cola products rose 40 per cent while pre-tax profits were up 163 per cent. HBC said its strong performance in Bulgaria resulted from the launch of Sprite and Fanta and improvements in distribution.</p>

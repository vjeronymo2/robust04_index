			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Yeltsin claims referendum win Russian voters have approved plans for a reformed constitution that would give strong powers to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the president's advisers said last night. However, the elections for the Russian parliament showed fragile support for radical reform. The Communist party and the neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky were the main beneficiaries of a low turnout. With Russia seemingly poised between reform and reaction, Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister and leader of the liberal Russia's Choice group, said the 'possible success of the extremists is a result of the new social and economic situation in the country, and also because of divisions on the part of the democrats'. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister for privatisation, appealed to the democrats to 'unite in the face of a new fascist threat'. Although the turnout nationwide was low, it was enough to pass the 50 per cent barrier needed for the vote on the constitution to be valid. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, said that about 60 per cent of those voting had backed the new constitution - an outcome which, he said, gave the government stable conditions for its work. Early indications of results gave a mixed picture of the parties' positions, although all showed a considerable strength for the Communists and the Liberal Democrats. Germany's ARD public television news reported an exit poll carried out by Russian polling institutes as showing that 23 per cent had voted for Russia's Choice, 17 per cent for the Communists and 13 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. However, results for four constituencies broadcast by the Ostankino TV company put the Liberal Democrats on 24 per cent, the Communists on 17, Russia's Choice on 16.1 per cent and the conservative Agrarian Party on 8.3. Further figures from the far-eastern Primorsky district, which includes the city of Vladivostok, put Russia's Choice on 17 per cent, the Liberal Democrats on 14 per cent, the Communists on 13 per cent and the Yabloko group of Mr Grigory Yavlinsky on 11 per cent. While detailed results will not be available until today or tomorrow, it is clear that the new parliament, set to convene on January 11, will contain a solid block of strongly nationalist deputies dedicated to opposing pro-market reforms and to promoting anti-western policies. Mr Gennady Burbulis, a leader of Russia's Choice and a former close aide to President Yeltsin, blamed his former boss for refusing to support Russia's Choice and preferring to stay above the conflict. 'We will now have to swallow our pride and seek concrete compromises,' he told the Interfax news agency. Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's spokesman, said it might be possible to co-operate with communist and nationalist parties. Both the capital, Moscow, and the second city, St Petersburg, registered a bare majority of participating voters, while the big city of Ekaterinburg, home town of President Yeltsin, failed to register 50 per cent - as did several other important regions. As expected, the north Caucasian republic of Chechnya took no part in the elections. RUSSIAN ELECTIONS Page 8 Voters hand great power to president Soldiers seek leadership</p>

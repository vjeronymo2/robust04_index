			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: CRA hit by continued low prices CRA, the Australian resources group, will see earnings fall by between 20 and 25 per cent this year because of continued softness in commodity prices, Mr Don Uhrig, chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday. Mr Uhrig said profit before extraordinary items for the first three months of the year was about 13 per cent lower than for the corresponding period in 1990. This follows a 27 per cent fall in net profit last year, from the Dollars A648.4m in 1989 to Dollars A472.5m (USDollars 367.4m) in 1990. 'Until the US economy rebounds, it seems probable that commodity demand will continue to soften and prices decline,' commented Mr Uhrig. But he added that the exception was iron ore, mainly because of continued strong demand by the Japanese steel mills. CRA is one of Australia's top two producers of iron ore, coal and aluminium, owns in a joint venture with North Broken Hill the large Pasminco base metals group, and is the controlling shareholder in Australia's largest diamond mine at Argyle, in Western Australia. Mr Uhrig confirmed an earlier report that CRA wanted to re-open the copper mine on the strife-torn island of Bougainville, which is occupied by secessionist guerrillas. He hinted, however, that CRA would consider selling its holding if this would help bring about a return to stability on the island. 'Expectation is that CRA will retain its (53 per cent) shareholding in Bougainville and re-start the mine in due course,' Mr Uhrig told shareholders. 'However, we recognise that Bougainville Copper cannot resume operations unless there is a political settlement. It does not appear such a settlement is imminent, although some progress appears possible. 'Should it become obvious that CRA's continued participation in Bougainville Copper prevents the attainment of such a political accommodation, then the company would have to consider the disposal of its investment in the mine,' he said. CRA had withdrawn all its staff from the island in March, 1990, and, therefore, it was not possible to assess accurately the condition of the mine, one of the world's largest.</p>

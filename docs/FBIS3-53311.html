He said that  no such incident took place and the charge that the Pakistani  troops resorted to unprovoked firing was baseless. However, it  may be pointed out that the Indian troops have been  indiscriminately firing from across the Line of Control on the  Azad Kashmir civilian population. Special complaints regarding  all such incidents are being regularly filed by Pakistan with  the United Nations military observers group in Pakistan.</p>

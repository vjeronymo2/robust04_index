			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Iraq warned to curtail flights THE US and its allies warned Iraq's military yesterday that continued use of its anti-aircraft missile radars and new training flights by Iraqi warplanes could spark an incident with allied forces, Reuter reports from Washington. Mr Bob Hall, the Pentagon spokesman, said Brig Gen Glenn Profitt of the US Air Force, commander of an allied task force in the region, expressed concern over military steps by Baghdad to Iraqi officers at a meeting in the Iraqi city of Zakho. The meeting was 'to underscore our concerns over their actions and to make sure there were no misunder-standings. . . the concern is there is a very big potential risk for an incident,' Mr Hall told reporters. 'They (Iraqis) are aware that we will take whatever actions we deem necessary to protect our forces,' he said. The US and Britain have expressed alarm over Iraq's recent movement of SAM-2 and SAM-3 surface-to-air missile batteries and ground troops into northern Iraq for a possible assault on minority Kurds. He appeared to dismiss suggestions that the brief training flights were a legitimate defensive response to an Iranian air raid on Iraq last Sunday.</p>

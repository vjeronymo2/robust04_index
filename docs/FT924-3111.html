			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Greenland refinery proposed A Dollars 300m zinc refinery might be built in Greenland to process some of the raw material which at present is shipped from the Canadian Arctic to Europe for refining. Substantial quantities of zinc concentrate are produced in the Canadian Arctic and the supply is expected to increase in 1997 with the start-up of Metall Mining's Isok Lake project in the Northwest Territories. Greenland's refinery, which would employ about 350 people and be built near the capital, Nuuk, would use cheap electricity from a hydroelectric facility which is nearing completion and will be in full production next year. Mr Robert Gannicott, president of Platinova A/S, the company behind the scheme, pointed out that Greenland was only half the distance from the Canadian Arctic compared to Europe - an important consideration when the Canadian mines had such short shipping seasons. Nuuk is on Greenland's south-west coast which is kept ice-free all year by the Gulf Stream. It offers regular, scheduled shipping services to Europe and North America and considerable excess capacity in ships leaving Greenland which could accommodate refined metal, Mr Gannicott said. Platinova - a junior exploration company, quoted in Toronto with mainly Canadian and European shareholders - has ordered a pre-feasiblity study of the refinery project from both Sherritt Gordon and Hatch and Associates. Mr Gannicott was speaking in London during presentations by the Greenland government designed to encourage mining and oil companies to do more exploration. Mr Lars Emil Johansen, premier of Greenland, a country nearly the size of the US but with a population of only 55,000, was particularly enthusiastic about a high-grade gold deposit at Nalunaq in the Kirkespir Valley. This was discovered recently by Nunaoil A/S, a company jointly owned by Greenland and Denmark, and Mr Johansen said he hoped the find would support a gold mine which could be producing from 1996-97. Microdiamonds have also been discovered in west Greenland and RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, is at present concentrating its exploration efforts in the country on diamonds.</p>

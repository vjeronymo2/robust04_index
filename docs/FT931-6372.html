			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A chance to influence BSI policy - In A Nutshell The British Standards Institution has set up a policy committee for small businesses following complaints from some small firms that its BS5750 quality management standard was too onerous. The committee is to look at this and other aspects of BSI's activities where a small firm's view is needed. Chairman of the committee is Roger Dunn, founder and managing director of Arcontrol, a manufacturer of electrical switchgear employing 70 people. The committee's first chance to influence BSI policy will come at a BSI board meeting in May.</p>

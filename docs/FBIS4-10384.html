			<p>BFN     [Text] It is quite likely that the U.S. request for the  extradition of retired Colonel Faustino Rico Toro will be  rejected, as has been the case with over 10 requests by the U.S.  courts for the extradition of Bolivian citizens, due to the lack  of an extradition agreement between Bolivia and the United  States.    High-ranking judicial branch authorities, who asked not to  be  identified, made this comment in recalling that the extradition  of Asunta Roca Suarez to the United States generated a negative  reaction from the Bolivian public.    After this case the Supreme Court announced that it would  not  extradite any more Bolivian citizens to the United States unless  a treaty in this regard was signed by the two countries.    One of the sources said: "The United States would have to  exert a lot of pressure to obtain Rico Toro's extradition,  because the Supreme Court was quite clear on the issue."    All the U.S. requests for extradition refer to cases of drug  trafficking and, in that sense, the sources stated that the 21  April 1900 treaty signed by the two countries does not mention  that type of crime.    Drug trafficking was a crime not known at that time, and  this  is the argument of the Bolivian Court to reject the U.S.  requests for extradition.    Although the extradition of Asunta Roca was based on the  1900  treaty, and was approved with the Vienna Convention signed in  1988 (a multilateral accord which includes drug trafficking as a  crime for which a delinquent may be extradited), the sources  explained that that document is contradictory.</p>

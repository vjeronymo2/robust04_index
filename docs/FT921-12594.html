			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: BES hunts for bargains THIS WEEK saw a further flurry of Business Expansion Scheme issues, and the 1992 BES season is now in full swing. The rules of the scheme are explained on page 36 of the FT's Quarterly Review of Personal Finance. BES companies have now fallen into the pattern established last year and come in two categories: 'Predators' which go bargain-hunting and attempt to profit as much as possible from the housing recession, and 'Buy-backs' which limit risk by obtaining a covenant from a housing association, or university, to buy accommodation from them for a fixed price. Disappointingly few schemes have managed to obtain the third party guarantor which would assuage many doubts about the schemes. Johnson Fry's scheme launched last week (which is backed by a certificate of deposit), offers the equivalent of 14.81 per cent annually to a higher rate taxpayer. This week's new buy-back offer is House the Homeless of London (Westminster) which has a buy-back agreement from the Peabody Trust. It will buy housing for the homeless in Westminster, with a covenant to pay Pounds 1.35 in five years' time for every Pounds 1 raised now. It thus offers the equivalent of 16.5 per cent annually to top rate taxpayers. Further buy-back schemes are expected. Schemes with no upper limit on growth include: Artesian Performer is the fifth issue from the Artesian Group, and will continue buying property in London and the South East, refurbishing it and aiming for value. Midland Predator Assured Tenancies seems to be a hybrid scheme. It will aim to buy property at cheap prices in the East Midlands and East Anglia region, and then rent it to students of Northampton College. Pathfinder Repossessions, which is sponsored by Johnson Fry, will aim to buy cheap properties in the London area which have been repossessed by building societies after the owners have defaulted on mortgages. It is similar to Close Brothers' London Repossessions fund and Neill Clerk's Auction Raider, both launched last week. Stephen Bantoft, BES analyst with the Allenbridge Group, said the schemes are getting more similar, as all sponsors try either to buy very cheap accommodation, or to provide copper-bottomed guarantees. He says your choice should be based on your opinion of the managers, and on your reading of the housing market.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: EC central bank sought by Pohl THE Maastricht treaty on European economic and monetary union should be dropped in favour of a more limited agreement on a new European central bank, according to the former president of the Bundesbank. This would have two big advantages, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, told Der Spiegel magazine. It would enable the Danes, mostly concerned about their social security system, to vote Yes. It would also mean Europe would not have to wait until 1997 or 1999 for a central bank and joint currency. Mr Pohl said European monetary union and a new central bank could be set up without political union, as long as the bank's main priority was price stability. Asked if Italy and the UK could be members, he said no country should be excluded but 'very strict entry criteria' would have to be fulfilled. 'The French and Germans must now show joint leadership. Both could in a short time establish a central bank, which the Dutch, Belgians, Luxembourgeois and Danes could join. As soon as other EC countries are in a position to subject themselves to the discipline of such a system, they should also take part.' A majority of Danish voters would consider voting Yes in a second referendum on Maastricht if special arrangements are made to exempt Denmark from some treaty obligations, Hilary Barnes reports from Copenhagen. A Gallup poll published yesterday said 64 per cent of those questioned would consider voting Yes if there was an exemption from participating in a common European defence policy, a common currency and European citizenship.</p>

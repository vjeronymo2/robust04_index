			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Limited headroom Devaluations have often been good for the UK equity market, at least in the short run. Overseas earnings account for 50 per cent of the profits of companies in the FT-A All-Share index, and for more than half in the case of the FT-SE 100. But history is not the only guide. This time, corporate debt is high and dividend cover low. Most of any earnings improvement from devaluation may be retained to rebuild balance sheets. That prospect makes yield valuations of the equity market unreliable. Comparing dividend yields to inflation or gilt yields suggests that shares are not expensive, but earnings tell a different story. The market rating is fast approaching the heady levels last seen in early 1987. Such valuations might be sustainable given falling inflation, but expectations in that respect may turn out to have been too sanguine next year. If so, long gilt yields would rise and equity ratings fall. Share prices are thus unlikely to rise more than earnings in 1993. In the short run, the equity market also seems over-optimistic about economic recovery. The benefit of lower interest rates may be offset by the government's tightening fiscal stance. And US experience suggests it may take a long time for falling rates to have much impact. The relative performance of different equity market sectors since devaluation is thus harder to understand. The largest rises since Black Wednesday have come from composite insurers, property and construction. True these sectors had been badly hit this year. But so far, the only guaranteed beneficiaries of the ERM debacle are the overseas earners.</p>

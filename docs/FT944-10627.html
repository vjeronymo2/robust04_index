			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Republicans poised to win Congress: Democrats face loss of House for first time in 40 years - Dole predicts Senate victory The Republican party stood on the brink of control of both houses of the US Congress early today, administering a severe rebuff to President Bill Clinton and the incumbent Democratic party. Results and TV projections mostly from the eastern half of the country, but including Arizona, pointed to a net Republican gain of seven seats in the Senate, exactly what was what needed to overturn the 56-44 Democratic majority. Elsewhere a Republican candidate was trailing, but only slightly, in Pennsylvania, a Democratic seat, and there was no result declared in Minnesota, a possible Democratic gain. Altogether 35 Senate seats were at stake. Mr Robert Dole, Republican leader in the Senate, said cautiously: 'We're not there yet, but I think we'll make it.' Senator John Breaux, the Lousiana Democrat, virtually conceded defeat as he left a reception at the White House with the words,'I've never been in the minority before.' In the House of Representatives, in Democratic hands since 1954, a late-evening projection by the Associated Press pointed to a net Republican gain of 40 seats, again precisely what they need to reverse the current Democratic edge of 256-178, with one independent. The one overwhelming consolation for the Democrats was the defeat in the Senate contest in Virginia of Mr Oliver North, architect of the Iran-Contra scandals, by Senator Chuck Robb. With most of the votes counted, Mr Robb was ahead by about 5 points, according to exit polls, winning mostly on the strength of distrust of Mr North. Some other Democratic warhorses survived, either easily (Senators Edward Kennedy in Massachusetts, Paul Sarbanes in Maryland and Robert Byrd in West Virginia) or with difficulty (Senator Frank Lautenberg in New Jersey). Also withstanding strong Democratic challenges were Republican senators Bill Roth in Delaware and James Jeffords in Vermont. But the killing blows were delivered in southern border states, where the Democrats lost both seats in Tennessee, including that of Senator Jim Sasser to Dr Bill Frist, a political novice, and in Oklahoma, where the well-known congressman Dave McCurdy was crushed by Congressman Jim Inhofe. Earlier Republican Senate pick-ups in Ohio, Maine and Michigan had been freely predicted, The Republicans also began to pick up some of the 22 Democratic governorships of the 36 being contested, with victories in Oklahoma, Kansas, Wyoming and Tennessee, though the loss of South Carolina looked likely. In Maryland, another Democratic seat, Mr Parris Glendening was falling behind Mrs Ellen Sauerbrey, the conservative Republican. But in Georgia, Governor Zell Miller was holding on to an edge over another arch-conservative, Mr Guy Millner. Results in the two big states - California and New York - were expected later, though Governor Mario Cuomo in the latter was behind Mr George Pataki in very early returns. Of former President George Bush's two sons, George W Jr was leading Governor Ann Richards in Texas, but Jeb was narrowly behind Governor Lawton Chiles in Florida. But both were faring better than Mr Hugh Rodham, brother of the First Lady. He was thrashed for the US Senate seat in Florida by Mr Connie Mack, the Republican incumbent. One of the more startling upsets was still just possible in Washington, DC, late last night. Mr Marion Barry, a three-time mayor seeking rehabilitation after a narcotics conviction was barely ahead of Mrs Carol Schwartz, the Republican, in spite of the fact that Democrats and blacks both have vast majorities in the nation's capital.

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Abitibi-Price reveals smaller loss of CDollars 5.5m ABITIBI-PRICE, one of Canada's three biggest integrated pulp and paper groups, yesterday revealed that it had posted a small loss in the first quarter. It also warned it expected a difficult year because of poor markets, especially in newsprint. Sales in the period dipped 7.5 per cent to CDollars 726m (USDollars 625m) and the first-quarter loss was CDollars 5.5m or 9 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 11.3m or 17 cents a year earlier, including a CDollars 13.7m special charge. During the quarter, Abitibi, controlled by the Reichmann brothers of Toronto, made two disposals for CDollars 53m. More non-core assets will be sold to reduce debt. Even the paper distribution and converting businesses, though profitable, will be adversely affected by the recession throughout 1991. In the first quarter Abitibi lost money on an operating basis in all its activities, except distribution and converted products. Newsprint production was 444,000 tonnes and groundwood papers were 105,000 tonnes, both around the same level as a year earlier. Campeau Corp has sold a 10 year old office building in Montreal to Confederation Life Insurance, raising the total generated by property sales in eastern Canada to about CDollars 500m in the past year.</p>

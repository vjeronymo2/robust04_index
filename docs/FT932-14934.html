			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / IAD receivers confident of sale THE administrative receivers for International Automotive Design (UK), the design and engineering consultancy, hope to agree to a sale of the company within days. The company, one of Europe's biggest automotive design and engineering companies, went into administrative receivership last week with debts of about Pounds 13.5m. Mr Maurice Withall of accountants Grant Thornton, one of the joint administrative receivers, said offers for IAD had been received from several UK companies. 'We are very hopeful and expect to be successful in selling the business as a going concern.' Mr Godfrey Harker, group finance director, said the company's debts included bank debt of Pounds 7m, trade debt of Pounds 4m and Pounds 2.5m owed to the Inland Revenue. It expected to make a loss of Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.5m on turnover of up to Pounds 52m in the year to the end of this month. Turnover had begun to fall sharply since mid-1992. The strain on the company's finances was increased by the financial collapse in February of Daf, the Dutch truckmaker, which owed it around Pounds 500,000. The company, based at Worthing, West Sussex, has carried out contracts for many of the world's leading vehicle makers since it was formed in 1976 by Mr John Shute. Mr Shute and his family owns 77.5 per cent while 22.5 per cent is held by Cinven, the UK's second largest venture capital investor.</p>

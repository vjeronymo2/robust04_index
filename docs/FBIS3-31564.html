			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jagodina, 22 Feb (TANJUG) -- Commenting on the  situation around Sarajevo, the chairman of the Srpska republic's  assembly, Momcilo Krajisnik, told Radio Jagodina today that the  Serb side had asked for impartial mediators from UNPROFOR and  got them in the UN's Russian units.    "UNPROFOR is generally implementing the agreement between  the  Serb and Muslim sides very correctly and with good intentions.  The Serb side not only has no complaints, but it also commends  the impartial and mediating role of the `international forces,'"  Krajisnik said.    Asked to comment on air strike threats if the Serbs did not  allow Tuzla airport to open, Krajisnik said:    "We do not have anything against the opening of Tuzla  airport  if we get guarantees that it will not be used to arm Muslim  forces, thus prolonging the war. However, those who want to  open the airport straight away do not have good intentions."  We, Krajisnik added, also have no complaints about the  demilitarization of the warring sides in Zepa, Srebrenica, and  other enclaves because our goal is peace and a demarcation  between the Serbs, Muslims, and Croats. However, not a single  percent of Serb territory can be threatened by this act. We  have opted for a peaceful resolution accompanied by a  demarcation between the three states in the territory of former  Bosnia-Herzegovina and any attempt to join the three nations is  in reality a prolongation of military operations, Krajisnik said.</p>

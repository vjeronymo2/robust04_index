			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NIGHT OF TWO NO-HITTERS;  </P> <P> FERNANDO PITCHES ONE FOR THE FIRST TIME AS HE STYMIES CARDINALS, 6-0  </P> <P> Thirty minutes before the Dodgers faced the St. Louis Cardinals Friday,  Fernando Valenzuela noticed on a clubhouse television set that Oakland pitcher  Dave Stewart had thrown a no-hitter in Toronto.  </P> <P> "Fernando turned to some teammates and he said, 'That's great, now maybe we'll  see another no-hitter,' " Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said.  </P> <P> Valenzuela then pitched as well as he predicted, throwing the first no-hitter  of his career in a 6-0 victory.  </P> <P> It was the first time in the modern baseball era that two no-hitters have been  pitched on the same day, and the fifth no-hitter in the major leagues this  season. It was the Dodgers' first no-hitter since Jerry Reuss had one against  the San Francisco Giants on June 27, 1980, and only the team's second no-hitter  since 1970.  </P> <P> "And it couldn't have happened to a tougher, more competitive guy," Lasorda  said. "You look at Fernando and he has done everything in his career except a  no-hitter. And now . . . this."  </P> <P> Proving that he is more than a mere memory, Valenzuela provided new memories  for the 38,583 at Dodger Stadium. Only four Cardinals reached base -- on three  walks and an error -- and Valenzuela struck out seven.  </P> <P> With Willie McGee on first base and one out in the ninth inning, former Dodger  Pedro Guerrero hit a grounder up the middle that seemed destined for the  outfield. But Valenzuela stuck out his glove, the ball nicked the leather and  rolled to Juan Samuel, who stepped on second base and threw to first baseman  Eddie Murray, who made the double-play catch that sent Dodgers running to the  mound.  </P> <P> Valenzuela did not throw his glove or jump up and down. He stood on the mound  and jabbed his arms into the air until he was hugged by catcher Mike Scioscia.  </P> <P> "Do you think if I don't touch that ball, it goes through for a single?"  Valenzuela asked afterward. "Whoooa. I think it does. I think I don't touch it,  I'm in trouble.  </P> <P> "I was just glad to see Scioscia running to the mound from the plate. Only then  did I know it was over. Thank goodness Alfredo Griffin made the catch and the  throw."  </P> <P> When reminded that it was Samuel who made the final play, Valenzuela laughed.  </P> <P> "That shows you how excited I am," he said after improving to 6-6 with a 3.73  earned-run average. "This is a great moment for me."  </P> <P> A no-hitter by Valenzuela seemed a remote possibility, at least on paper. He  had won only once in his last six starts. He had not beaten the Cardinals since  May 6, 1988, in St. Louis.  </P> <P> He was averaging 9.2 hits against him per nine innings. He had only thrown two  complete games this season, including his first shutout since 1987 when he beat  the Chicago Cubs, 5-0, April 27.  </P> <P> He had never had a no-hitter or a one-hitter in his 10-year career. His best  effort had been a two-hitter -- of which he had eight, the latest coming last  Aug. 12 at San Francisco.  </P> <P> "But this is a different pitcher than in previous seasons," Scioscia said.  "This guy is not as quick as the old Fernando, but this guy still knows how to  win."  </P> <P> Valenzuela's 10-year Dodger career began with Cy Young and rookie of the year  awards in 1981, but had since fallen on hard times because of shoulder  problems. He started well Friday night, struggled in the end and didn't need  much help.  </P> <P> The only thing close to a hit was a fly ball by Craig Wilson into the  left-center field gap with one out in the eighth. It was chased down and  grabbed by Stan Javier, who was playing because Kal Daniels was suffering back  spasms.  </P> <P> "The only hard-hit balls were foul balls," Lasorda said.  </P> <P> Valenzuela, 29, breezed through the first six inings, only Guerrero reaching  base when Gibson dropped his fly ball in left field with two outs in the first.  At that point, Valenzuela had thrown 75 pitches.  </P> <P> But in the final three innings, he threw 49 pitches, and was obviously tired.  </P> <P> "But this was a different kind of tired," Valenzuela said. "This kind of tired  did not bother me. You think I feel anything during those last inning? No way."  </P> <P> With one out in the seventh, he began to struggle, walking Guerrero and Todd  Zeile. But he settled to retire Terry Pendleton on a fly ball and Jose Oquendo  on a grounder to third.  </P> <P> He fell behind in the count to two of the three hitters he faced in the eighth,  but still retired Rex Hudler on a grounder to shortstop, Ozzie Smith on a wild  swinging strikeout and Wilson on the fly ball to Javier.  </P> <P> During this time, his only conversations on the bench concerned his  second-favorite topic, hitting.  </P> <P> "All the starting pitchers have a bet as to who will hit higher, and we always  talk about it," pitcher Mike Morgan said. "So when Fernando came back after  making his first two outs at the plate, we would say, 'Oh for one,' and then  'Oh for two' and he would shake his head."  </P> <P> Valenzuela even got the last laugh there, as he singled to left and scored on  Kirk Gibson's two-run single in the seventh. But by the ninth inning, everybody  had forgotten about his bat.  </P> <P> "We all had goose bumps," Morgan said. "We were all just watching and hoping  and waiting to charge the field."  </P> <P> In the ninth, Valenzuela struck out Vince Coleman on a called third strike that  caused Coleman to scream at home plate umpire Jerry Layne. McGee then walked on  four pitches. But on an 0-and-2 count, Guerrero, celebrating his 34th birthday,  ended the game.  </P> <P> Offensively, Valenzuela was supported by two RBIs by Hubie Brooks and Gibson.  Brooks scored runs on a fly ball and his first home run since June 9, his 10th  overall. The Dodgers also scored on a suicide squeeze by Javier and an  eighth-inning homer by Juan Samuel, his fifth.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Kal Daniels scratched himself from the starting lineup during batting practice  Friday, the sixth consecutive start he has missed since his back injury. Stan  Javier started in center field, and Kirk Gibson was moved to left field. It was  a quick change of fortune for Javier, who earlier in the afternoon had been  informed by Manager Tom Lasorda that he was being benched for at least one game  to allow Gibson and Daniels to play in the same outfield. Javier entered Friday  night's game with 15 hits in his last 16 games and a .411 batting average  during that time.  </P> <P> Ray Searage will return to Class-A Bakersfield today and Sunday for his 10th  and 11th rehabilitation appearances. Searage, 1-2 with a 3.65 ERA for  Bakersfield, has 16 strikeouts in 12 1/3 innings. He has been on the disabled  list since May 14 because of a sore left elbow.  </P> <P> Injured third baseman Jeff Hamilton took 40 swings during an eight-minute  batting practice session, but said only two minutes of those swings felt good.  He will try to hit on consecutive days for the first time today. . . . In a  meeting earlier this month, Tim Belcher was elected as the Dodgers' full-time  player representative, with Chris Gwynn the alternate. Belcher was only the  interim representative last winter when he played a big role in the union  negotiations with management. He had replaced the departed Dave Anderson.  </P> <P> DODGER NO-HITTERS  </P> <P> A list of no-hitters by Dodger pitchers (Brooklyn 1890-1957, Los Angeles 1958  to present).  </P> <TABLE

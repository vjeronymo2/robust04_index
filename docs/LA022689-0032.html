			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRKED BY HIGH AIR FARES? TAKE FREEWAY TO S.F.  </P> <P> There are two sensible solutions to the outrageous Los Angeles-San Francisco  air fares:  </P> <P> First, have the municipally owned airports in the Los Angeles basin reserve  gate positions for air services offering low fares on this route. This offers  an opportunity for new intrastate operators.  </P> <P> Second, authorize state-backed bonds for a modern, high-speed rail line linking  the Bay Area and Los Angeles via the San Joaquin Valley and over the  Tehachapis. (Surely modern engineering can conquer those brutes!) If the French  and Germans can do it, so can we -- three-hour trips, some also carrying autos.  No airport hassles or freeway jangles -- and lower fares.  </P> <P> CHARLES T. NEWTON  </P> <P> Del Mar  </P></p>

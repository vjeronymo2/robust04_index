			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Japan money supply growth slows sharply Japan's broad money supply expanded at a record low year-on-year rate of 1.8 per cent in January, the Bank of Japan reported yesterday. The Bank said the decline in monetary growth from 2 per cent in December was due in part to large tax payments to the government and to a shift of money to postal savings accounts and to money trusts with higher interest rates.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN ALLEGEDLY KILLED HORSES FOR INSURANCE;  </P> <P> THOROUGHBREDS: KENTUCKY DENTIST IS CHARGED WITH MAKING LETHAL INJECTIONS IN  RETURN FOR CASH.  </P> <P> A Kentucky dentist allegedly killed thoroughbred racehorses so owners could  collect insurance money, the FBI said Monday.  </P> <P> Dr. Joseph James Brown of Shelbyville, Ky., was arrested and charged with wire  fraud Feb. 17 at Calder Race Course after an investigation by the FBI and the  New York-based Thoroughbred Racing Protective Board.  </P> <P> "Brown was arrested . . . by FBI agents as he was about to administer a lethal  injection to a thoroughbred race horse," FBI spokesman Paul Miller said.  </P> <P> Brown allegedly said he would charge $15,000 to kill one horse -- $2,500 down  and the rest upon settlement of the insurance claim, according to the FBI.  </P> <P> An associate claimed Brown had also killed horses in New York and New Jersey,  the FBI said.  </P> <P> The horse-killing scheme had gone on for a few months, said Paul Berube,  president of the racing board. He declined to provide additional details.  </P> <P> Brown, 43, was released on $5,000 bond after his arrest but later failed to  contact Miami federal court to submit the name of his lawyer as required. He  has been given until 5 p.m. today to do so, court officials said, but hasn't  been declared a fugitive.  </P> <P> Brown is charged with making telephone calls across state lines in a scheme to  defraud. The warrant for his arrest says the scheme involved "collecting on  insurance policies by intentionally destroying thoroughbred racing horses via  lethal injection."  </P> <P> An undercover investigator with the racing board visited Brown at his horse  farm near Shelbyville in December, according to an FBI affidavit. Brown told  the agent he had killed a horse and insurance money was collected after the  animal's death.  </P> <P> Brown offered his services if the agent ever wanted a horse killed for  insurance money, the document said. Last month, Brown referred the agent to a  third party, identified as Bob West, in Lexington, Ky., to discuss the  arrangement.  </P> <P> West and the agent met in Lexington, the FBI affidavit said. West told the  agent of other horses he and Brown had killed in New York and New Jersey.  </P> <P> The agent and West discussed the fee for the horse's death, which was to be  based on the dollar amount of the insurance on the animal, according to the  document. The agent later set the $15,000 fee with Brown.  </P> <P> Brown and the agent arranged for the dentist to travel to Miami to kill a horse  that the agent said had been insured for four years. The agent met Brown at  Miami International Airport and the two traveled to the stables at Calder,  according to the affidavit.  </P> <P> They were met there by FBI agents who arrested Brown before any horses were  hurt.  </P> <P> "During a search of Dr. Brown, two vials of a clear liquid and two syringes  were concealed in his socks," the affidavit said.  </P></p>

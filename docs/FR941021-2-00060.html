The AHCPR accomplishes its goals through the establishment of a broad base of scientific research, and through the promotion of improvements in clinical practice and in the organization, financing, and delivery of health care services. (See 42 U.S.C. 299&hyph;299c&hyph;6 and 1320&hyph;12.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In keeping with its legislative mandates, AHCPR arranges for the development, periodic review, and update of clinically relevant guidelines that may be used by physicians, nurses, other health care providers, educators, and consumers to assist in determining how diseases, disorders, and other health care conditions can most effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and clinically managed. Medical review criteria, standards of quality, and performance measures are then developed based on the guidelines produced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 912 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b&hyph;1(b)), as amended, requires that the guidelines:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

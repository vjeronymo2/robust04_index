			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Tories confront Heseltine on mail Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday faced opposition from his backbenchers over plans to privatise the Post Office. Mr Robert Hicks, Cornwall South East, said there was 'genuine apprehension' that fundamental changes to the Post Office could affect the sub-post office network and the Royal Mail's uniform charge. Sir Donald Thompson, Calder Valley, voiced his concern about the effects of privatisation on rural post offices, many of which rely on a subsidy from the Post Office. Mr Hugh Dykes, Harrow East, said previous privatisations had been of companies that had been by and large unsuccessful and lossmaking. 'In this case that is not so, and provided the Post Office can be freed from Treasury bondage . . . there is no need to have the upheaval you have in mind.' Mr Heseltine, who favours privatisation of Royal Mail and the parcels arm, said that a flotation would not affect the universality of delivery and the universal charge for letters. He pointed out that a significant competitor to the Post Office - the Dutch Post Office - was about to have its shares floated and denied that previous privatisations had only taken place because the companies had been in the red. 'Privatisation has changed nationalised industries, serving a domestic market from a monopoly base, to becoming competitive, world-class companies, trading across the face of the earth to the greater benefit of the British economy,' he said. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, attempted to reassure backbenchers that the rural network of post offices would be safe irrespective of privatisation. Mr Colin Baker, general secretary of the Federation of Sub-Postmasters, which represents 18,000 sub-postmasters, welcomed the speech. However, Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, warned that post offices were still under threat because they were prevented from expanding their commercial activities.</p>

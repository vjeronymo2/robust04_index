			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Procter &amp; Gamble rises 5% to Dollars 424m PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the large US consumer products group which recently agreed to buy the Max Factor and Betrix businesses from Revlon for Dollars 1.14bn, yesterday announced a modest 5 per cent improvement in after-tax earnings during its third quarter, at Dollars 424m. Sales for the three months to end-March were up more sharply, at Dollars 6.79bn - an 11 per cent rise on the Dollars 6.12bn scored in the same period a year earlier. But earnings per share rose only marginally, by 1.8 per cent, to Dollars 1.16. With the figures at the lower end of expectations, the company's shares eased by  7/8 to Dollars 84. P&amp;G acknowledged its US business - where brand names range from the Cover Girl cosmetics line to detergents such as Tide and Bold - had been affected by the economic recession. It said the international operations 'remained very healthy'. Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman, said the relatively small earnings improvement 'reflected substantial investment in new products, principally the expansion of compact detergents in the US, as well as heightened competitive activity in the coffee business'.</p>

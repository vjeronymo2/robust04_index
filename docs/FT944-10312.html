			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / British Coal wins ruling on patent British Coal stands to save several million pounds after the Court of Appeal ruled in its favour in a patent case involving its Coal Products subsidiary. The case could also have implications for the corporation's forthcoming sale of the subsidiary, which manufactures smokeless fuels. In the Court of Appeal ruling, judges unanimously overturned a decision of Mr Justice Mummery who found Coal Products had infringed the Belgian company Glaverbel's patented process for repairing the lining of refractory ovens. Coal Products said it based its process on technology which it has always asserted is in the public domain. Mr Andrew Inglis, partner at Nabarro Nathanson, solicitors acting for British Coal, said he expected the Court of Appeal to order Glaverbel to pay British Coal's costs. British Coal has selected four companies as preferred bidders for Coal Products including Anglo United, the quoted company which makes the Coalite smokeless fuel.</p>

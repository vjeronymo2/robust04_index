			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State collaboration <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Is there a vision for implementing a statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system that is shared by the Governor; the State educational agency; the State agency officials responsible for job training and employment, economic development, and postsecondary education; and other appropriate officials? Does the plan substantially demonstrate sufficient commitment and specific involvement of these partners in the statewide implementation? Are the activities appropriate to the partners and likely to produce the desired changes in the way students are prepared for the future? Is there evidence that the State partners have the capacity to support the statewide implementation?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Involvement by key parties <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Does the State plan include an effective and convincing strategy for obtaining the active and continued involvement of employers and other interested parties such as locally elected officials, secondary and postsecondary educational institutions or agencies, business associations, employees, labor organizations or associations thereof, teachers, students, parents, community-based organizations, rehabilitation agencies and organizations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered apprenticeship agencies, and local vocational educational agencies in the implementation of statewide systems? Does the strategy recognize the interests of the key parties and utilize their strengths appropriately? Does the plan reflect the input of employers and other key parties?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Resources. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (10 points) Is the plan for a comprehensive statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system adequately supported by other Federal, State, and local resources? Does the plan effectively integrate State and private education and training resources with other Federal education and training resources? Does the plan limit administrative costs in order to maximize the amounts spent on delivery of services to students enrolled in its School-to-Work Opportunities programs? Is there an effective long-term plan for maintaining the School-to-Work Opportunities system with resources other than Federal School-to-Work Opportunities funds?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Student Participation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (15 points) Does the plan propose realistic strategies and programs to ensure that ``all students,'' including young women, minorities, low-achieving students, students with disabilities, students with limited-English proficiency, academically talented students, and former students who have dropped out, have the opportunity to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs? Does the strategy recognize barriers to their participation and propose effective ways of overcoming them so that these students are prepared for high-skill, high-wage jobs including, for young women and minorities non-traditional employment?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Programs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (15 points) Does the plan include an effective strategy for supporting local School-to-Work Opportunities programs that integrate occupational and academic learning, integrate work-based and school-based learning, establish linkages between secondary and postsecondary education, include components for work-based learning, school-based learning and connecting activities, and result in the award of a high school diploma or its equivalent, a certificate or diploma recognizing successful completion of one or two years of postsecondary education (if appropriate), and a skill certificate? Have promising existing programs been considered for adaptation? Have new directions and approaches been planned to ensure that these programs meet the priority? Does the plan show evidence that local School-to-Work Opportunities programs throughout the State, including those that have been funded by the Department of Education or the Department of Labor, are an effective part of a statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

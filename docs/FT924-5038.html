			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Russian army officers train for more taxing profession TURNING swords into plough-shares has taken on a new meaning in Russia as army officers made redundant because of defence cuts retrain as tax inspectors. Dr Nikolai Filinov, in charge of a special diploma for officers trying to find their feet in the new Russia, claims they have a special contribution to make. 'It's mostly women who work there now, but former officers will be ideal in situations where tax collectors have to go and persuade enterprises into paying taxes,' he claimed. Both the creation of an efficient tax-collection system and the scaling down of Russia's huge army are essential if the centrally planned economy, geared primarily to the needs of a bloated defence establishment, is to be transformed. The two tasks are fraught with difficulties. Thousands of officers must find new jobs in civilian life, while an old-style tax inspectorate is having trouble adjusting to numerous new demands. These include coping with complex levies such as value added tax and trying to extract money from new businesses, which pay no taxes, and old state-owned enterprises which are too indebted to pay taxes to a bankrupt state. Mr Sergei Alexashenko, a Russian economist specialising in tax and budgetary issues, said a lack of trained personnel was a big obstacle to efficient tax collection. He also cited a primitive banking system, which can take months to effect transfers, and the temptations for poorly paid tax inspectors to accept bribes. A Moscow institute named after Sergo Ordzhonikidze, a Bolshevik revolutionary, is trying to help solve both problems with a four-month training course giving former officers basic skills in business management and tax collection. Prof Mikhail Koptiev, who teaches a class in international finance - which includes topics such as capital flight, a big problem for Russia - said the military made ideal students: 'They are very disciplined, very educated, and learn fast.' Almost half this year's intake of 200 are military men, 33 of whom are already working as tax inspectors. But many of the future graduates hope to use their skills to go into business instead. Military skills may come in handy there too. Air force Col Viktor Kondratiev, 45, said he wanted to set up a civilian air transport company. But Lt-Col Igor Anikeev, 38, had not made up his mind to leap into the unknown. 'We are used to living in an orderly world, and government service has a certain security about it.'</p>

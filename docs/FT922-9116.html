			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Lobbying for positions as MPs begin to take an interest - The likely moves at Westminster / The Battle For Midland WITH Parliament stumbling back into life and the future of Midland Bank, once the world's largest, lodged firmly in the hands of regulators, the political lobbying process at Westminster is swinging into action. All three of the main protagonists - Lloyds Bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and their target Midland - have retained political consultants in addition to a clutch of financial and public relations advisers. The consultants will play a key role in ensuring their clients' messages get through to members of parliament. But the process cuts both ways, providing parliamentarians with a channel through which to broadcast their concerns to the leading companies. The direct influence of the average backbencher on government decision-makers might be slight or non-existent. But the recent problems of the Lloyd's insurance market are a good illustration of the impact that a relatively small number of aggrieved MPs can have if they feel they are not getting a fair hearing. Such is the geographic spread of the businesses involved in the battle for Midland that a large number of MPs are likely to take a serious interest. There can be few in England and Wales who do not have some Midland or Lloyds employees among their constituents. Some are already receiving letters about the possible consequences of any deal. Early comments suggest that one of Lloyds Bank's toughest tasks will be to set MPs' minds at rest as to the likely effect of its proposals on employment levels and competition. There is a quite widely held view at Westminster that the degree of competition is already inadequate, especially in corporate banking. A reduction from four to three in the number of clearers is hardly calculated to improve matters. Hongkong may have to counter claims that the current regulatory procedures give foreign bidders an effective advantage at the expense of British companies. The point was raised yesterday by Mr Keith Hampson, the Conservative MP for Leeds North West and a member of the Commons select committee on trade and industry, in a letter to the Financial Times. In lobbying terms, it was Lloyds which set the ball rolling some 10 days ago, sending a letter signed by Sir Jeremy Morse, its chairman, to all MPs. He argued that its proposed offer was in the public interest and that the Hongkong Bank proposals did not address 'any of the fundamental problems in the UK banking sector'. The bank has hired GJW Government Relations as its political lobbyist. Hongkong, which has retained Lowe Bell Communications as its political adviser, and Midland, which is using Ian Greer Associates, are both expected to write to MPs. Bifu, the banking union, has already done so, sending a dossier to MPs and British Euro MPs arguing that a Lloyds takeover would be harmful to the UK economy. Next week, the process will take a fresh turn when Conservative backbenchers are expected to have an opportunity to meet senior executives from both Hongkong Bank and Lloyds. The usual format for such gatherings, which generally last about an hour, is for a brief presentation followed by a question and answer session. Mr Tim Smith, the Conservative MP for Beaconsfield, who served as vice-chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee in the last parliament, played a leading role in arranging the meetings. If lobbying efforts then proceed according to type, selected MPs can expect to be invited to lunch or dinner to discuss the situation further. Typically, one representative from the client organisation would be present for each MP who attended. Subsequently, guests displaying a particular interest will often be consulted further by an MP or another individual with close ties to the client. MPs who perform such tasks on behalf of companies or other interested parties are known colloquially as 'gophers'. Several MPs have links of one kind or another with the main protagonists and their advisers. But few expect to play a significant role as the contest develops. Mr Hugh Dykes, the Conservative MP for Harrow East, said he would not get involved unless asked, and that would be unusual. Mr Dykes is a shareholder in Dewe Rogerson, Lloyds' public relations adviser. Mr Jeremy Bray, the Labour MP for Motherwell South and Bifu consultant, said that anything he wrote or said on the subject would be in the public domain. Mr Hampson, who was retained by GJW until last summer and has close political links with Mr Heseltine, has emphasised that he has had no discussions with Lloyds about its proposed offer and has no financial interest in the outcome. Other MPs with current or former ties include Mr Quentin Davies, the Tory MP for Stamford and Spalding, a director of Dewe Rogerson Consultants and Sir Peter Tapsell (C Lindsey East), who played a significant part in negotiating the purchase of James Capel by Hongkong Bank but no longer has any connection with the stockbroker. One ex-MP who will be closely involved is Mr Francis Maude, the former Treasury minister who has become an adviser to Mr William Purves, the Hongkong Bank chairman. Mr Maude's appointment was partly at the behest of Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, a former Treasury adviser who recently returned to James Capel. Mr Stephen Sherbourne, whose career includes spells as both political secretary to Mrs Margaret Thatcher and head of office to Mr Edward Heath, is in charge of the Hongkong account at Lowe Bell.</p>

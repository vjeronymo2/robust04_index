			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Ministers deadlocked on public spending cuts THE GOVERNMENT remained deadlocked on public spending cuts yesterday after ministers failed to reach agreement at a marathon three-hour cabinet meeting. Downing Street said 'substantial progress' had been made on a package of spending cuts presented to the cabinet by the EDX expenditure committee. But Mr John Major, the prime minister, was forced to refer the issue to a special cabinet meeting on Tuesday after several spending ministers objected to the EDX proposals. Ministers said much of yesterday's cabinet was taken up with discussions on Ulster, rail privatisation, the Sheehy report on reforms to the police service and today's European Community summit. The most trenchant opposition to the EDX package came from Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, who has fought against proposed cuts of up to Pounds 1bn. Mr Rifkind is understood to have headed off a significant proportion of the threatened cuts, partly by threatening to call for a full-scale defence review. He warned, however, that any attempt to make more than token cuts in the Pounds 23bn defence budget risked provoking a substantial backbench rebellion. Fourteen Conservative MPs have written to Mr Major threatening to oppose substantial defence cuts. Several other Tories are thought to sympathise with the rebels. Other ministers objected to the EDX package, including Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. Most other ministers are understood to be happy with the EDX recommendations, which are intended to implement the cabinet's earlier decision to limit next year's public spending total to Pounds 253.6bn. There was a degree of optimism that the critical ministers would fall into line on Tuesday, removing the need to reopen negotiations. Mr Major has made clear to the spending ministers, however, that he will not hesitate to refer the whole package to EDX if necessary. This has increased pressure on ministers to settle on Tuesday or risk seeing their budgets further reduced in a fresh round of argument in EDX. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is keen to reach early agreement on spending so that he can finalise the revenue side of the first unified Budget, to be delivered on November 30. But he faces deep divisions among Tory backbenchers over the balance to be struck between spending cuts and tax increases. Joe Rogaly, Page 16</p>

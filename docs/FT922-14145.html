			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Derivatives flutter pays off for Swiss banks - The success of Grois, Clous and Kisses - instruments for small investors Innovative is not a word that readily springs to mind when it comes to Swiss banks. In the past year, however, the big Swiss banks, led in this case by Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), have successfully developed derivative-based savings instruments for smaller investors. The idea is to give the individual saver a guaranteed return on his or her money, as well as the opportunity for a little flutter. Put the other way round, the instruments offer a chance to take a bet on a capital market without risking capital. It is something sophisticated institutional investors have been doing for some time, but the individual saver does not have access to the money markets or the complicated calculations that make such risk-managed products work. In January, 1991, SBC offered three, one-year term investment instruments with these characteristics. The bank called them guaranteed return on investment (Groi) securities, and sold them in units of only SFr5,000. The investor could choose among three combinations of security and risk, with the risk element being the movement of the SMI index of leading shares on the Swiss stock market over the one-year term of the fund. The investor could, for example, choose to have a guaranteed 7 per cent return on the investment, in which case the maximum bonus - if the SMI performed well - would be only 2.03 per cent. If, however, he chose a 0 per cent guaranteed return, the investor could make as much as 24.72 per cent if the SMI did well. There was also a middle option of 4 per cent guaranteed return, where the potential bonus could take the total return up to 16 per cent. The units were so popular among Swiss investors, that the SBC had to cut off applications after taking in orders worth SFr150m. In the event, the SMI index's rise in the year to January exceeded the targets set under the terms of the Groi, so investors in all three versions did very well. And it is a fair bet that SBC, capitalising on the skills of its Chicago derivatives specialist partners, O'Connor Partners, also did well with the funds it raised. SBC's success did not go unnoticed by other banks in Switzerland, and they soon piled in with similar instruments, often with whimsical names. Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) offered the Iglu, the index growth-linked unit, and the Clou, the currency-linked outperformance unit, while Bank Vontobel had the Kiss, the guaranteed capital index investment unit, and Swiss Volksbank offered a Smile, the SMI linked issue. Credit Suisse was more prosaic, with something called the SMI deposit. SBC has gone on to launch 60 more risk-managed instruments for individuals and small institutions, using various other capital market indices, and even individual shares, for the flutter element, raising a total of SFr1.2bn last year. That is probably about half the total raised by all banks through these instruments in the Swiss market last year. The instruments tend to have a life of from nine months to two years, and a secondary market has developed. One Groi using the Nikkei index on the Tokyo stock market proved to be an object lesson on the merits of these securities. Over the period of the instrument, the Nikkei index tumbled 21 per cent. Investors in the Nikkei Groi obviously got no bonus, but at least they got their capital back. 'If they had just been in Japanese equities, they would have lost a lot of money,' Mr Mario Hafner, executive director of SBC, says. 'This experience was the breakthrough for us in the Swiss market.' For all the initial success, there is considerable debate about how the market for these products is going to develop, both in Switzerland and elsewhere. It is remarkable that, so far, the idea has not caught on in a big way in other countries, except for France. In Switzerland, a couple of special factors have contributed to the appeal. For one thing, they arrived on the market just as the commissions on small transactions in shares rocketed following the elimination of fixed rates. Thus, investors were attracted to securities that had carried only a modest fee. Some bankers had been concerned that customers would shift money from their bank savings accounts to these securities. However Mr Renaud Planta, a vice-president of UBS, says most of the shifting was from equities. Second, many of Switzerland's fund managers have not been allowed to invest in pure derivative instruments until recently, and others have been frightened of them. The Grois and Clous provided an indirect and low-risk way to learn new risk management techniques. 'We thought these would be retail products initially. We were astonished that a lot of institutions bought the 4 per cent tranche of the first Groi,' Mr Hafner says. It just so happens that 4 per cent is the minimum return that pension funds must achieve under Swiss law. In other countries, institutional investors already design their own risk-management products, and Swiss bankers expect and hope this trend will gradually take hold in Switzerland as well. Credit Suisse has already decided to concentrate on tailor-made products, suspecting that the market for off-the-shelf products will not continue growing strongly or be that profitable. UBS and SBC, on the other hand, believe a substantial market for off-the-shelf products will remain, and will carry on issuing them.</p>

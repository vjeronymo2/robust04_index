			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / BBC to cut 1,250 more support jobs THE BBC is to cut 1,250 jobs from its central bureaucracy in a move that it said yesterday would save Pounds 150m over five years. The latest job cuts follow an extensive review of all the BBC's support functions and will come in areas ranging from printing and systems development to market research and publicity. It is the first time there have been such swingeing job losses among support staff. Most of the 1,250 jobs will go over the next 18 months. The aim is to reduce BBC overheads in advance of the full introduction of Producer Choice next April. Under Producer Choice, BBC programme makers will have the right to buy the services they need from the outside market if it is more cost-effective. The savings in support services are designed to ensure that internal resources are competitive with the outside market. After a review of BBC radio resources, 17 studios will be closed and 20 outside broadcast vehicles withdrawn. Sir Michael Checkland, director-general of the BBC, said yesterday: 'The two reviews continue the clear policy of making the BBC more efficient, putting more money directly into programmes and making more BBC programmes outside the south-east of England.' Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the broadcasting union, said last night: 'We are shocked by the scale of this. Most of the people going are doing real jobs  - these are not bureaucrats.' The union said it would force the BBC to justify every single job to be lost. Bectu added that it seemed to be a case of assistant heads rolling. The BBC said yesterday it would be the last large tranche of job losses. The future scale of employment in the corporation would be determined by how successful staff were in competing with the market. About Pounds 30m of the Pounds 150m in savings will be needed to meet a shortfall that resulted from the 1991 licence-fee settlement, which was set below inflation. The cuts will bring job losses in BBC radio and television between 1986 and the end of next year to 7,000. The total reduction has, however, been 6,000 because of 1,000 jobs created by new programme developments. At present the BBC has a staff of about 23,000.</p>

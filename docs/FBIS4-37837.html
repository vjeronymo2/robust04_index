			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by Kamal </F> Tarabayh on 23 June; place not given; from "The Political Week"  program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Tarabayh] What is the latest  about the Middle East peace process on the Lebanese-Israeli  track?    [Buwayz] I am sure you are aware that Lebanon entered these  negotiations on two principles. The first concerns Lebanon;  that is, Israeli occupation of the Lebanese territory in the  south and western al-Biqa'. Lebanon continues to believe that  Resolution 425 constitutes the accurate, clear, and just  mechanism to remove this occupation. This is a basic condition.    Secondly, Lebanon is concerned about the dispute in general.  Lebanon is an Arab country, one of the ancient Arab  decisionmaking states and one of the founding members of the  Arab League. It hosts a large number of Palestinian people. It  is concerned with any peace in the region and with the fate of  these Palestinians. Therefore, Lebanon deals with this issue in  general in solidarity with the other Arab states. It will not  sign an agreement in isolation of the other concerned states and  before these states have regained their usurped rights. So far,  Israel wants to combine these two cases and we cannot yet say  that Israel has agreed to the principle of leaving the occupied  Lebanese territory.    We presented a clear mechanism. We said that Israel should  abide by full withdrawal behind the internationally recognized  borders. For this reason, we will accept the formation of a  joint military committee to discuss the tabulation and  programming of this withdrawal in addition to how peace and  stability can be secured in the south. Lebanon will then begin  talks in solidarity with its brothers on the level of this  future peace. [passage omitted]    [Tarabayh] Mr. Minister, frankly speaking, you are aware  that  the West, especially the United States, is asking the Lebanese  state to spread its control on the entire southern region; that  is, stopping the resistance operations so that Israel could stop  its attacks on the south. Are you adhering to the principled  stand of the Lebanese government; that is, continuing the  resistance until the end of the occupation?    [Buwayz] You said at the beginning that the world is  demanding that Lebanon impose its control over its entire  territory. That is what we wish and that is what we are  demanding from the Western world. However, the reality is  different. We believe that nobody in this world would like to  die for nothing, nobody likes to die unless he believes in a  sublime objective. We believe that the resistance is the result  and not the cause of the occupation because it began after the  occupation. A solution for this problem lies in reassuring  Lebanon that Israel will withdraw from its territory to the  internationally recognized borders. I believe that other  solutions, be they military or security solutions, have proved  after many years that they are futile and will only result in  more violence in southern Lebanon.    I really would like to ask about the results of the Israeli  attacks on the south over the past 10 years. Have these attacks  with all their technology, sophistication, and power, been able  to cancel the will of the Lebanese people to regain their south?  I think the solution is a political one and lies in a clear  Israeli commitment to withdraw from southern Lebanese.    [Tarabayh] If full Israeli withdrawal from the south is  realized, will Hizballah undertake to hand in their weapons and  renounce fighting?    [Buwayz] In any case, there is an undertaking by the  Lebanese  state that when Israel withdraws, this Lebanese state will be  committed--and it now has all the resources, and the required  security and stability--to implementing a full security plan in  the southern region. I believe that this has been a constant  policy of the successive governments during the era of President  al-Hirawi. These governments have presented this undertaking to  more than one team. Lebanon does not love violence and trouble.  It does not seek more than its natural and legitimate rights.  When this is realized. the Lebanese state, which is now strong  by its armed forces, will be committed to spreading its full  control over the entire south and laying down the basis of peace  and stability. [passage omitted]    [Tarabayh] What is Lebanon's attitude on the various tracks  of negotiations and the Arab coordination?    [Buwayz] We have all wished this peace to be a comprehensive  peace. We cannot view the comprehensiveness of this solution  and this peace the way things are being done; that is, by  separate means. Therefore, Lebanon, which believes that this  peace has to be either comprehensive or not to be at all, based  on experience and prior consideration of things, cannot but call  on everybody to effect cohesion in the peace process.    Moreover, we believe that this peace is an Arab-Israeli  peace  decision. Who represents the Arabs? They are represented by  all their states, trends, and forces. Therefore, we believe  that separate solutions will empty the meaning of a  comprehensive solution for the Arab-Israeli question. So far,  we believe that an Arab peace decision cannot be concluded  except through a unified Arab decision. It does not come  through separate paths.    As for what was realized on the Jordanian level in terms of  achievements, so far I really do not believe that there are  achievements. I do not know if you are aware what these  achievements are.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Boost for IMF members sought: UK-US proposal to increase international liquidity with SDR issue Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, will this weekend press the decision making body of the International Monetary Fund to agree to a UK-US plan that would allow the Fund to boost the monetary reserves of its member countries. The IMF's policy making Interim Committee will tomorrow consider British-American proposals to issue between 12bn and 16bn of the Fund's own reserve asset, the special drawing right, and so boost international liquidity by between Dollars 17.6bn (Pounds 11bn) and Dollars 23.5bn. Although the plan would supply reserves to all IMF members, it has been structured to confer special benefits on Russia and other former communist countries which have joined the IMF since the last issue of SDRs in 1981, as well as poor developing nations. In this way, London and Washington hope to overcome German opposition to the idea of a general increase in SDRs and so solve a problem that has been dogging international financial diplomacy for several years. The Interim Committee meeting could see some tough bargaining, however, with Germany expected to argue that any SDR allocation should only benefit the recently joined IMF members. Yesterday, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, said there were 'good reasons for being in favour' of a special allocation for new members. The UK-US proposals form part of a package of measures to increase the capacity of the IMF to provide financial support for countries in economic difficulty. The Interim Committee will also consider an increase in the annual access limits of IMF members to fund resources to 90 per cent from 68 per cent of their IMF quotas, or membership subscriptions, for three years. Also on the agenda is a plan to increase the use that former communist countries can make of the Fund's temporary special 'systemic transformation facility' that was set up to help Russia and other ex-communist states develop market-based economies. The US-UK plan for the SDR allocation consists of an 'equity' part to correct the injustice suffered by the 37 countries with no SDRs and a so-called 'pro-rata' allocation to the entire membership. The plan will require a change in the IMF articles, necessitating the backing of members with 85 per cent of total quotas and parliamentary ratification in most countries. Ironically, these formidable hurdles give the plan some chance of success because Germany insists it will only support a SDR issue if it is clear that it is a special one-off event. The Germans - backed by the US and Britain - have vigorously opposed proposals from Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, for a general issue of SDR36bn to all Fund members. These countries argue that Mr Camdessus's proposals, which would need just 85 per cent support in the IMF board, are unjustified because there is no global need for new liquidity. The pro-rata part of the UK-US plan is structured to allocate SDRs in two ways. Countries would either receive SDRs expressed as a percentage of quota (20, 24 or 29 per cent are under discussion) or a percentage increase (possibly 8 per cent) in their existing SDR reserves. British officials claim that this would give the low-income developing countries and former communist states more SDRs than under Mr Camdessus's proposals. They said that under the UK-US plan, Russia and other former Soviet republics could expect to get SDR1.6bn while low- and middle-income developing countries would receive SDR4.8bn. Mr Camdessus's plan would channel SDR11bn to the 11 richest industrial countries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Teplice nad Becvou, North Moravia, May 7 (CTK) --  Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus said today the Executive Council of  his Civic Democratic Party (ODS) had reaffirmed that the ODS  stuck to 81 "clear, transparent and comprehensible"  constituencies for Senate elections. Speaking during a pause in  the council's deliberations, Klaus said the council "is afraid  of creating complex electoral systems existing at one place  somewhere in the world" and was resolutely opposed to it.    The ODS Executive Council has recommended to create a  comprehensible, clear system providing for one-round voting if  possible, in which the winner of the biggest number of votes  would be elected senator, Klaus said. He allowed for the  two-round variant.    The other three coalition parties, the Civic Democratic  Alliance (ODA), the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak  People's Party (KDU-CSL) and the Christian Democratic Party  (KDS), had favoured the creation of 27 "three-mandate"  districts, each of which would send three senators to the new  house.    After a meeting of the four parties' chairmen last week,  Klaus said the parties were now inclining to the opinion that  elections to the as yet unformed Senate should take place in 81  one-mandate constitutions in a direct majority system.    Klaus said today the Executive Council would not order party  leaders to "run for the Senate at any cost if they prefer  running for the Chamber of Deputies two years later." He called  the chamber a much more important instrument of the Czech  Republic's parliamentary system.    The Senate elections will probably be held in the autumn,  when also local elections are slated to be held. Elections to  the Chamber of Deputies are to be held in 1996.</p>

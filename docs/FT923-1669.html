			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Liam Strong moves to shed Sears' men's wear division SEARS, the group behind such UK high street names as Wallis, Dolcis and Olympus, is shedding its men's wear division with the sale of Fosters and Your Price. This is the latest move by Mr Liam Strong, Sears' chief executive, who has been reviewing all parts of the poorly performing retail business since his arrival from British Airways in February. Last year Sears made a pre-tax profit of only Pounds 81.2m on sales of nearly Pounds 2bn from roughly 3,700 outlets. Mr Strong said the men's wear business was small and 'was not going to be an area of significant profit growth'. The group intended to 'concentrate on areas where we have or can build market leadership'. Fosters' management, headed by Mr David Carter Johnson, is paying Pounds 1 for the fittings, stock and other working capital. Sears will face an extraordinary charge of Pounds 82m, of which Pounds 42m is a write-off of goodwill related to a change in accountancy rules on acquisitions. The cash cost to Sears is Pounds 18m in professionals' fees, redundancy costs, the purchase of preference shares in Fosters and eliminating liabilities. It said it was shedding a business that had cost Pounds 30m over the past 2 1/2 years. Last year's trading losses were Pounds 9m on sales of Pounds 128m. So far this year it has lost nearly Pounds 11m more. The Fosters business, with 340 outlets, has 2.5 per cent of a UK men's wear market laid low by recession. Verdict, a market research organisation specialising in the retail sector, says the mens and boys' wear market contracted 9 per cent last year, and nearly 4 per cent in both 1989 and 1990. This year is also expected to be poor. Men's wear has always been a small part of Sears, which includes the Selfridges department store, womens fashion and childrens' wear and the Freemans mail order operation. The British Shoe Corporation is seen as a problem area and Mr Strong said the decision here was 'to improve and build'. Mr Carter Johnson has already spent 18 months trying to turn Fosters around. The Your Price stores would either be converted into Fosters shops or closed. The management buy-out is being backed by Hambro European Ventures. Lex, Page 20; Observer, Page 19; Market, Page 44</p>

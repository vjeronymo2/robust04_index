			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian president's decree on measures to combat  banditism and organized crime has aroused controversy in the  State Duma.    The Russia's Choice faction will urge the president to  recall  the decree, one of this faction's leaders, Doctor of Law Boris  Zolotukhin told Interfax. Although the importance of combating  crime is not in question, the decree is at variance with the  Constitution, the Criminal Code and international human rights  legislation, approved by Russia.    Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party's faction Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy told Interfax that the decree did not cause any  objections. He noted, however, that it would not work fully if  it was not supplemented with a State Duma resolution. He  announced that his faction was drafting a resolution which would  reduce the circulation of cash to the minimum by introducing  credit cards, impose a state of emergency in individual regions,  set up temporary courts for emergency trials which would be  granted the right to execute the ring-leaders of criminal  groupings without trial or due process, close major cities and  banish foreigners from them, and close the state border in a  number of regions.    Leader of the Communist Party's faction Gennadiy Zyuganov  stated that the decree "grossly violated the current laws and  neglected the Federal Assembly."    Member of the New Regional Policy group, Vice Chairman of  the  Committee for International Affairs Aleksandr Dzasokhov told  Interfax that the time had come to intensify the campaign  against crime. "However, it must not be based on mass  violations of human rights," he said.    He believes that the president's representative must make a  proposal in the State Duma on amending the current legislation  for stepping up measures to combat crime.    A leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Concord, Sergey  Stankevich, said that whereas the importance of a resolute  campaign against crime was indisputable, the methods listed in  the decree were quite alarming. The decree gives everyone  direct administrative access to commercial information, which  goes against the constitutional norms, he said.    Leader of the Russian Way group Sergey Baburin said that the  decree would give rise to administrative terror. He told  Interfax that the decree neither defended human rights nor  created mechanisms for combating crime. He also noted that he  welcomed the State Duma's decision to include the discussion of  the decree in the agenda of the next session.    Leader of the Democratic Party faction Nikolay Travkin said  he would welcome the most ruthless measures to combat crime. If  we fail to cardinally change the situation today, tomorrow human  rights will be violated everywhere and more seriously than in  the decree, he said.    The president's decree is an anti-constitutional act which  is  at variance with other Russian laws, Chairman of the State  Duma's Committee for Security Viktor Ilyukhin (the Communist  Party's faction) told Interfax.    The guarantor of the Constitution, the president violates  the  Constitution, he said.    He also urged Prosecutor-General Aleksey Ilyushenko to  respond to such violations of the law.</p>

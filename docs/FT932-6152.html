			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzis to loosen grip on family company FERRUZZI, Italy's second largest industrial grouping, yesterday decided to seek outside shareholders to offset mounting losses, reduce borrowings and concentrate on a core of agro-business. The move, aimed at ending the Ferruzzi family's tight hold on the group, marks an important milestone in Italian corporate history as pressure mounts on family-controlled companies to modernise managements and broaden capital bases. The group is controlled through Serafino Ferruzzi. This is owned by Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, chairman and sole son of the group's founder, and two sisters, Alessandra and Franca. A third sister, Idina, ceased to be a shareholder in July, 1991, following the highly-publicised departure of her husband, Mr Raul Gardini, from the group's helm. Ferruzzi's aggressive expansion in the 1980s was largely due to Mr Gardini. He is now blamed for the high gearing behind much of the group's problems. Yesterday it was announced that new shareholders, local and foreign, would be sought in Serafino. Through Serafino, Ferruzzi has a 45 per cent stake in the stock market-listed Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) which controls Montedison, the food to chemicals group. Ferfin yesterday revealed a L1,519bn consolidated net loss for 1992, against a L115bn profit in 1991. Turnover rose 12 per cent to L19,900bn from 17,800bn. The figures were after financial charges of L1,644bn, up from L935bn. Net financial indebtedness of the group rose 72 per cent to L15,120bn from L8,800bn. Ferfin blamed non-operating companies' performance as largely 'the principal cause of the fall in the group's results.' Ferfin said it wouldn't declare any dividend. In 1991, it paid a dividend of L45 per ordinary share and L75 per savings share. Montedison is itself heavily in the red. It reported yesterday a 1992 loss of L1,244bn (Dollars 841.67m) against a profit of L168bn in 1991. Gross turnover last year was 8 per cent higher at L16,968bn. The group has just sold its pharmaceutical interests, bringing in L1,900bn, and is now awaiting the outcome of a deal with Shell to reorganise and reduce its plastics business through its Himont subsidiary.</p>

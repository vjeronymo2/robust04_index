			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / The Markets: LME studies US warehousing - Commodities The London Metal Exchange on Wednesday holds its first management board meeting since its move a week ago to new, bigger premises in Fenchurch Street. Members will be paying particular attention to see if there is any development on plans to extend the exchange's warehouse coverage to the US. This issue has been brought to the fore in recent weeks by a tightening squeeze on copper supplies that has distorted the price structure of that metal's contract at the LME. Exchange warehouse stocks of copper have fallen to the equivalent of five and a half weeks' consumption - an uncomfortably low level, according to some analysts. But some suggest that that is not the whole reason for the growing 'backwardation' (price premium for nearby delivery over forward positions) in the market. An additional problem, they say, is that most of the LME stockpile is in Europe, while most of the short-term demand is in the US. In normal circumstances forward positions in the metals markets are at a premium to nearbys (as they are at the moment for all other LME contracts), reflecting the costs of holding physical metal - lost interest, storage, insurance etc. But tight availability of supplies for nearby delivery can reverse this position; and inadequate warehouse coverage can make matters worse. It has also been suggested that Wednesday's board meeting could discuss extending warehousing in south-east Asia outside Singapore. Metal Bulletin magazine said this week that there had been talk emanating from China that Shanghai could be a candidate. On Thursday the International Primary Aluminium Institute is to issue its assessment of western world stocks of the metal in September. LME traders will be anxious to see evidence of a continuation of the drawdown, following the multilateral production-cutting agreement reached earlier this year, that has helped to lift prices to four-year highs.</p>

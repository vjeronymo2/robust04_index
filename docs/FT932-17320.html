			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / IBM says four big plants are 'surplus' INTERNATIONAL Business Machines says four of its big European manufacturing sites are surplus to its requirements. The plants include some of IBM's best known European operations: Havant in the UK, which makes small memory units; Montpelier in France, which makes silicon chips and large mainframe computers; Valencia, which makes small mainframes in Spain; and the printer plant at Jarfalla in Sweden. The company plans to make these plants 'independent business units', run by their local managements. The experiment will only continue if the plants can show themselves capable of returning a satisfactory profit. This plan, however, was drawn up before the arrival of Mr Louis Gerstner, IBM's newly appointed chairman and chief executive. He starts his new job today, with a meeting of top managers to review the state of IBM's operations and the measures it is taking to improve its performance. Mr Gerstner is expected to take a more aggressive approach to cost cutting. The future of the four European plants identified as surplus is therefore uncertain. A total of 4,867 jobs at the plants are at stake. In the US, IBM this week notified some 2,600 workers at its mainframe computer and semiconductor plants in New York state they have lost their jobs. These are the first involuntary redundancies in IBM's 79-year history. An additional 3,400 employees have agreed to take early retirement. IBM has said it plans to eliminate more than 25,000 jobs worldwide this year, including 10,000 in Europe, as part of a restructuring plan announced in January. However, industry analysts expect Mr Gerstner to increase the target to as many as 100,000, which would require large scale redundancies throughout IBM's operations. IBM's European operations will be under intense pressure to improve their performance. Last year, IBM made operating profits of Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) in Europe, down from Dollars 3bn the year before. Restructuring charges, however, forced a loss of Dollars 1.7bn. Mr Renato Riverso, head of IBM Europe, was not optimistic yesterday about the region's business prospects for 1993. He was not confident that growth would return in 1994. He said the original target of 10,000 job cuts in Europe could be achieved without closing manufacturing plants or forced redundancies.</p>

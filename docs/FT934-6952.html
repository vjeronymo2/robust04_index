			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Petrochemicals Europe face difficult future Europe's petrochemicals industry is facing a fundamental decline in competitiveness, according to Mr Edward Wilson, vice-president strategic planning of Dow Europe. 'The problems on the horizon loom large and the social and economic consequences are frightening,' he said. The region's trade surplus in petrochemicals was shrinking as imports grew faster than exports, European chemical output was slowing, while the Pacific region had become the fastest-growing chemical producing area, he told the Financial Times petrochemicals conference yesterday. Europe was suffering from high monopoly energy pricing, high-cost, low productivity labour, high environmental costs, and a punishing tax regime, said Mr Wilson. In addition, the sector suffered from a lack of pipeline infrastructure to transport low-cost ethylene to low-cost downstream plastic manufacturers. 'American ethylene manufacturers are earning twice the amount on their investment as the best European counterparts. The average return on investment in 1991 for North American producers was 28 per cent, compared with a European average of 13 per cent,' said Mr Wilson. A pick-up in the growth of the world economy next year would not bring back petrochemical operating rates back to peak levels before 1997 or 1998, said Mr Wilson. Certain sectors would continue to be troubled. Demand for PVC would be flat for the rest of the decade because of public pressure to reduce the use of chlorine, he warned. Poor pricing was not the root cause of the industry's problems, but rather the reflection of those problems. The industry needed to rationalise, but the traditional method of looking at the viability of ethylene plants was flawed. Normally, analysts only looked at costs. If back-integration with refineries, logistics and the choice of downstream products were analysed a different picture emerged. 'Under current conditions there is a Dollars 200 difference per tonne of ethylene between the best and worst European plant, but there is a Dollars 1,000 difference between the lowest and highest margin,' said Mr Wilson. The determination of the Italian and French governments to privatise their petrochemicals companies should allow former state companies to participate in facing up to the industry's crisis, said Mr Wilson.</p>

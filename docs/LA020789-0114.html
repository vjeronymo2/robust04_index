			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH S&amp;L BAILOUT PLAN WOULD COST $90 BILLION;  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS EXPRESS CAUTIOUS APPROVAL  </P> <P> Members of Congress, while expressing cautious approval for President Bush's  plan to bail out the nation's savings and loan industry, indicated concern  Monday that it may put too great a burden on taxpayers and predicted that it  will not emerge from Congress untouched.  </P> <P> Congress "is very likely to make changes in this before it's finally approved,"  Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said.  </P> <P> The likely impact of industry lobbying remains difficult to gauge. S&amp;L  executives voiced concerns that higher deposit insurance premiums could  decimate their institutions, but Barry Beeksma, chairman of the U.S. League of  Savings Institutions, said that his group is "neither endorsing nor rejecting"  the Bush plan.  </P> <P> Banking leaders, although unhappy that they too would have to pay more for  deposit insurance, expressed satisfaction that S&amp;L fees would remain higher  than theirs. And they were pleased that their premiums would be used not  directly to bail out the S&amp;Ls but rather to beef up their own deposit  insurance fund.  </P> <P> Lawmakers focused on a proposal that would require an estimated $3 billion to  $5 billion annually from general revenues to help pay the interest on $50  billion in government bonds that would be used to pay off depositors at  hundreds of insolvent S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plan Called Reasonable  </P> <P> "I think it's a reasonable plan, and I'm pleased the President has taken this  initiative," Dole said. But he frowned on the cost to taxpayers of $3 billion  to $5 billion a year, "especially if we're going to be crowding out some  programs like education, where we want to put more money in."  </P> <P> The Democratic chairmen of the Senate and House banking committees, vowing to  tackle the S&amp;L issue in a bipartisan spirit, expressed measured support for  Bush's proposal. Their endorsement will be crucial if the plan, or something  like it, is to be enacted.  </P> <P> "I think this is by and large a sensible proposal . . . that gives us good  signs of bipartisan cooperation," said Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan,  chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fears Cuts in Other Areas  </P> <P> "But there are still some questions on how this will be funded. . . . Will  there be pressure to take it out of health care, Medicare, or the war on drugs?  I hope not."  </P> <P> In the House, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the Banking, Finance  and Urban Affairs Committee, complimented Bush for preparing a bailout plan so  quickly after his inauguration. He voiced the hope that Congress will be able  to reach a quick solution to the problem.  </P> <P> However, Gonzalez expressed some doubts. He warned, for example, that the costs  of increased insurance premiums for S&amp;Ls "will be passed on to the small  depositor in the form of higher fees unless the Congress mandates otherwise. .  . . The deposit premium increases, in reality, will hit the small depositor  even harder and leave the affluent untouched." Other committee members  predicted that the plan might wind up undermining the S&amp;L industry's  ability to provide home mortgages at reasonable rates. Rep. Frank Annunzio  (D-Ill.) said that Bush's plan to place the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which  regulates S&amp;Ls, under control of the Treasury Department could have a  "devastating impact" on the ability of Americans to obtain home loans.  </P> <P> "It will only be a matter of time before the Treasury Department eliminates  entirely the savings and loans industry and, with it, its role as the nation's  home lender," he said. "When that happens, mortgage rates will skyrocket."  </P> <P> Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, noted that  the proposal is bound to be unpopular, given the magnitude of the problem.  </P> <P> "Nobody is going to go out and embrace and kiss on the mouth a plan that tries  to fill a $50-billion hole," he said. "But I think something very close to this  plan is going to be adopted. . . . I think we'll see real bipartisanship here."  </P> <P> S&amp;L and bank lobbyists did not rush to embrace the proposal. Beeksma,  representing S&amp;Ls, said: "There are components of the President's proposals  that would be burdensome to our industry if adopted."  </P> <P> Beeksma said that his organization will lobby hard against permanently charging  S&amp;Ls more than banks for their deposit insurance. He expressed support for  Bush's proposal to crack down on "that small element of lawbreakers" who have  stolen or squandered huge amounts of money from S&amp;Ls in recent years.  </P> <P> Bank representatives noted approvingly that Bush's plan would not call on their  institutions to assist ailing S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> The burden of financing the proposal "will fall largely on the savings and  loans themselves, where it belongs," said C. G. Holthus, president-elect of the  American Bankers Assn. "We are encouraged that apparently banks and their  customers will not be asked to bail out the S&amp;Ls."  </P> <P> Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Assn.,  also expressed satisfaction that Bush's plan "inflicted more fees on the  sinners than on the saints."  </P></p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways Sir Colin Marshall must have breathed a large sigh of relief yesterday as he successfully anticipated and defused criticisms of BA's management at its annual meeting. Small shareholders were more inclined to discuss the merits of Cornwall, the imperfections of Concorde and the beastliness of transporting furry animals by air than unravelling the mysteries of the Virgin affair. Large institutions have never been much interested in the matter. BA therefore looks as though it has survived the storm. The appointment of more non-executive directors, including the no-nonsense chief executive of Inchcape, Mr Charles Mackay, helps reassure. But there are still unanswered questions. Publicly, Virgin says it is determined to pursue its legal case. That may result in BA directors appearing in court, throwing up more bad publicity. Moreover, Virgin has opened another front by complaining that BA has breached EC anti-trust rules. Shareholders may dismiss these issues as rather tiresome but they are unlikely to go away. The Pounds 22m general provision BA continues to carry against litigation suggests it regards such tussles as a permanent feature of the airline business.</p>

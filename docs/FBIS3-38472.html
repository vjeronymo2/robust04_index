He announced the details in Bonn today before the  Bundestag Defense Committee.    He said that just under DM600 million of the cuts will be  achieved by means of immediate measures. Individual measures to  account for the remaining sum of around DM650 million will be  decided during the year, Ruehe said. The list of immediate  measures comprises a total of six items. It provides, among  other things, for a reduction in Bundeswehr strength to 345,000  soldiers by yearend.    The budget allocation for international missions is to be  cut  by DM100 million. If the Bundeswehr is needed further in this  area in 1994, additional funding is to be provided. Funds for  military procurements are to be cut by DM220 million. Some  DM165 million less are to be spent on civilian and military  personnel. The suspension of all military exercises in the  second half of 1994 is intended to achieve savings of a further  DM45 million.    Some DM60 million are to be spent on rebuilding the  infrastructure in the new [eastern] states. Savings of around  DM10 million altogether are also to be made in the navy and air  force.</p>

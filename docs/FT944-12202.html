			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Swedish bonds top league table All European government bond markets posted positive total returns in October with the exception of France, where bonds were plagued by pre-election jitters, JP Morgan's monthly government bond index monitor shows. Sweden was the best performing market, with a monthly return of 2.26 per cent in local currency terms. It was buoyed by hopes that the new government will take additional measures to cut the country's large budget deficit and signs - including a 20 basis point interest rate increase - that in the absence of fiscal tightening, the Riksbank will do its bit to slow the level of economic activity. In Belgium, lower than expected inflation data and a steepening yield curve increased the market's attractiveness, the survey states. In Ireland, lower money market rates also provided the bond market with an improvement in funding costs. 'In both markets, funded spread trades over Germany became more attractive in October, thus leading to significant foreign inflows,' the report states. The Japanese market weakened on continuing economic recovery and the edging-up of short rates allowed by the Bank of Japan. The market posted local currency returns of minus 0.28 per cent. In the US, continued signs of economic growth and a delay in further Fed tightening pushed yields higher, resulting in a minus 0.06 per cent total return. Meanwhile, Kemper Investment Management's monthly bond survey, which includes some of the smaller markets, found that Finnish bonds, with a return of 3.68 per cent, posted the strongest gains, followed by Sweden and Norway.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sharp decline to Pounds 80,651 at Goodwin Goodwin, the Stoke-on-Trent engineering company, reported pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 of Pounds 80,651, a little more than a third of the comparable Pounds 232,040. Turnover fell 8 per cent, from Pounds 7.13m to Pounds 6.59m. The company said that reorganisation had been undertaken to improve efficiency. Investment in exports remained high and as a result margins were unlikely to recover before the end of the year. Earnings per share came out at 0.75p (2.16p).</p>

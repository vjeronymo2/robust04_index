			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hewlett-Packard UK at Pounds 83m - Worldwide profits performance more than doubles to Dollars 1.2bn The UK subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard, the US-based computers and electronics group, outperformed its parent last year with a Pounds 90m turnround in pre-tax profits and a 43 per cent increase in turnover to more than Pounds 1bn. Worldwide, HP reported profits of Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 810m) in 1993, up from Dollars 549m the previous year. Revenues rose 23 per cent to Dollars 20.3bn, making it the second largest computer manufacturer in the US and easily the most profitable. The UK subsidiary made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 82.6m compared with a Pounds 7.4m loss the previous year. Mr John Golding, UK managing director, played down the profit improvement pointing out that the figures reflected internal accounting policy rather than trading performance. He attached more importance to the growth in overall turnover, which reached Pounds 1.02bn, and to a 50 per cent increase in exports to Pounds 324m. Mr Golding said the company's performance was the result of quality programmes, eliminating waste, consolidating operations and keeping expenses under control. During the year, HP bought Colorado Memory Systems (Europe) and BT&amp;D Technologies, strengthening its activities in computer mass storage and in telecommunications. HP seems to have proved itself better able to ride out the recession and turbulence in the global computer industry than other large computer manufacturers. It is, according to Mr Golding, profitable in all its product sectors including computer systems, printers, calculators and electronic instruments. It is strengthening its performance in personal computers and is now the fourth largest pc vendor in Europe.</p>

He said he  used information from an episode of the "MacGyver" TV show. The show's producer  said there was no such episode.  </P> <P> The bomb was discovered by third-graders in the boys' restroom shortly after 10  a.m. and exploded by the bomb squad on the school playground at 11:05, just six  minutes before it would have gone off, a deputy said.  </P></p>

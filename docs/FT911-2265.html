			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Acas sees strikes at record low A RECORD low in the number of strikes last year was matched by the highest level of individual claims to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas), the service said yesterday in its annual report. The number of officially recorded strikes fell to a 55-year low in 1990. At the same time, the number of individual conciliation claims that statutory employment rights had been infringed was the highest since Acas was established in 1975, the report stated. The chairman of Acas, Mr Douglas Smith, said the low level of strikes reflected a 'shift in the balance of power'. Unions had lost one in four of their members over the past 10 years and were finding it difficult to recruit among such groups as part-time workers and financial services employees. Trade unions were also much more pragmatic about what needed to be accepted in order to preserve jobs, he added. Complaints alleging sex and race discrimination in employment were the highest ever; formal complaints of unfair dismissal rose by almost a quarter over 1989; and allegations of unlawful deductions from pay rose by about 50 per cent. Overall, there were more than 52,000 individual cases for conciliation, the report stated. Requests for collective arbitration in industrial disputes rose by 8 per cent to about 1,300. Individuals were increasingly prepared to pursue their rights under the law, said Mr Smith. In addition, the 'shake-out of labour' resulting from the recession had increased all Acas's activities, he said. The number of complaints relating to the implementation of redundancies almost doubled during the year. These complaints often involved the methods of selection for redundancy, according to the report. An increasing number of organisations had sought to move away from long-standing 'last in, first out' agreements in favour of other arrangements which they considered offered the best path to a skilled and balanced workforce, Acas said. While unions still sought to match pay claims to inflation, it was increasingly employers' views about what they could afford to pay that were determining pay increases, said the report. 'It was notable, in particular, that where employers had been open and frank about difficult trading circumstances and what might be needed to preserve jobs, lower settlements proved possible,' Acas concluded.</p>

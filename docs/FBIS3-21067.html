Inspection of bearings in electric motor drives: After  having recorded and evaluated the diagnostic data with the aid  of a computer, we submitted the results to the operators with  recommendation as to necessary steps to be taken. By repeating  the measurements periodically, we monitored the steps taken and  their effects. Our software also contained data on the location  of machine sets, on the kind of drives, on the operating  conditions, on prior disturbances, and on typical worn parts.    2. Generator and motor windings: By measurements made during  partial load dumping, we determined the state of the insulation  of individual coils. Depending on the results of diagnosis, it  was decided whether a new complete winding should be installed  or replacement of the damaged coil will suffice.    3. Transformers in industrial plants and electric  public-utility networks: In oil-filled and thus high-cost  transformers, for instance, electric and thermal anomalies  during their still harmless early stage already produce small  amounts of noxious gases which dissolve in the insulating oil.  Using the appropriate methods, we extracted these gases from the  oil and analyzed them by gas chromatography. The examinations  were performed systematically, without considering the course of  operation, whereupon we evaluated the results using a special  computer program. In this way faults were detected already in  the initial stage.    4. Switchgear components: Besides mechanical loads also and  above all electrical loads can produce weak spots in the  insulation, whether under the applied voltage or during fast  short events such as switching, ground fault, short circuit, or  lightning stroke. Using the appropriate methods and instruments,  we have checked the state of the insulation during operation.  From the results one can learn not only about just the  switchgear alone, however. With a sufficiently sensitive method  of diagnosis and with enough experience on hand, it is even  possible to extract from the main switchgear of an industrial  network ideas about the state of the insulation of equipment  operating in substations tied into that network.</p>

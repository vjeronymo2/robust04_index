			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Scots seek to avoid another cereals overshoot Scottish farmers' leaders will meet next month to find a way of avoiding another costly overshoot of the annual cereal production target they have to meet under the reform of the common agricultural policy. European Community farm ministers agreed earlier this month to water down penalties for this year's overshoot, which the National Farmers' Union of Scotland said would have cost the industry Pounds 20m. 'We're very relieved this threat has been lifted,' said Mr David Jack, chairman of the union's cereals committee. 'It would have decimated Scottish cereals production.' The problem arose over a discrepancy between the 'base area' used by the British government to calculate what Scotland's cereal output should be and the actual arable area for which farmers claimed compensation from Brussels for cuts in support prices. The latter exceeded the former by 5.4 per cent, and the European Commission was set to cut their payments this year by the equivalent - Pounds 4.5m - and to require them to leave an extra 5.4 per cent of land idle next year without compensation, in addition to the 15 per cent set-aside for which they are paid. The compromise put forward by the Commission, along the lines of offers made to farmers facing penalties in Germany and Spain, would leave Scottish arable farmers only about Pounds 2m short, according the union. Under the compromise, they face a penalty of 0.54 per cent in payments and set-aside for the first year, instead of 5.4 per cent. The penalties will gradually increase if the base area is exceeded in coming years. Mr Jack said the union still had doubts about the Scottish Office's base area, which was calculated using census figures. However, he said the meeting of the cereals committee on January 19 would review the whole scheme.</p>

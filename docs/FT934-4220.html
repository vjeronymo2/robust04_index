			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mr and Mrs Suburban: winners or losers? - The effects on three different households / The Budget and You Two Budgets in one tax year create enough detail to confuse any taxpayer. What makes matters even more complex is that both Norman Lamont and Kenneth Clarke announced measures which would take effect in future tax years. Our Budget 'At a Glance' box on page II guides investors through the timetable of tax changes. But for the effect on individual taxpayers, the Weekend FT asked Michael Bishopp and Clive Mackintosh of Price Waterhouse to analyse how three different households will face different tax bills in 1994-95. MR &amp; MRS SUBURBAN. Mr Suburban has a salary of Pounds 30,000 and his wife earns Pounds 15,000. He has an 1800cc company car, which cost Pounds 19,000 and he travels 5,000 business miles a year. They have a joint mortgage of Pounds 60,000 which bears an interest rate of 7.5 per cent per annum. Following an inheritance, they have investments of Pounds 80,000, yielding an annual gross income of Pounds 3,800. The Suburban couple are losers from the combined Lamont/Clarke Budgets on a number of points. For a start, Mr Suburban who is a 40 per cent taxpayer, gets the married couple's allowance. Relief on that allowance is being restricted to 20 per cent from April 1994, reducing its value to Mr Suburban from Pounds 688 to Pounds 344. In 1995-96, the allowance will be limited further to 15 per cent, costing the Suburbans another Pounds 86 a year. The couple will also pay a higher National Insurance Bill because of two changes; the increase in the higher rate from 9 to 10 per cent announced by Lamont; and the widening of the bands, from Pounds 56-Pounds 420 per week to Pounds 57-Pounds 430 per week, announced by Clarke. The combined effect costs Mr Suburban Pounds 232 and Mrs Suburban Pounds 112 in 1994-95. The restriction of tax relief on mortgage interest to 20 per cent (another Lamont measure) from April 1994 will cost the Suburbans Pounds 112 a year. These changes offset one of the few positive tax moves - the widening of the 20 per cent tax band from Pounds 2,500 to Pounds 3,000 - which will save the couple Pounds 25 a year each. Mr Suburban's company car is taxed more heavily in 1994-95 because of a change in the tax system, introduced in Norman Lamont's last Budget. The new system is based on the list price of the vehicle when new, rather than on a combination of engine size and price as before. The change hits middle managers like Mr Suburban, who made optimum use of the old system which encouraged company car owners to own vehicles costing less than Pounds 19,250 and under 2,000cc. All this means the taxable benefit of Mr Suburban's car will increase from Pounds 2,990 to Pounds 4,433, pushing up his tax bill by Pounds 577.20. The couple also see their fuel bill increase by Pounds 74, because of the imposition of 8 per cent VAT, and, as they drink wine and smoke cigarettes, their expenditure on alcohol and tobacco will rise by Pounds 28 a year. The increase of 3p a litre on petrol increases their motoring costs by Pounds 113 a year. Overall, the Suburbans are Pounds 1,542 worse off in 1994-95. MR PENSIONER Mr Pensioner is single, over 70 years old and receives a basic pension plus SERPS, plus an occupational pension of Pounds 15 per week. He has neither savings, nor mortgage and drinks beer. After the Budget, his basic pension will rise from Pounds 56.10 to Pounds 57.60 per week in 1994-95; of that increase, 50p is due to the VAT compensation package. Because he is a beer drinker, the Budget did not increase Mr Pensioner's alcohol bill. VAT on fuel, however, will increase the amount Mr Pensioner spends on heating by Pounds 47.50 a year. The changes appear to leave Mr Pensioner marginally better off, because the rise in his pension is higher than the rise in his fuel bill. However, the pension rise is, of course, designed to compensate pensioners for price increases on other goods, such as food. If one nets out that part of the pension increase which is solely due to VAT on fuel - Pounds 26 a year - one can see that it does not compensate the pensioner for the actual rise in the fuel bill of Pounds 47.50 a year. MR &amp; MRS WEALTHY The Lamont/Clarke Budgets have provided mixed news for the Wealthys. Mr Wealthy earns Pounds 100,000 a year, has a company Porsche with a list price of Pounds 30,000, in which he travels 10,000 business miles a year with fuel provided. He has already invested Pounds 25,000 in Business Expansion Schemes this tax year, which will earn him Pounds 10,000 in tax relief. Mrs Wealthy earns Pounds 30,000 a year and has a company Toyota Celica, with a list price of Pounds 20,000. No fuel is provided by the company; her annual business mileage is 2,000 miles. the couple has a joint mortgage of Pounds 60,000, at an interest rate of 7.5 per cent. Mr Wealthy liked the safe, property-backed BES companies; he will not be tempted by the more risky Enterprise Investment Scheme, due to start in January. So, merely because of the end of the BES, he will pay a lot more tax in 1994-95. But if one ignores the BES, the Wealthys are, surprisingly, better off because of this year's Budgets. This is because of their company cars. In 1993-94, Mr Wealthy's car is taxed as part of the band worth more than Pounds 29,001; the taxable benefit is Pounds 10,400. For 1994-95, the taxable benefit is based on 35 per cent of the price of the Porsche (Pounds 30,000), with a one-third reduction because his mileage is between 2,500 and 18,000. The taxable benefit falls by Pounds 3,040; his gain is 40 per cent of that, or Pounds 1,216. Mrs Wealthy also gains from the differing tax treatment of company cars. In 1993-94, her taxable benefit was Pounds 6,210, plus a 50 per cent increase because she drove less than 2,500 business miles, making the total Pounds 9,315. For 1994-95, the benefit is the cost of the car (Pounds 20,000) multiplied by 0.35, or Pounds 7,000. Her benefit falls by Pounds 2,315; her gain is 40 per cent or Pounds 926. So even though the Wealthys suffer from a higher National insurance bill, a higher fuel bill and from reduced tax relief on their mortgages and on the married couple's allowance, the effect of this year's Budgets is to leave them better off by around Pounds 1,224. The examples show that averages can be a misleading way of judging the effects of Budgets, because of the complex nature of each family's circumstances. Even though analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that the Budgets have had the greatest impact on the richest 10 per cent of the population, much depends on technical factors such as company cars and BES investments.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MR PENSIONER  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  1993-94     1994-95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Income from state and occupational pension         4,217       4,296 OUTGOINGS Tax                                                    0           0 Alcohol                                           127.10      127.10 Fuel                                              540.00      587.50 TOTAL OUTGOINGS                                   667.10      714.60 Total spendable income                          3,549.90    3,581.40 GAIN FROM CHANGES                                              31.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures in Pounds.

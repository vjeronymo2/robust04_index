			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chai Fang Jie (2693 2455 2638) and Wang Zhiqiang (3769 </F> 1807 1730): "Some $140 Million is Used for Environmental  Protection"]    [Text] The agreement signing ceremony for the People's Bank  of China to grant the Asian Development Bank loan to Tangshan  and Chengde cities to carry out environmental protection  projects was held at Shoudu Hotel in Beijing at 1000 in the  morning of 3 June.    The People's Bank of China granted $140 million of an Asian  Development Bank loan to the Tangshan and Chengde city people's  governments. Of this sum, Tangshan will take $85 million and  Chengde will take $55 million. This time, Tangshan will use  this Asian Development Bank loan for carrying out a group of  projects for improving the city environment, including the gas  supply and transmission project of the city gas company, the  heating supply project of the city heating company in the  central district, and four other projects. Chengde city will  use this loan to build the coking gas project. Upon completion,  the industrial sector and citizens may replace coal with gas,  the daily gas supply may reach 470,000 cubic meters, about 80  percent of citizens may have gas supply, and all the produced  metallurgical coke will be supplied to Chengde Iron and Steel  Company. Thus, we may have gas supply in these two cities and  fundamentally solve the pollution problems in these famous  historical and cultural cities.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA AS A TREND-SETTER AND OPPOSITION TO PROP. 111  </P> <P> Peirce quotes a Times poll that Golden State voters greatest concern is that  Proposition 111 gasoline tax funds would not be spent "wisely," yet he seems  surprised that Californians are not enthralled by Proposition 111 provisions  that would "provide commuters with alternatives such as rail transit and car-  and van-pool programs," and "flexible congestion relief."  </P> <P> Wake up, Neal.  </P> <P> These are the very provisions of Proposition 111 that a majority of the voters  don't like and won't vote for. They know that rail transit and car-pool  programs have been giant failures in Atlanta, Miami, San Francisco, Washington,  Houston, Seattle and Pittsburgh. So long as automobiles and fuel to operate  them are affordable, and the population growth continues, California voters  will demand more "roads, roads, roads."  </P> <P> WAYNE KING  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

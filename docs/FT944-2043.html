			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Books: Human kind richly defined - Poetry / Douglas Dunn reviews the latest crop of contemporary verse Thirty-odd years ago - if you are old enough - did you ever think you would read a poem by Allen Ginsberg, beginning 'as I cross my kitchen floor the thought of Death returns'? I bet you didn't. Did you foretell that in his penitent old age the arch-Beat would write an anti-smoking song? Or that he would write poems in which he asked how he got himself into this mess, 'this workaholic show-biz meditation market'? Is this what the Beats come to - remorse and contrition? Lucky Kerouac, to have died before his talent and success drove him to give up fags and booze. Ginsberg's recent poetry (Cosmopolitan Greetings, Penguin, Pounds 7.99) subtracts from his prestige as an icon of rhapsody and excess. While a lot of contemporary poetry would benefit from even a few ounces of Ginsberg's earlier fire and energy, that could not be said of Douglas Oliver's Penniless Poetics (Bloodaxe Books, Pounds 7.95). For about 50 pages Oliver drives on with a big, baggy stanza which is a handy instrument in a poem of sustained narrative rollick and invention. What the poem says might be a bit hard to take at times, which could be the same as saying that living up to its brilliant first line - 'all politics the same crux: to define human kind richly' - is too much a matter of the reader's conviction and not the author's. Oliver's poem is up-tempo and generously inventive, and much the same has to be said for Iain Crichton Smith's poetry. His range includes almost everything between footnotes and the 'marvellous spendthrift universe'. He is not as sexily post-modernist, though, and much of his power stems from short passages and even individual phrases. His poetry aspires to a timeless lyricism: 'The moon shone like a round shield/ In a window between two countries/ Like ice that has grown over unowned land.' More than many poets, Smith seems to write straight from dreams, which might be why his work carries a look of spontaneity. Ends &amp; Beginnings (Carcanet Press, Pounds 8.95) shows a poet now in his 60s writing as if with a new lease of life. It includes some of his best work. A more exact, engraved rather than brushed poetry, confirms just what an interesting poet Pauline Stainer is (The Ice-Pilot Speaks, Bloodaxe Books, Pounds 6.95) - as well as setting up a contrast with the immediacy of Ginsberg and Oliver, or Crichton Smith's less disciplined lyricism. Her best gift is an artist's discretion in coaxing what she is saying onto the page (see, for instance, 'Between Stations' and 'A Study for the Badminton Game'). Today's version of the courtly in poetry is a self-aware reliance on art, music and other literature, and there is a lot of that in her work. The originality of her perceptions prevents its deliberately 'cultural' climate from becoming precious. Whatever Geoff Hattersley has to worry about, it is not preciosity. Some poems in Don't Worry (Bloodaxe Books Pounds 7.95), though, give an impression of slightness, cleverness, or embarrassment in case there is a danger of being too serious. There is real gusto in his work as well as a manic but controlled humour. He can evoke odd or unnerving states of mind, enigmas, private terrors, domestic emergencies, with techniques or ways of looking at things that seem devised to give the familiar a good shake. 'Time passes slowly here in south Yorkshire. The dustbinmen came yesterday . . . My cough gets on my nerves but at least I own it.' Cheeky, imaginative, cerebral, witty - it is poetry with a lot to say for itself. 'Poet Laureate Ritual Bath Murder' in Douglas Houston's new book, The Hunters in the Snow (Bloodaxe Books, Pounds 6.95), is as certain a piece of literary satire as I have come across in a while - although the object of the satire is how Ted Hughes is mythologised by his less intelligent admirers. Houston's characteristic poems tend to be chunkier, more serious and sorrowful although sharpened by quirky humour and observations. A deft technical command, confident imagery - 'Night falling like a weightless slab of slate' - and an agreeable first person singular, make this an enjoyable collection. Less showily formal than others, 'Encounter' and 'Taking a Break' suggest that simplicity is the most poetic wile of all. Poems of Gerard Woodward's such as 'After the Deafening', 'A Nocturnal Breakfast' and 'Tomatoes' jolt with an almost disturbing originality in After the Deafening (Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 7.99). 'Making Strange' is a process at once mysterious and recognisable. You feel that you have been shown something new, or that the previously familiar really has been re-examined with a fresh eye and intellect. Not all his poems work anything like as well, but when they do the result feels like a sting to the nervous system.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Norwich Union switch - At a glance Norwich Union, the big UK insurer, has switched its life and pensions sales agents from commission to salaries. In March the insurer announced that it was suspending its entire sales force for a month for retraining, after the life industry's regulator identified breakdowns in management control. Instead of being paid by commission on the policies they sell, sales agents will receive a basic annual salary of Pounds 12,000 as well as commission. The number of branch offices is to be cut from 25 to 13.</p>

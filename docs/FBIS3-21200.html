			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Seiji Samukawa, Microelectronics Research </F> Laboratories, NEC Corp.]    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   As we enter the age of 0.25 m or below, more accurate  etching technology is required. However, this technology is  still in large part dependent on empirical factors, hence a  scientific approach is difficult. This is because the plasma  states and surface reactions are extremely complicated and there  are not many means to analyze them. Even though our  understanding is insufficient, plasma can be generated  relatively easily and a very active state can be produced.  However, various equipment using different methods has been  introduced, adding to the confusion. Nevertheless, it seems the  appropriate time to start discussions and studies for the  ultrafine fabrication of 0.25 m and below.    This report reviews the items required for etching equipment  for 256M DRAMs and beyond.  <H5>  High-Density Plasma Source </H5>   Most active discussions about etching equipment are related  to the plasma source. Previously, a low-pressure, high-density  plasma source always referred to ECR plasma. Now, a variety of  plasma sources, including helicon-wave and inductive-discharge  (Figures 1 and 2) have been developed and introduced in the  market. Helicon-wave plasma and inductive-discharge plasma use  the RF frequency band at around 10 MHz and do not require a  ferromagnetic field, so they can be implemented with compact  size and simplified design. On the other hand, they have  problems controlling the discharge state due to insufficient  understanding of the mechanism of plasma generation. It has also  been pointed out that their large-surface electric fields and  plasma potentials sputter or etch the walls, influencing the  etching characteristic of substrates. On the other hand, with  ECR plasma, progress has been made in the analysis of the plasma  state and elucidation of the discharge mechanism, and  optimization of the plasma state is very advanced. However, the  use of microwave and ferromagnetic fields makes the equipment  large and complicated. Another problem is the production of  abnormal etched shapes on the gate electrodes, as shown in  Figure 3, which occurs when electric charge is accumulated on  the wafer because the capture rates of electrons and ions with  respect to the field are different, such as in the case of the  presence of a ferromagnetic field on the wafer.[.sup]1[/]  Therefore, with ECR plasma, reduction of the magnetic field on  the wafer electrode and size reduction are important topics to  be considered.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-04A>           Figure 1. Helicon-Wave Plasma Source (mfd. Plasma </FIG>      <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-04B>            Figure 2. Inductive Discharge Plasma Source (mfd. by </FIG>      <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-04C>           Figure 3. Abnormally Etched Shapes in Poly-Si </FIG>       As seen above, each plasma source has its merits and  demerits. Nevertheless, when the equipment for manufacturing  256M and later DRAMs is considered, the trends of increasing the  number of chambers and clustering are necessary, together with  increasing wafer size. Further, a compact, simplified plasma  source is necessary on actual mass-production lines. This means  that size reduction is a necessary condition for ECR plasma  sources to survive. This topic should be studied along with the  decrease of applied frequency.[.sup]2[/] On the other hand,  with helicon-wave plasmas and inductive-discharge plasmas, the  optimization of plasma and optimization of hardware would be  important issues in the future.    As described above, a variety of plasma sources have been  developed and currently low-pressure, high-density plasmas have  become the leaders in the etching process. However, it is  becoming clear that high-density plasma is not always  beneficial, as some problems have emerged due to the high  density. Not all the active species in plasma contribute to the  etching reaction; some of them produce the main reaction and  others inhibit it. For example, polymerization in the etching of  oxide film is determined by the ratio between the  CF[.sup]2[/] radicals and F atoms in fluorocarbon plasma. The  CF[.sup]2[/] radicals are the precursor of polymerization and  F atoms function to inhibit polymerization. Therefore, to  achieve highly selective oxide-film etching, the  F/CF[.sup]2[/] radical-density ratio in the plasma should be  low. However, in low-pressure, high-density plasmas, such as ECR  plasma, helicon-wave plasma and inductive-discharge plasma, high  electron temperatures and the occurrence of highly dissociative  reactions tend to make polymerization inadequate due to a low  CF[.sup]2[/] radical density. This poses problems such as a  low etching selectivity with respect to silicon  wafers.[.sup]3[/] To solve these problems while maintaining  the benefits of low-pressure, high-density plasma, it is  important to control the electron temperature and dissociative  reaction in plasma. Controlling the generation of active species  by pulse-modulated plasma was recently proposed as a method to  solve these problems.[.sup]4[/]    In manufacturing 256M and later DRAMs, it is desirable that  these problems be solved at the plasma source. Regardless, the  mixed presence of a variety of plasma sources is not favorable  for users, because this situation will require much effort in  equipment selection and process development. A valuable future  topic would be to identify the optimum plasma state for each  type of material and develop a standardized plasma source that  can achieve that state.  <H5>  Role of the Chamber Wall </H5>   Although chamber wall material and chamber size are very  important factors relating to plasma, they have not been studied  sufficiently. Wall material and wall potential states  (grounding, floating) have a great effect on the plasma's  potential distribution and charged particle decay times. As they  vary, the electron loss probability on the wall surface, the  electron temperature in plasma, plasma potential, and floating  potential are also varied so the ion impact state onto the wall  is also varied. In addition, as the reactivities of active  species (radicals, ions) are variable depending on the wall  materials, as shown in Figure 4, their loss and adsorption  probabilities are also varied which varies the percentage of  active species existing in the plasma.[.sup]5[/] This is why  it is said that the reproducibility of plasma processes is  largely affected by the wall. Therefore, the selection of wall  material and its electric state are also important themes for  equipment implementation.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-05A>           Figure 4. Variation of Radical Density Depending on Wall </FIG>       Chamber size is also important. Chamber size increases when  the size of the wafer is increased, and the increase in chamber  size means a relative increase in the volume of plasma with  respect to the wall, providing the benefits of reduced electron  loss and lower plasma potential and electron temperature.  Therefore, the optimization of chamber size is also an important  topic to be considered.  <H5>  Exhaust System </H5>   The exhaust system is noteworthy from the viewpoint of  controlling the residence time of reaction products as well as  controlling the degree of etching vacuum. Since the gas flow  varies the residence time of reaction products and thereby the  etching characteristic as shown in Figure 5.[.sup]6[/]  Exhaust system design is an important element in the design of  etching equipment. Equipment design must take conductance into  full consideration, as well as the exhaust rate of the  turbo-molecular pump.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-05B>           Figure 5. Variation of Etching Characteristic Depending on </FIG>     <H5>  Multi-Chamber Equipment </H5>   Microfabrication and the multi-layer structure of devices  are  making the etching process increasingly complicated. As a  result, it has sometimes become necessary to apply pre- and  post-processing to etching, use processes for etching layered  film with several gas systems, or process several large-size  wafers simultaneously. An increase in the number of chambers is  indispensable to achieve these. In addition, as continuous  processing in vacuum is essential to process reproducibility,  the implementation of equipment as standardized cluster tools is  also necessary. This is an important subject which could lead to  the standardization of etching equipment.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   In the above I reviewed the points concerning etching  equipment expected for use for 256M DRAMs and later. The  extremely stringent accuracy requirements for etching have made  it necessary to conduct an advanced study of the equipment. This  requires an approach to the plasma process aimed at achieving  optimum cost efficiency and expected characteristics. Equipment  standardization has also become an important topic. These  requirements are extremely severe for equipment manufacturers,  and I hope our research will contribute to their efforts.  References    1.

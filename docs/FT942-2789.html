			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hardy to cut back North Sea drilling programme Hardy Oil &amp; Gas, the independent explorer, yesterday said it was cutting back its North Sea drilling programme as it announced an 18 per cent drop in net profits to Pounds 8.3m following UK tax changes. Mr Douglas Baker, chairman, said priority would be given to the appraisal of finds awaiting development. The decision was taken following the government's decision to eliminate tax shelters for drilling activity at the end of this year. Mr Baker said Hardy had returned a creditable performance, in spite of weak oil prices. Pre-tax profits had jumped by 56 per cent to Pounds 5.2m. North American gas prices had remained strong. About 67 per cent of Hardy's production is comprised of gas. Mr Baker said the current year would be difficult for the whole industry. He was confident, however, that Hardy would be able to weather the problems associated with weak oil prices. 'The group has major developments in hand or in prospect, spread across a number of countries,' he said. North America, in particular, would show a steady increase in production. Hardy also enjoyed a strong financial position after last year's Pounds 29m rights issue and its policy of non-recourse funding for new developments. Turnover for the year to March 31 rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 60.6m. Operating profits were 29 per cent higher at Pounds 12.9m. Earnings per share fell by 28 per cent to 7.8p (10.9p) and the dividend is maintained at 1p.</p>

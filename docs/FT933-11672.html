			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Linx Printing disappoints with 13% fall to Pounds 1.43m LINX PRINTING Technologies, the manufacturer of continuous ink jet printers used primarily to identify and code products, disappointed with its first full year results since last October's flotation. Profits before tax for the 12 months to June 30 fell by 13 per cent to Pounds 1.43m (Pounds 1.64m) on sales of Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 10.5m). Earnings per share were 7.1p (8.4p). Worsening market conditions in the UK and continental Europe led to the earlier-than-expected release of the results, which followed a profits warning and the resignation of the sales and marketing director in May. Attributing the decline to 'pressure on margins, together with continuing investment in sales and marketing and research and development,' Mr Derek Harris, chairman, also emphasised that the company's strategy was to reduce dependence on UK and European markets by expanding sales in the rest of the world. Sales revenues, particularly from the Pacific Rim, have increased rapidly and now represented 25 per cent of the total, he said. However, North American markets were starting to deteriorate. Investment in research and development increased to 8.9 per cent (7.9 per cent) of sales when the new 6000R printer and a new range of inks, including environment-friendly inks, were developed and launched. Mr Harris vowed to implement remedial actions in Europe after a marketing strategy review is completed, but warned the benefits of changes were unlikely to be evident until later in the group's financial year. The shares dipped 3p to 89p.</p>

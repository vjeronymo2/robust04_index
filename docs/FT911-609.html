			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Soviet minister issues strong criticism of Jewish settlements STRONG criticism of Jewish settlement in the occupied Arab territories came yesterday from Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, the Soviet foreign minister. He said a US-Soviet sponsored Middle East peace conference could not go ahead before the issue was confronted. His comments came on the day Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, said the Soviet Union had to renew full diplomatic relations with Israel before assuming a role in Middle East peace talks. He said renewed diplomatic relations were 'a prior condition for the Soviet Union's participation in the peace process, and we will welcome it'. Mr Bessmertnykh, speaking in Jordan in advance of a ground-breaking visit to Israel today, said Moscow did not accept any pre-conditions for its participation in the process. He also linked the settlements issue to Soviet Jewish emigration to Israel. Asked whether Moscow planned to restrict the outflow, he said: 'I do not exclude anything when we talk about the necessity to stop the construction of these settlements.' Mr Bessmertnykh damped hopes that his Jerusalem visit, the first by a Soviet foreign minister, would bring an announcement of the re-establishment of full diplomatic relations between the two countries after a 24-year rift. 'We do not accept any conditions for our own participation in the peace process in the Middle East because our role in that process is natural.' Speaking after talks with Jordan's King Hussein, the foreign minister said he could not 'foresee, conceive or accept' holding a peace conference while settlement building continued in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 'The Soviet Union and other countries who are interested in arranging such a conference are going to deal with that problem straightforwardly and directly as one of the things to be solved before the conference starts.' Mr Bessmertnykh's six-hour visit to Israel is part of a Middle East shuttle that will complement the fourth tour through the region by Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, since the end of the Gulf war. Mr Baker is trying to bring about a regional conference that would open the way to bilateral Arab-Israeli peace talks. The two men are scheduled to meet in Cairo at the weekend. During his first two stops in Jordan and Syria - Moscow's long-standing ally in the Middle East - Mr Bessmertnykh reiterated continued Soviet support for the Arab stance and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. In spite of his criticism of Israel he was careful to stress Moscow backed Washington's efforts. Perhaps significantly, an expected meeting in Amman with Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader - who Washington and Israel want excluded from the process - did not take place. Apart from the issue of settlements, which the Israeli government has flatly refused to halt, Mr Bessmertnykh's talks with Mr Shamir will focus on the Moscow-backed Arab demand that the proposed conference should include the UN and be more than a one-time formal opening to a series of bilateral negotiations. Israel wants to exclude the UN, which it regards as biased, and rejects any executive role for the full conference largely for the same reason. Mr Shamir, who believes Moscow has decided in principle to restore full relations regardless of hesitation over timing, will urge Mr Bessmertnykh to distance Moscow from the PLO and persuade Syria in particular to soften its conditions for talks.

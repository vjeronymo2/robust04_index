			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dick Ljungberg: "Debt Will Soon Total 2 Trillion </F> Kronor"]    [Text] A galloping national debt and permanently high  unemployment are the two big threats to Anne Wibble's budget. If  state finances are not in order, there will be no halving of  unemployment or stability in the social security system, the  government's two primary goals.    It is true that the minister of finance is making quite a  fuss over the fact that the budget deficit and the state's total  borrowing requirement will decline in 1994-95 compared to the  current fiscal year (see the table), but not until around the  end of the century will it be possible to have the state's  finances in reasonably good order.    In the meantime, the national debt is going to rise at an  alarming rate. Last year our public debt passed the  inconceivable figure of 1 trillion kronor. By the end of this  fiscal year -- that is, in June of this year -- the debt is  expected to total just over 1.2 trillion kronor, and in June  1995 it will be up to 1.435 trillion kronor. That is 94.5  percent of the gross national product (GNP), meaning all the  goods and services we produce in Sweden in one year!  <H5>  Prodigious Amount </H5>   Calculations show that the national debt may reach 2  trillion  kronor by the end of the 1997-98 fiscal year, that being the  final year of the government's five-year reorganization plan for  state finances.    The debt would then total 109 percent of GNP, a level  achieved in the Western World only by Belgium, Greece, and Italy.    With a debt and interest burden that high, a country can  scarcely afford to pursue a stabilization policy, and Sweden  might wind up in that situation in a future recession if the  national debt is not stabilized -- in other words, unless the  debt ceases to grow faster than GNP.    Debt service on the national debt is going to cost a full 85  billion kronor over the next fiscal year, and that is about as  much as the state pays out to the sick, the handicapped, and  pensioners.    Anne Wibble's five-year reorganization program strengthens  the budget by 81 billion kronor, and she claims that the goal  for the first year has been more than achieved. But the improved  budget figures are due mainly to the beginnings of an economic  upswing, one effect of which is an increase in tax revenues for  the state and a gradual decline in the cost of unemployment as  well.  <H5>  Not Content </H5>   The minister of finance expects to stay within the projected  81 billion kronor in budget improvements until 1997-98,  something that the Riksdag has already approved. But the  measures involved may be adopted earlier.    On that subject, Wibble sets forth a line of reasoning in  the  budget statement.    If things go so well that economic conditions and public  savings improve faster than expected, we should be not be  content with that, she warns.    If anything, such a development would be an argument in  favor  of speeding up the reorganization of state finances, because  then we would have a chance of lengthening the period of good  growth and reducing the risk of overheating and bottlenecks in  the future.    If, on the other hand, the economic recovery turns out to be  weaker and shorter than predicted when the reorganization  program was launched in 1993, the program must still be carried  out, Wibble emphasizes.    Otherwise, the public deficit might go down more slowly or,  in the worst of cases, continue to rise -- because of high  interest rates, for example.    Even under those circumstances, considering the large  deficit  we began with, the 81 billion kronor called for in the  reorganization program should be regarded as a minimum program,  the minister of finance says.    In the spirit of the Lindbeck Commission, she also  emphasizes  the importance of the institutions in this connection. A longer  term of office beginning with this fall's elections -- from  three to four years -- combined with new rules for the Riksdag's  budget process, can increase the credibility of long-term  measures.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Planned Deficit Reduction by 1998(in billions of kronor)                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Billions of kronor                    |Description                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |41                                    |Lower subsidies to households:        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                                      |1.

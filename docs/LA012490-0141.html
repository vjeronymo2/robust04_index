			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Donor organ flights -- Because of an editing error, a story in some editions  Saturday incorrectly identified Harbor-UCLA Medical Center as a hospital that  uses Van Nuys Airport for flights to retrieve donor organs for transplants.  </P> <P> The hospital is UCLA Medical Center. Also, a photo caption accompanying that  story misidentified a heart transplant coordinator with Loma Linda University  Medical Center. The coordinator, Kay Ogata, was correctly identified in the  story.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATEHOOD FOR WASHINGTON, D.C.  </P> <P> The Rev. Jesse Jackson's inflammatory demand for statehood for Washington,  D.C., is full of specious arguments ("Statehood for the District of Columbia  Would End Its Unfair Colonial Statue," Op-Ed Page, July 24). Instead of making  a reasoned appeal, Jackson brings in a collection of adjectives and nouns which  poison the debate, words such as scandal, stain, outrage, intolerable and such  exaggerated assertions that the city endures "congressional occupation" and  that a "shocking colonialism" is at work.  </P> <P> All of this is pure sophistry and nonsense. If Washington deserves statehood  because its population exceeds that of four of our states then what about New  York City, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco -- should they  demand statehood as well?  </P> <P> The District of Columbia was carved out of Virginia and Maryland but it should  not be too difficult a matter for the Congress to work out a system that would  permit the citizens of Washington to participate in national elections even  while the city remains a special enclave under the jurisdiction of the  Congress.  </P> <P> Virginia and Maryland might each gain a House seat, but there would then be no  need to give the residents the privilege denied all of the other cities of  America of having the right to elect United States senators representing only  one city.  </P> <P> I'm afraid, though, that working out the complexities of such an arrangement  would be of no interest to Jackson since his real intent is to provide himself  with a senatorial seat that would otherwise be unavailable to him.  </P> <P> DAVID LEVY  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

This was reported by Media Secretary Raul Burzaco at the end  of today's cabinet meeting in which the implementation of  educational and social plans throughout the country and their  projections were studied. [passage omitted]    Burzaco was charged with reporting the details of the first  cabinet meeting of 1994, which was "complementary" to the last  cabinet meeting of 1993. [passage omitted]    Burzaco reported that just after the end of the cabinet  meeting, Menem called Salinas de Gortari "to express my support  as a friend, as president, and in the name of the Argentine  people in view of the subversive situation that is being  experienced by your country."

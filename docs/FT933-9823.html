			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Timing of mail price rise attacked THE Post Office Users' National Council yesterday criticised the timing of proposals to raise the price of first and second class mail by 1p from November 1, Tim King writes. The users' watchdog is extending its normal three-week period for receiving representations to six weeks and has told the Post Office and the Department of Trade and Industry that its report will be delayed. It argued that it would be difficult to consult interested parties during the holiday period. Mr Jim Cousins, Labour Post Office spokesman, said the proposal to charge 25p for first-class letters and 19p for second class followed directly from the Treasury's demands for more cash from the Post Office. He said the government required the Post Office to contribute Pounds 181m for 1993-94, and Pounds 176m and Pounds 158m in the following two years. The DTI said it was appropriate to expect more revenue from a profit-making body at a time of strain on the exchequer.</p>

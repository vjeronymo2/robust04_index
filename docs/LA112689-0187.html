			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOVE A PARADE? L.A. HAS PLENTY TO OFFER TODAY  </P> <P> Santa's helpers will be parading him all over town today.  </P> <P> And he'll be watched by up to a million and a half people who will have their  choice of holiday parades in Hollywood, East Los Angeles and Pasadena to signal  the march into the Christmas season.  </P> <P> The Hollywood Christmas Parade is expected to draw up to 1 million spectators.  It will take place from 6-8 p.m. and include more than 100 celebrities, 20  floats, 15 bands, a dozen silver-saddled equestrian units and one Santa on a  40-foot sleigh float.  </P> <P> The East Los Angeles Christmas Parade is scheduled to take place from 1-3 p.m.  It is expected to attract a crowd of up to 250,000 with its 30 celebrities, 20  bands, 18 floats, two grand marshals and one Santa riding atop a supermarket  float.  </P> <P> The Doo Dah Parade, a spoof of the annual Rose Parade, will begin at noon. The  loosely organized event will include 1,500 marchers in such tongue-in-cheek  entries as briefcase -- and chain saw -- drill teams and an unknown number of  Santas who could show up on anything from bicycles to roller skates.  </P> <P> Authorities said parade-goers should plan on arriving early to find parking.  </P> <P> The 58th annual Hollywood parade will start on Sunset Boulevard at Van Ness  Avenue and travel west to Highland Avenue, where it will turn north. At  Hollywood Boulevard, it will travel east to about the Hollywood Freeway.  </P> <P> Its grand marshal will be Sammy Davis Jr., and participants will include pop  singer Tiffany, actor Sam Elliott and the Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles, said  Linda Sauers of the sponsoring Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.

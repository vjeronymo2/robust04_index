			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK blocks part-time work draft Mr Michael Portillo, Britain's employment secretary, yesterday vetoed a diluted European Union draft directive that would have provided protection for part-time workers. His decision, which was made at the EU's social affairs council, annoyed his ministerial colleagues from the other 11 EU member states who had believed that the UK had been willing to agree to a compromise settlement over the part-time workers' measure. The proposal will now be re-written by the Commission and it will be much tougher than the watered-down version rejected by Britain yesterday. The final directive will be presented in the early part of next year to European employers and trade union organisations to see whether they can reach a consensual agreement on its details. If this fails, then the EU governments - without the UK - are expected to agree on a directive on part-time workers which will then come into force. Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU's social affairs commissioner, said he was 'disappointed' at the British government's decision to block the part-time workers' directive. 'I thought what we were proposing was a bare bones minimum measure but even then the UK maintained a negative approach' he said. The social affairs council meeting was also unable to reach agreement on a draft directive covering posted workers. Britain was strongly opposed to the directive in principal, but there was also serious criticism from a number of other countries, nobably Portugal, Greece and Italy. The measure is designed to ensure companies carrying out contracts in member states other than their own have to pay their employees at the rates of the host country. Doubts were raised about the scope of the directive, what issues it should cover and whether it applied to workers employed for less than one week. Mr Flynn said that he hoped that there would be an agreement on a posted worker directive on December 21 when the ministers are due to meet again. 'I believe there is a willingness to compromise on all sides over this measure,' said Mr Flynn. 'It is about extending the free market in services and not part of any Social Chapter.' Mr Portillo was also alone to reject the German government's proposal to press for greater economic and social convergence through the creation of minimum labour standards.

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Tories join resignation chorus MR JOHN MAJOR last night faced mounting pressure for the resignation of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, including some from the Conservative back benches. As the chancellor called an emergency meeting of senior EC officials to discuss the turmoil, some of the wilder corridor gossip in the Palace of Westminster asked whether Mr Major might even face a challenge for the party leadership after next month's Conservative conference. A broad consensus of Tory MPs brushed aside all such talk as irresponsible or, at the very least, premature. But there was open discussion about how long Mr Lamont would hold his present post following the suspension of Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism. Mr John Carlisle, Conservative MP for Luton North and a persistent critic, said that if the chancellor had been finance director of 'UK plc' he would have been forced to resign. 'Possibly he should stay and see this one through, but after that he must seriously consider his position.' Mr Carlisle said there was 'no thought at all of any leadership challenge being mounted'. The party 'might demand Mr Lamont's head but not at this stage the prime minister's,' he added. Other prominent Euro-sceptics were more charitable to Mr Lamont and less so to Mr Major. Mr John Townend, chairman of the influential Tory backbench finance committee, said he was 'very opposed to sniping at the chancellor', who had inherited membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. 'I hope Norman Lamont is not going to be made to carry the can for it,' he said, adding that British ERM membership was 'the prime minister's policy.' He nonetheless voiced support for Mr Major, describing him as 'the best prime minister we have got'. Mr Nicholas Budgen, Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West, said Mr Major had made 'a fundamental mistake when he was a junior minister' by supporting Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, in the debate over ERM membership and not Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister. Lord Ridley, the former cabinet minister, said he had 'every sympathy' for Mr Lamont, who had 'done his level best'. The mistake was to have joined the ERM in the first place. 'It is a total chimera that there is a sort of El Dorado to be found down this road.' Euro-sceptics were of the view that even a 12 per cent base rate could prove disastrous for the depressed domestic economy if sustained for more than a few days. Mr Nicholas Winterton, MP for Macclesfield and former Tory chairman of the cross-party health select committee, said yesterday's events amounted to 'the disembowelling of what little life there is left in the British economy.' Speaking yesterday morning after a two percentage point increase in interest rates to 12 per cent had been announced - but before the suspension of Britain's ERM membership - Mr Townend said that a short 10-day period of higher rates would not cause 'any serious trouble'. But he added: 'If it goes on for several months it will be devastating for British industry.' He said he would ask the government to meet the high street banks to formulate a strategy for damage limitation. 'If interest rates are at this level when we get to party conference, they will be in for a rough time.'</p>

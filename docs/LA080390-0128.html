			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JURORS AWARD $2.5 MILLION TO VICTIM'S PARENTS  </P> <P> An Irvine couple won $2.5 million in damages Thursday against a man who hit and  killed their 20-year-old daughter in a traffic crash on Laguna Canyon Road five  years ago.  </P> <P> After a monthlong trial before Superior Court Judge David G. Sills, jurors  awarded that amount to Bob and Sheri Hill, according to their attorney, Wylie  Aitken.  </P> <P> Their daughter, Lorraine Hill, was killed instantly on April 27, 1985, when a  pickup truck sideswiped her car about 3:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Jurors found that the truck's driver, Glenn Barnhill, 29, of Florida, was  guilty of gross negligence. Barnhill, formerly of Laguna Beach, had been  drinking at a party and was on his way home when he wandered out of his lane  and struck Hill, who was headed home from her job as a waitress in Corona del  Mar, Aitken said. Barnhill suffered bruises in the crash.  </P> <P> Barnhill was acquitted of drunk-driving charges, Aitken said. In the civil  case, Barnhill's attorney argued that the crash was Hill's fault because she  had swerved out of her lane and struck Barnhill, Aitken said.  </P> <P> Barnhill's lawyer could not be reached for comment after the verdict was  announced. The damages were assessed against Barnhill and Bear Automotive Inc.,  a company owned by his father, Aitken said. Barnhill was driving a company  truck when the accident happened.  </P> <P> Hill's parents also named the state of California as a defendant, because the  road had been narrowed and its median eliminated while state workers were  laying sewer pipe in the area, Aitken said. Jurors absolved the state of any  blame, Aitken said.  </P></p>

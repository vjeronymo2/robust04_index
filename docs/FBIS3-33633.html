			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Sever </F> Plotzker in Davos on 29 January]    [Text] [Plotzker] Minister Peres, what is your reaction  to 'Arafat's appeal to the United States to mediate between  Israel and the PLO?    [Peres] We will in no way agree to U.S. mediation. This  will freeze the entire process and bring us back to square one.    [Plotzker] Will we reject the mediation even if the price  would be the collapse of the talks?    [Peres] We will not agree even if the result is a breakdown  of the talks. Also, I believe that the Americans will not want  to mediate.    [Plotzker] Why do you think 'Arafat opted for this?    [Peres] 'Arafat has been speaking about U.S. mediation for  quite some time. The Palestinians fail to understand Israel's  security problem. They believe we are a superpower. Our  demands for adequate security arrangements on the bridges and  border crossings fall on deaf ears.    [Plotzker] Can the Israeli stands be more flexible?    [Peres] It is not a question of flexibility. We signed the  Oslo agreement; the Knesset approved it; the majority of the  people supports it. We must implement it to the letter. If we  agree to withdraw from the agreement, we would shatter the  credibility of the peace process. Naturally, this would also  contradict our real security needs, on which we insist.    [Plotzker] So, what it is going to be? Will the parties  forever dig in their heels?    [Peres] Let me tell you something. The people involved in  the Middle East peace process are no longer young; I speak of  Israel's prime minister, myself, Mr. 'Arafat, King Husayn, and  President al-Asad. It is very probable that the time has come  for us to take some unpopular steps and make hard decisions --  because of our age -- to prepare the grounds for the younger  generation. After all, in five to six years, the entire Middle  East leadership could be different; a new generation will take  the reins. The process is essential, and I am optimistic about  this new generation.    [A report by Sever Plotzker on pages 1 and 15 of the same  YEDI'OT AHARONOT edition adds that, arriving in Davos, Peres  said: "If 'Arafat wants to bring in the United States as a  mediator, he can forget about making progress in the peace  process. We have not signed the Oslo and the mutual recognition  agreements for this. Such an appeal places a giant obstacle on  the road to progress."]</p>

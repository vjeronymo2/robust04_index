			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Spitalfields building plan given start date The first stage of the planned redevelopment of the former Spitalfields fruit and vegetable market, to the east of the City of London, is set to start within a year. Spitalfields Holdings, which owns the 13-acre site, expects to agree a deal in the next six weeks with a developer to fund and build up to 160 homes on part of the site. Spitalfields Holdings is jointly owned by LET, the property developer, and Costain and Balfour Beatty, the construction companies. The long-awaited initial development is likely to comprise town houses and flats at the northern end of the site. The housing will be aimed at the upper end of the market, although much will depend on detailed planning consent. The decision to press ahead with the housing component of the scheme reflects the relatively strong state of the housing market in central London, compared with the office market. With the exception of a few schemes in the centre of the City, there is unlikely to be demand for large-scale development of new offices in the City for some years. Sales of new houses in Great Britain are estimated to have risen by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent last year, excluding one-off sales to housing associations, compared with a 5 per cent rise in sales of all types of homes. The outline planning consent consists of 900,000 sq ft of offices and 300,000 sq ft of residential and retail units. The total project is planned to be developed in phases as market conditions improve. In its latest report, Costain put the scheduled completion date for the project at 2001. A temporary market now occupies part of the site. The severe recession in the City office market in the early 1990s has cast doubt on the value of the scheme. Costain's 1992 accounts wrote down the cost of the interest capitalised on the scheme at Pounds 25.7m, putting its book value at Pounds 45m, with a further Pounds 18m premium to be paid to the Corporation of London over three years.</p>

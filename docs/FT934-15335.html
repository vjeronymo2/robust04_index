			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Ford Credit Europe plans Dollars 4bn funding FORD Credit Europe will launch several funding programmes in coming weeks to finance the growth of its various European units. The company plans to launch a US-commercial paper programme totalling Dollars 1.5bn and a Euro-CP programme worth Dollars 1bn, Ford said. In addition, a planned Euro medium-term-note (MTN) programme, scheduled for early November, will total up to Dollars 1.5bn, it said. Under this programme Ford will be targeting the shorter end of the maturity spectrum, with most issuance likely in the 10- to 15-year sector, Ford said. The CP-programmes are rated A-1 by Standard and Poor's and P-1 by Moody's Investors Service, while the MTN programme has been rated A by S&amp;P and A-2 by Moody's.</p>

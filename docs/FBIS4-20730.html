			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gai Bekhor: "And on Page 3, the Jewish Devil"; </F> first paragraph is HA'ARETZ introduction]    [Text] The Egyptian Government has apparently been allowing  the press to publish poisonous criticism of Israel, to provide a  way to vent the rage that has been mounting up in many circles  since the slaughter in Hebron.    Cartoons depicting the "Jewish Devil," with the slogan of  revenge, "Haibar, Haibar, Ya Yehudim, the army of Muhammad shall  return," have been back in the daily papers of Egypt for the  last few weeks, after being missing for a long time. "Thank God,  our list is still long," Yitzhak Rabin says proudly in one  Egyptian cartoon, holding up a list that says: "the Dir Yasin  massacre, the Sabra and Shatila massacre, the Cave of Makhpela  massacre." "I cannot get my hands clean, even though I washed  them both before the massacre and after it," Rabin complains in  another cartoon in the opposition weekly AL-WAFD, where the  picture shows his hands dripping with Palestinian blood. And in  another place, the leader of the Serbs, the murderers of the  Bosnian Muslims, asks a Jewish figure (according to the  anti-Semitic stereotype) to come and help him. "But if you do  come, do not blow up our bank or our stores," he warns, with  blood dripping from his hands and the hands of the character he  is talking to.    These dozens of cartoons are testimony to the fact that the  short spring in the attitude of the Egyptian press, especially  the establishment press, but also the opposition, toward  Israel--a spring that began with the achievement of the Oslo  agreement and reached its height with the signing of the Cairo  agreement a month ago--has come to an abrupt end. If for the six  months that have passed since the agreement was signed in  Washington, the cartoons in the Egyptian newspapers concentrated  on the slaughter of the Muslims in Bosnia and on the internal  terror in Egypt itself, now the papers are being flooded with  articles of incitement and protest against Israel, the same kind  that were published at the height of the intifadah and after the  war in Lebanon.    Some of the newspapers do distinguish between the settlers  and their politics and the Israeli Government and its indirect  responsibility for the slaughter in Hebron, but they are few and  far between. Most of the media blame Israel for the massacre,  and imply that the government is in partnership with the  settlers, and sympathizes with them. They make no distinction  between the murderer from Hebron and the settlers as a whole.  All the settlers are depicted as murderers of Arabs.    "The hands of Israel are filthy with blood, even if she does  try to deny her responsibility (for the slaughter)," wrote the  official paper AL-AKHBAR on 27 February. "The crime in Hebron  reveals clearly the racist tendencies and terrorist character of  the Jewish settlers, who believe that the blood of Muslims is  worth nothing. The Israeli army also did its own part to  maximize the number of deaths.    "The massacre is solely the responsibility of the Israeli  Government," concluded AL-AHRAM of the same day, "and this time  it is impossible to claim that a crazy man carried out the crime  on his own accord. There are precedents for this claim, the  burning of the Al Aksa mosque, and also the murder of the  Palestinian workers, where the Israeli authorities claimed that  the murderer was a crazed youth.    "The Israeli occupation forces poured oil on the flames the  day the massacre was carried out, by shelling another mosque in  occupied Jerusalem with TNT shells" destroying the mosque and a  building nearby, broadcast the government radio station Savat  al-Arab. It is true that in a phone call to Mubarak, Rabin  expressed his sorrow over the ugly incident and the Israeli  Government's and people's condemnation of the criminal act, but  expressing sorrow is not enough to bind the wounds to Arab  feelings."    From the way the Egyptian radio station expresses itself, it  is possible to draw conclusions about the purpose of the  restraint the Egyptian authorities have shown toward the  electronic media, and the restraint these media have shown in  this matter.    These anti-Israel expressions stand out all the more because  so many articles have been appearing since the agreement in  Washington, even in the leftist newspapers, calling for  normalization of relations with Israel. This seems to have been  part of a government-backed information campaign. Now it appears  that the Egyptian Government is knowingly allowing the wave of  criticism to sweep over the newspapers in order to give the  anger and pressure that have been building up since the massacre  in many circles a way to be vented. The Egyptian Government  knows that the only person who can turn the anti-Israeli trend  around is Yasir 'Araf'at, who by renewing negotiations with  Israel can calm the winds and give renewed legitimacy to  relations with her. Because of this, he is the most courted man  in Cairo these days. Last week he met, under government  auspices, with top people in the regime, the press, and the  Egyptian intelligencia--those same journalists and intellectuals  who had attacked him for his support of Saddam Husayn--and  explained how important the peace negotiations with Israel were,  in spite of or perhaps because of the massacre in Hebron, and  his words were headlined in the newspapers of Egypt.</p>

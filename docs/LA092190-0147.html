			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> ROBINSON UNSURE ABOUT TAILBACK  </P> <P> Sticking to his stance that all three tailbacks will be treated equally for  now, Ram Coach John Robinson said he has not made a decision yet about his  starter at that position.  </P> <P> "Well, we usually flip a coin on Saturday nights, usually wait till then,"  Robinson said Thursday.  </P> <P> "We're going to try to play them all the same.  </P> <P> "I really haven't thought much about them. I'm serious about all of them  playing -- Cleveland Gary has played less because he's played hurt."  </P> <P> Curt Warner has run the most from tailback but Gary, coming off a back injury,  seems to be ready to take more of the load. Gaston Green is the other man in  the mix.  </P> <P> Robinson said there will be a decision made today about whether to sign an  extra kicker because of Mike Lansford's sore lower leg.  </P> <P> Robinson is leaning that way and the second kicker may well be John Carney, who  has survived two days of workouts with several other kickers.  </P> <P> Carney edged out Teddy Garcia in a field-goal workout Wednesday, although  Garcia was better on kickoffs.  </P> <P> Although Lansford figures to kick Sunday, Robinson is concerned that Lansford  will reinjure the leg during the game.  </P> <P> If the Rams do sign Carney, or anyone else, they would have to cut a player or  put someone on the injured-reserve list.

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Burning midnight oil in case against auditors: The latest leg of the battle to recover money for creditors THE LIGHTS are burning late into the night in City offices this week as the liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International prepare the latest salvo in their attempt to recover money for creditors. Lawyers and accountants have been working long hours putting the final touches to a 'statement of claim' detailing charges likely to top Dollars 8bn (Pounds 4.6bn) against the two accountancy firms that were auditors to BCCI in 1986. Ernst &amp; Whinney - now part of Ernst &amp; Young - and Price Waterhouse were both served with brief writs expressed in general terms last March. The statements of claim shortly to arrive will go into far more detail. Neither firm had received copies late yesterday, but under the court-agreed timetable the statements were required to be lodged by the end of today. They represent the next stage in a battle that will probably take at least five years to reach the courts - if it makes it that far. 'These are vexatious actions with Mickey Mouse numbers on them,' said one partner. Publicly, Ernst &amp; Young and Price Waterhouse were yesterday putting a brave face on the allegations. PW said: 'We are confident that the work of all of the PW people involved in the BCCI audit was carried out to the highest professional standards.' Both firms have said they intend to contest the legal action. Ernst &amp; Young is also likely to argue that it was auditor to parts of BCCI that were not the source of the fraud, and that it relied on the work of PW as auditor to those which were. PW has already spent more than Dollars 10m in legal fees to prepare a defence. Ernst &amp; Young has spent about Pounds 1m. Some partners are expressing private unease over the prospect of litigation that could make them personally bankrupt. The largest cases of claims for damages in which payments have been made public include Pounds 50m against Arthur Young - now part of Ernst &amp; Whinney  -in connection with Johnson Matthey Bankers in 1989, and Pounds 40m last year from KPMG Peat Marwick in respect of Ferranti's acquisition of ISC. When the big accountancy firms agree to a legal settlement, payment comes from a variety of sources. The first few million dollars is paid directly from the firm's own resources. Some may also be shared between international partnerships. External professional indemnity insurers will then provide cover for many tens of millions more, although growing claims and sharply rising premiums have made that cover increasingly difficult to obtain affordably in the last few years. In addition, the Big Six firms are all members of two secretive mutual insurance companies based in Bermuda. One is called Pail (Professional Assets Indemnity Ltd), and the other Padua (named after the Italian city for some time credited as the birthplace of double-entry bookkeeping). These two mutuals both plug certain 'gaps' in the cover offered by external insurers, and extend it beyond the levels to which they are willing to underwrite risk. That covers the firms up to about Dollars 110m. The firms typically also have their own individual 'captive' insurers, which might bring the total level of cover to about Dollars 150m. Beyond that, the partners themselves - as the owners of the firms - are individually liable up to the total value of their assets. The firms emphasise that the likelihood of a settlement that would bankrupt partners is infinitesimally small. They also hope that the government of Abu Dhabi, the BCCI majority shareholder, will not want to risk scrutiny of its role by bringing the matter to court. But one professional involved in the preparation of the statement of claim said: 'Brian Smouha would not bring a claim unless there were very serious grounds for action.'</p>

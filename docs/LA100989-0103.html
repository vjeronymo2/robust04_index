			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AIRPORT NEAR IRISH SHRINE TAKES OFF  </P> <P> A controversial Irish airport set up by an ambitious priest eager to attract  pilgrims to a local shrine has tripled its profits and looks set to double its  passenger numbers.  </P> <P> Critics labeled Knock Airport a white elephant and government backing was  withdrawn before the site was completed four years ago in a remote corner of  County Mayo, western Ireland. Undeterred, Msgr. James Horan raised the rest of  the money privately.  </P> <P> Knock Airport announced profits today of $210,000 for the year ending in June,  triple the previous annual profit figure. Knock expects to attract 180,000  passengers in 1989, 46% up from last year.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The method of deriving poultry products by the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from the meat and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses results in a product whose physical form and texture differ materially from those of other boneless poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques. Mechanically separated poultry is derived using a machine that operates on the differing resistance of bone and tissue to passage through small openings, whether it employs sieves, screens, or other devices. Such machines mechanically separate and remove most of the bone from poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses resulting in a finely comminuted, paste-like product. The starting materials, which may have undergone an initial bone breaking process, are pushed under high pressure through equipment with apertures that allow a small amount of powdered bone to pass through with the soft tissue. This is different than boneless poultry derived by traditional means, i.e., hand-deboning, and such differences have potential consequences for consumer expectations. FSIS has statutory responsibilities under the PPIA and FMIA to assure that consumers receive poultry and meat food products that are not adulterated and that bear labeling that is not false or misleading. Despite this, the regulations do not distinguish between poultry products produced by mechanical separation and poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques, i.e., hand-deboning, in terms of product identity and composition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Mechanically separated poultry is produced by essentially the same technology and has characteristics (i.e., physical form and texture) similar to those of the livestock product, MS(S). Yet, the regulatory requirements for labeling these two products currently are inconsistent with one another.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Department is proposing to amend the poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR Part 381) to revise and supplement the requirements for the manufacture, characteristics, and labeling of poultry products produced by mechanical separation and the labeling of products in which they are used as ingredients. Under this proposal, mechanically separated product derived from chicken or turkey would be labeled as ``mechanically separated chicken'' or ``mechanically separated turkey,'' as the case may be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Poultry products produced by mechanical separation, also referred to as mechanical deboning, are characteristically finely comminuted (i.e., finely ground) in form and result from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and other tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses. The products are prepared from various materials, including necks, backs, and whole carcasses. These starting materials may be raw or cooked, may contain varying amounts of muscle and/or skin, and may contain kidneys, except when product is made from mature chickens or mature turkeys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kidneys of mature chickens or turkeys may not be used as human food (9 CFR 381.65(d)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technology to mechanically separate and remove most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and other tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses began in the late 1950's or early 1960's. The Agency's initial reaction was to consider the resulting product adulterated because of the amount of bone present and the physical size of the bone particles. By the mid-1960's, the industry had modified and improved the equipment used to produce poultry product by mechanical separation such that the product contained 1 percent or less bone solids with an extremely small bone particle size. This prompted the Agency to reevaluate its position. Widespread commercial production of products containing mechanically separated poultry began in the early 1970's. By 1975, poultry product produced by mechanical separation was being used as an ingredient in poultry and meat food products such as franks, bologna, salami, and rolls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today, poultry products made with poultry produced by mechanical separation include cooked poultry sausages (such as chicken frankfurters, turkey salami, and turkey bologna), poultry patties and nuggets (such as chicken patties and nuggets), and poultry baby foods. The level at which it is used has depended in part on technological capabilities and has reached 100 percent of the poultry product portion of a number of cooked poultry sausage products. Poultry product produced by mechanical means is also used at up to 49 percent of the formulations of certain meat food products, e.g., beef and turkey chili, provided that it is identified in the product name as ``turkey'' or ``chicken,'' and used in meat food products including cooked sausages, such as frankfurters and bologna, at a level of up to 15 percent of the total ingredients, excluding water (9 CFR 319.180) without being identified in the product name.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

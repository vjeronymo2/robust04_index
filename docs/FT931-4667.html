			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: Casting doubt on green investment The cost of going green is still a worry for many businesses, and environmental costs are expected to rise sharply, according to a new report* by consultants P-E International. The companies' comments come as evidence emerges from the oil industry that the annual costs of pollution control will have risen by 50 per cent in less than a decade and the costs may be handicapping the companies' ability to invest. After years of regarding environmental measures as a cost, ministers and environmental consultants are now fond of proclaiming, almost as an axiom, that greener means richer. However, these figures on the real impact on businesses' costs suggest many companies are right to question whether environmental investment really represents an opportunity. The report says 'over two thirds of companies expect operating costs to increase as a result of addressing environmental issues'. More than three quarters attribute the need for changes to EC directives, compared with 47 per cent citing UK legislation as a source of pressure. The survey, which analyses 250 companies about their 'logistics' - every part of the supply chain from buying raw materials to distribution and packaging - was conducted together with David Bellamy Associates, a subsidiary of P-E run partly by David Bellamy, the environmentalist. It adds: 'There is considerable uncertainty about the commercial benefits of responding to many environmental concerns. A large proportion of companies, therefore, intend to wait until they are forced into action by legislation'. Like many consultancy reports, the survey argues: 'The ability to be pro-active . . . will determine which companies will prosper'. But the evidence for this conclusion is not fully supported by the report. Although P-E found that where the companies had taken environmental steps such as reducing packaging there was 'a very significant cost reduction element', this does not demonstrate that environmental measures can be in a company's financial interest so much as raise questions about why the management had neglected to take the steps earlier. Jan Szymankiewicz, managing director of P-E's logistics consulting arm, argues that companies which anticipate environmental legislation have the chance to adapt more gradually and cheaply than those that leave it to the last minute. While this is plausible, plenty of exceptions can be envisaged, particularly where the relevant environmental technology is changing fast to the benefit of those companies which wait. Szymankiewicz agrees, too, that environmental investment could lead to a competitive disadvantage for companies exporting to regions with different environmental rules: 'It is probably true that they will have higher costs (because of compliance with the green rules).' Evidence to support that concern is emerging from the oil industry. The Petroleum Industry Association, in an informal poll of its members, has found that their total investment will rise from an average of around Pounds 170m a year in the last three years to Pounds 270m a year over the next five years. However, the association has also found that the companies' total investment spending has scarcely risen, suggesting environmental investment may be squeezing out other spending that could improve competitiveness. There are no clear-cut answers to whether environmental investment is a burden or an opportunity for businesses - they are buried in the companies' figures for operating costs, investment and market share. As the impact of compliance with recent legislation on companies becomes clear, some of the rhetoric about environmental investment may give way to a clearer picture of what companies can be expected to deliver. *Going Green - the Logistics Dilemma.

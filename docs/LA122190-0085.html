			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFUGEES POUR OUT HORROR TALES AS INS RECONSIDERS ASYLUM BIDS  </P> <P> When Humberto Ortega went to see federal immigration authorities in Los Angeles  several years ago to apply for political asylum, he decided not to show what he  considered irrefutable proof of his need to stay here -- a left arm mangled, he  said, by Guatemalan authorities.  </P> <P> Ortega is still so uncomfortable about his left arm -- crooked and jutting at  an awkward angle -- that he is hesitant about being photographed.  </P> <P> But he now admits he made a mistake in not emphasizing the maimed limb to  Immigration and Naturalization Service examiners before they summarily rejected  his asylum application after he arrived in Southern California in 1987.  </P> <P> The one-time university student's story, recited in Spanish, was one of many  that surfaced Thursday, the day after the U.S. government announced that the  INS would reconsider an estimated 150,000 requests for political asylum from  Guatemalans and Salvadorans whose cases had been turned down since 1980. The  agreement will also allow applications from Salvadorans and Guatemalans who are  in this country illegally but have never applied for political asylum.  </P> <P> Advocates of immigrants' rights, who hailed the agreement as an important  victory for refugees, said they expect a substantial portion of the 350,000 or  more Salvadorans and Guatemalans in the country illegally to sign up.  </P> <P> "The (Guatemalan) government did this to me," said Ortega, 29, motioning to his  damaged arm. "I felt like showing off my arm (to the INS). "But I couldn't. I  couldn't face up to showing my arm. So I just walked out."  </P> <P> Critics have charged that since 1980, INS authorities routinely rejected  political asylum petitions from thousands of refugees from Guatemala and El  Salvador because those governments were considered friendly to the United  States.  </P> <P> Ortega, who fled Guatemala and settled into a cramped apartment in East  Hollywood, agreed with the critics as he recounted the incident that drove him  from his country.  </P> <P> "I had just come home with my brother from a meeting where we were discussing  plans to protest a particular government decision," he recalled. "They barged  in, hit my brother and then tied my hands up with wire attached to a baseball  bat.  </P> <P> "They then twisted the bat tighter and tighter. They broke my arm and you see  how it is now."  </P> <P> Other refugees said that the threat of violence forced them to seek asylum in  the United States.  </P> <P> Alva Escobar, a 24-year-old activist refugee who appeared at a Los Angeles news  conference, said her days as a student in her native El Salvador were abruptly  cut short by the uncertainty that engulfed her war-torn country.  </P> <P> Escobar, a second-year literature student at the National University in San  Salvador, was active in her student union and spoke out against the government.  </P> <P> "I spoke my mind," she said. "But in my country that can be a crime."  </P> <P> One day when she returned home, two men were waiting for her. They threatened  her, telling her they knew who she was, what she was doing. They told her she  had better watch out.  </P> <P> For the next two months, she noticed men following her as she went to school  and traveled the city in a bus. She spotted them watching her house.  </P> <P> "I started having nightmares," she said. "I could not be calm."  </P> <P> Escobar left El Salvador in 1988, making her way to Mexico and then crossing  the U.S. border illegally. Eventually captured by the INS, she decided to seek  political asylum because she felt it would be dangerous to return to her  country. A hearing before an immigration judge came in October, 1988. The judge  rejected her petition.  </P> <P> "He said that everything I said was a lie . . . that I had created a brilliant  story, but that he did not believe it," she said.  </P> <P> Another refugee at the news conference, Marvin Pinto, 26, a native of  Guatemala, also said that U.S. authorities did not put much stock in his plea  for political asylum.  </P> <P> "The U.S. government thinks everyone from my country is here for economic  reasons," Pinto said, "but that's not true. All they have to do is go there and  see for themselves."  </P> <P> Humberto Ortega, who works at odd jobs in Los Angeles, hopes he will eventually  be able to make his case here in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I hope one day to have the strength to show what happened to me," he told a  visitor. "Then, maybe, you can take my picture."  </P></p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Observer: Under cover Meanwhile, is Moscow making a secret bid to be the capital of the world junk-mail industry? A colleague was surprised to get a press release from Moscow telling how Supertravel, a London ski tour operator, was training its chalet girls in the New Forest. It is hard to believe that it is cheaper to write a press release in London and air freight it to Moscow, so that it can then be put in an envelope and posted back to London. Supertravel's Susan Birkin admits that sending promotional bumf via Moscow doesn't save any money but she thinks it a 'super' marketing tool. A Moscow postmark might just prevent a punter binning an unopened promotional circular. 'It conjures up images of 'From Russia with love. . . ', and one client even thought that the KGB had supplied her name,' gushes Birkin.</p>

The WPK highly appreciated the CPC (M-L) that is maintaining  the revolutionary principle even under the ceaseless  maneouvrings of the imperialists and their stooges to undermine  the party and strengthening the party on a new basis, firmly  building up the basic party organizations among the masses.

The CPC (M-L) expressed deep concern over the adventure of  the U.S. authorities to put pressure on the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea while breaking the promise it has made at the  DPRK-U.S. talks and held that the United States should pull all  nuclear weapons out of South Korea and stop the projected  deployment of "Patriot" missiles and the nuclear war exercises  if it wants a fair solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    It also expressed firm solidarity with the Workers' Party  and  the people of Korea in their struggle to realize national  reunification in the form of confederacy based on one nation,  one state, two systems and two governments on the three  principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great  national unity.    Both sides expressed common will to unite, cooperate and  further strengthen solidarity with communist and workers'  parties and other progressive political parties of different  countries of the world on the principle of advancing the cause  of working class of the whole world to victory while bearing  responsibility for the revolution of their own country with  independence as an important idea of unity.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Extension sought to olive oil pact OLIVE OIL producers and consumers are meeting in Geneva this week to agree a five-year extension to the 1986 International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives. The existing United Nations accord, which is designed to foster development of the industry and has no price stabilisation provisions, expires at the end of this year. The draft protocol to extend the agreement was approved last November by the Madrid-based International Olive Oil Council, and is not controversial. The nine members of the accord - Algeria, Cyprus, the European Community, Egypt, Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey and the former Yugoslavia - account for more than 96 per cent of world exports of olive oil and 87 per cent of world exports of table olives. The EC is by far the biggest producer, consumer and exporter of olive oil, with Greece, Italy and Spain accounting for three-quarters of world output and half world exports. Since the early 1980s, Spain has displaced Italy as the biggest EC exporter, with a third of world exports, but outside the EC it is matched by Tunisia which also has a one-third export share. Spain is the biggest producer and exporter of table olives, with 45 per cent of world exports, followed by Morocco with 24 per cent. The EC also imports large quantities of olive oil and table olives, accounting for 30 per cent of world olive oil imports - but the US is close behind. Olive oil makes up 6 per cent by volume of all fluid edible vegetable oil traded but represents 23 per cent by value (including intra-EC trade). Olive oil prices rose sharply between 1985-86 and 1990-91, declining slightly in 1991-92.</p>

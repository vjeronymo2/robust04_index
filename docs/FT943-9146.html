			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saviours of Cornwall mine due to be named Mr David Williamson, whose consultancy organisation was instrumental in completing the funding to ensure the survival of the UK's last operating tin mine, was uncharacteristically reluctant to talk yesterday. He hopes, however, that the indentity of the large investor or investors who had enough faith in tin's future to come to the rescue of South Crofty mine, near Redruth in Cornwall, will be revealed today or on Monday. 'Until everything is absolutely in place, it is better I say nothing,' he said. South Crofty needed to raise at least Pounds 1m (Dollars 650,000) by August 4 under the terms of a package agreed with the UK government. The deadline was met and, once the legal formalities are completed, the government and the RTZ Corporation between them will waive loans totalled Pounds 31m. This will leave South Crofty free of debt and with enough development capital to sustain it for up to three years. In the latest International Mining Review from his David Williamson Associates, Mr Williamson, a Cornishman himself, gives an indication of the arguments he must have put forward to persuade the big investor/s to provide more than Pounds 500,000. He says the collapse of tin prices to historically low levels makes South Crofty marginally unprofitable. 'But should the tin price move up from current levels of around Dollars 2.50 a lb (Dollars 5,510 a tonne) to Dollars 3 (Dollars 6,612), the mine would become extremely profitable with a net present value of close to Pounds 10m at an 8 per cent discount rate.' He points out it would be too expensive to re-open South Crofty if it were closed. 'While a mine is running there is always hope,' he says.</p>

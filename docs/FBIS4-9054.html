			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 18 (ATA) -- On April 15, at about  20.30, a Serbian border patrol executed by a volley of shots  youths Skender Rasim Morina, age 25, and Lulzim Sadik Morina,  age 22, who were found 150 meters in the territory of former  Yugoslavia.    The two youths killed perfidiously were teachers in the  elementary school of their village, Pogaj of Has district, near  the Kosova border. A day before they had gone to meet their  relatives in the Prizren commune in Kosova, and on their way  back, they fell victim of the volley of shots by the Serbian  border forces.    On April 16, the local mix commission, as well as the group  of the Albanian and Serbian experts went on the spot. They  observed that the victims carried no weapon or any other  defensive means. The places of the wounds showed that the  Albanian citizens were first shot in the legs in order to halt  them. Later, the Serbian border guards approached them, and in  a very short time, although wounded in the leg, the victims were  shot in the head and chest.    The Ministry of Public Order, once again, calls on all the  Albanian citizens not to cross the border illegally for any  reason. They must be equipped with the necessary documentation  and move only through the border crossing points.</p>

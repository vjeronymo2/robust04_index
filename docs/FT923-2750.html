			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bowater agrees sale to avoid MMC referral Bowater has agreed with the Department of Trade and Industry to dispose of its Welton medical sterilisation bags and pouches subsidiary thereby forestalling a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, writes John Thornhill. The DTI asked Bowater to reduce its presence in the market following the acquisition of the DRG packaging group which gave the combined packaging group an unacceptably high market share. The addition of DRG's subsidiary - DRG Malago which has an annual turnover of Pounds 4m - bolstered Bowater's share to 51 per cent. However, Bowater has undertaken to sell its Welton business, which has a turnover of Pounds 2m, within 12 months.</p>

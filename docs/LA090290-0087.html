			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT CAUSES A YELLOW VIOLET  </P> <P> Rather than the usual blue-and pink-producing anthocyanins, which belong to a  large group of plant compounds collectively called flavonoids, Blansit's plants  contained a group of flavonoids, closely related to the anthocyanins, called  flavonols.  </P> <P> It is the flavanols that create the yellow colors in flowers, and Blansit's Big  Yellow was the first reported occurrence of flavonols in African violets.  </P> <P> According to Jeff Smith of Norman, Okla., who was one of the first scientists  to examine Blansit's plants, "Studies of the synthesis of flavonoids in plants  indicate that their production is a step-by-step process requiring many  different enzymes. The loss of an enzyme is typically a mutation inherited as a  recessive trait.  </P> <P> "Yellow African violets," Smith said, "are the result of the loss of the enzyme  needed to convert flavonols into anthocyanins. The flavonols accumulate in the  petals instead of anthocyanins and the resulting color is yellow.  </P> <P> "In many species of plants, the failure to complete the anthocyanin synthesis  would result in flavonols that are pale in color. Nature, however, has favored  Blansit's African violets with flavonols that contain methyl groups that  produce substances which are distinctly yellow.  </P> <P> "The yellow in Nolan's plants is very distinct, supporting the idea that the  conversion failure to anthocyanins is the source for the yellow pigment."

			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian 1609 GMT on 11 April carries a 10-minute "Details"  program, presented by Vera Kuznetsova, examining the chain of  events leading to the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb  military positions, featuring interviews with Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev and Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.  "Details" program regular announcer Sergey Dorenko is shown  among other journalists at a news conference given by Andrey  Kozyrev in Spain today following NATO's second air strike.    Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov points out  that  "according to the UN Security Council's resolution, the UN  secretary general should be making such a decision in  consultations with members of the Security Council. No such  consultations were held with Russia." Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev says: "Although it seems that all is correct from  the legal point of view -- there was a UN sanction, there were  UN consultations in accordance with the UN resolution --  everything is correct here. But from the moral, human point of  view we believe that there was no need for these strikes. There  are no peacekeeping forces there and no one to defend. There is  one Ukrainian company, 93-strong, deployed 12 kilometers away in  the southwest and only 12 UN representatives in Gorazde itself,  who are no danger there. Moreover -- knocking out two tanks --  frankly, we can say that this was just a demonstration of power."    Answering Kuznetsova's question on whether Russia is being  bypassed in the Yugoslav peace process, Lavrov says that this is  an exaggeration. "When the Russian president has said for the  first time that the Yugoslav problem cannot be solved without  Russia's participation, you may recall that it was followed by  Russia's success in easing the situation around Sarajevo. So,  at that time no loss of Russia's prestige was suffered -- rather  the opposite." He goes on to say: "When the Russian president  stated this today, for the second time, I think it was for the  same reason -- that our partners simply have not yet mastered  the kind of partnership which we are trying to negotiate with  them."    Pavel Grachev, in an "exclusive interview" to "Details" says  that in his opinion the air strikes were not necessary from the  political or from the military point of view. "U.S. Defense  Secretary Perry has asked me to consult with him in the future  for the sake of the Partnership for Peace program."    Dorenko then presents a fragment of Kozyrev's news  conference  in Madrid where he is shown among other journalists standing  next to Kozyrev. Kozyrev says: "I had a conversation with U.S.  Secretary General Christopher right here about one or two hours  ago in which I expressed concern about the world being dragged  into an extremely dangerous chain of exchanges of blows, and I  asked the secretary of state to show maximum restraint. We  believe that all sides should now immediately stop all military  actions. This also means the Muslim side which, regrettably, is  provoking the Serb side in a number of locations. Of course, we  consider air strikes against the cities as being unacceptable,  just as we do any threats against the UN forces. At the same  time, it is most likely that the air strikes will bring results  quite different from those that are probably expected from them.  The responsibility for the possible grave consequences of these  strikes -- which, most regrettably, we are still awaiting --  lies with those who made this decision."</p>

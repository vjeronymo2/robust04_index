			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / People: New player sought for finance at Boosey &amp; Hawkes Boosey &amp; Hawkes, the musical instrument maker and music publisher, is looking for a new finance director to replace Paul Hazel, 42, who has resigned after five years in the job. The company, which is majority owned by Carl Fischer, a private US music publisher, gave no explanation for Hazel's departure. Hazel joined the company in June 1989 from Brent Chemicals International, filling a vacancy caused by Richard Holland's promotion to chief executive. Boosey &amp; Hawkes's fortunes have recovered strongly since 1986, when it was the subject of an unwelcome Pounds 9.8m takeover bid. It has returned to profit and its market capitalisation has grown more than six fold to Pounds 66m. It reports its interim results in October.</p>

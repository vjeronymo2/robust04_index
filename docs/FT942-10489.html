			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil slips 6% after new currency is announced Brazil Equities fell 5.8 per cent as investors focused on the presidential race more than on President Itamar Franco's announcement that Brazil's new currency - the real - would be introduced from July 1. The Bovespa index finished 885 points lower at 14,218. Volume totalled Cr236.8bn (Dollars 165m). Analysts remained confident that the introduction of the real would bring Brazil's 45 per cent inflation down. But the strength of leftist presidential candidate Luiz Inacio 'Lula' da Silva in recent opinion polls continued to weigh on share prices. Several details about the changeover - future policy on the real's exchange rate with the US dollar, for example - will not be announced until next month. Mr Rubens Ricupero, the finance minister, said final decisions on monetary and exchange rate policy were being finalised. It is expected that the real will be backed initially by Brazil's foreign exchange reserves. The market has been depressed in recent weeks awaiting details of the government's anti-inflation policy. Equities have fallen by some 10 per cent in dollar terms so far this year. Mexico The bolsa ended a lacklustre session lower as it tracked the drop in the US markets and investors held back awaiting Mexico's first presidential debate in modern history later this week. The IPC index retreated 29.12 points, or 1.3 per cent, to 2,147.58 in very light volume of 25.3m shares. Heavily weighted Telefonos de Mexico 'A' and 'L' shares dropped 1.96 and 1.09 per cent respectively, while its ADRs lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: US health groups sign supply deal BAXTER International, the US heathcare group, and American Healthcare Systems have signed a five-year agreement expected to be worth more than Dollars 4bn in Baxter supplies and services for American Healthcare member hospitals, AP-DJ reports. The agreement renews a five-and-a-half-year agreement signed in August 1988 and represents an increase of about 60 per cent over the Dollars 2.5bn purchases of Baxter products made by American Health Systems hospitals during the previous five years. American Healthcare, based in San Diego, California, represents more than 1,000 healthcare facilities in 47 states. The new deal covers a wide range of products, including Baxter's entire range of medical and surgical supplies, cardiovascular devices, and diagnostic instruments and reagents. Baxter provides intravenous fluids and related products under a separate five-year agreement signed in 1991. That is expected to result in purchases of up to Dollars 500m in Baxter intravenous products over the course of the contract.</p>

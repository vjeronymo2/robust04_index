			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): Yes, the market is quite sane - Keynote / Whereas 1993 was a year for speculators, 1994 will turn out to be a year for investors, though they may not yet realise how fortunate they are Are the markets crazy? It is a time of the economic cycle when it sometimes seems that way. Just as the economy is recovering nicely, and the eternally tantalising blend of steady economic growth and low inflation appears to be attainable, the securities markets start to throw a wobbly. Last month the chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, accused the City of being schizophrenic in refusing to invest in accordance with its own benign economic forecasts (let alone the rosy view of the Treasury). Private investors, meanwhile, have been left to wonder why, by mid-year, UK share prices had fallen by close to a fifth from their highs. Healthy profit gains and decently firm dividend declarations have not been enough to offset a strong but in some respects puzzling underlying downtrend. The London stock market has been falling since the beginning of February, and the second quarter of the year saw several important further lurches downwards. The All-Share Index was down 6 per cent during the April-June period, and the fall was pretty consistent across the market, with no extra resistance by the tiddlers represented in the SmallCap Index. Of course, politicians don't complain when the markets rise in the middle of recessions, in apparent anticipation of recoveries that are still around the corner. Nor should they grumble (though they would not be human if they didn't) when securities prices sink back in conditions of decent economic growth. The rate of return on capital is low when few want to use capital except governments. So it is fundamentally good news that a strongly-recovering demand for financial resources is pushing up the returns that investors receive. Private-sector borrowers now want to put capital to productive use. For the benefits, look for example at the recent sharp recovery in annuity rates, which is excellent news for people retiring this summer (though galling for pensioners who were forced to purchase annuities at last winter's trough for rates). However, as the current return on securities rises, so their prices drop, as a matter of simple arithmetic. Dividends on shares have not been able to rise fast enough this year to offset the increase in the yield basis. The shift has been seen most clearly in the government bond market. During the second quarter the yield on long-dated fixed-interest gilts jumped from 7.7 to 8.7 per cent. Crucially for equities, there was a jump - though only of about half that size - in the yield on index-linked gilts, which ended the April-June quarter returning almost 4 per cent. These rises in bond yields have put intolerable pressure on the equity market, which started the quarter with a dividend yield of just 3.7 per cent (the average paid by the 860-odd constituents of the All-Share Index). Historically, the All-Share has almost always yielded more than index-linked gilts. The last time the yield premium disappeared was just before the 1987 stock market crash. This time the reaction has been nowhere near so violent, but down share prices have had to go. Incidentally, the same influences of rising interest rates have affected the residential property market. A surge of activity generated last winter by the availability of cheap fixed-rate mortgage finance appeared to have petered out by May as the cost of this money jumped. Short-term interest rates, it is true, remained unchanged during April-June, with bank base rates staying at 5 1/4 per cent. But the sharp jump in longer-term rates means that monetary conditions have in effect become tighter, whatever Kenneth Clarke and his sparring partner Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, may have desired. And the consensus is that base rates have now hit bottom. The next move will be upwards, maybe later this year, maybe early in 1995. Is this unintended tightening all Kenneth Clarke's fault? The British government is certainly a big borrower, but of course this is far from being a purely domestic problem. Governments across Europe borrowed Dollars 400bn in 1993, and the total will be only slightly smaller this year. In Sweden, institutional investors have been going on strike, saying that they can absorb no more government paper. Bond yields in Italy and Spain have soared much higher than in the UK. Looking still further around the globe, the economic (and political) imbalances between the US and Japan are becoming disruptive. As the Japanese hoard their surplus savings, the deficit-ridden dollar is sinking and dollar interest rates are being forced higher. The details are complicated, but as I said more simply in this space three months ago, the market climate has changed. Whereas 1993 was a year for speculators, 1994 will turn out to be a year for investors, although in the short term they may not realise just how fortunate they are. The past three months have been notable, for instance, for the numbers of aborted new flotations on the London stock market. Promoters (often venture capital houses trying to get out at the top) have not been able to get the fancy prices for poor-quality companies which were easily obtainable until the market cracked. Many buyers of overpriced rubbish last winter will wish they had had a keener sense of true value. No, the markets are not crazy. But the logic of their movements is often not apparent until long after the event. In the meantime, investors should understand that they now have the ability to trade their capital more dearly. The prices may be down but the value is better.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Technology: Building a new home for scientists - Glaxo's Pounds 700m drug research centre Britain's biggest building project after the Channel Tunnel, Glaxo's Pounds 700m drugs research centre (pictured right), is approaching completion in Stevenage, 30 miles north of London. Unlike the Chunnel, it is on schedule, below budget and there have been no fatalities nor serious injuries. Glaxo is creating the spacious 73-acre research campus on one of the last big greenfield sites left in south-east England. It will house 1,500 scientists and support staff who now work in overcrowded and out-dated laboratories in Ware, a few miles from Stevenage, and Greenford, west London. The success of Glaxo and its contractors in controlling the project's costs and timing, while maintaining an outstanding safety record, is an object lesson for the construction industry. The Stevenage project exemplifies many of the recommendations for improved working relationships, made last month by Sir Michael Latham in his government-sponsored report on the building industry. In particular, the integrated management structure provides a high level of control over the design and construction process. The design phase involved 350 engineers, architects and cost estimators, based in the London offices of consulting engineers Ove Arup. Sub-contractors used the project team's computer-aided design models to develop their own drawings. The London base is linked electronically to the Stevenage site, so that any last-minute design changes are immediately notified to everyone concerned. 'The project is managed like a company's board,' says Richard Haryott, senior Arup director for the Stevenage project. 'Glaxo acts as chairman, with the the other professionals playing a full role in decision making.' The overall architectural planner is the Kling Lindquist Partnership of Philadelphia, chosen because Glaxo liked the way it designed the company's US research headquarters in North Carolina. The Stevenage campus is emerging with the wide-open feel of an American science park, sandwiched between two of Britain's principal transport links, the east coast main line railway and the A1 trunk road. The landscape features a serpentine lake, as well as 28,000 trees. The main building contractor is Laing Morris-Knudsen, a UK-US joint venture between Laing of London and Morris-Knudsen of Cleveland, Ohio. During the peak construction activity in 1992-93 LMK had 3,000 workers on site. Glaxo is particularly proud of the safety record which Malcolm Carne, one of the engineers supervising the project, says is five to 10 times better than the UK construction industry average. Glaxo executives were warned, when they decided in 1987 to build the research centre, that they would kill three people in the process if the safety performance was just average. So Glaxo, aided by Arup and Laing, implemented rigorous safety procedures. The workforce was given generous incentives to work safely. For every million man-hours without a serious accident, Glaxo held a draw for a new Volvo car. 'So far we've given away 10 Volvos,' says Sir Mark Richmond, research director. Completing the project under budget - with a likely final cost of Pounds 670m compared with the budgeted Pounds 710m - owes a lot to lucky timing, Richmond concedes. Cost estimates were made when the construction industry was working at full capacity, but many of the contracts were placed two or three years later when companies were cutting prices to win business. Glaxo executives may worry that shareholders see the Stevenage campus as extravagant, even with its total costs slightly reduced, now that the company's great expansion of the 1980s is over and the pharmaceutical industry is entering a period of relative austerity. However Roger Newton, head of chemistry, points out that Glaxo's Greenford labs - many dating from the 1950s  - 'were at the end of their useful life and would have had to be replaced anyway. We also needed to build a new microbiology pilot plant'. By putting everything on one site, Glaxo avoids duplication of equipment and saves many tedious road journeys between Ware and Greenford. Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, is unapologetic about 'the benefits of bringing together all our research in the UK - chemistry and biology - on one imposing site with first-class facilities. These people are going to be more productive when they are working together in an integrated way'.</p>

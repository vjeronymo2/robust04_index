			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministries of Defense and Interior and Security  have praised the efforts of citizens in the various governorates  of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], who are discharging  their national duties with a high degree of responsibility,  bringing to realization the noble national unity for our people  in the DRY, supporting the DRY by supporting the Armed Forces  and the security forces. The two ministries call on all the  citizens to report any destructive activities on the part of the  remnants of the mercenaries of the al-Ahmar gang in any area,  particularly in those areas currently being liberated and mopped  up to get rid of these remnants.</p>

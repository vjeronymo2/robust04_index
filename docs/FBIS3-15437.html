The bloc is headed by Georgiy Chanturiya, leader of the  National Democratic Party. The opposition is campaigning  against head of state Eduard Shevardnadze, the Civic Union  organization headed by him, and the parliamentary majority.    The reason for this unification is the ratification by  parliament of the decision to join the CIS. Chanturiya and Co.  believe that the speaker grossly violated the standing orders  and flouted all the laws. A law suit has already been filed  with the republic's Supreme Court.    It is worth recalling here that the ratification took place  to the accompaniment of whistling, cat calls, choice swearwords,  and fisticuffs. The hall of sessions was like the central  market when a thief has been caught and above all this uproar  was heard the shrill voice of one of the deputies signing the  anthem of the Soviet Union. If all these scenes are repeated  out on the streets, and the leaders of the opposition movement  are perfectly capable of doing that, the situation will get out  of control. And the new alliance is in a very determined state  of mind.    The situation is being complicated by the fact that on 7  March Shevardnadze is flying to the United States at the  invitation of President Clinton. It would be a good idea if he  took David Zeikidze, Tbilisi's police chief, along with him. A  year ago this conscientious state servant declared: "I get spat  on whether I authorize a rally or not. So I shall disperse it!"  In most cases he has kept his promise since then. In this  connection one is bound to recall that the previous Georgian  coup began precisely with the dispersal of a National Democratic  Party rally.    The leaders of the opposition parties have held a  confidential meeting in Tbilisi. The audience adopted an appeal  to the United Nations, the peoples of the world, and the  governments of all countries. The appeal notes that the  decision on affiliation to the CIS is illegitimate and the vote  was held in conditions of terror. The ratification is called a  "coup from above." The opposition leaders believe that such an  important decision must be adopted only by a nationwide  referendum.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION, Dublin] </F>   [Excerpt] The Dublin government reacted with caution and  disappointment tonight to the IRA's declaration of a three-day  ceasefire. The terror group's announcement was welcomed -- but  only as a potentially interim step.    Prime Minister Albert Reynolds stressed that what was really  needed was a permanent end to the Northern Ireland-linked  violence. That was the only way, he said, that the political  process could be moved forward.    The hope was that the development could be built on to  create  a long-term cessation of terrorism, officials in the Irish  capital added.    That prospect was envisaged earlier this month by deputy  Irish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Dick Spring. He  controversially looked ahead to a temporary IRA ceasefire  providing a foundation for moves towards a political settlement  of the Ulster conflict.    In subsequent comments, though, Mr Spring made it clear that  only a permanent rejection of violence by the hard-line Irish  Republicans would permit them to enter the constitutional  political arena.    The Dublin sources made no attempt to cloak their  disappointment that the IRA had not gone the whole way in  tonight's statement. And, speaking ahead of the anticipated  development, Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said he would  study the contents of any announcement that was made. But he  added: "While any reduction in violence would be welcome, a  short term one, or one of short duration would be disappointing.  I would be disappointed because what the situation demands at  this stage is -- in order to move the peace process forward -- a  cessation of violence." [passage omitted]</p>

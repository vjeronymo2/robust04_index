			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Brittan optimistic of early Gatt deal SIR Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic affairs, said yesterday that an early conclusion to the Uruguay Round of global trade talks was both possible and 'vitally necessary'. During a brief visit to Geneva, where he met Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and other senior trade negotiators, Sir Leon told journalists he wanted to stress to trading partners the Community's 'sense of urgency' in concluding the six-year-old talks and his determination that they move 'into top gear'. Although the US and EC failed in their attempt earlier this month to conclude a last-minute deal on tariff cuts before the Bush administration left office, Sir Leon said the time was not wasted and the outlines of a deal on market access had become clear. He believed it was possible to reach an overall Uruguay Round agreement within the US 'fast-track' procedure and it was, therefore, 'vitally necessary to do so'. However, this did not necessarily mean a completed deal by March 2, when President Bill Clinton must notify Congress that he intends to sign a Uruguay Round accord. The administration's current 'fast-track' negotiating authority - enabling it to present Congress with a trade agreement for approval or rejection without amendment - expires at the end of May. The fear is that, if this final deadline is missed, Congress will insist on new items, such as the environment and worker rights, being put on the negotiating agenda. Sir Leon, who will meet Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US trade representative, for the first time on February 11, said the desire to put new areas on the agenda 'should not be a pretext for failing to conclude the Round'.</p>

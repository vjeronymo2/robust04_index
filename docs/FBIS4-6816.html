			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Misunderstanding Must Be Cleared"] </F>   [Text] Relations between Thailand and Cambodia are sour  again after Cambodian leaders, from prime ministers to foreign  minister, made a series of allegations against Thailand through  the media. They accused Thailand of helping the Khmer Rouge in  operations against the Phnom Penh government because the Khmer  Rouge was excluded from national administration.    The latest accusation was heard when the Khmer Rouge forces  retook the town of Pailin, which is in the northwest of Cambodia  and less than 20 km from the Thai border. Pailin had been  captured by government forces on 19 March, but remained under  the Cambodian Government's control for only 30 days.    This time the accusation was made by Second Prime Minister  Hun Sen, who said Thailand "directly helped the Khmer Rouge,"  and that several hundreds crossed from the Thai side to  reinforce the Khmer Rouge at Pailin.    The Thai Government, through its spokesman, immediately  denied the Cambodian allegation. It said the Thai Government  was gravely concerned by the accusations made to the media by  Cambodian leaders. It said, despite the fact that there was an  agreement to settle problems through diplomatic channels,  Cambodia never abided by the agreement. This caused Thailand to  doubt whether the Cambodian Government was only finding a  scapegoat to explain its defeat at the hands of the Khmer Rouge.    From what happened, we think the Thai and Cambodian  Governments are now resorting to emotions in dealing with one  another. It is useless to adopt such a stand, and continue  throwing charges against each other, since this would only make  things worse.    Before the Khmer Rouge lost Pailin to the Phnom Penh  government, Thailand had adjusted its policy regarding issues at  the border with Cambodia -- Cambodians would be denied shelter  inside Thailand in order to prevent allegations that Thailand  was helping the Khmer Rouge. However, Thailand was accused by  the Cambodian Government of lacking humanitarian feelings when  it pushed back fleeing Cambodian refugees. Now Cambodia has  accused Thailand of helping the Khmer Rouge -- which is very  unlikely. Khmer Rouge elements can sneak into Thai territory  without Thailand's knowledge because the Thai- Cambodian border  is a long stretch. And it is not Thailand's fault if Khmer  Rouge forces used Thai territory as a transport route without  Thailand's knowledge.    We think that, although both Thailand and Cambodia are in an  angry mood, they should immediately seek to hold a high-level  meeting to thrash out the mutual distrust.    There is no use in Thailand helping the Khmer Rouge in their  fight against the Phnom Penh government since Thailand, as a  nation, would gain nothing from that.    It is necessary for Thailand and Cambodia to hold  discussions  to reach mutual understanding in order to prevent further any  deterioration in their relations. Remaining indifferent to the  issue will be no good for any of the two parties since, as  geographical neighbors, they cannot live far apart from one  another.</p>

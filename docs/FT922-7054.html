			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Inside Whitehall: A society now not so secret - Yesterday the government cut secrecy at the heart of Whitehall, revealing the membership of cabinet committees whose very existence was previously not even acknowledged. The cloak is being removed from how decisions are made and who makes them LIGHT was was shed on some of the darker recesses of Whitehall secrecy yesterday, but Mr John Major's latest exercise in open government had an air of studied understatement about it. Sir Robin Butler, secretary to the cabinet and head of the Civil Service, who lifted a corner of the veil of secrecy surrounding Whitehall, is not a man who is given to grand gestures. The exercise, launched by Mr William Waldegrave in his capacity as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, was designed to illuminate the instinctively secretive Whitehall establishment that Sir Robin runs for his political masters. It was a partial success. The publication of details of the cabinet committees at the heart of government - and of the detailed instructions to ministers on how to operate the machinery - provided a valuable insight into the way Britain is run. Yet, as Sir Robin was obliged to acknowledge, the picture remains far from complete. For those unaccustomed to the intricacies of Whitehall decision-making, the first message of the documents is that very little of the business of government is conducted at full meetings of the cabinet. The weekly sessions on Thursdays rarely last more than 90 minutes. With occasional exceptions, ministers report on their activities or float ideas rather than become entangled with the minutiae of policy-making. Most decisions are instead taken by much smaller groups of ministers - sometimes within the framework of the cabinet committee system published yesterday, and just as often in still smaller ad hoc groupings. They provide the infrastructure to support the all-important doctrine of collective responsibility: the unbreakable rule that once a decision has been taken it must be publicly supported by all ministers, whatever their private views. It was the official committee structure that Mr Waldegrave and Sir Robin unveiled - the 16 standing committees and 10 sub-committees that have authority to take decisions on behalf of the cabinet. The four most important - on home, foreign, domestic and legislative affairs  -were officially acknowledged by Mrs Thatcher. While the existence of the others has long been an open secret, technically their activities have remained secret. Their membership confirms what has long been known about the Whitehall power structure: for example, that the chancellor or chief secretary, and frequently both, have places reserved on virtually every committee in their roles as guardians of the public purse. The prime minister heads nine of the main groups. Those interested in personal power plays will notice that Mr Michael Heseltine is well represented in his capacity as president of the board of trade. He has secured also Mr Major's agreement to an upgraded ministerial committee dealing with industrial issues. The prime minister has curbed Mr Heseltine's ambitions, though, by giving the group a neutral chairman in the person of Lord Wakeham and by including Mr Norman Lamont as its next most senior member. Lord Wakeham, the lord privy seal, lives up to his reputation as chief political fixer with the chairmanship of several committees on which departmental rivalries run deep. Mr Waldegrave's principal role as minister for the Citizen's Charter has won him a place on all the important domestic committees. So in theory, the interested observer should be able to trace the main decisions of government through the cabinet machinery. That machinery in turn should guarantee each member ample scope to ensure that his or her voice is heard before important decisions are reached. Unfortunately the reality is not quite as simple. Much of the most sensitive business of government is done not in the cabinet committee system but by smaller ad hoc groups with interests in particular policy issues. Sometimes those are established alongside the standing committees, gaining the title 'Misc' or 'Gen'. On other occasions, such groupings can exist outside any formal structure, limiting the capacity of most members of the cabinet to influence important decisions. In her second and third terms, Mrs Margaret Thatcher came to rely almost exclusively on 'Misc' committees and ad hoc gatherings to buttress her authority. Mr Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, only once managed to secure a broad ministerial discussion on the European monetary system. The issue eventually tore Mrs Thatcher's government apart, but it never reached full cabinet. Questions of procedure make clear that a senior minister's ability to force full cabinet discussion of any particular issue is tightly circumscribed. Except in the case of a battle with the Treasury over funding, such a request must first win the support of the relevant committee chairman. Even then, the prime minister can reject it. Yesterday's documents make no reference to the role of Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, who has ex-officio membership of all the main groups. Mr Ryder, the prime minister's agent in much of the behind-the-scenes bargaining between ministers, wields considerable but officially unacknowledged influence across Whitehall. Mr Waldegrave insisted yesterday that Mr Major's decision to publish the details signalled his determination to use the formal committee system. However, senior colleagues say he will find it difficult to avoid the attractions of the ad hoc approach to settle the competing claims of Whitehall departments. In such circumstances, the standing committee might become little more than a mailing list for high-level documents. Sir Robin acknowledged that open government extends only so far. The cabinet office will periodically update the list of committees to include details of ad hoc groups, but will not announce their establishment at the time. Without any apparent hint of irony, Sir Robin said such announcements might be 'misleading'. In fact, he is anxious to ensure that outsiders cannot delve too deeply into the process of decision-making. More particularly, he wishes to discourage the appearance in public of differences of opinion between ministers. Mr Gus O'Donnell, the prime minister's press secretary, made clear yesterday that he would not help journalists to track decision-making through the Whitehall machine by revealing when the committees meet. In terms of open government, Mr Major has so far shone a torch rather than a searchlight into Whitehall. But at least there is some light.</p>

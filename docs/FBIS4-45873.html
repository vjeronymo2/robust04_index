			<p>CSO     [Text] The authorities of the Ministry of Public Health  have denied that there is an epidemic of classic dengue fever  affecting 6,000 persons in the Canton of Macara, Loja Province,  although the figures reported by the authorities in Quito,  Macara, and Loja continue to contradict each other.    Reports issued in the last few days by Ramon Aguirre,  director of health of the Province of Loja, state that in the  Canton of Macara 6,000 cases of classic dengue fever had been  identified in the last few weeks. This amounts to 20 percent of  the total population. As a result he even asked for the  declaration of a health emergency in the Canton of Macara.    This same information was confirmed on the following day by  Dr. Dalton Arevalo, the director of the Hospital of Macara, and  by Dr. Jose Prado. Both of them pointed out that the situation  was not a cause for particular alarm, after comparing the number  of sick persons and the total number of persons living in the  canton.    Two days after the report by the director of health of the  Canton of Loja was issued the Ministry of Health explained that  a survey of the population had been carried out to determine how  many persons had ever suffered from dengue fever in their whole  lives. The result of the survey was that 20 percent of the  population of the canton had suffered from dengue fever at one  time or another. The Canton of Macara has a population of 30,000  people.    In the entire Province of Loja 39 cases of classic dengue  fever were reported during the first two months of 1994. It is  expected that data for the month of March will show that the  total figure does not exceed 100 cases, the authorities said, as  they confirmed that this was not an epidemic in any way.    For his part Ricardo Canizares, the regional chief of  epidemiology, said in Guayaquil that, according to data provided  by the Leopoldo Izquieta Perez Institute of Health, no more than  three cases of classic dengue fever had been positively  confirmed in the Canton of Macara. An additional 46 cases were  reported but not confirmed. Meanwhile, when Nicolas Jara, the  undersecretary of health, was asked about the number of cases of  dengue fever recorded in the Canton of Macara, he stated that he  did not know the figure. However, he ordered that the  information be collected. It was reported that in January and  February of 1994 39 cases were confirmed in all of the Province  of Loja, and it is expected that there will be no more than 100  cases confirmed in March.    Nevertheless, he recognized that the increase in the number  of cases of dengue fever in the Province of Loja reflected the  fact that no health precautions are being taken in Peruvian  border towns.</p>

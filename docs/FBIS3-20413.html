Reviewing the  1993 economy of our province, we are happy to note that it  continued to grew steadily on the basis of the relatively fast  development achieved in the previous year.    According to the initial figures provided by the departments  concerned, our province's total output value of goods and  services for 1993 could reach 64.8 billion yuan, up 10 percent  over the previous year. This double-digit growth, which we  achieved despite numerous economic difficulties, was  attributable to our efforts to deepen the reforms, open  ourselves wider, adjust the economic structure, and raise our  economic efficiency. Among the various components of the total  output value, it is estimated that the tertiary industry  increased 15 percent, topping the primary and secondary  industries.    Last year our province's economic operations had the  following main features:    A fairly high agricultural output. Despite the severe  natural  disasters--a drought followed by waterlogging and a cold  spell--which hit a large part of our farmland, we still had a  fairly good harvest, thanks to the strenuous efforts of the  cadres at all levels and the masses in the province. Last year's  total grain output is estimated at 10.85 million tons, or 1.4  percent more than the previous year. A continued growth was  achieved in the output of tobacco, tea, sericulture, and animal  husbandry. Township enterprises developed at a quicker pace.  Total agricultural revenue is estimated at 20 billion yuan, a  53.2 percent increase over the previous year.    A stable industrial growth. Despite numerous difficulties,  such as a shortage of electric power, insufficient revolving  funds, seriously inadequate outbound freight facilities, and  rising prices of raw materials and other supplies, it is  estimated that the gross value of industrial production could  still reach 53 billion yuan, 14 percent more than the previous  year. Production and sales were well coordinated, and economic  efficiency continued to improve. For the period from January to  November, sales within the budgets of state-owned enterprises  increased 36 percent, while their profits and taxes rose 84  percent. Investment in fixed assets were focused on basic  industries and infrastructure projects. The amount invested in  production accounted for 67 percent of the total investment.  More emphasis was laid on key construction projects.    Stable sales on the market. With the step-by-step  implementation of macroregulatory and control measures, the  retail market gradually became stable. Retail sales between  January and November totaled 24.6 billion yuan, 23 percent more  than the previous year's corresponding period. The upward trend  of consumption by government institutions was put under control.  In the capital goods market, the problem of unbalanced supply  and demand was eased for rolled steel, cement, and other main  products.    An improving financial situation. Through screening and  rectification, we were able to effectively control such  activities as illegal lending and borrowing as well as  indiscriminate fund-raising. Residents' savings showed an  upturn, and banks had a better paying capability.    Fairly good results in fulfilling the revenue and  expenditure budget. With the rise in the economic returns of  industrial and commercial enterprises and especially due to the  further development of the two tobacco-related industries, there  was an increase in the industrial and commercial tax receipts,  leading to a relatively fast growth of government revenue. Last  year's revenue was estimated at 14.5 billion yuan from local  resources.    A continued rise in residents income. For urban people, the  average per capita annual income used for living expenses is  estimated at 2,430 yuan. In rural areas, the average net income  of an individual is estimated at 670 yuan. Allowing for  inflation, these are higher than the previous year by about 6  and 2 percent respectively.    A further growth of imports and exports. According to  estimates, last year's exports stood at $510 million, an  increase of 12 percent over the previous year; imports $230  million, an increase of 12.7 percent; and the amount of border  trade, including imports and exports, 2.8 millon yuan, an  increase of 25 percent. With the continued development of the  tourist industry, it is estimated that 376,000 travelers came  into our province for sightseeing, a 20 percent surge over the  previous year. Total receipts from travelers' foreign exchange  certificates amounted to 530 million yuan, surpassing the  previous year by 43 percent.    An objective analysis shows that, despite our stable  economic  growth, some problems still exist in our economic activities.  Chief among them are the difficulties encountered in developing  agriculture caused by severe natural disasters and the hiking  prices of means of production, the arduous task of curbing the  sharp rise in commodity prices, the increased losses suffered by  certain enterprises, and the relatively large amounts of unpaid  taxes. All these problems have to be resolved through improving  the reform drive.    Based on the three-step national economic development  strategy, the provincial party committee and government have  come up with the following basic proposal for Yunnan's economic  development in the future: With respect to the total output  value of goods and services, we should maintain an average  annual growth rate of 9-10 percent during the 1990's and achieve  the objective of quadrupling the 1980 figure by 1995; that is,  earlier than specified in the national strategy. We should  score a total output value of more than 100 billion yuan and try  to make it as much as eight times the 1980 figure by the year  2000. By that time, the rural people in our province should  have a net per capita income of 1,200 yuan, the food and  clothing problems in poverty-stricken areas should be resolved,  and the people in most parts of the province should enjoy a  comfortable life. The Yunnan people should work hard to achieve  this goal.    The first priority task will be infrastructure construction.  In agriculture, we will build 50 more large- and medium-sized  water conservancy projects during the eighth and ninth five-year  plan periods. Our goal is to raise the irrigated acreage from  the present 35 percent to 50 percent of the total farmland in  the province and build 25 million mu of high- and stable-yield  fields of various categories to meet different requirements.  With regard to the power industry, we will invest some 10  billion yuan in building the 1.35-million-kw Dachaoshan Power  Station and the 600,000-kw Qujing Power Plant, beginning this  year. And we will continue to build a number of small- and  medium-sized hydro power projects. Transportation construction  will be focused on building four railways, renovating six  highways, improving and constructing eight airports. As for  communications, we will build a number of microwave, fiber  optical, and second-grade satellite communications facilities to  link Kunming with various prefectures and autonomous  prefectures. With respect to mail and telecommunication  services, we will see to it that automation is achieved in all  counties and program-controlled equipment is installed in all  major cities.    Commencing this year, development of promising industries  will be one of the major economic tasks in our province. In  addition to the tobacco, sugar, and tea industries, we will  develop livestock production, food-processing, nonferrous metal,  machinery, phosphatic chemical, iron and steel, and building  materials projects so as to gradually turn them into new strong  industries.    Another major task is to seize opportunities to create a new  situation in opening our province to the outside world,  Southeast Asia in particular. Now, our province has nearly 700  foreign-funded enterprises, and the negotiated foreign  investment has reached $1.46 billion, of which the amount  actually received and put to use is $144 million. To bring our  opening-up activities to a high level, expand their fields, and  develop them in breadth and depth, our goal is to increase the  number of our products capable of earning more than $100 million  of foreign exchange from one to six and solicit more foreign  investment, mainly in the exploitation of our strong resources,  in infrastructure construction and basic industries, in  exchange-earning agricultural projects, and in the development  of tourism. We will try to bring the three kinds of  foreign-funded enterprises to over 1,000 and sign a number of  agreements on Sino-foreign cooperative projects during the  Eighth Five-Year Plan period. Additionally, we will further  develop border trade and economic cooperation with neighboring  countries in an effort to maintain a 20 percent growth in border  trade.    According to what we have learned, accelerating the  development of township enterprises, export-oriented economic  undertakings, and the tourist industry and further restructuring  the economy are also major parts of Yunnan's economic work in  the future. Meanwhile, Yunnan will always pay attention to  correcting unbalanced development as a strategic task in  economic construction.    At the beginning of the new year, people are expecting  Yunnan  to take new strides to deepen its reforms and further its  openness to the outside world.</p>

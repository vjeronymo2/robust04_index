			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Reconditioned for growth Valeo, the French automotive components supplier, has come through the deep recession in the European auto industry with flying colours. While leading rivals such as Bosch of Germany and Italy's Magneti Marelli incurred heavy losses last year, Valeo has maintained profits, writes Kevin Done. Mr Noel Goutard, Valeo's ebullient chairman and chief executive, was one of the first leaders in the automotive components industry to anticipate the downturn and batten down the hatches in 1990. Now that the market is improving, Valeo is going for growth while some rivals are still clearing the wreckage of the recession. 'In 1994 we are in a new phase, and we anticipate strong growth,' says Mr Goutard. 'We believe that by 1995-96 the American, European and Japanese markets will be in a unique situation with all three converging on a path of strong growth. Asia/Pacific will join as a fourth important region. There will be four markets in high gear and we want to be ready.' Valeo has become a standard bearer of the European automotive components industry. Over the past decade it has provided a textbook example of how a regional player can develop into a global supplier. After three years of losses in the mid-1980s the group came under the minority control of the Cerus group of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian industrialist. Mr Goutard was recruited from Thomson, the French electronics group, to turn round the ailing con-glomerate. Initially, Valeo's non-automotive operations in construction materials, mechanical engineering and defence were jettisoned. Valeo then set out to transform itself from a company with markets largely limited to France, Italy and Spain, into a European supplier and, eventually, into a global components producer. Acquisitions took it into the UK - to serve the newly arriving Japanese carmakers - and also into Germany and Sweden. A similar route, together with joint ventures, has allowed it to expand its presence into North and South America and Asia (notably into South Korea). Of group sales last year of FFr20.2bn (Pounds 2.43bn) some 41 per cent was derived from France, 36 per cent from the rest of Europe, 14 per cent from North America (including Mexico) and 9 per cent from South America and Asia. The group now has 68 production plants worldwide, of which 20 are outside Europe. In an industry becoming ever more concentrated, it supplies virtually all of the world's leading vehicle makers. But its main customers are the two French producers PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault, Chrysler of the US, the Volkswagen group of Germany and Fiat of Italy. Valeo has seized the opportunity - and risk - offered by Chrysler's resurgence. The US carmaker has come from nowhere five years ago to become its third most important customer, ahead of VW and Fiat. The French group has focused operations in sectors where it can be number one or two in Europe or the world: in automotive lighting, clutches, air conditioning and heating, radiators, plus electrical, wiper and security systems. This structure served it well, but the acquisitions spree was halted by the threat of recession, when it had to take tough measures to reduce debt levels, cut back its workforce and increase productivity. 'We said a healthy balance sheet and a continuous improvement of our operating margins, and not sales growth, would be the main concerns. We have re-engineered ourselves,' says Mr Goutard. Net profits actually grew marginally last year - in the depths of recession in European auto markets. Valeo has continued to invest heavily in research and development, training and the upgrading of its workforce, through extensive recruitment of graduate engineers, to equip it for the next growth phase, which Mr Goutard believes is well under way. He forecasts Valeo will increase turnover by 50 per cent by the year 2000 to FFr30bn, including a doubling of sales outside western Europe. Already this year it has taken over a clutch business and set up an aluminium radiator operation in Argentina. It has also set up joint ventures in automotive air conditioning, heaters, wipers and electric motors in China, and taken over Borg Instruments, a specialist German automotive electronics company. Having successfully managed recession, Valeo now faces the challenge of managing growth without getting fat. 'In a receding market everyone knows belt-tightening is the order of the day, but everyone goes mad in a growth environment. It is very difficult to run a tight ship,' warns Mr Goutard. 'The next years will be growth without inflation. We will not be able to pass on cost increases to customers. We cannot count on inflation to erase our sins, so we had better not sin.'</p>

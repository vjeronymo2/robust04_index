			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BRUSH FIRE SKIRTS AFFLUENT SAND CANYON AREA  </P> <P> Standing atop a hill in the calm of dusk, surveying the blackened hills around  Mountain Park Road, Dave and Macel Barron reflected on their good fortunes.  </P> <P> Their prized rose bushes were burned, the chicken coop consumed, and their  steel tool shed melted. But their home in an affluent Sand Canyon neighborhood  escaped unscathed from a fast-moving brush fire that consumed more than 1,100  acres in the Santa Clarita Valley and was still burning out of control late  Sunday night.  </P> <P> From their vantage point the Barrons, both 46, could see helicopters dropping  water onto hot spots glowing in the distance, but Los Angeles County fire  officials said all homes were out of danger and that they expected the blaze to  be contained by 6 a.m. today.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Lost Shed'  </P> <P> "We lost a tool shed, the fence and the chicken coop, but the house could have  been like that," Dave Barron said.  </P> <P> "It was the closest that any fire has ever gotten to our house," Macel Barron  said, as she snapped photos of the damage.  </P> <P> Although flames came perilously close to at least six homes on Mountain Park  Road, the Barrons' tool shed and chicken coop were the only structures lost in  the blaze.  </P> <P> The calm of dusk was a stark contrast to the commotion of midday, when Sand  Canyon residents and firefighters rallied to save the expensive homes. As a  dozen firefighters stood in the Barrons' back yard battling the blaze, Dave  Barron ran through the house, gathering photo albums and other possessions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cooperation Noted  </P> <P> Throughout the Sand Canyon area, horse owners worked to evacuate the many  horses that live on the canyon's ranches. As flames raced within 200 yards of  the Arabian Pleasure Horse Ranch, six horse owners led the 22 animals stabled  there to safety.  </P> <P> "They got kind of nervous but they were pretty eager to jump in the trailers  and get out of here," said Don DeGroote, of Valencia.  </P> <P> Residents of several homes on Warmuth Road took their animals to neighboring  homes and ranches. Members of the Arabian Horse Society sent trailers to help  transport horses out of the area.  </P> <P> More than 100 people were urged to leave homes that were threatened by flames.  But most chose to stay and protect their luxury Tudor- and ranch-style homes.  </P> <P> Doug Van Horn, of Newhall, whose in-laws live on Red Clay Street, said that  "everyone chipped in to take care of each other. . . . That's the way the  canyon is, everybody knows everybody."  </P> <P> Standing in the driveway of his home off Pacy Street, Floyd Irvin, 49, said he  would not move from the area.  </P> <P> "They have fires every year out here. You go through this two or three times  every summer for nine years, you don't get too excited," said Irvin as his  front-lawn sprinklers ran full blast.  </P> <P> "They haven't lost a house here in 15 years," he said.  </P> <P> Santa Clarita City Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon, who lives in a  two-story, Spanish-style home on Raven Hill Road, said he has lived in the area  for 20 years and this is the closest that a brush fire has come from his home.  </P> <P> "The thing that impressed me is what a great job the Fire Department did and  how the neighbors worked to help each other," he said. "When you go through  something like this, it's just great to see how people rally around to help  each other."  </P> <P> McKeon was backing out of his driveway when he noticed the fire in the hills  near his home. He said he went back inside, changed clothes and then went out  to help his neighbors.  </P> <P> Pam Gunnison, 33, a four-year resident of the Ravenhill Street area, said that  although she and her husband did not want to leave their home, they took their  12 Arabian horses, several goats and dogs to nearby stables.  </P> <P> However, deputies attempted to arrest her husband, Gunnison said, as he  returned to their house with the empty horse trailer.  </P> <P> The more than 1,100 acres of brush consumed by late Sunday had not burned in  more than 40 years, fire officials said.  </P> <P> The fire burned all the way to the pavement of the Antelope Valley Freeway  north of the Via Princessa exit.  </P> <P> Freeway traffic was slowed in both directions for more than two hours, and the  freeway was closed briefly about 7 p.m. Thick, white smoke billowed across all  the traffic lanes, reducing visibility to about 200 feet. Some motorists  stopped on the shoulder to watch the flames. A few produced video cameras.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Backfires Set  </P> <P> Firefighters set backfires to contain the blaze and helicopters and air tankers  conducted water drops at the freeway's edge. More than 350 firefighters battled  the blaze.  </P> <P> At about 11 p.m., county Fire Department Spokesman Corey Lovers said that the  fire was about 60% contained and that all homes were out of danger.  </P> <P> The only injury reported by Sunday evening was a sprained ankle suffered by a  prison inmate working on a fire crew.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer Carlos V. Lozano contributed to this story.  </P></p>

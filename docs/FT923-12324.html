			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Letter: Air traffic control Sir, In your article, 'Airlines step up drive for EC control system' (July 16), you report the Association of European Airlines' (AEA) support for a harmonised system of air traffic control. The British Air Line Pilots' Association supports an integrated ATC system, for our members are well aware of the air traffic problems facing Europe. With the prospect of sustained long-term traffic growth, the need to upgrade and integrate the existing national ATC systems becomes ever more urgent. Technology alone is no answer: equipment and procedures must be standardised; and much greater investment is required as part of a Europe-wide co-ordinated development. We must move speedily towards a unified system that transcends national frontiers. Progress has been made towards closer co-operation between governments under the auspices of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) and Eurocontrol. However, the present approach of inter-governmental co-operation has some limitations and we believe new impetus could be given if the European Commission were to play a more leading role. Chris Darke, general secretary, British Air Line Pilots Association, 81 New Road, Harlington, Hayes Middx</p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> New Clean Air Act Cost Study: The new federal law will cost the average  American household far less than industry has alleged, according to the  National Clean Air Coalition, which lobbied for the bill.  </P> <P> The coalition estimates the cost at $8.40 per household per month by 1995. A  study cited by the Bush Administration had estimated it at roughly $20 a month  by 2005. Richard Ayres, coalition chairman, said this would hardly deliver the  devastating blow to the U.S. economy that industry had predicted. He compared  that $8.40 monthly figure with estimates that the average U.S. household this  year will spend $29 a month for movies and $51 for alcohol.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 1/6/1994 -- Turkey's interests  in Moldova and in particular in the conflict between a part of  the Gagauz population and Moldovan leadership is natural, Vasile  Nedelciuc, member of the Parliamentary Commission for Foreign  Relations and member of the Peasants and Intellectuals Bloc,  stated to BASA. According to him "there are few states so  seriously and constantly interested in the situation in Moldova  and therefore Turkey's economic interest and its  military-strategic interest should not be neglected." He said  that "President Demirel's arrival in Chisinau is an important  step toward finding foreign partners that could support Moldova  during its crisis." On the other hand Nedelciuc noted that  "Demirel's arrival has implications that should worry those who  carefully observe negotiations between Chisinau officials and  Comrat separatists' representatives." He stated that he "was  bewildered that the Chisinau officials went so far in the  negotiations with the Gagauz representatives," when he studied  the project on special status for Gagauzians. He mentioned that  the project "contains provisions sometimes granted to  independent states, but by accepting it parliamentary leaders  will make not only a political but a historical mistake."  According to Nedelciuc "if the talks between Demirel, Snegur  and the Gagauzian side support this variant, the Parliament will  not be able to impose another point of view, even though it will  want to adopt a new law because Demirel's arrival will only  complicate the situation."</p>

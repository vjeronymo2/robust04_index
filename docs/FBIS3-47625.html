Telecom President Cho Paek-che and Indosat President  Tjahjono  Soerjodibroto signed the agreement at a Pacific partners'  meeting in Hawaii.    They will form a consortium to participate in an  international tender to be placed by the Indonesian Government  for installing 2 million telephone lines on a build, operate and  transfer (BOF) basis.    Under its sixth economic development plan, the Indonesian  Government plans to install 5 million lines.    Developing countries prefer BOF, by which foreign firms  operate invested facilities for a time and hand them over after  gaining a preset profit.    If the consortium succeeds, it will help build Korea  Telecom's reputation in the area, the spokesman said.    Telecom has consulted on two projects in Indonesia. One on  communication technology at 3.9 million U.S. dollars and the  other on building a communications network at 1.3 million  dollars.</p>

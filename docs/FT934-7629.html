			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Ukraine ratifies nuclear arms reduction treaty THE Ukrainian parliament yesterday ratified the strategic arms reduction treaty (Start-1), but stopped short of approving President Leonid Kravchuk's promise to become a non-nuclear state. In closed session, deputies voted 254-9 to destroy 42 per cent of the country's 1,656 warheads immediately, but to dismantle the rest of the weapons 'gradually' after certain conditions had been met. Parliament did not set a time-frame for total disarmament. Ukraine is looking for Dollars 2.8bn in western aid for dismantlement, western security guarantees and financial compensation for the short-range tactical weapons it transferred to Russia last year. On Wednesday, Mr Kravchuk stressed the need to ratify the nuclear arms treaty - to fulfil his October assurances to Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state - ahead of his forthcoming visit to Washington. Ukraine is the world's third largest nuclear power with 176 inherited long-range strategic weapons, a larger arsenal than those of France, China and the UK combined. Earlier yesterday, Ukrainian deputies adopted a Soviet-style election law, which is likely to favour the Communist majority in voting next March. After weeks of contentious debate, insults and scuffles on the floor, parliament approved the right of influential labour collectives to place their factory bosses on the ballot and rejected a plan to reserve a portion of the seats for political parties. Moderates and liberals denounced the law as another throw-back to the Soviet era.</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> STABLES NEAR BOLSA CHICA MUST CLOSE  </P> <P> Smoky's Stables, one of the few remaining horse stables in the area, soon will  be just a little part of the city's history.  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Water District, which owns the land, has terminated the  stable's lease, leaving 150 horses without a home. The district is in  negotiation with Signal Landmark in Irvine to develop 41.5 acres next to the  Bolsa Chica Wetlands.  </P> <P> But for stable owners Fred and Alexis Burkett, the news that they must vacate  by the end of the year was sad.  </P> <P> "We have the pony birthday parties," Alexis Burkett said. "Kids come down all  dressed up as cowboys and they have their whole party here and they get to ride  ponies. Once we are gone, they are going to have to go to Irvine Park -- that's  the closest. It's just that here it's real convenient and it's a nice local  thing to do."  </P> <P> The Burketts claim they have two years left on their lease and they plan to  fight the eviction.  </P> <P> "I've never been so worried," Fred Burkett said. "I'm a fighter and I don't  like losing. I'm determined I'm going to stay until it's over."  </P> <P> Water district officials said a clause in the five-year lease agreement gives  them the authority to abolish the remaining two years of the agreement with 60  days' notice. Russ Twomey, attorney for the district, declined to discuss plans  for the property.  </P> <P> Sue Vernand, 35, of Huntington Beach and her two daughters are worried about  where their horse, Charlie, who lives at Smoky's Stables, will go now.  </P> <P> "We were at Fox Meadows for 10 years and when we moved him it was pretty  traumatic," she said. "He refused to eat." Vernand said she got a notice from  the Burketts that told of the eviction notice. "They tried to get boarders to  stick around at that time, but people started putting their names in other  places," Vernand said. "We're not sure how serious the water department is.  We're just waiting for the final ax to fall." LORELEI LACHMAN  </P></p>

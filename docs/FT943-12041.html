			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Cantab signs Stanford deal Cantab Pharmaceuticals, the biotechnology company, has signed an agreement with California's Stanford University that gives it an option to acquire exclusive rights to a family of patent applications covering inventions by Stanford's researchers. The two will also collaborate on research into autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. The deal signals Cantab's entry into autoimmune and inflammatory disease areas. The work is still at the research stage. Any product it isolated would have to go through years of clinical trials before reaching the market.</p>

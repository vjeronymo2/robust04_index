			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FRESNO;  </P> <P> COURT TO DECIDE ON COAL-BURNING PLANT  </P> <P> Attorneys for a coalition of farmers and environmentalists told a state  appellate court it should overturn approval of a $43-million coal-burning power  plant because it violates environmental law and will further damage crop  production in the San Joaquin Valley, the nation's richest farming region.  Chris Garrett, attorney for GWF Inc., the power company, told judges of the 5th  District Court of Appeal that the project has state-of-the-art coal-burning  technology that will not damage air quality.  </P> <P> But attorneys representing the coalition argued before that the project  violates the California Environmental Quality Act and would spew nearly 1,700  pounds of noxious gases and particulate matter into the air daily. They noted  that damage from poor air quality to Kings County's cotton crop already amounts  to $30 million a year.  </P></p>

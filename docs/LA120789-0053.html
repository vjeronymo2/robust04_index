			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BE IT EVER SO HUMONGOUS' WAS A HARD TALE TO SWALLOW  </P> <P> What prompted me to write you is not so much the fact that these larger homes  are built, but the fact that most of the time they show an incredible disregard  of basic architectural principles of proportion and organization and are often  down-right ugly.  </P> <P> As an architect and an architectural historian with more than 30 years of  experience I would like to point out to you some specifics, the few I can see,  from the photo published with today's article:  </P> <P> The dormers in the mansard roof are out of scale.  </P> <P> Never is there a vase positioned in the pinnacle of a pediment.  </P> <P> Corinthian pilasters don't bend at corners, as shown on the octagon over Mr.  Coler's head.  </P> <P> The whole organization of the facade on the right side is incongruous.  </P> <P> Please interpret my comments as a constructive contribution to the quality of  architecture in our city.  </P> <P> GERMAN C. SONNTAG  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Economic Viewpoint: What lies beyond anti-inflation There is nearly always some paradox about the world or national economy which prevents the subject from being unbearably repetitive or dull. This time it is that forward-looking financial market indicators point to healthy growth. On the other hand most direct measures of activity show a very inadequate recovery from a severe recession with unprecedented amounts of slack remaining. Whatever today's UK unemployment figures show, the depressing trends in the rest of the world cast a cloud. In terms of equities, there has been a sharp contrast between Anglo-US experience, on the one hand, and German and Japanese on the other. In the US, equity prices have not merely risen sharply this year but are now nearly 40 per cent higher than at the peak reached before the 1987 Wall Street crash; in the UK equities are a good 20 per cent higher. German and Japanese equities have been depressed by the economic difficulties of the two countries. They have, however, seen limited local recoveries. Dividend yields in the two main English-speaking countries have been heading strongly downwards. But they are still above or around the low points they reached before the 1987 crash. The fall in bond yields has gone even further than the fall in equity yields and the yield gap has narrowed strikingly. The equity rise, so far at least, can be explained as a normal response to falling interest rates. The fall in bond yields does not in itself suggest prolonged depression. It does suggest that the inflationary pressures of recent years have been truly subdued, although not eliminated, as the unsurprising UK Retail Prices Index data remind us. The one available direct measure of inflationary expectations is the gap between the yield on UK nominal gilt-edged securities and that on indexed bonds. This has also fallen sharply, but is still 3 1/2 per cent, which suggests something like the creeping inflation experienced in the postwar golden age. Some of the evidence for the degree of slack remaining in the world economy has been collected by Mervyn King, economic director of the Bank of England, in his recent presidential lecture to the European Economic Association. He shows that personal consumption in the US has been 4 per cent below what is normal at this stage of the business cycle. In the UK, the shortfall has been 8 per cent. King's own explanation is in terms of debt deflation. The slogan is, of course, well known, but King explains the phenomenon more carefully than most. He defines the necessary condition for debt deflation as 'a fall in asset values relative to the unit of account in which debts are denominated'. Thus, there can be debt deflation in a world where general price indices are still rising, as well as in periods such as the 1930s when they were falling and the US economist, Irving Fisher, identified the problem. The real value of net private sector debt rose in the UK by nearly 7 per cent in 1989-92. This was not nearly as much as in the US in 1929-32 but has, nevertheless, been a severe shock. King finds a reasonably good fit between increases in the household debt ratio and the shortfall in consumer spending in 1989-92 in various countries. The main new element he contributes is an analysis of the distribution of the debt between sectors. For instance, the fall in consumer spending in Britain has been confined to households with mortgages. The behaviour of house prices varied widely from region to region. The biggest fall of nearly 30 per cent has been in the south. In the north, Scotland and Wales, house prices are now higher than in 1989. Not surprisingly, negative equity has been concentrated in the south and hardly exists further away. An associated phenomenon has been the sharp narrowing of unemployment differentials, as the normally prosperous south-east was affected far more by recession than the previously depressed areas. King does not stick his neck out by saying whether the dragging effect of high debt levels on spending will continue to hold back recovery, or whether the more encouraging stock and bond market indicators provide a better clue. But the proverbial editorial ending, 'only time will tell', will not do. For we have reached a period in the international conjuncture where macroeconomic policy can no longer be seen just in terms of fighting inflation. It is typical of our cultural lags that just when inflation is at its least threatening for more than a generation that the UK government has only an inflation target and no other macroeconomic objective at all. The Bank of England Bulletin has only an Inflation Report and has abandoned its commentary on the general economy, which now has to be read between the lines of the Inflation Report. An indicator which combines real output and inflation in a useful way is total spending, measured by the growth of nominal gross domestic product. In the Group of Seven summit countries combined, nominal GDP growth was down to 3 1/2 per cent in the year to the middle of 1993. Inflation was down to 2 1/2 per cent, leaving only 1 per cent for real growth - all of which was accounted for by the US, UK and Canada. If we regard the prevailing international inflation rate as not far from the levels at which public national authorities should be aiming, and take the trend rate of real growth to be about 3 per cent a year, then the growth of demand in cash terms has been too low. At least the old simple-minded monetarism was theoretically a bulwark against depression as well as inflation. This was so because of the relationship it asserted between chosen measures of money and nominal GNP. The relationship meant that if inflation declined output would automatically recover, so long as the monetary targets held. The collapse of confidence in this relationship does not mean that policy need be helpless. But it does mean that governments and central banks cannot just have an objective for inflation alone, but need one for nominal GDP. Any busy business executives, who are thrown by the words 'nominal GDP' can best translate it as a national - or international - cash-flow objective. The need for such a cash objective is one that I have been trying to hammer home for nearly a decade and a half, as a way of saving the valid insights of both monetarism and Keynesianism from their misleading technocratic wrappings. Nominal GDP objectives would be sought through ordinary monetary and fiscal policy. No black magic is required or available. Framing policy in such cash-flow terms would liberate monetary authorities in relation to means, but tie their hands on ends. The main evolution in my thinking has been on the need to move this objective to an international plane. The UK departure from the exchange rate mechanism a year ago today and the subsequent crumbling of the system itself have made such a perspective more rather than less necessary. Indeed, the establishment on January 1 next year of the European Monetary Institute provides a heaven-sent opportunity to make progress. (The betting at the moment is that Mr Wim Duisenburg, the Dutch chairman of the EC central bankers, will act as interim chairman until an outside president can be found.) Irrespective of whether or not the institute leads to a European central bank, as originally planned, it needs to formulate a monetary policy for the whole Community, designed to produce enough cash spending for the whole area but without financing resumed inflation. It was the lack of such a concerted policy which undermined both the ERM and wider attempts at G7 currency policy. But irrespective of exchange rates, a joint international stabilisation effort is itself a valid objective.</p>

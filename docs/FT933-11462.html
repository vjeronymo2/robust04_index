			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / This Is Your Life inspires Thames deal THAMES Television, the independent television production company that lost its ITV franchise, has struck a deal with the BBC worth more than Pounds 20m over three years. At the heart of the deal is This Is Your Life, a programme that started life at the BBC 38 years ago, moved to ITV and will now move back to the BBC in autumn 1994. The programme's simple formula is to take a celebrity by surprise, and tell his or her life story through friends and family. Thames, recently bought by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has been attracting audiences of 12m to 14m for the programme. But ITV said yesterday it felt unable to commit itself to the long-term deal that Thames was seeking. The production company is already selling Pounds 40m of programmes to ITV this year. 'ITV is keen to commission more programmes which appeal to young up-market viewers, as well as to its established audience,' said the ITV Network Centre. It is nudging its channel up-market at the very time that the BBC is rediscovering the need to appeal to a broad audience to protect its universally imposed licence fee. The Thames deal also involves developing new drama and comedy ideas for the BBC. Mr Alan Yentob, controller of BBC 1, said he was luring a number of top performers back from ITV in deals with independent producers. They include comedy stars Rowan Atkinson and Dave Allen. SelecTv, producers of the hit show Birds of a Feather, will be making a new comedy about a hen-pecked husband who finds romance when he enters a 1940s time warp.</p>

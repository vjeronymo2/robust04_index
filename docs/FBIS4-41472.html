			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 25 TASS -- A decision, announced by  Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Saturday, to resign  together with the entire cabinet "will not affect the  development of Russo-Japanese relations", a high-ranking staff  member of the Russian Foreign Ministry, who requested anonymity,  told ITAR-TASS on Saturday.    The current developments in the Japanese political life are  an internal affair of Japan and the choice of its people, the  diplomat said.    As far as Moscow's approach to relations with Japan is  concerned, the strategic policy line, determined on the strength  of the results of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to  Tokyo in October last year, towards large-scale development of  bilateral relations and intensification of the political  dialogue remains unchanged, he said.    The level of mutual understanding reached between the two  sides during the Russian leader's visit rendered the relations  between the two countries civilised, taking them out of the  category of sensations which were unnecessary at times, the  Russian Foreign Ministry staff member said. "We are prepared to  continue to maintain such a level of mutual understanding in  future as well," he added.    Upon mentioning that he has available so far only  preliminary  and conflicting information on the latest developments in  Japan's political life, the Russian diplomat did not rule out  the possibility that Mr Hata will retain the premiership in a  new government which the country, judging from everything, will  get next week.</p>

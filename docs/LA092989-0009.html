			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AND JAPAN STUCK IN THE MUD;  </P> <P> SQUABBLING OVER TRADE, THEY FAIL TO BUILD A VITAL COMPACT  </P> <P> The United States' relations with Japan are heading toward a postwar low.  Unless both countries act now, America's key alliance in the Pacific -- and  this vital economic partnership -- could come unglued. Nothing less than a new  U.S.-Japanese political compact will come to the rescue.  </P> <P> For many Americans, Japan is little more than a national engine of corporate  economic growth, unwilling to understand the needs of others as it seeks global  dominance in major industries. Yet viewed from Tokyo, this is a gross and  dangerous caricature. Indeed, too many U.S. observers reduce relations with  Japan to a single statistic -- the bilateral balance of trade -- and pay scant  attention to what unites the two countries. Often ignored are Japan's  democratic development, its Western economic system, its commitment to U.S.  strategic objectives and its penchant, as it becomes a cosmopolitan society,  for following the American lead, from the texture of its television to the  design of its products and the life style of its younger generation.  </P> <P> Most at issue today is a provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act that requires  Tokyo to permit much greater access for U.S. goods by next spring. These  demands, emanating from an angry Congress, have spawned a set of talks, the  Structural Impediments Initiative, or SII -- an unconscious mimicking of SDI,  the Strategic Defense Initiative. Yet, like "Star Wars," "car wars" is unlikely  to relieve the United States of its sense of vulnerability to the outside  world. Even if SII drags out of the Japanese government some limited benefits  for U.S. exporters -- most difficult because of Japan's domestic political  crisis -- the price will be paid in political relations.  </P> <P> Observers in Tokyo have been particularly disquieted by a U.S. public-opinion  poll that stipulated Japan, not the Soviet Union, to be the leading threat to  U.S. well-being. This subordination of the world's central conflict (however  muted) to mere economic competition (however vigorous) leads the Japanese to  wonder about U.S. priorities and purpose. Also disquieting has been a spate of  books by American authors whose common theme is that the United States must  increase its economic pressure on Japan. Not to be outdone in the Battle of the  Books, two leading Japanese -- one being the founder of Sony -- have responded  with harsh criticism of American business methods.  </P> <P> No doubt, there is much validity to U.S. criticism of the slow pace at which  Japan is liberalizing its trade practices. No doubt, the Japanese are right in  asserting that most of America's economic difficulties are home-grown. But most  striking is the fact that this squabble dominates almost totally each side's  current perceptions of the other.  </P> <P> Neither society has an adequate knowledge of the other, with the lack more  apparent in the United States. In particular, the United States has largely  left non-diplomatic relations with Japan to the academic specialists, the  economists, the bankers and the businessmen. Essentially uneducated about  modern Japan are the American media, the mainstream foreign policy and academic  elites, the average citizen east of California and political leaders --  especially members of Congress, only a handful of whom have visited Japan  during this critical year.  </P> <P> Nor has Japan done much better. American lobbyists for Japanese companies have  worn out their welcome on Capitol Hill, but rarely does a Japanese appear to  plead his own case (of necessity, in English) and thus inspire confidence, and  few Diet members know their American counterparts.  </P> <P> Japan also is poor at gaining credit where due; it is, for example, the leading  donor of foreign economic aid and provides most of the financial underpinning  for Filipino democracy -- facts that should be counted in comparing  contributions to the global good.  </P> <P> Most missing is a clear and articulated sense of political common interest.  Thus, while change in East-West relations is being celebrated, rarely mentioned  is the continuing need for the U.S. Seventh Fleet and Japanese Maritime  Self-Defense Force to keep watch over an undiminished Soviet Far East Fleet.  Nor is much said about the long-range value of maintaining naval power in the  region or of updating the U.S.-Japanese security relationship. If that were  done, Japan would likely stop increasing its defense spending before the point  of alarming some East Asian neighbors. Congress might accept that U.S. forces  are in Japan primarily to promote U.S. interests, and thus stop demanding that  Tokyo pick up the entire tab. And Japanese public opinion would better  understand the security provided by U.S. forces and thus have fewer doubts  about their presence.  </P> <P> A new U.S.-Japanese political agreement could be the basis for encouraging  Japan to translate its economic strength into a sense of responsibility for its  commercial actions and for the effective functioning of the global economic  system. There would be a bilateral framework for efforts by the two countries,  on their own and with others, to deal with worldwide concerns that are as much  political as economic -- from Third World debt to the environment. Japan could  be drawn more deeply into the management of East-West relations. And the United  States and other states would be more likely to accept greater Japanese  political weight in institutions such as the IMF and World Bank.  </P> <P> It will not be easy for Japan to develop a world view to complement its  economic prowess. Nor will it be easy for Americans to accept a major Japanese  role in the world -- even one based, happily and without precedent, on economic  rather than military might. Nevertheless, the U.S. and Japanese governments  must begin now, in clear view of both societies, to create a new political  compact. Only then can they put their trade dispute in perspective and thereby  avoid an error of historic proportions.  </P></p>

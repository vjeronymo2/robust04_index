			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> ORCHIDS, OTHER EXOTIC FLOWERS ON SALE TODAY  </P> <P> More than 170 species of orchids and other exotics will be featured at the Los  Angeles State and County Arboretum's Valentine plant sale in Arcadia today.  </P> <P> The arboretum holds many plant sales throughout the year, but this is the only  one to focus on orchids, many of which are just beginning their prime flowering  season. The sale plants come from three sources: surplus arboretum stock,  seedlings grown in the arboretum's glasshouses especially for this sale and  commercial suppliers.  </P> <P> Among the most plentiful will be cymbidiums, the best of all orchids for  outside cultivation in Southern California. Moth orchids (Phalaenopsis) and  lady slipper (Paphiopedilum) species will also be well represented at the sale,  along with corsage orchids (Cattleyas). The frilly cattleyas, ranging from  delicate white to golden orange and regal purple, are usually snapped up early  in the sale by orchidists adding to their glasshouse collections.  </P> <P> In fact, many of the more unusual species will disappear soon after the gates  open at 9 a.m. Get there early for the best selection. Most orchids are priced  in the $5-to-$35 range, although a few exceptionally fine specimens may be  priced as high as $150.  </P> <P> Earl Ross, curator of orchids, reports that the arboretum is growing more and  more exotic plants from seed to reduce wild-plant collecting, a serious  horticultural problem today. He expects to have a large number of Stanhopea  orchid species ready for the sale. Planted in hanging baskets, they bear waxy,  fragrant blooms on scapes extending from the bottom of the basket. Stanhopeas  can be grown outside in a protected area.  </P> <P>  For cultivation indoors, Ross recommends moth orchids, currently among the  trendiest of flowering house plants. In garden windows on the north side of the  house, moth orchids thrive and bloom for four to six weeks, usually beginning  in February. When the first bloom ends, Ross suggests breaking off the flower  spike at the second node. This encourages a second set of blooms to appear  about 90 days later.  </P> <P> Probably the biggest complaint with orchids, Ross says, is lack of bloom. Why  do they stop blooming? Almost always, the reason is insufficient light. Most  orchids require a full day of filtered light. The glasshouse at the arboretum  is covered with shade cloth during the hours when the sun is strongest. But at  2 in the afternoon, the shade cloth rolls back and is not returned until 9 the  next morning.  </P> <P> This means the orchids receive full sun in the late afternoon and early  morning. Of course, the light is refracted from the high glass overhead, but  the orchids still are basking in a healthy dose of sunshine each day.  </P> <P> Moth and lady slipper orchids require somewhat less light than do the cattleyas  and cymbidiums.  </P> <P> In addition to orchids, visitors to the Valentine plant sale will find exotic  heliconias. These tropical blooms look like colorful lobster claws, and  florists are beginning to rely upon them heavily for long-lasting, stunning  arrangements. Other tropical plants available at the sale are aromatic gingers,  pearl anthuriums, frangipani, jasmine "Pikake," and variegated hibiscus.  </P> <P> Although orchids and tropical plants are the primary focus of the Valentine  sale, the arboretum also will sell an assortment of organic herbs (grown  without chemical sprays). These include onion and garlic chives, golden thyme,  lemon thyme, spearmint, applemint, peppermint, pineapple mint and pineapple  sage. More herbs for the kitchen are marjoram, Green oregano, Italian oregano,  Mexican oregano, rosemary, tricolor sage, sorrel and tarragon. These herbs are  potted in 1- and 5-gallon containers, thus producing instant herb gardens.  </P> <P> Visitors to the Valentine plant sale will also find beautiful blooms and  flowering trees on the arboretum grounds. Spring pansies, primroses and poppies  are ablaze with color, and many of the magnolias, camellias and azaleas are  beginning to bloom.  </P> <P> But the most spectacular show at the entire arboretum at this time of the year  is inside the tropical display greenhouse. Here the best of the blooming  orchids and other flowering plants from all arboretum glasshouses are displayed  against a backdrop of huge ferns, running brooks and tropical trees dripping  with live moss. To see orchids at their best, don't miss the tropical  greenhouse.  </P> <P> Experts will be on hand to answer questions about how to grow exotic plants.  The Valentine sale runs from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. in Ayres Hall.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles State and County Arboretum is at 301 N. Baldwin Ave., Arcadia.  Admission to the sale is included in the arboretum entrance fee of $3 for  adults; admission is $1.50 for senior citizens, students with ID and youths 13  to 17. The fee for children 5 to 12 is 75 cents. Children under 5 are admitted  free.  </P></p>

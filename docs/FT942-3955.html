			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / W Europe new car sales up 13% in May West European new car sales rose by 13.4 per cent to an estimated 1.099m last month, the biggest monthly increase this year and the strongest indication to date that demand is recovering from last year's deep recession. Sales have been higher than a year ago in four of the last five months, and in May alone demand rose year-on-year in 16 of 17 markets in west Europe. In the first five months of 1994 new car demand was higher than a year ago in 11 of the 17 markets. According to industry estimates, new car sales in the first five months have risen by 5.5 per cent to 5.4m from 5.14m in the corresponding period a year ago. Sales in the whole of 1993 fell by 15.2 per cent to 11.45m, the steepest decline since the war. The recovery during the first five months has been led by the UK, France and Spain and by sharply rising sales in several smaller markets including the Netherlands, Scandinavia and Ireland. Sales were still lower than a year ago in Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Greece and Portugal, but with the exception of Austria sales also began to recover in these markets in May. In Germany, the biggest single market in Europe, new car sales are estimated to have risen in May by 6.5 per cent year-on-year to 300,000, while new car sales in Italy increased by 7.5 per cent to 179,000. New car sales in France and Spain, where demand has been stimulated by government financial incentives to encourage the scrapping of cars 10 or more years old, rose sharply year-on-year in May by 26.2 and 31.6 per cent respectively. The rate of growth in the UK, which slowed in April under the impact of tax increases, recovered in May with a rise year-on-year of 10 per cent. Japanese carmakers, struggling to maintain competitive prices under the impact of the strong appreciation of the yen, have failed so far to take part in the recovery and have suffered an estimated 6.5 per cent decline in sales during the first five months to 596,000. The share taken by Japanese car producers has fallen to 11 per cent from 12.4 per cent in the same period a year ago. Only Honda among eight Japanese carmakers in the west European market has managed to increase its sales this year, and the producers hardest hit are those without mainstream car production in west Europe, such as Mazda, Mitsubishi and Daihatsu. Suzuki's four-wheel-drive vehicle plant in Spain has been closed for much of this year by industrial conflict. Among the big six volume carmakers in west Europe, the Volkswagen and Fiat groups have continued to lose ground. The German group's leading brands, Volkswagen and Audi, have seen sales volume fall this year, offset by sharp rises at Seat and Skoda, its Spanish and Czech subsidiaries. The Fiat group, which has been hit in particular by the recession in the Italian market, is being undermined by the weakness of its Lancia and Alfa Romeo brands, where sales have declined by 6 and 12 per cent respectively.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                             January-May 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Volume      Volume     Share (%)    Share (%)                          (Units)    Change (%)   Jan-May 94  Jan-May 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET            5,425,000      +5.5        100.0        100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen group          889,000      +1.5         16.4         17.0  -Volkswagen              581,000      -1.6         10.7         11.5  -Seat                    142,000     +20.8          2.6          2.3  -Audi                    140,000      -4.2          2.6          2.8  -Skoda*                   25,000     +20.6          0.5          0.4 General Motors****        695,000      +6.3         12.8         12.7  -Opel/Vauxhall           666,000      +5.6         12.3         12.3  -Saab**                   23,000     +32.3          0.4          0.3 PSA Peugeot Citroen       685,000     +13.5         12.6         11.7  -Peugeot                 411,000     +11.0          7.6          7.2  -Citroen                 274,000     +17.3          5.1          4.5 Ford****                  643,000      +7.5         11.8         11.6  -Ford Europe             637,000      +7.4         11.7         11.5  -Jaguar                    5,000      +5.3          0.1          0.1 Fiat group*****           623,000      +2.6         11.5         11.8  -Fiat                    483,000      +6.2          8.9          8.8  -Lancia                   82,000      -6.4          1.5          1.7  -Alfa Romeo               53,000     -11.9          1.0          1.2 Renault                   575,000      +7.1         10.6         10.4 BMW group***              332,000      +5.9          6.1          6.1  -BMW***                  167,000      -0.8          3.1          3.3  -Rover***                165,000     +13.6          3.1          2.8 Mercedes-Benz             189,000     +38.8          3.5          2.7 Nissan                    177,000      -1.4          3.3          3.5 Toyota                    140,000      -4.0          2.6          2.8 Volvo                      91,000     +23.9          1.7          1.4 Mazda                      85,000     -11.0          1.6          1.9 Honda***                   71,000      +5.2          1.3          1.3 Mitsubishi                 54,000     -17.9          1.0          1.3 Suzuki                     38,000     -19.4          0.7          0.9 Total Japanese            596,000      -6.5         11.0         12.4 MARKETS: Germany                 1,455,000      -0.6         26.8         28.4 Italy                     887,000      -4.3         16.3         18.0 United Kingdom            822,000     +13.3         15.1         14.1 France                    803,000     +16.0         14.8         13.5 Spain                     359,000     +17.5          6.6          5.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda. ****Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe. **GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile. *****Fiat group includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti, Ferrari and Maserati. ***BMW owns 80 per cent of Rover group and is to acquire the remaining 20 per cent from Honda.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: industry estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Stronger retail sales lift recovery hopes BETTER than expected retail sales statistics yesterday lifted hopes for an end to the recession and re-opened the debate about whether the government should raise taxes this year. Retail sales volumes increased by 1.6 per cent last month compared with December, and by 2.3 per cent on the previous January in the biggest annual rise for nearly four years. The latest figures were released as it emerged that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is coming under conflicting pressures over raising taxes to cut the government's growing budget deficit. Mr Lamont will be cautioned by cabinet colleagues this morning not to risk aborting economic recovery by introducing large tax increases in his March 16 budget. But it also emerged that the Treasury is coming under pressure from officials at the Washington-based International Monetary Fund to raise taxes in order to cut the rising gap between government receipts and spending. The public sector borrowing requirement is expected to rise to about Pounds 37bn in 1992-93 from Pounds 13.7bn in 1991-92. The Treasury indicated last night that the deficit would be reduced as the economy recovered, and noted that underlying inflation was within the target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent. However, the cabinet's traditional review of the background to the budget will see the chancellor warn that the sharp deterioration in public finances may force some increase in taxation in one of his two budgets this year. That view is thought to be shared by a number of leading cabinet figures including Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary. Many are convinced that Mr Lamont will have no alternative but to extend VAT to goods and services which are at present zero-rated. But a majority of senior ministers are thought to favour delaying significant changes until the second budget in December even if Mr Lamont decides to 'flag' them next month. Despite the relatively upbeat tone of the latest retail figures, sterling fell last night to a new closing low in London against the D-Mark. The pound slipped against the German currency on the back of expectations about a further cut in UK interest rates, even though Mr Lamont told journalists he had no reductions in mind. Sterling dropped 1 1/4 pfennigs against a stronger D-Mark to a London close of DM2.35 and eased to DM2.3489 in New York. Against the dollar, the pound slipped by a third of a cent to Dollars 1.4440, but gained to Dollars 1.4455 in New York. Mr Lamont welcomed the retail sales figures as 'extremely encouraging' and said interest rates were 'at a suitable level' to keep inflation down and were also consistent with recovery. The seasonally adjusted retail figures from the Central Statistical Office indicate that retailers, helped by heavy discounting, have bounced back in recent weeks after a disappointing December in which sales volumes dropped a revised 1 per cent on the previous month. In the three months to the end of January, sales volumes were up 1.4 per cent on the same period a year previously. But underlining the patchy nature of the recent trends in the sector, sales volumes in the three months to January 31 were up by a modest 0.2 per cent compared with the previous three months, significantly less than the quarterly rises seen around the middle of last year. In the three months to January 31 compared with the previous three months, food retailers saw sales volumes rise by 1.7 per cent while shops selling a mixture of food and other goods reported a 2.2 per cent rise. Stores selling clothes, shoes and household goods experienced sales drops of 2.5 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively over the same period.

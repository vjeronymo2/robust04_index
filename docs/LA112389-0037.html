			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KID BEAT: 'BLAST OFF!' REACHES FOR THE STARS AT THEATRE WEST  </P> <P> "Blast Off! A Musical Mission to Mars" is a definite hit with theatergoers 6  and younger, but one message it sends out is thoughtlessly pre-glasnost.  </P> <P> This well-meaning Storybook Theatre production at Theatre West, staged by Lloyd  J. Schwartz (he also wrote the book and lyrics), features audience  participation, perky music by Ben Lanzarone and does make a valid point:  "Different is OK."  </P> <P> The uncredited set design is spare -- just a few geometric shapes and a  cartoonish painted rocket ship that opens up.  </P> <P> American astronaut Tom (Joe Lucas) and Soviet cosmonaut Ivana (Catherine  MacNeal) decide to make a joint flight to Mars, accompanied by a robot called  MT1 (Nadine Kalmes) and unintentional guest Mrs. Seltzer (Barbara Mallory  Schwartz).  </P> <P> "Dolling, I can't go to Mars. I've got the girls coming over!," she protests.  In fussy coat and squashy hat, nervously clutching her purse, Mallory Schwartz  is a sketch.  </P> <P> The audience continually gets in the act. They're the "crew" on a bumpy space  ride, dodging meteors and coming in for a landing.  </P> <P> On Mars, a furry space creature (Janice Ehrlich) invites a dozen children on  stage to teach them the Jupiter Jump. The seated audience bounces along.  </P> <P> The professional cast handles all the participation comfortably. That ease is  the show's best quality.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Lucas' stalwart Tom complements the zaniness around him, while  Kalmes is an especially appealing robot (Rosetta Gitlin did the show's crisp  choreography).  </P> <P> But there's a hitch: MacNeal is required to offer the usual aggressive Soviet  stereotype -- she wants to zap the space creature on sight, her dialogue is  cluttered with words ending in ski and she says thank you in English, because,  she explains, Soviets don't like to say it.  </P> <P> It's the clinker in an otherwise pleasant hour.  </P> <P>  At 3333 Cahuenga Blvd. West in Hollywood through Dec. 9, Saturdays at 1 p.m.,  (818) 761-2203; $5.  </P></p>

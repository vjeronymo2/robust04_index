Saiget] </F>   [Text] Beijing, March 19 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa arrived in Beijing Saturday [19 March]  afternoon and immediately began a sightseeing trip that took him  on a subway ride and to a free market.    After being met at the airport by State Planning Commission  Minister Chen Jinhua and Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, the  prime minister was whisked away to the Diaoyutai State  Guesthouse.    His populist tour of Beijing began almost immediately with a  ride on the newest section of Beijing's subway, taking him from  Fuxingmen station in the western district to the busy market  area of Xidan near the city center.    Subway officials eagerly answered Hosokawa's questions as an  empty train rolled into the station for the small entourage.    Security was tight at both stations, and remained so the  rest  of the afternoon as Chinese police made sure that no unruly  incidents took place in front of the Japanese premier.    Crowds appeared curious along the entire route and didn't  seem to be bothered by traffic inconveniences caused by the  Hosokawa entourage.    Leaving Xidan, Hosokawa returned to the motorcade and was  taken to Tiananmen Square where he climbed the rostrum  overlooking the square and stood on the spot where Mao Zedong  declared the beginning of the People's Republic of China in 1949.    After touring the Palace Museum, residence of the Yuan, Ming  and Qing dynasties, Hosokawa retook his populist posturing while  visiting a crowded northern Beijing free market.    While making inquiries into a variety of goods, including  several varieties of rice and Chinese herbs and spices, his wife  Kayoko Hosokawa purchased small quantities of black rice and  some Chinese herbs.    Commenting on the large variety of foodstuffs, the prime  minister lingered longest around stands selling soft-shelled  tortoises, asking sellers about the taste and price.    Before leaving he stopped by a fruit stand and was offered a  large watermelon, which he gladly accepted as the crowd of  onlookers applauded.    During his sightseeing tour, there was no sign of activists  demanding war compensation from Japan. More than a hundred such  activists were rounded up Thursday and Friday before the visit.    Saturday evening, Chinese Premier Li Peng held a welcome  banquet for Hosokawa in the Great Hall of the People.    The premier is expected to meet with President Jiang Zemin,  Li and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji on Sunday.</p>

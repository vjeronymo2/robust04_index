Brazil will pave 200 km  of the highway linking Boa Vista with Santa Elena de Uairen.  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Venezuela could  cooperate by supplying the asphalt.    -- The electric sector: Brazil will purchase energy from  Venezuela and will build the transmission lines. Interim Mines  and Energy Minister Jose Israel Vargas said the idea is to get  electricity for Manaus from the Guri electric plant. He also  said discussions are being held for an exchange between Guri and  the Balbina hydroelectric plant, because the two countries have  weather problems.    -- The hydrographic sector: study the possibility of  navigation between the Orinoco and Amazon river basins.  President Franco said during a news conference that he  discussed with President Caldera the interconnection of the  Orinoco and Amazon river basins, which have an extension of  approximately 11,000 km. The studies began in 1943. Franco  said that what the two governments have in mind is to continue  the studies with the objective of "reaching the River Plate  basin."    -- The mineral sector: The two governments will study the  possibility of carrying out compatible joint projects regarding  sustainable development and the protection of the indigenous  communities. The cooperation agreement signed in 1991 between  the Rio Doce Valley Company (CVRD) and the Venezuelan  Corporation of Guayana (CVG) will be useful for the development  of such projects. Israel Vargas commented that the two countries  are studying the possibility of using manganese from Carajas in  Venezuelan electric furnaces. The objective is to produce iron  alloys for the Venezuelan steel industry. He also reported that  studies are being made for joint gold prospecting, to develop  the border regions and employ gold prospectors in legal and  orderly activities.    -- The environmental sector: joint development of ecological  tourism, scientific research on biodiversity, and cooperation  for recovering the deteriorated areas caused by illegal mining.  The illegal activities in the border regions were mentioned in  the joint communique signed by the two presidents. It says:  "The presidents agreed on the need to fight any illegal  activities on their common border with determination. With that  objective they commit themselves to the reinforcement of  appropriate measures for the eradication of illegal mineral  prospecting in the border zones, and to carry out an effective  control over the use of equipment and other components used in  prospecting that contribute to the depredation and contamination  of the environment."    Bolivar State Governor Andres Velasco of the Radical Cause,  a  leftist party that came out third in last year's presidential  elections, said: "The Brazilian Government must reverse its  position regarding the gold prospectors." He also said the gold  prospectors are involved in drug trafficking. He added: "It is  possible they are also being used by the multinationals as  spearheads for mineral prospecting."    -- The Sivam [Amazon Region Surveillance System] project:  The Venezuelan Government is studying Brazilian participation  in carrying out ecological-economic zoning.    -- The hemispheric summit: The two presidents expressed  their hopes for the upcoming summit, to be held in the United  States this year. The two countries will make joint efforts to  have the agenda reflect an effective hemispheric consensus.    -- Economic complementation agreement: The two governments  will expedite negotiations for reaching an agreement within the  framework of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI).  "Such an agreement could also include, in addition to the  reduction of trade barriers, incentive measures for border  trade, for promoting investment protection, for facilitating the  trade of services, for protecting intellectual property, and  regulations for preventing unfair competition and access to  public biddings."</p>

The technological assistance is intended to promote the gas  turbine market in the country where natural gas is abundant. The  gas turbine is superior to the diesel turbine in terms of  environmental factors and thermoelectric effects. Kawasaki Heavy  Industries has decided to provide this technological assistance  since interest in gas turbines, which create less pollution, has  been increasing.    The assembly and maintenance technologics for the gas  turbine  will be provided to BARATA and IPTN, a government-owned aircraft  and engine manufacturer based in Bandon.    In August, Kawasaki Heavy Industries received an order for  an  emergency gas turbine power generation facility for the  Indonesian Science and Technology Agency's new building. The  facility consists of four gas turbines with an output of 1,500  kilowatts at a price of slightly less than &yen;400 million.  Kawasaki Heavy Industries will commission the assembly and  maintenance of the power generation facility to BARATA and IPTN  as the initial project. The main parts of the facility will be  exported from Japan by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The facility  is scheduled to be completed by the end of March 1994.    Kawasaki Heavy Industries has begun to expand its sales  activities for the current fiscal year by increasing the number  of sales representatives in Indonesia and Malaysia, which are  rich in natural gas for use as gas turbine fuel. Although the  same technologies have also been provided to Malaysia, Indonesia  is the first country where technological assistance is being  provided along with the receipt of an order. This will make  seven cases of technological assistance in six nations, i.e.,  Germany, Canada, the United States, and Italy, in addition to  the above two countries. Although the majority of demand for gas  turbines is in Japan, the company expects that Asia will  represent a growing market in the future due to its  industrialization.    The demand for gas turbines is increasing in Japan due to  such advantages as low noise, low vibration, compact design and  the low level of soot and dust. Kawasaki Heavy Industries has  set the FY93 sales target at &yen;26 billion, an increase of 13  percent over the previous fiscal year. The company holds  approximately 50 percent of the world market for small gas  turbines with outputs of under 10,000 kilowatts.</p>

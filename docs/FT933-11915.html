			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Improvement at Cummins disappoints Wall Street CUMMINS Engine, the world's largest independent manufacturer of diesel engines, yesterday disappointed Wall Street with its second-quarter results and the outlook for the third quarter. This was in spite of a substantial improvement in earnings. For the three months to July 4, the company earned Dollars 48.2m, or Dollars 2.65 a primary share, compared with profits of Dollars 18.8m, or Dollars 1, a year earlier. Sales grew to Dollars 1.09bn from Dollars 948.1m. Cummins is benefiting from improving markets as the US claws its way out of recession. It said second-quarter sales were higher than in the first quarter in most of its important markets, including engines for North American heavy-duty and medium-duty trucks and for industrial equipment. On the other hand, sales of engines for light commercial vehicles fell in the quarter, and the company was also hurt by weakness in several international markets, especially Mexico. Cummins said it expected third-quarter earnings and sales to trail earnings and sales in the first two quarters of 1993. Sales to Chrysler are expected to fall sharply in the third quarter due to the changeover to the new T300 Series Dodge Ram. Sales to some international markets are expected to remain weak, and third-quarter results are seasonally-affected by holiday shutdowns by Cummins and its biggest customers. The outlook disappointed investors, who have been bullish about the company since April, when Cummins unveiled a strong improvement in earnings and forecast even better second-quarter profits. On Wall Street, shares in Cummins tumbled Dollars 4 to Dollars 85 at mid-session. Most analysts had expected earnings of Dollars 2.68 a share in the latest quarter. For the first half of 1993, the group earned Dollars 89.3m, or Dollars 4.87, compared with a deficit of Dollars 227.3m, or Dollars 14.69. Stripping out the impact of a Dollars 251.1m charge for accounting changes in the first six months of 1992, Cummins earned Dollars 23.8m, or Dollars 1.25 last year. Sales advanced to Dollars 2.14bn from Dollars 1.83bn.</p>

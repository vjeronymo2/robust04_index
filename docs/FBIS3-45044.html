The base is located in the Great Badain Jaran Desert. More  than 60 grass-roots units are scattered along the 22 small  settlements in the 4,870 square km desert. People call the base  "the isolated islet" because of its extremely difficult living  conditions. [passage omitted on efforts to improve the living  conditions]    More than 500 college graduates have been assigned to the  base in recent years. Some 85 percent of them have become  professional technical backbone elements, over 90 percent have  performed meritorious service, and nearly 100 of them have been  rated as outstanding intellectuals or outstanding scientific and  technological cadres. In scientific research and experiment,  the base has set the highest records in the number of guided  missiles launched on a single day, in a single month, and in a  single year. It is also the first base in China to successfully  complete a multi-targeting, minimum-altitude missile launching.  It accomplished more than 100 scientific research and  experimental tasks with flying colors. Six of the scientific  research projects filled in the gaps in China's scientific and  technological field, and dozens of research results received  state or military science and technology progress awards.</p>

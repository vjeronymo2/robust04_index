			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Paying up for Maxwell victims MORE THAN six months after Mr Robert Maxwell went missing from his yacht off the Canary Islands, pension scheme members in his business empire are still uncertain as to their future pension prospects. The government has shown little inclination to do more than pass the buck. The official bodies of the normally vociferous pensions lobby have maintained a studied silence. Banks that backed Mr Maxwell on his breakneck expansion in the 1980s persist in clinging, poker-faced, to stolen assets as security for their ill-judged loans. The debate over compensation for present and future pensioners has become bogged down in irrelevant detail. This relegation of the pensioners' interests to a residual consideration in the winding up of the Maxwell finances is altogether unseemly. For while Mr Maxwell bears primary responsibility, the scandal is also the product of an overwhelming failure of the British system of pension provision. So far the government has offered the Maxwell pensioners no more than the equivalent of the minimum pension under the state scheme. That is a derisory sum, which reflects the failure of successive governments to establish an adequate state pension plan in the 1960s and 1970s. If a third-best scheme was adopted by the last Labour government, it was largely on the basis that anything was better than continuing prevarication. Meantime the occupational pensions sector flourished, faute de mieux, with the support of substantial tax breaks. More generous A Maxwell-type scandal in Germany, France or even Italy would have been inconceivable precisely because greater security is provided by more generous state pension schemes. That is not to say that it is unreasonable for any government to tilt the balance further in the direction of the private sector. There may well be legitimate reasons, such as the impact of demography on public finances, to do so. But if politicians choose to go down that route, it is incumbent on them to provide a regulatory structure to compensate for the increased risk that legitimate pension expectations will be frustrated. This British politicians have conspicuously failed to do. The Wilson Committee, Professor Gower's review of investor protection, the City Capital Markets Committee, numerous press commentators - all, over the years, warned of the inadequacy of regulation and the need for legislation to protect pension fund beneficiaries. The response of the Department of Social Security and other interested Whitehall departments was supine. That insouciant attitude was reflected in the 1986 Financial Services Act, which confined itself purely to the narrower aspects of pensions investment management. Pensioners were, in effect, excluded from the compensation schemes set up under the new framework. Collective responsibility The regulatory debate now concentrates largely on the question of whether the Department of Trade and Industry was right to grant a licence to London and Bishopsgate International, the Maxwell fund management group, just before the 1986 Act took effect and the extent to which the fund management watchdog IMRO was at fault. These are important matters on which a forthcoming report from the Securities and Investments Board will no doubt throw light. But the real issue is Whitehall's collective responsibility for failing to introduce adequate regulation in the first place. The government is understandably worried about setting a precedent with the Maxwell pensioners and other victims of theft or fraud. Yet a precedent has already been set at Barlow Clowes. The case of the Maxwell pensioners is invidious by comparison: most were coerced into their funds as a condition of employment. The government might reasonably twist the arms of the pensions lobby, many of whose leaders opposed regulatory change, for a contribution via whatever form of compensation scheme finally emerges. Conscience money should also be extracted from the banks. But it is for the government to take the initiative to make good the estimated Pounds 400m loss. It should get off the fence and make a firm commitment to compensate these victims of theft and fraud forthwith.</p>

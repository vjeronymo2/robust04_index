			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, 31 May -- The allegations being circulated  by some parties that Russia is supplying arms and military  equipment to Yemen are wholly unsubstantiated, Grigoriy Karasin,  director of the Press and Information Department of the Russian  Federation Foreign Ministry, told a news conference today. "The  Russian Federation is not supplying the Yemenis with  special-purpose equipment, either directly or through a third  country", he stressed.    The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that even last  year, long before the armed conflict began, Russia decided to  halt supplies of arms and military equipment to Yemen following  the exacerbation of intra-Yemeni discord. Russia did this on  the grounds that supplying weapons to warring parties  contradicts its principled approach, which aims to achieve the  earliest possible settlement of the conflict by political  methods. Grigoriy Karasin pointed out that the Russian Foreign  Ministry is taking this line in contacts with both states and is  encouraging them to act in the same way.</p>

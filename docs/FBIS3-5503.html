The dispatch is in line with a request from U.N. Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali made late February to send Japanese  personnel to monitor the March 20 presidential and parliamentary  elections, the officials said.    A peace agreement was signed in January 1992 after a  decade-long "proxy war" in El Salvador between the right-wing  government, backed by the United States, and leftist guerrillas,  supported by the former Soviet Union.    In a meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Tokyo  last November, El Salvador's President Alfredo Felix Christiani  asked Japan to send voting monitors for the elections.    The 15-member Japanese team, comprising three from the  Foreign Ministry, one from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and  11 from the private sector, will join a 900-member U.N. unit to  oversee the polls in the Central American country.    All the Japanese members are proficient in speaking Spanish,  the officials said.    The Japanese team is scheduled to work in El Salvador until  March 31, but its stay may be extended until May 10 if no  candidate wins a majority of votes to become president and vice  president and a reelection is called to pick the two top leaders  of the nation.    El Salvador will be the third country to which Japan sends  election observers in accordance with the U.N. Peacekeeping  Cooperation Law, following Angola and Cambodia.    The 1992 law stipulates that to send election monitors  overseas the government must confirm three necessary conditions  -- a declared cease-fire, agreements by parties concerned to  accept such personnel and assured neutrality in the country.</p>

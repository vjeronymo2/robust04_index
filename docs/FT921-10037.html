			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Two US airlines register improvement TWO leading US airlines yesterday reported improved figures for both the fourth quarter of 1991 and the latest 12-month period, although they both remained heavily in the red for 1991 overall. Northwest Airlines, the fourth largest carrier in which KLM Royal Dutch Airlines holds a stake, saw the after-tax loss in the fourth quarter shrink from Dollars 121.4m a year ago, to Dollars 79.2m. This was scored on operating revenues up by 3.7 per cent at Dollars 1.89bn, and a pre-tax loss which fell from Dollars 188.6m to Dollars 122.3m. The passenger yield, however, fell from 12.80 cents to 11.97, and comparisons with the fourth quarter of 1990 are muddied by the impact which higher fuel prices - in the wake of the Kuwait invasion - were having on airline profits worldwide. For 1991 overall, Northwest made a net loss of Dollars 3.1m compared with a Dollars 10.4m deficit a year earlier. Northwest's parent company, the privately held NWA, lost Dollars 316.9m during the year, compared with Dollars 301.2m in 1990. The slightly worse figure at the parent company level reflects lease and interest costs and results from non-airline subsidiaries. At Continental Airlines, the fifth biggest carrier, there was a small fourth-quarter profit of Dollars 10.2m against a net deficit of Dollars 1.3bn a year earlier. For the year overall, the airline made net losses of Dollars 340.9m, against a Dollars 1.2bn deficit in 1990. Its parent company, Continental Airlines Holdings, reported a net profit of Dollars 4.41m in the fourth quarter and a Dollars 305.7m deficit for the year. The company has been in bankruptcy since late-1990, but filed a reorganisation plan earlier this week. It claimed yesterday that results for the last month of the year had been better than in any December since 1986 and that the 'positive trend which we are seeing is encouraging'.</p>

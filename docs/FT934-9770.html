			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Reduced interest charge lifts Prowting to Pounds 0.5m PRE-TAX profits of Prowting, the Middlesex-based housebuilder which nine weeks ago acquired Galliford Homes for Pounds 22.6m, jumped from Pounds 120,000 to Pounds 520,000 during the six months to the end of August. The first half improvement was due mainly to reduced interest payments which fell from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 1.01m. Operating profits by comparison declined from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 1.5m as gross margins came under pressure following house price falls when sterling left the exchange rate mechanism. House prices have since stabilised and Prowting expects margins to improve further as house builders ease back on sales incentives and volume sales of houses increase. Mr Terry Roydon, chief executive, said that the acquisition of Galliford would have a positive impact on Prowting's earnings in the first year. He said the combined businesses should sell 650 to 700 homes this year, equivalent to 900 to 1,000 homes in a full 12 months. During the first six months of this year, without the benefit of Galliford, sales had risen by only 11 from 154 to 165. 'We are delighted with the Galliford purchase which will increase the number of sales outlets and enable us to take full advantage of our existing land holdings,' Mr Roydon said. He added that the group currently held 6,200 plots available for development at an average cost of just Pounds 10,700. Sales of 1,000 homes a year would still leave the group with a six-year land bank. Mr Roydon said that after slowing in September, house sales had accelerated in October. He appealed to the Chancellor to do nothing in the Budget to upset the fragile returning confidence of prospective house buyers. The positive cash flow from housebuilding had enabled the group to reduce net borrowings from Pounds 20.1m to Pounds 6m at the end of August. Following the purchase of Galliford net debt had risen to Pounds 30.8m, equivalent to 44 per cent of shareholders' funds of the merged businesses. The interim dividend is being maintained at 1.7p from earnings of 0.3p (losses 0.3p) per share. For the full year analysts are expecting the group to make profits of Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 4m compared with a previous deficit of Pounds 4.93m. The return to the black would provide sufficient earnings to cover a forecast maintained final dividend of 1.7p. Prowting shares, of which the Prowting family holds 61 per, slipped 3p to 145p yesterday.</p>

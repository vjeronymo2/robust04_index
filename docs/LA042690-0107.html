			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: CUDAHY;  </P> <P> ACTING MANAGER WEATHERS CONFLICTS, GETS 2-YEAR PACT  </P> <P> The Cudahy City Council has unanimously voted to hire acting City Manager Jack  Joseph as city manager.  </P> <P> Joseph, 41, who had served as acting city manager since September, was also  hired as city clerk at last Friday's special meeting.  </P> <P> In Cudahy, the city manager traditionally holds the clerk's job as well.  </P> <P> As acting city manager, Joseph often was caught in the middle of struggles  among the old council, which was sharply divided by persistent personal and  political conflicts. Those battles came to a head shortly before the April 10  election when Councilman John Robertson and defeated Councilman Wilfred Colon,  together with several unsuccessful candidates, signed a complaint which was  mailed to the district attorney's office and the state Fair Political Practices  Commission, alleging that Joseph was involved in illegal election activities  ranging from misusing his office to run the successful reelection campaign of  Mayor Joseph Graffio to tampering with absentee ballots. Joseph has denied the  charges.  </P> <P> Joseph was awarded a two-year contract for $69,300 the first year. The second  year will be negotiated in 1991.  </P></p>

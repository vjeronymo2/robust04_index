			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> GREAT PANCAKES? A HOT CAKE LOVER WILL FLIP OVER THESE  </P> <P> One friend of mine has been talking about the German pancake at Walker Brothers  in Chicago for as long as I've known him. Another been bragging about Polly's  Pancake Parlor in Sugar Hill, N.H., for more than 20 years.  </P> <P> It is with some satisfaction that I can tell you I've finally found a place  that shut these guys up for a whole morning.  </P> <P> A pancake lover will be sorely tempted to call the Original Pancake House in  Anaheim the best restaurant in Orange County. Yes, it's a chain restaurant, but  yes, it's that good.  </P> <P> Of course, the Original Pancake House is not to be confused with the much  larger International House of Pancakes chain. But maybe the Anaheim OPH has an  additional secret of success: It's totally a family operation. Owned and  managed by its former chef, Ron Voll, along with his wife, Nancy, its current  chefs are their sons Adam and Gary, and you won't find more experienced pancake  chefs between here and Portland, where the Original Pancake House chain  started. Or between here and Tierra del Fuego, for that matter.  </P> <P> The restaurant itself is modest, just a woodsy-looking coffee shop with  cherrywood paneling and coffee-colored vinyl booths. It's set back slightly  from the street, so look for a rather dilapidated sign depicting a smiling chef  in a baker's hat, partially hidden behind a tall tree. If this doesn't work,  keep your eye out for an auto parts store; it's right next door.  </P> <P> During the week you'll see the regulars, a colorful crowd of truckers, seniors  and secretaries. Weekends, it's a big favorite with families. There's standing  room only in the lobby as people wait for tables.  </P> <P> Why do they wait? The pancakes served here are anything but modest, every one  made from special batters infused with sourdough yeast. These are the pancakes  great-grandma used to make: light, finely textured, complex. There are about 30  varieties to choose from.  </P> <P> Tops on my list would definitely be the apple pancake, simply the best pancake  dish I have ever eaten. It's a giant, golden puff the size of a small pie, with  a crunchy cinnamon glaze topping half an inch thick and a pile of freshly cut  apples glistening in the center. It positively drools butter. This is the one  that silenced my friend with the Chicago fixation.  </P> <P> Second place would be the Belgian waffle, available plain or with various berry  toppings. Eggy, crisp and golden brown, this is one of the most perfect waffles  I have ever tasted. The batter is whipped until thoroughly aerated, giving a  sensuous crunch to every bite. Try it plain. Putting fruit on it is like  putting ice in champagne.  </P> <P> Actually, most of the customers seemed to be eating either the German pancake  and its smaller cousin, the Dutch baby, probably because they are lighter and  more digestible than most of the other dishes. They look like golden sombreros,  edges burnt from baking in an extra-hot oven. The tops are dusted with powdered  sugar and doused with fresh lemon juice and butter. Don't let them cool down,  because they deflate like an overcooked souffle.  </P> <P> For purists there are classic buttermilk pancakes, puffy and springy with a  pleasant sour aftertaste. You can get three of them with any of the menu's  first-rate egg dishes. I recommend the buttery, golden brown ham-and-cheese  omelet (served pancake style, natch).  </P> <P> But why limit yourself to the familiar? A host of eccentric offerings are  available. "Palestine pancakes" are rolled crepes laced with a runny sour cream  sauce faintly tinged with Cointreau. Or how about cherry Kijafa crepes, a still  lighter crepe which the menu describes as stuffed with "luscious, blushing  cherries simmered in liqueur"?  </P> <P> The list goes on and on. Swedish pancakes, so thin you can see right through  them, served with a heaping bowl of lingonberry preserves. Hawaiian pancakes  with pineapple-based "tropical syrup."  </P> <P> Is the Original Pancake House perfect? Well, no. The buckwheats I got were on  the doughy side, and all the pancakes come with a big gob of whipped butter  that tends to melt into a big puddle. And the ham and bacon is forgettable,  even if they do prepare a pretty mean sausage patty. (Some cob-smoked Vermont  bacons and hams would make a wonderful addition to this menu.) Pure maple  syrup? At these prices, forget it.  </P> <P> But who cares? The syrup they do serve is awfully good for a commercial brand.  Their fresh-squeezed juices are sweet and pulpy and their coffee is always hot.  From start to finish, this place is definitely a class act.  </P> <P> The Volls have recently opened another Original Pancake House, this one in  nearby Yorba Linda. The new restaurant has most of the same good old recipes,  plus a few new ones such as apple waffle, vegetarian omelet, and even a pancake  made from cottage cheese. I hope people start going there. It might help  shorten the lines at the original Original Pancake House in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Prices are low. Fruits, juices, and preserves are $0.75 to $1.35, waffles $2.50  to $4.95, pancakes $2.65 to $6.05. Side orders run a big $0.95 to $2.85.  </P> <P> THE ORIGINAL PANCAKE HOUSE  </P> <P> * 1418 E. Lincoln Ave., Anaheim  </P> <P> * (714) 535-9815  </P> <P> * Also 18639 Yorba Linda Blvd., Yorba Linda  </P> <P> * (714) 693-1390  </P> <P> * Both restaurants are open Tuesdays through Sundays from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.  </P> <P> * No credit cards.  </P></p>

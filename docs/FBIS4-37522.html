			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, June 21, IRNA -- The Ikhwan al-Muslimun  (Muslim Brotherhood), the Arab world's strongest Islamic  movement, has denounced the Mashhad bomb attack as a "criminal  act" and expressed its grief over the large number of pilgrims  who fell martyrs to the cowardly and inhuman act.    "This is a criminal act. We are deeply distressed. We  severely denounce it and express our condolences to the Iranian  leadership and to the Iranian people," Ikhwan spokesman Ma'mun  al-Hudaybi told IRNA speaking by phone from Cairo Tuesday [21  June].    "We pray to allah to protect the Islamic lands from criminal  acts and to bestow on them peace and security," he added.    At least 25 people were martyred and scores of others,  including children, were injured in a terrorist bomb blast which  ripped through the holy shrine of Imam Reza (peace be upon him)  in Mashhad Monday.</p>

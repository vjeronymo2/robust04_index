			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'LIGHTNING' BIKE TEAM DROPS OUT NEAR END OF CROSS-COUNTRY RACE  </P> <P> A team of bicyclists that included a San Juan Capistrano man zipped to victory  after departing Orange County last weekend in the first cross-country test of  high-tech bikes.  </P> <P> Another team, featuring Seal Beach bike shop owner Greg Miller, abandoned the  race Thursday with about 130 miles to go, despite leading most of the way.  </P> <P> Led by ultra-endurance cycling champ Pete Penseyres of Fallbrook and his  brother, James, of San Juan Capistrano, the four-man squad took turns piloting  a bike named Lightning to the finish line in New York City's Battery Park,  covering the 3,000-mile race course in 5 days, 1 hour and 8 minutes.  </P> <P> The team, riding the bike Gold Rush America, was passed by Lightning on  Thursday morning and then took a wrong turn onto a heavily traveled highway in  Pennsylvania. The team members decided to pull out because of concerns for  their safety in the traffic, according to Trisha Nerney, a spokeswoman for the  Race Across America.  </P> <P> Long a test of endurance for cyclists on traditional bikes, the Race Across  America this year introduced a new division for such high-tech vehicles as  Lightning and Gold Rush America. Pete Penseyres won the endurance test twice  before switching to the "human-powered vehicle" division this year.  </P></p>

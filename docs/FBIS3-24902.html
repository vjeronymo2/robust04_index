W. de Klerk said on Thursday [3 February] at a  media conference in Kempton Park. "I have distanced myself from  the wrongs of the past, but the ANC has not done so," he said.  He was replying to a question about why he thought blacks would  vote for him in the election.    "I think they will vote for me because so many blacks have  told me they are going to do so. They will do so because the  present situation in the townships is, to a great extent, due to  the ANC, its youth league and their intimidation."    Referring to the provision of housing he said the ANC's  actions had frightened the private sector out of housing  development in the townships. "If it was not for these actions  of the ANC we could have produced many houses, but the ANC does  not want us to get the credit. That is why people in the  townships have been robbed of development."</p>

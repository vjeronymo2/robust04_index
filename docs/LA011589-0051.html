			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFICIT: 'WHY NO OUTRAGE?'  </P> <P> I appreciate the editorial. It condemns Capitol Hill for greeting Reagan's  final budget message with yawns. It labels the alleged $92.5-billion deficit "a  sham." The real deficit is closer to $140 billion because about $50 billion in  temporary surplus Social Security trust-fund revenues is counted against the  deficit. The deficit may be greater, depending on the economy.  </P> <P> I would add my personal outrage at Reagan's request for a 2% increase above the  inflation rate in Pentagon spending -- at a time of huge deficits and when  there is hope for an end to the cold war and the arms race.  </P> <P> The last line of the editorial, " . . . Washington needs to hear a little  outrage," is right on target. It gave me the energy to write my congressman.  Thanks.  </P> <P> EDITH L. PERLMUTTER  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> RANCHO SECO'S SALE WEIGHED  </P> <P> Directors of Sacramento's citizen-owned utility district voted to slow the  dismantling of the Rancho Seco nuclear power facility while they study offers  by private investors to operate it. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District  board closed the plant June 7, one day after voters ordered the utility to  cease operating the 15-year-old facility. Since then, the five-member board has  divided 3-2 over whether the vote mandated that Rancho Seco should be closed  for good or whether the district has the legal right to sell it to a private  company, which would reopen it. Opened in 1974, Rancho Seco was plagued with  numerous shutdowns, and electricity bills of Sacramento residents almost  doubled before the referendum June 6 in which 53% of the voters endorsed the  closing.  </P></p>

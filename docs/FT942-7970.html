			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyds/C&amp;G Lloyds Bank throws itself on the mercy of the courts this week for a decision on whether its takeover of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society can go ahead. Present legislation about who can make cash payments to building society members and in what circumstances is so confusing that the outcome is highly unpredictable. But it should not be assumed that Lloyds could easily get round an unfavourable verdict, for example by offering preference shares instead of cash. That would risk further disagreement with the Building Societies Commission and another court case. Since Lloyds and C&amp;G are sure of their case, the chances are that they would rather appeal. If the verdict goes the other way the Commission may feel tempted to appeal as well. That would at least prolong uncertainty over what is actually permitted, preventing a rash of similar merger announcements before the government can amend relevant legislation to make them more difficult. The Commission is clearly anxious to bend over backwards in defence of mutual structures. Its suggestion that societies should use their reserves to pay dividends to members would not long ago have been regarded as too risky for organisations that have no access to outside capital. Unless the Lloyds/C&amp;G deal proceeds, though, there will be little chance of subjecting building society managements to much outside pressure. The mutual structure may have some value but not if its main purpose is to protect management from competition.</p>

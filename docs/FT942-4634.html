			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / EU poll issues that have guided Twelve campaigns: Netherlands Voting today. The Dutch campaign has been short, uneventful and completely overshadowed by domestic political wrangling following general national elections a few weeks ago. The four main parties, united in their support for political and monetary union, also agree on the need to extend EU control to areas like policing and immigration. On social issues, they divide along right-left lines, but differences have also emerged on the environment. The Liberals want an eco-tax in Europe only if the rest of the industrialised world follows suit, while the other parties have indicated a readiness to take part in a 'unilateral' European move. LIKELY RESULT: An opinion poll this week indicates only the Christian Democrats will suffer losses. It is forecast to take eight seats, down two; Labour to remain at its 1989 level with eight seats. Sharp gains are predicted for the two parties which scored well in the general election. The left-of-centre D66 is seen jumping to five seats from one, while the Liberals could double their score to six seats.</p>

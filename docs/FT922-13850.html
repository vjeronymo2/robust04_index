			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / IADB officials to discuss capital injection SENIOR officials of shareholder governments are to begin talks in September on a replenishment of the Inter-American Development Bank's capital Mr Enrique Iglesias, bank president, said he expected a meeting of its governors would be convened then to discuss the issue. The previous capital increase, of Dollars 26.5bn, was agreed three years ago to cover the four years until end-1993. Ministers from Latin American governments told the bank's annual meeting, which ended in Santo Domingo yesterday, that the increase should be Dollars 40bn or more. However, some shareholders, such as Germany, have said they believe less would suffice. Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs, said that the US, the largest shareholder, was favourably disposed both to an increase in the IADB's capital and to a boost of the bank's concessional lending operations. But he said a clear view of the bank's role in the 1990s was needed before figures could be discussed. For example, as the role of the bank changed, more of its lending should be directed to the smaller, poorer countries in Latin America. Answering a question about whether the US would give up any of its share in the bank to accommodate European and Japanese demands for a greater shareholding, Mr Mulford said that would have to await the capital replenishment discussions. However, he said that the US would 'have to think long and hard before we would wish to convey a message that we were losing interest in the region.'</p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Date set for sugar's return to floor trading RAW SUGAR futures at the London Futures and Options Exchange will revert to floor trading on January 17. The market moved from open-outcry trading on to the exchange's screen-based system on January 11 last year in an attempt to reverse a worrying decline in the number of lots being traded. The move was encouraged by the continuing success of the screen-based white sugar contract, launched in 1987. However, raw sugar trading failed to revive after the switch and, after studying returns from a questionnaire distributed to members of the sugar market, the exchange decided in September that it should return to the floor. Mr Michael Overlander, the chairman of the London sugar market committee, said yesterday that five sugar trading companies and an assortment of locals (traders operating on their own account) would staff the raw sugar floor. Traders said the five companies were Sucden (UK), Refco Overseas, GNI, Credit Lyonnais Rouse and Pierson ICS.</p>

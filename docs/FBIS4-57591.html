			<p>BFN     [Text] At the conclusion of the vote count, the Central  Electoral Commission of the Dominican Republic declared  President Joaquin Balaguer the winner of the elections held on  Monday [16 May.] In the final provisional bulletin, Balaguer  maintained a one- point margin over Jose Francisco Pena Gomez,  who demanded the annulment of the elections due to reported  frauds.    Today, THE NEW YORK TIMES commented that the international  community should not recognize President Balaguer's victory if  it is the result of electoral fraud, as credible sources have  indicated. THE NEW YORK TIMES pointed out that Balaguer was also  accused of committing fraud in 1990's general elections, which  confirmed him as president of that nation for another term.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / BCCI payout unlikely until August CREDITORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International are unlikely to receive any payments until at least August next year, it emerged yesterday. A first dividend of 15p in the pound cannot be paid unless an agreement between the liquidators and the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in the bank, is ratified by the Luxembourg court of appeal. A verdict is expected tomorrow in an appeal by three BCCI depositors against the ratification of the agreement by a lower court last year. If the appeal fails, accountants at Touche Ross, BCCI liquidators, can proceed with a ballot of creditors to approve a contribution of at least Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.14bn) from Abu Dhabi in exchange for a waiver of legal action against it. Touche Ross warned that a payout in August next year was its most optimistic assessment and that a further appeal to Luxembourg's highest court could take the distribution of a first dividend into 1995. Mr Hal Skolnick, Mr Adil Elias and Mr Assilaos Artiki, the appellants, will have six months to appeal against tommorrow's judgment if it goes against them, which would defer payments further. If their appeal succeeds, however, Touche Ross will have to consider launching its own appeal, suing Abu Dhabi or renegotiating its agreement. Even if the court of appeal finds in favour of Touche, the firm said it would need to obtain approval from at least Dollars 4.75bn-worth of creditors before proceeding with its agreement with Abu Dhabi. Total fees incurred by Touche Ross in the worldwide liquidation have reached approximately Pounds 100m, up from Pounds 86m at the start of the year. The Luxembourg court is also expected to announce tomorrow that an appeal against a separate pooling agreement between BCCI liquidators in different countries has been dropped. That will clear the way for Touche Ross to negotiate with other jurisdictions on the distribution of any dividends.</p>

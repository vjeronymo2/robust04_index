The conference, chaired by Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin, was attended by heads of ministries and  departments and managers of largest oil enterprises of the  country.    The conference was held behind closed doors, but according  to  information received by ITAR-TASS, representatives of the oil  industry raised the problem of overdue payments to oil and gas  enterprises, exorbitant taxes and inadequate price policies  pursued by the state in the field of energy resources.    It was pointed out that 28 different kinds of taxes are  currently levied on one tonne of oil, which makes up 77 per cent  of its cost. Besides, new taxes are going to be levied by local  authorities in 1994, which will render normal development of the  industry impossible.    Participants coordinated a package of documents aimed at  resolving these problems. The package is expected to include a  decree of the Russian president and a number of resolutions  adopted by the government which shall be finalized in a week's  time.    Commenting on the results of the conference, Russian  Minister  for Fuel and Energy Yuriy Shafrannik said that participants  adopted a decision to increase the share of free oil sales for  oil enterprises. A concrete figure specifying the increased  amount of free oil sales will be determined in the near future,  Shafrannik said. He pointed out that in 1994, oil exports from  Russia are expected to remain at the 1993 level.</p>

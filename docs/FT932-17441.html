			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / World Trade News: The gospel according to trade's agnostic - The emerging views of US negotiator Kantor MR MICKEY Kantor, the US trade representative, does not like 'theological debate'. Over two days of talks in Brussels with EC trade officials, he made this repeatedly clear. As others grope to discern a clear US trade policy, he insists instead that the administration is 'pragmatic', 'realistic' and 'results-oriented'. In Brussels he went further: 'We see a trade policy emerging that is more active, anticipatory, inclusive and flexible - incorporating new concerns about the environment, competition policy, international labour standards, science and technology policy, enlarging the productive capabilities of developing countries.' He talked about 'mutuality of obligation and comparability of action'. In negotiations with the EC, his starting premise was simple: the US is one of the most open markets in the world. The EC is by comparison closed. The US task is to get other countries into line. When asked if the trade policies of President Bill Clinton will be different from those of his predecessors, Mr Kantor chose 'to reframe the question': 'Can we afford to have continuity for continuity's sake? Can we afford to remain at a standstill, to live with old assumptions in the face of massive and inexorable change in the new global economic environment?' In the wake of these explanations, one Brussels-based trade analyst commented: 'If Mr Kantor is averse to theological debate, he seems perfectly happy to deal in metaphysics.' In certain respects, it remains premature for Mr Kantor to talk more clearly. The review of US trade policy demanded by Mr Clinton is still incomplete. The president has still to confirm many of his trade representatives. Many of those named are new to the area of trade. Serious negotiation of issues involved with the Uruguay Round of world trade talks remains impossible because Mr Clinton has yet to put to Congress proposals renewing 'fast track' laws that would enable the administration to present a 'take-it-or-leave-it' package. So far, there are few results by which to measure US policy. Clashes between the US and the EC over steel dumping, and Airbus subsidies were inherited from the Bush administration. 'Get tough' threats in a row over EC procurement policy have yet to move beyond bluff and brinkmanship. Deadlines for US sanctions have come and gone. A meeting in Washington on April 19-20 is now set as a make-or-break session, during which there will either be a settlement, or both sides will be 'free to act as we wish'. EC officials fear a crisis has been delayed rather than averted. They say they would be prepared to bow to US demands to dismantle Article 29 of the new Utilities directive, which discriminates in favour of EC bidders for procurement contracts, but want the US in return to tackle its 'Buy America' laws. Throughout negotiations in Brussels on government procurement, Mr Kantor neither bowed to, nor agreed to recognise, EC complaints that the 'Buy America' act in the US strongly discriminates against foreign bidders for contracts, in particular at a state and municipal level. On Monday, Mr Kantor said categorically that the act 'has had no effect on European suppliers'. His claim was embarrassingly contradicted by US officials at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) in Geneva, who at the very time he was speaking were vetoing for the second time a Gatt panel ruling against the US for having barred a German company from a US procurement contract through use of the law. Trade experts also query Mr Clinton's commitment to multilateral trade rules and 'honest-broker' settlement of trade disputes in the Gatt. In talks with Mexico on the North American Free Trade Agreement, with the EC on Airbus, steel, or procurement, or with Japan on semi-conductors, the US has shown a clear preference for bilateral settlement of disputes. President Clinton has also openly supported reinstatement of 'Super 301' laws, which will entitle the US to target countries it sees as trading unfairly, and impose sanctions if they do not change their ways. The US has clearly targeted Japan as an unfair trader, with whom bilateral negotiations offer the only route to opening the market. In Brussels, Mr Kantor said the Uruguay Round would not be completed 'if Japan continues to behave as if it had little stake in the outcome.' The comment stirred a storm among Japanese trade officials. In Brussels, the Japanese embassy said Mr Kantor 'had a misperception': 'Maybe he is not yet fully familiar with the details of the realities.' That Mr Kantor is new to his task is undeniable. But he is not new to the domestic economic priorities that lie at the heart of the new president's decision-making. What the Japanese may be seeing is evidence of new priorities, in which the details of past realities count for much less. One UK-based trade analyst commented: 'The US knows what it wants - it's just not what other people think it should want.'</p>

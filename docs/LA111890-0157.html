			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BENEFITS OF CHILD CARE  </P> <P> I am a student in the nursing program at Pierce College and my 3-year-old  daughter is attending the Child Development Center at the college. I was  shocked to hear that funding to the center will be cut shortly.  </P> <P> My daughter has responded extremely well to the teaching methods at the center  and is very happy.  </P> <P> The center provides an invaluable, high-quality service to the community. It is  critical that the college provide a good educational facility at a reasonable  cost for the preschool children of students.  </P> <P> These students have made a commitment to further education which is made more  difficult having to care for children. The Child Development Center helps to  ease this burden by contributing to the student's support system, thus helping  to ensure that the student completes the prescribed studies.  </P> <P> This not only benefits the student but also benefits society as a whole by  having more educated people who can contribute to increasing society's standard  of living.  </P> <P> The immediate short-term costs saving of a cut in funding is far outweighed by  the longer term cost to society of student dropouts.  </P> <P> DEBORAH AITKEN  </P> <P> Simi Valley  </P></p>

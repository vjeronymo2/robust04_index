			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Macfarlane tumbles to Pounds 6.85m PROFITS of Macfarlane Group (Clansman), the Glasgow-based packaging company, continued to fall through the second six months of 1991 and for the full year emerged Pounds 2.37m lower at Pounds 6.85m pre-tax. The figure was adversely affected by restructuring costs of Pounds 804,000 (Pounds 618,000) which were taken above the line this time following changes in accounting standards - previously restructuring charges were taken below the line. With most group companies exposed to a downturn in business throughout the year turnover fell by 19.4 per cent to Pounds 82.66m. In order to counteract the effects of the recession the directors introduced economies which included substantial reductions in manning levels, stocks and debtors. In order to reflect their confidence in the underlying strength of the business the directors are proposing to raise the dividend for the year by 5.1 per cent to 4.24p via a final of 2.49p. Earnings fell from 11.91p to 8.97p per share.</p>

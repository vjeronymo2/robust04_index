Gomes is willing to record his  statement at a notary's office. At a meeting with Sao Paulo  Senator Mario Covas, PSDB President Tasso Jereissati, and  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Gomes said his name is not  available. "There are people better qualified than I in the PSDB  hierarchy. I have already served four [as published] interrupted  terms of office--two as deputy and one as mayor of Fortaleza,"  he said.    Ciro said his youth is another reason he would not agree to  run: "I am distressingly similar to Collor, but I'm not a  thief," and announced his plan to pursue graduate studies at  Harvard, in the United States. In March, he will find out  whether his application for a grant to study at the Institute  for International Affairs has been approved. He would spend two  years there writing a thesis on "Political Aspects of Inflation  in Brazil."</p>

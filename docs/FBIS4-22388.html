			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Stanislavovich Novitskyy, Ukrainian </F> first deputy minister of industry, by Natalya Svichkolap; date  and place not given: "The Chemical Industry Workers'  Disorganized Present; They Are Unraveling the `Gordian Knots' of  Accumulated Problems and Making Plans for Tomorrow and...for the  Period up to the End of the Century"]    [Text] In the heat of ambition and the triumphal  "funeral service" for the old order, we almost threw another  baby out with the bath water, confusing the Western economists  who could not understand why we are so averse to planning.  Without plans, after all, we cannot make our way through the  thickets of the market, and regardless of how allergic a certain  segment of our population might be to the very word "plan," the  facts are these: No enterprise or industry in the West can even  consider its future existence without forecasts. In addition,  there is also short-term, medium-term, and strategic  planning--for 10-20 years in advance.    Today in our country, God himself has commanded us to  shape up, as the saying goes. Let us take a look at the chemical  complex, for example. No branch of the national economy can  develop without the use of modern chemical products.  Incidentally, for the sake of comparison, their share of the  total industrial product is 12 percent in Germany and 9 percent  in the United States, but in our country the figure decreased by  20 percent in the last four years and now amounts to 5.1  percent. The present structure of the Ukrainian chemical  industry as a whole does not meet modern requirements and cannot  satisfy the country's needs. The reasons are well-known: Just a  few years ago our chemical complex was part of the union  complex, with quite intense cooperation by enterprises. Today we  are disentangling ourselves from this interdependence, but we do  not have the raw materials for the production of several  important commodities (we receive 80 percent of them from  Russia), and we are not producing some of the main basic  resources--rubber, styrene, aniline, and others. We are also  feeling the effects of disparate technological goals, the low  percentage of state-of-the-art technologies and production  units, the considerable depreciation of fixed assets (up to 60  percent), and the obsolete technology.    That is why structural changes in the chemical complex  have to be considered now. What will the Ukrainian chemical  industry look like in the near future? The editors asked  Ukrainian First Deputy Minister of Industry V.S. Novitskyy to  answer this question and several others.    [Svichkolap] Vladimir Stanislavovich, now that actual events  are surpassing all expectations, and now that any kind of reform  can be expected at any time, I think that one of the things we  have to do is express our appreciation for the courage of the  people who are deciding the development strategy for the  chemical complex. Please tell us how this massive task began.    [Novitskyy] There is no question that we are living in a  difficult time, but you will agree that any system has to make  plans and predictions and evaluate its own performance before it  can develop. A complex as huge as the chemical industry  naturally requires the best possible development model and a  corresponding program of action. We began by analyzing the  degree to which our industry can meet our country's need for  chemical products. We learned that we are satisfying some of the  national economy's requirements--for nitrogen fertilizer, for  example. On the other hand, we are not producing some extremely  necessary products. Our analysis indicated gaps in technological  chains: We have the raw materials and the final products, but  the semimanufactured products are in other CIS countries. We  calculated how much of each of these products we need and where  the gaps in the chains have to be repaired and now we will start  building the kind of structure that will satisfy all of our  country's needs. We are certain that the chemical complex will  recover all foreign currency investments.    [Svichkolap] That is a bold prediction in view of today's  deficit in the balance of exports and imports.    [Novitskyy] Yes, but one of our primary objectives is a  positive balance, and one of the main ways of achieving this  will entail energy conservation. We are lagging far behind the  Western countries in this respect.    [Svichkolap] There are so many different methods of  industrial restructuring in world experience, some of which have  gone so far as to suspend the operations of selected facilities  and eliminate whole industries. Which method have you chosen?    [Novitskyy] Our plans for the development of the chemical  complex include fundamental strategic guidelines, and we have  drawn up a program of action on this basis. It stipulates the  main stages of the process, the cost of carrying out each stage,  and the deadlines for the completion of the work. This, however,  does not mean that we will not be making adjustments as time  goes on. We can expect changes in the economy, in our  approaches, and in the prices of energy resources and many types  of raw materials. We can adjust to all of these circumstances.    The process of restructuring in the Western countries  occurred back in the 1960s when there was an abundant supply of  chemical products. We, on the other hand, are experiencing  shortages of almost everything. This is why we are taking a  different approach: Although the whole chemical complex is  slated for dynamic development, we will make a more intense  effort in some areas. The operations of whole production units  could have been halted in those areas, but we do not need this,  even though we might have some excess capacities for the  production of ammonia and nitrogen fertilizers today. These are  among Ukraine's main exports.    It is true that the current prices of natural gas virtually  preclude the profitable, and even lucrative, export of products.  for this reason, one of our main objectives today is the  reduction of the energy and material requirements of our  production units. We drew up a program for this purpose, and it  is already being implemented. Ammonia production units, for  example, are being modernized, and this project will do much to  reduce proportional expenditures of natural gas and other  resources and thereby lower the overhead costs of production.    The program envisages the extraction and processing of four  to five times as much potassium ore, the development of  phosphorite deposits, the stabilization of the sulfur output,  and the development of new lime deposits. For the time being,  however, Ukraine's need for phosphorus fertilizers can be  satisfied only with the use of phosphorus raw materials from  Russia.    [Svichkolap] Yes, but for several well-known reasons our  relations with Russia are regrettably "thorny." We live in a  dynamic world, however, and if we are having difficulty  acquiring raw materials from Russia, why not buy them from, for  instance, the countries of Northwest Africa?    [Novitskyy] At this time the shipments of apatite from the  Kola Peninsula are the most preferable option from the economic  standpoint. The African phosphorites are inferior in quality and  are not any cheaper. Even this option has been considered,  however, and can be employed at any time.    Now we have begun producing phosphorus fertilizers. We will  need around 600,000 tonnes of apatite by the spring sowing  season to satisfy the needs of agriculture. If our enterprises  work constantly, without any interruptions, we expect to satisfy  minimum agricultural requirements.    A big conference of the heads of oblast organizations of the  Ministry of Agriculture and the managers of Ministry of Industry  enterprises was held a few days ago. We reached an agreement on  the whole group of issues connected with fertilizer supplies.    [Svichkolap] Vladimir Stanislavovich, at the last meeting of  the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the director  complained that Ukrainian enterprises are selling materials and  products at prices exceeding world prices within our country and  at one-third to one-fourth the cost abroad. Does this apply to  the chemical complex as well?    [Novitskyy] I have to admit that I do not know exactly what  he was talking about. We do have problems of competitiveness  with some of the products of the chemical industry. In other  words, our expenditures are sometimes higher than the world  prices of these products. We are essentially selling carbamide  and ammonia at a zero profit margin, for example, but only at  the present exchange rate of the dollar. The official exchange  rate of the dollar to the karbovanets today is not an accurate  reflection of their value and is a problem throughout industry.  The exchange rate is obviously too low for the exporter. Here is  the situation: It is best for the exporter to have the highest  possible exchange rate, but the importer who buys raw materials  would prefer the opposite--a lower exchange rate. We need a  comprehensive assessment of this situation, and we certainly  need the regulation of the rate, even if the state has to become  involved in this. The rate has to change in response to changes  in the economic and financial situation. Otherwise, we run the  risk of misalignment. An exchange rate that is too low  discourages exports, and the consequences can be quite severe:  We will lose the market. If our products are not there, the  vacuum will be filled quickly by another supplier, and then it  will be extremely difficult to break into the market again. This  calls for a balanced and reasonable approach, so that we do not  put too much pressure on our own exporters or on the producers  using imported raw materials. This is done in the stock exchange  in every other country, but our situation is more complex. That  is why we cannot get along without government regulation.    [Svichkolap] Any plan can be implemented when enterprises  are  operating and science is making progress, but our country is in  a pitiful state. How will it be possible to act on even the best  intentions when everyone here is insolvent?    [Novitskyy] You are right. This is a difficult situation.  Science has suffered most of all. The cost of maintaining  project planning and research institutes and design bureaus has  risen, but the need for scientific and products (however  paradoxical this might sound) has decreased. There is not enough  working capital to pay for contracted projects. We are trying to  find a solution. We set up innovation and economic regulation  funds. They are being used to finance the scientific and  technical programs of institutes. These funds are understandably  inadequate. The institutes are working directly with  enterprises, but even these possibilities are limited because  the enterprises are also suffering from a shortage of funds.    As far as the general situation in the chemical complex is  concerned, it was always difficult even in the past. It became  critical, however, in the first months of this year. The abrupt  rise in energy prices literally drove the enterprises to their  knees, and this was followed by a period of sharp cuts in gas  shipments, when we had to suspend continuous production  processes. Now they are being started up again. Officials in  Moscow have agreed to continue shipping gas to us in the same  quantities as before until 11 April and to make up for 80  percent of the gas shipments we are not getting from  Turkmenistan.    We are still racking our brains, however, over the two main  shortages--of working capital and hard currency. The shortage of  hard currency could be alleviated by increasing exports and  reducing imports, but the reduction of imports would presuppose  the production of the same goods in our country or the reduced  consumption of some imports. This would call for efforts in many  different areas. As far as working capital is concerned, we have  calculated that the shortage of working capital at enterprises  of the Ministry of Industry exceeds 10 trillion karbovantsy.  Under these conditions, even successful enterprises will be  bankrupted by the next rise in prices. It is understandable,  therefore, that the problem of supplementing our working capital  must be solved on the governmental level, perhaps not in its  entirety, but at least for 70 percent of the total amount  required. Otherwise, the shortage of working capital will result  in the instability of all industry.    [Svichkolap] Do you believe that structural changes in the  chemical complex can make a difference even in this "overheated"  economy?    [Novitskyy] I am certain that Ukraine is not suffering from  a  terminal illness. We have enough intelligent minds, working  hands, undeveloped mineral deposits, and the wish to make our  country rich. We have the potential to satisfy light industry's  need for chemical fibers and filaments and to develop the  aniline dye industry. The program envisages a considerable  increase in the output of plastic and synthetic resins (steps  have already been taken to remodel some production units and  build some new ones). We plan to modernize and augment our  capacities for the production of household chemicals, the active  base of medications, and superpure substances for  radioelectronics. Our plans also assign special priority to the  environment.    In conclusion, I want to say that the work on the program  will achieve the restructuring of the chemical complex, fill the  market with new chemical products, secure the steady work of  enterprises, minimize the dependence of this work on shipments  of raw materials and semimanufactured products from the CIS  countries and distant foreign countries, reduce energy  consumption considerably, and result in a positive export-import  balance by the year 2000.</p>

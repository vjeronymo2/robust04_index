			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Lloyds Chemists in Pounds 55m acquisition LLOYDS Chemists, the chemist and drugstore group which has expanded rapidly through acquisition, yesterday announced its biggest deal yet and a Pounds 71.1m rights issue to finance it. Lloyds is paying Pounds 55m for Kingswood-GK, a chemist chain, and Holland &amp; Barrett, the health food shops, both owned by Booker, the food distribution and agribusiness group. The deal will add 163 chemist shops to give Lloyds a total of 617. Lloyds has 181 drugstores (which do not sell prescription drugs), and H&amp;B has 191 outlets. Mr Allen Lloyd, Lloyds chairman and chief executive, said: 'We are very confident this acquisition is earnings enhancing.' The rights issue will raise Pounds 71.1m net of expenses and is on a 1-for-2 basis at 230p. Lloyds shares rose 3p to 278p yesterday, while Booker's shares were up 11p to 480p. Booker will receive Pounds 37.5m in cash from the deal, including the repayment of intra-group debt. Another Pounds 19.2m will go to Mr Gus Kiamtia, founder of GK Chemists, and his family, who had kept a 40 per cent interest in Kingswood-GK. Mr Jonathan Taylor, Booker chief executive, said the deal would cut Booker's gearing on a pro forma basis from 112 per cent at the end of 1990 to 85 per cent, excluding the effect of a Pounds 25m share placing since the year end. Booker had decided to leave retailing, and is expected to sell L'Herbier de Provence, a herbal cosmetics chain. Mr Lloyd said negotiations with Booker began in earnest four weeks ago. Lloyds is paying Pounds 48m for Kingswood, which has net assets of Pounds 10.3m, and Pounds 7m for H&amp;B with net assets of Pounds 8.3m. Together the two businesses made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.4m in 1990. Mr Lloyd said that Lloyds could cut about Pounds 2m of costs from Kingswood and Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m at H&amp;B by integrating head office and distribution systems with Lloyds' before any improvement in sales and margins. However, there would be redundancy and other costs of about Pounds 500,000 at Kingswood, and Pounds 500,000 would be spent changing Kingswood stores to Lloyds. Mr Dick Steele, Lloyds finance director, said Pounds 16.1m remaining from the rights issue would be used to repay the group's debt - Pounds 18.2m on April 5. Thereafter a sale and leaseback deal on a new warehouse should raise Pounds 6.5m-Pounds 7m giving the group net cash by the June year end. Lex, Page 24</p>

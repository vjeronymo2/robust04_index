			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / HK democracy blow for Patten Governor Chris Patten's chances of getting the so-called non-controversial parts of his democracy legislation through Hong Kong's legislature narrowed at the weekend when the Legislative Council's biggest political party said it would seek to amend his plans. The Liberal party, a 15-member coalition of conservative politicians in the 60-strong council, said that in the interests of getting Britain and China back to the negotiating table it would propose deleting all reference to next year's Legco polls from a bill working its way through the council. But it would support the governor's proposals for forthcoming local government elections. If the Liberals' amendment succeeds Mr Patten would be placed in a virtually untenable position. One of the reasons talks between Britain and China broke down late last year was the UK refusal to consider the colony's local government elections separately from those for Legco.

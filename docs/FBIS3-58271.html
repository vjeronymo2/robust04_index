			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andreas Andrianopoulos, New Democracy deputy </F> and a former minister, by correspondent Andonis Dhelatollas;  place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Dhelatollas] A few days ago,  Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos said Skopje will  not be a Greek Presidency issue, but a bilateral one. Do you  agree?    [Andrianopoulos] The Greek Government struggled for two  years  to prevent countries, particularly European countries, from  recognizing Skopje. The Pasok [Panhellenic Socialist Movement]  government is now saying that Greece will never recognize a  country with the name "Macedonia!"    But was there ever such an issue? The government is simply  recognizing its weakness and making--hypocritically and  cowardly--a 180-degree turn. The essence is that Skopje is not  a bilateral issue--at least not politically. It directly  concerns Europe and its plans to solve the Bosnian problem. It  would be a tragic mistake to ignore this reality.  <H5>  Counterattack </H5>   [Dhelatollas] The New Democracy chairman said Skopje must  return to the EC framework. Should we assume that you have  changed your policy, because a while ago you were speaking about  the UN procedure?    [Andrianopoulos] Abandoning the UN procedure meant that  Greece abandoned Europe, because it was its initiative to  mediate and avert "Macedonia's" automatic accession to the  United Nations and its broad recognition. Bringing the issue  back to Europe means a return to the United Nations. But why do  we speak around and not on the issue?    The truth is that following recent government moves, Greece  appears to be losing the battle on Skopje. International  relations show that you must not see every impasse and problem  as a threat but look at it as a new opportunity.    Maybe this is an opportunity to abandon our incomprehensible  nationalism on defense, a stance that is unacceptable for our  dignity and is also unacceptable internationally, and adopt a  more aggressive stance. We intend to live peacefully with this  republic but we must make it clear to friends and enemies,  Skopjeans and others, that if the tiny neighboring state  provokes Greece at all, we will adopt a coordinated policy of  questioning its territorial integrity, considering it part of  Greek Macedonia.    Instead of being concerned that it may have plans against  us,  we must force everyone to come to us to persuade us not to  promote extreme and dangerous pursuits.    The message of a strong and dignified country will then be  received. I do not see why we should be the ones to be  concerned about them and ask others to pressure them to remove  their provocation. Why shouldn't they be the ones to be  concerned about us? We are a country that does not beg. We are  a country that demands. [passage omitted]</p>

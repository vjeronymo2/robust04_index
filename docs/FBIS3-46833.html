			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 3 January a source specializing in international  military affairs said Russian nuclear-powered submarines had  resumed their operations in the Sea of Japan last December,  almost as if Russia had returned to the Cold War era. In the  Atlantic, the Russian Navy has also resumed missile launching  exercises, long-term exercises of aircraft carriers, and patrol  operations. In connection with the rise of "Russian  nationalism" observed in the last parliamentary elections,  Western nations are concerned about these Russian moves.    Operations of a Russian submarine were observed twice in  early and late December. Both operations lasted for about a  week, with the operations being undertaken in the Sea of Japan  to a point 100-kilometers north of Ishikawa Prefecture's Noto  Peninsula, which is within Japan's economic waters.    The type of submarine has not been confirmed since it never  surfaced during the operation, but judging from various signs,  it is believed to be a Victor-III class (with a displacement of  4,800 tons), which is regarded as the "backbone" of Russia's  fleet attack submarines.    The source added: "Such activities of nuclear-powered  submarines were quite usual in the period of the former Soviet  Union, but have not been observed during the last couple of  years since the Russian Federation took over control of the  Navy." In addition, the source noted: 1) a Udaloy-class  destroyer (6,700 tons), an Alligator-class landing ship (3,400  tons), and a Boris Chilikin-class replenishment ship (23,400  tons) passed through the Korea Strait on 18 November and  conducted exercises in waters near the gulf after stopping in  Cam Ranh Bay; 2) a Ropucha-class landing ship (3,600 tons) also  passed through the strait on 2 December, apparently unloading  supplies in Cam Ranh Bay; and 3) airplane operations are  becoming active around Japan. In analysis, the source  concluded: "The Russian Navy may be resuming full-fledged  activities after restructuring its lineup through the disposal  of superannuated ships."    In particular, the source said it is noteworthy that such  operations are observed not only in the Pacific but also in the  Atlantic simultaneously. On this basis, the source stressed  that Japan should carefully determine whether the operations are  based on a new strategy by President Boris Yeltsin or are signs  of the rise of military authorities after the attack on the  Russian White House.</p>

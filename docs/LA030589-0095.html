			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: A FRIEND FROM ENGLAND BY ANITA BROOKNER (HARPER &amp; ROW:  $6.95)  </P> <P> Thirty-two-year-old Rachel Kennedy, owner of a London bookshop, is  self-sufficient, solitary. "I've learned how to be alone and to put a good face  on it," she says.  </P> <P> She becomes a frequent dinner guest at the home of her father's former  accountant and his wife, Oscar and Dorrie Livingstone. Somehow Rachel concludes  "that Oscar and Dorrie thought me a suitable companion for Heather," their  grown daughter, and Rachel condescends to become her mentor.  </P> <P> When Heather impulsively flies to Venice to marry the man she loves, Rachel  follows her -- to reprimand her. Heather responds by saying that Rachel's own  total control -- good manners masking disengagement -- amounts to a  "mismanagement" of life.  </P> <P> In the end, Rachel admits her limitations: "To strike out and claim one's own  life . . . even to embrace caprice, was, though monstrous, sometimes  admirable."  </P> <P> "What we are reading is . . . an allegorical fable between a false life of  repression and a true life of risks and engagements," Hermione Lee wrote in  these pages, calling "A Friend From England" a "harsh, dark fable."  </P></p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Michelin extends advance as Paris bourse recovers SECOND THOUGHTS came to the rescue of the Paris bourse yesterday, but they had the reverse effect in Frankfurt, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS recovered from a midday slump which was blamed on the dollar's weakness and the impact of a sell programme on a thin market. The CAC 40 index fell as low as 1,853.95 before closing 5.18 down at 1,860.61 in turnover of FFr2bn. The tyre maker Michelin continued to advance, putting on FFr7 or 4.5 per cent to FFr164 with 164,890 shares traded. One analyst said that Goodyear's recent forecast that it would return to the black this year was encouraging investors to buy, but he added that the stock was looking overbought. Paribas added FFr11.30 or 3.1 per cent to FFr371.50 with 188,290 shares traded, on heavy buying by two domestic brokers. There were also unconfirmed reports that Goldman Sachs had downgraded its earnings for Bancaire, pushing it down by FFr10 to FFr495. FRANKFURT broke up through 1,700 on the DAX index for an intraday peak of 1,702.69, but then dropped more than 20 points to close 5.49 lower at 1,681.13, after a 1.99 rise to 689.15 in the FAZ at midsession. The early rise was a traders' initiative, and prices soon lost ground after orders failed to follow. In the aftermath of the steel pay settlement, the emphasis switched to its inflationary consequences, and the prospect of a more extended period of high interest rates; and car shares, which had risen on the absence of a strike threat, fell on reports that Daimler's Mercedes unit was reviewing methods of cutting production this year, due to a slump in the US market. Volume rose from DM7bn to DM8bn. Daimler and Volkswagen both fell DM5.50, to DM744.50 and DM337 respectively. However, the market extended its appreciation of construction stocks, where Hochtief's good orders took the shares up another DM14 to DM1,199, and Philipp Holzmann by DM15 to DM1,165. Retailers, similarly, extended Wednesday's gains on hopes of higher 1992 consumer spending, with Karstadt DM5.50 higher at DM631.50 and Kaufhof DM6 higher at DM478. MILAN saw interest in banks and insurers. The Comit index rose 0.88 to 551.59 in turnover estimated at close to Wednesday's L149bn. Generali rose L290 to L31,190 while its subsidiary Alleanza added L120 to L12,770. Ambroveneto also continued in strength, adding L15 to L4,400 on speculation that Credit Agricole of France or Alleanza were interested in taking a stake in the bank. Dealers reported foreign buying in the utility Italgas, which rose L58 to L3,534 with a heavy 1.6m shares traded. Fiat rose L2 to L5,135 but slipped to L5,050 after hours, depressed by industry data showing that its share of the domestic car market fell to 43.5 per cent last month, compared to 46.9 per cent a year earlier. AMSTERDAM was broadly mixed with the CBS Tendency Index barely changed: it gained 0.1 to 122.2. KLM's third quarter results, which showed a smaller-than-expected loss of Fl 8.6m, supported its shares. Having recorded a day's high of Fl 40.90 after opening at Fl 39.80 it closed just 90 cents lower Fl 39.60. One analyst did not expect the price to rise much above Fl 40 until there sible merger with British Airways. Philips put on Fl 0.40 to Fl 31.00, although there was mixed feeling over its announcement on Wednesday that it was taking a 25 per cent stake in a US media group. Elsevier gained Fl 1 to Fl 107.20. ZURICH rose on marginally lower than expected domestic inflation figures for 1991, the all-share SPI index ending 3.0 higher at 1,119.1. The inflation news helped bonds and bank shares in early trade. CS Holding bearers, up SFr40 at SFr1,965, topped the active list. However, Gotthard Bank certificates lost SFr15 to SFr525 on better 1991 profits, an unchanged dividend and a 1-for-15 rights issue. MADRID was flat, the general index ending down 0.81 at 256.61. The banking sector was weak on profit-taking while, in utilities, Endesa shed another Pta40 at Pta3,170. STOCKHOLM's rally ended with the Affarsvarlden General index 9.5 lower at 968.8, on interest rate worries and Ericsson's announcement of 800 job cuts in the Stockholm area. Volume eased from SKr587m to SKr502m. Ericsson was the most active stock, its B shares slipping SKr4 to SKr118. OSLO fell in dull trading, the all-share index dropping 4.38 to 438.09. Hafslund, the healthcare group, saw its A shares lose NKr2 to NKr266 in spite of record profits, an increased dividend and plans to spin-off its shipping operations into an independent company.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open    10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1144.86  1144.28  1142.13  1139.75  1138.44  1136.89  1137.77  1138.76  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Day's High  1145.00    Day's Low  1136.66  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Feb 5     Feb 4     Feb 3    Jan 31    Jan 30 1138.71   1132.79   1134.04   1137.97   1131.87  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

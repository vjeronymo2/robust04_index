			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Thais look to their neighbours as peace breaks out - Investing in China and Indochina is a response to fears of western protectionism THAI companies, lured by business opportunities in southern China and Indochina, are increasingly investing abroad in an attempt to boost turnover and profits. Fearful of trade protectionism in north America and Europe, they are also contemplating further investments in the West to safeguard their overseas markets. Mr Anand Panyarachun, the Thai prime minister, recently identified the expansion of Thai investments overseas as one of the most important ways of ensuring the country's future economic prosperity. Recognising the emerging role of Thai investments abroad, the Bank of Thailand, the central bank, began to publish figures on the subject at the start of this year. They show net flows of Thai equity investment abroad rising to Bt4.47bn (Dollars 177.38m) in 1991 from only Bt615m in 1988. Hong Kong's share rose to Bt1.34bn last year from almost nothing three years earlier, one indication of the growing interest in southern China's boom being shown by Bangkok's Thai-Chinese business community. Among the companies increasing their exposure to China are the multinational Charoen Pokphand or CP group - long established in Hong Kong and China itself - Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest bank, and property developers such as the Somprasong group. CP's varied interests in China include a motorcycle factory, a brewery and a growing number of animal feed mill plants and chicken farms. For ethnic Chinese investors in China, political risk is more than offset by the cheapness of land and labour, profit margins twice as high as those in Thailand and the huge potential market. 'If we can increase consumption by one chicken per person per year, we are thinking 1.2bn chickens. That's a lot,' says Mr Prasertsak Ongwattanakul, the CP group's spokesman in Bangkok. Bangkok Bank, meanwhile, has announced plans to spend at least Dollars 80m on a dozen new overseas branches, most of them in China, as part of its drive to become a regional bank concentrating on cross-border business in south-east Asia and China. Bangkok Bank has noticed that its overseas business is growing much faster in Asia than in the saturated markets of the US and Europe, and it is targeting its new investments accordingly. Thai Military Bank is also expanding on the Pacific rim, and is doubling its share capital to Bt7bn to finance new branches in China, Indochina, Burma and on the US west coast; Krung Thai Bank is moving into Cambodia, Vietnam and China; The Bangkok Bank of Commerce, a smaller bank, is planning to open a branch in China and a subsidiary in Canada. Mr Prasong Panichpakdee, managing director of Somprasong Land Development, is typical of the energetic Thai-Chinese businessmen who are now turning their attention to China. He sees an almost insatiable demand for houses in southern China and says Guangzhou is 'like Bangkok in China'. Somprasong has interests in Bt12bn worth of residential property developments in China, which will form a substantial part of the company's turnover in the years ahead. Mr Prasong was educated in Hong Kong and has gone into partnership with a Hong Kong businessman for the Chinese projects. 'For us to move to China is quite easy because of the language, and we all have the Chinese mentality,' he says at his headquarters overlooking Bangkok's Chao Phraya river. 'We'll be one of the early people to move from Thailand into China, and we think we'll perform very well.' Mr Prasong is less enthusiastic about Vietnam, although his company may consider investing there in the future. 'I personally feel it's a little too early to get involved in Vietnam,' he says. 'You have to go somewhere where there's buying power.' But following the end of the Cold war and the signing of the 1991 Cambodian peace accord, many Thai banks, industrial companies and entrepreneurs have started moving into Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Hua Thai Manufacturing, a textile company, has two operations in Vietnam, but businessmen say other Thai companies have been slow to respond to opportunities in Vietnam and have lost out to their rivals from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. Labour in Indochina is cheap and public awareness of the need to preserve the environment is lower than in increasingly prosperous south-east Asian countries such as Malaysia and Thailand; this is drawing investment in pulp and paper projects, cement plants, asbestos factories and prawn farms into Indochina. Another deciding factor in Thai investments abroad is the fear that exports to world markets will be restricted by protectionism in the European Community and the new North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), comprising the US, Canada and Mexico. In 1989, Thailand's Unicord, a tuna processor, bought the canned tuna company Bumble Bee Seafoods of San Diego for Dollars 269m. More recently Siam Cement, in a joint venture with Finfloor of Italy, has invested in a new ceramic tile factory in Tennessee. Several Thai companies, anxious to gain a foothold in Nafta, are now considering investing in Mexico. Some stockbrokers in Bangkok believe that Thai companies are merely dabbling in overseas investments or copying - perhaps too late - Hong Kong's excitement about southern China. Others say Thai companies' foreign investments will continue to grow. 'In China it's still fairly new, and with the exception of CP it's still fairly seat-of-the-pants,' says one broker. 'But companies like Bangkok Bank, CP and Siam Cement have quite simply outgrown Thailand, so it's time to start looking offshore.'</p>

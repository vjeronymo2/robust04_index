The Renamo leader said he is ready to take over power, but he  will accept remaining in opposition. Our correspondent in  Maputo, Fernando Magalhaes, met Renamo's shadow cabinet:    [Magalhaes] This is Renamo's first shadow cabinet and Afonso  Dhlakama introduced it to us:    [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] This is Minister for Internal  Administration Albino Faife. This is Agostinho Murrial,  information minister. This is Minister of Agriculture Paris  [Raul] Baza. [end recording]    [Magalhaes] He also introduced us to the recently appointed  aides of provincial governors. This will be a way of sharing  regional government that many Frelimo people fear will paralyze  its government.    [Begin recording] [Magalhaes] Will this shadow government  dynamize or paralyze the country's activities?    [Dhlakama] It will dynamize them. It will help the  reintegration and reunification of the country.    [Magalhaes] The appointment of the aides was decided at the  first Dhlakama-Chissano summit, which took place in Maputo on 3  September 1993. Maybe this is the beginning of a government of  reconciliation which the international community wants to see  still before the elections. Do you hope to win the elections?    [Dhlakama] Well.    [Magalhaes] Or do you hope to win the next?    [Dhlakama] Well, I want to make it clear that I did not  fight  for power but rather, I fought for democracy and freedom and I  have already won. We will have to see whether I will win the  elections or not. We will have to see. I have hope that the  results will be good. [end recording]</p>

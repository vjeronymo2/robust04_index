			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps lift ISA to Pounds 4.3m ISA International, the computer equipment distributor, reported a 57 per cent increase in profits following a strong performance by its new Scandinavian subsidiary. A Pounds 668,000 contribution by CTS Svenska, acquired for Pounds 3.6m in February last year, lifted pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.3m in the 12 months to December 31, against Pounds 2.7m in 1992. The comparative figure was restated using average currency conversion rates rather than year-end figures to calculate overseas profits. After stripping out CTS Svenska's gains and a Pounds 236,000 downward re-adjustment of the 1992 results, the group saw underlying profits grow 33 per cent to Pounds 3.6m Mr John Parkinson, chairman, said the improvement reflected a new emphasis on direct sales rather than dealer distribution. The move helped operating profit increase to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 3.38m), while turnover rose 24 per cent to Pounds 140m (Pounds 113m). Having initiated that strategy, however, Mr Parkinson announced his retirement to make way for 'someone with more experience of strategic marketing'. Signalling a shift in the overall direction of the group, he added: 'The company would benefit from a change in operational leadership. We'd like to see further improvement from some subsidiaries and new products introduced.' His fellow directors are understood to have been surprised by his decision, which follows a lengthy review of ISA's performance. The review persuaded the board to invest Pounds 4m on a new computer system designed to cut costs and offset the effect of tighter margins in Europe. Mr Parkinson hinted that ISA was also considering further acquisitions, which would be funded from reserves of Pounds 3.4m left over from its Pounds 7m placing and offer to acquire CTS Svenska. Earnings per share rose 35 per cent to 7.46p, against a restated 5.52p. A final dividend of 1.1p makes a 1.65p (1.5p) total. The shares closed up 5p at 136p.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Prescott predicts drive to adopt minimum wage Labour is to make the introduction of a statutory national minimum wage one of the main features of its economic policy in spite of differences over the issue among unions. The question is likely to have a prominent place in Labour's campaign in next month's European elections and at the party's autumn conference. Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, told the MSF general technical union at its conference yesterday that the party needed to back the general principle of a national minimum wage, but should not yet commit itself to a precise figure. He later said it would be necessary to agree on such a figure before the next general election. By focusing on the national minimum wage, Labour will be adopting a high-risk strategy. Last month Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU's general secretary, said a future Labour government should introduce a Pounds 4-an-hour national minimum wage - a proposal denounced by the AEEU engineering union. Many unions are concerned that any legally enforceable minimum wage will lead to a squeeze on pay differentials and demands for pay rises to restore relative pay positions. Observer, Page 17</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jardo Muecalia, National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] representative in Washington,  said in the U.S. capital yesterday that the presence of South  African mercenaries in the Angolan civil war is contrary to the  spirit of the UN-mediated Lusaka peace talks.    Ambassador Jardo Muecalia added that the international  community should not allow South African or any other  mercenaries to place under threat whatever successes may already  have been scored in the Zambian capital. That UNITA official's  statement comes in the wake of an announcement by an African  National Congress, ANC, official confirming the involvement of  South African Defense Force soldiers in the Angolan civil war.  That ANC official also voiced concern about that problem.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dusan Drazic] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] On his way back from South Africa to  Belgrade, President Zoran Lilic made a brief stop at Sofia  airport. The two-hour stopover at Sofia airport attracted  considerable attention by the media. More than 20  correspondents from foreign agencies and the Bulgarian media met  President Lilic, who responded to their appeal and answered  several questions concerning the peace initiatives in the  settlement of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia and  relations in the Balkans.    [Drazic] I hope that we are now close to peace in the former  Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was stated by  Zoran Lilic, president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, at  a news conference in the protocol building at Sofia airport this  afternoon, where he spent a short period of time on his way back  to Belgrade from his official visit to the Republic of South  Africa and friendly Greece.    Peace negotiations could successfully be concluded if all  sides in this conflict cared for peace. According to President  Lilic, the step made in Geneva on 13 May -- that peace  negotiations be held with the mediation of the European Union,  including the United States -- is a move that could guarantee  the stabilization of relations in this region.    According to the Yugoslav president, the first and most  important precondition in the peace negotiations is the lifting  of the sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council on  Yugoslavia and the equal treatment of all three sides in the  conflict on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Without  acknowledging the interests of all three sides and without their  agreement, it will be difficult to establish lasting peace,  Lilic said. I hope the international community will also  understand this. This is the correct way to finally settle the  conflict in Bosnia.    One of the conditions is also not to give in under the  pressure of great powers. The Serbian people in Bosnia must be  granted what has already been granted to other peoples of the  former Yugoslavia under the auspices of the United Nations, and  this is the right to self-determination.</p>

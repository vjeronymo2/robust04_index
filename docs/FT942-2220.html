			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / French Socialists make left turn: John Ridding reports on the choice of Mr Henri Emmanuelli as the new party leader Mr Henri Emmanuelli, a blunt, orthodox socialist, will need all his reputed toughness as he tackles his new task. Elected as provisional leader of the French Socialist party on Sunday, following the resignation of Mr Michel Rocard, he inherits a party deep in crisis, facing an uphill struggle to forge unity and win back dis-enchanted voters. His election represents a shift to the left by the Socialists as they seek to rebuild from a hammering in this month's European elections and to recover in time for next year's presidential election. Mr Rocard, defeated in a vote of confidence which he had called following his party's meagre 14.5 per cent support in the European polls, himself admitted that the party suffered from 'uncertain political and strategic positions, confirmed isolation, and an absurd means of operation'. Mr Emmanuelli's task will be to try and overcome the divisions in the party while it addresses its problems and searches for a credible candidate for next year's presidential poll. After defeating Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a former industry minister, by 140 votes to 64, Mr Emmanuelli said it was necessary to consult with militants in the party to ensure cohesion. 'The error of the Socialist party has been that it has been unable to position itself to defend the workers against the threats they face concerning labour protection and social security,' he said, demonstrating his left-wing credentials. A former president of the National Assembly, the 49-year-old Mr Emmanuelli, started his career at the Banque d'Edmond de Rothschild in 1969. The deputy for Landes in south-western France has since established a reputation as an uncompromising figure within the Socialist party. 'He holds very strong views and is a tough opponent,' says one party official. This reputation could complicate his task of steering the Socialists through a delicate transition period. He may be helped, however, by the fact that he is not considered a presidential candidate in his own right. Party officials said he will head the party until a party congress is held, due by the end of the year, and until a presidential candidate can be decided. Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, is clearly favoured by many within the party. A CSA poll published on Saturday suggested that 74 per cent of Socialist supporters want the former finance minister as their presidential candidate. A CSA poll of voters of all parties yesterday put Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister and head of the centre-right coalition, on 48 per cent, one percentage point ahead of Mr Delors, whose support has increased four points in a month. Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the Gaullist RPR party, is on 38 per cent. Mr Laurent Fabius, the former Socialist prime minister and bitter rival of Mr Rocard, said on Saturday that Mr Delors was the person 'best placed' to lead the Socialists into April's presidential contest. Mr Delors, however, has remained enigmatic on his possible return to French politics. Nor is he the only potential candidate. Mr Jack Lang, the former culture minister, has expressed his interest in standing for the presidency. Whoever emerges as the presidential candidate, the daunting challenges facing Mr Emmanuelli and his colleagues are already clear. In addition to the factionalism that has long bedevilled the party and which erupted with a vengeance last weekend, there is the equally fundamental problem of restoring the party's tarnished image. The disenchantment with the Socialists, and their weak appeal to young voters, were clearly demonstrated in the European elections. The Mouvement des Radicaux de Gauche, headed by the beleaguered businessman Mr Bernard Tapie, won 12.3 per cent of the vote, largely at the expense of the Socialists. Whoever runs on the left may need at least the tacit support of Mr Tapie. The backing of President Francois Mitterrand would also be valuable. Many French commentators see Mr Rocard's downfall as the result of a long-running feud with the president. This sentiment was expressed in a front-page cartoon in Le Quotidien which showed Mr Mitterrand being presented with Mr Rocard's head on a plate.</p>

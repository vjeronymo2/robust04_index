			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 8 May (MENA)--PLO Executive Committee member  Samir Ghawshah has stated that no decision has been made yet on  the names of the members of the National Authority Council,  which will take over self-rule responsibility in Gaza and  Jericho. In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Tunis,  Ghawshah said consultations are under way with the Palestinian  leaders in the occupied territories to obtain their agreement to  join the council. He added some leaders have agreed in principle  to participate in the council, others have asked for more time  to think about the subject, while many have declined to  participate for various reasons.    Ghawshah said consultations are continuing between  Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and the diaspora Palestinian  leaders, including members of the PLO Executive Committee and  the Fatah Central Council, to choose 12 members for the council  from the diaspora. The 12 other members will be chosen from the  occupied territories.    Ghawshah said he believes the formation of the council and  the announcement of the names of its members will not be  completed before Wednesday, 11 May, the date when 'Arafat will  deliver to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin a list of the  names of members of the National Authority Council and the  self-rule establishments.    'Arafat continued consultations last night and this morning  with the members of the PLO Executive Committee and the Fatah  Central Council and the representatives of the Palestinian  factions. 'Arafat will continue his consultations today before  leaving for Johannesburg tonight to attend the inauguration of  Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa.    Palestinian sources have stated that a number of prominent  Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories have expressed a  desire not to participate in the National Authority Council.  They include Faysal al-Husayni, Fatah representative in the  West Bank; and Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, chief Palestinian negotiator  at the Washington talks.    Regarding the Palestinian personalities in the diaspora, it  has become certain that Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political  Department, will not participate in the council. The PLO  Political Department will continue to operate from Tunis.  Mahmud 'Abbas, also known as Abu-Mazin, head of the PLO  National and International Relations Department, will also  remain abroad to follow-up the talks on the final phase of the  solution of the Palestinian issue.</p>

The message forwarded on Wednesday expressed hope for  further  development of cooperation between CSCE and Tajikistan. "It is  not only Tajikistan that is interested in CSCE, but CSCE is  interested in Tajikistan as well; therefore, it is extremely  important to develop the concept of" Tajikistan being CSCE  southern gates," the message said.    Alimov pointed out that CSCE might render Tajikistan not  only  economic and technical assistance, but help carry out market  reforms in the republic and hold general democratic elections in  autumn, 1994.    Touching upon the internal situation in Tajikistan, the  Tajik  Foreign Minister pointed out that the Tajik Government  reiterates its adherence to the sublime idea of a law-governed  democratic country and regards this process as a long and  difficult road leading, primarily, to comprehensive guarantees  and defence of human rights in the country. It was pointed out  in the message that unless reliable guarantees of human rights  are ensured all other democratic principles are pointless.    According to the Tajik minister, Tajik leaders managed to  achieve certain stabilisation in the republic and begin the  restoration of the economy. Military operations have been  practically ceased in the republic. Efforts made to this end  helped reach certain social and political stabilisation and the  cessation of military operations on the Tajik territory.    It was announced that a nationwide referendum would be held  on problems of the Tajik statehood and general democratic  elections scheduled in autumn, 1994. Declaring their readiness  for a dialogue with political forces of different orientation,  Tajik authorities are taking concrete measures to launch  negotiations with their opponents in the near future.    These talks are expected to be attended by the special envoy  of the U.N. secretary general in Tajikistan, Ramiro Ballona.</p>

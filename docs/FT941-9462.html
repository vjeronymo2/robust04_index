			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Slow increase in sales points to 'patchy' recovery Business in shops, stores and supermarkets increased at the slowest rate for a year last month, according to the Confederation of British Industry. The CBI's monthly survey of distributive trades shows small retailers as performing badly. While large multiple stores saw their sales grow significantly in January, smaller shops reported a decline. Larger retailers however were more optimistic. The survey shows that of stores with more than one outlet, the balance of those reporting an increase in sales over those reporting falls was 32 per cent. This contrasted with a net balance of 16 per cent of retailers with a single outlet reporting declines. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said the figures highlighted the patchy nature of the recovery. 'Although only four sectors report slight falls in volumes, most sectors still say that sales are below average for the time of year,' he said. The survey comes ahead of official figures for January's retail sales, to be published tomorrow. Before today's survey these were expected to show an improvement, largely due to New Year sales, after a decline in December. The findings of the survey will come as a disappointment after recent trading statements which painted a more optimistic picture of the retail sector. Mr Whittaker said: 'Looking ahead, prospects for retailers have changed little from December. The increase in sales in February is expected to be only slightly higher than the growth recorded in January. Expectations are the weakest since last May, pointing to continued modest growth in high-street demand.' The survey shows that there were increases in sales across most sectors, with booksellers, stationers, grocers, footwear and leather retailers among those showing the best improvement. But specialist food shops, confectioners and hardware, china and DIY retailers all reported that volumes are down on a year ago and all other sectors reported similar slow growth rates. Growth in wholesalers' sales volumes increased in January. They remain above average for the time of year. However, the survey reports that both wholesalers' and retailers' stock levels are still too high in relation to expected demand. Motor traders had a better start to the year, growing at the highest rate since August 1988, and business is considered to be well above average for the time of year.</p>

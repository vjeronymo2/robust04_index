			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Disposals put Midland &amp; Scottish back in black MIDLAND &amp; Scottish Resources, the USM-quoted oil production company, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.8m for 1990 - the company's first positive result since 1983 - reflecting the sale of two drilling units for Pounds 9.7m. The results are the first to be announced since the company launched a Pounds 149m rights issue last year to fund the purchase of the world's largest floating production rig for the Emerald oilfield east of Shetland. The rig is due to be delivered in 1993. But the company was unable to produce any oil last year following the late delivery of a similar rig from Davy, the contractor. Midland has now received a preliminary court judgement on its case claiming damages against Davy and been awarded full legal costs. The rig will now be hooked up in mid-June with production to start later this year. In addition, the company is seeking to acquire additional oil acreage and has agreed terms to buy a North Sea block with recoverable reserves of 30m barrels. Turnover was Pounds 3m compared with Pounds 735,000 in the previous year.</p>

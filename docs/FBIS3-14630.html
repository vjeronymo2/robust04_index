			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Closeup" Column by Salamah Ahmad Salamah: "Normalization </F> of Relations With Iraq"]    [Text] The Arab countries can no longer escape  reconsidering their position on Iraq on a purely realistic,  practical, and pragmatic basis free from emotion. The Arab  countries should reconsider their stance on Iraq based on  accurate, logical, rational, and long-term calculations to serve  the Arab nation's interests, and even the interests of the  neighboring countries that have been subjected to aggression  from the current Iraqi regime.    After more than three years since the Gulf War, which led to  the collapse of the old Arab system without bringing down the  Iraqi regime, and in view of the failure of all efforts to  establish a new system capable of assimilating Arab and  international changes, it is necessary for the Arab world to  look for other ways to bring the Iraqi regime back into the  fold. The Arab world should not leave Iraq in its isolation at  the mercy of the international forces, primarily the United  States and Britain, which seek to use the current situation for  their own interests.    What happened at the UN Security Council recently indicates  that the international alliance, which was opposed to Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait and also encouraged Saddam Husayn and  provided him with weapons and nuclear capability that made him  the bully of the Gulf, has been beset by clear rifts. These  rifts appeared in the differences among the Security Council  members over the statement that it releases periodically on the  extent of Iraq's compliance with Resolution 715 on subjecting  its military resources to international supervision, which is a  condition for lifting international sanctions.    France, Russia, and the PRC believe that there is a need to  note in the statement the "progress" Iraq made in destroying  banned arms instead of issuing the usual arbitrary statement on  which the United States and Britain insist, a statement that  maintains that Iraq has not complied with all the necessary  conditions to lift the sanctions. By insisting on this usual  statement the United States and Britain seek to achieve goals to  entrench the current division of the Arab world, a division that  will only increase Iranian influence and deepen suspicions and  fragmentation within the Gulf Cooperation Council itself.    The United States usually uses the stick and carrot in its  dealings, even with North Korea, but it only uses the stick with  Iraq. France and Russia believe that "encouraging" Iraq by  giving it time to watch its behavior and note its progress will  motivate it to cooperate in all areas, notably recognition of  the state of Kuwait.    It is strange indeed that when foreign countries are seeking  to "normalize" ties with Iraq, the Arab countries, which are  racing to normalize ties with Israel, find no justification to  even consider reaching a minimum level of normalization with  Iraq.</p>

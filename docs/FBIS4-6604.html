			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter to the editor from Finance Minister Sam Rangsi; date </F> not given]    [Text] In Mr Michael Vickery's article entitled "Phnom Penh  power plays" and published in your April 15, edition, the writer  spoke of a "FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent,  Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] faction, probably  centered on Sam Rangsi, which is lukewarm towards monarchy,  especially of the Sihanouk variety."    Strangely, within the space of just a few words, Mr Vickery  managed to make two basic errors of fact with reference to  myself. First, it is completely mistaken to believe that I lead,  or indeed am part of, any "faction" within the FUNCINPEC party.  Second, to suggest that I -- together with a "faction" within  FUNCINPEC -- am anything but completely devoted to the monarchy  and, in particular, to the person of His Majesty the King is not  only deeply insulting but also indicates a profound ignorance of  my views and of Cambodian politics.    [Signed] Sam Rangsi    Ministry of State    Minister of Economics and Finance    Cambodia</p>

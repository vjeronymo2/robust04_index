			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Coalition Alternatives"] </F>   [Text] Cadca -- All Slovak National Party [SNS] District  Councils in Slovakia have quickly recovered from the departure  of some members for the National Democratic Party--New  Alternative. Since the Extraordinary SNS Assembly, which was  held in Zilina in February, party membership has increased from  6,000 to approximately 6,700. This was stated by the SNS  Central Council during a meeting in Cadca on Saturday [9 April].  Information on the meeting was provided by SNS Chairman Jan  Slota and SNS Honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes.    The SNS Central Council also considered the possibilities of  forming a coalition for the upcoming parliamentary elections.  The proposal was put forward to form a coalition partnership  with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], but only in  the event of the formation of pre-election blocs --a left-wing  bloc, a right-wing bloc, and a national bloc.    The SNS Central Council protests against the decision by  Slovak President Michal Kovac to annul the results of citizens'  petition for a referendum. The president preferred intrigues to  a democratic solution to the problem, delegates stated in their  contributions.    The SNS Central Council issued a statement on the political  situation, which it addressed to the citizens of Slovakia. It  states, among other things: "A dangerous development has  occurred on the Slovak political scene. Under the formal cloak  of democracy, political culture and ethics have been trampled  underfoot, the regular results of the free elections of 1992  have been reversed, and power has been seized by political  entities that were either defeated in the free elections or did  not even exist at that time. This situation is reminiscent of  the elections of 1948 when Klement Gottwald usurped power in the  former Czechoslovak Republic....    "Political purges have been set in motion and an endeavor  has  been launched to liquidate the sole opposition daily, REPUBLIKA.  There is speculation that the September election date might be  postponed," the statement says. A dirty role is played in this  process by a greater part of the mass media.    The present government's distrust of the Slovak Republic's  independence is borne out by its downright Milovy-style  capitulationism [reference to February 1992 draft treaty  concluded between Czech and Slovak leaders in Milovy on the  future shape of Czech-Slovak coexistence, which was subsequently  rejected by Slovak Parliament as capitulationist] in its  negotiations with the Czech Republic in the Customs Union  Council, as a result of which the Slovak Republic will incur  losses of hundreds of millions of korunas. It is borne out by  the secret agreements between the current government coalition  and Hungarian political parties that do not conceal their  irredentism. The SNS emphatically demands the publication of  these agreements. Citizens of the Slovak Republic have the  right to get to know their contents. In conclusion, the SNS  appeals to citizens not to yield to hopelessness and apathy and  to express their attitude toward the Slovak Republic in the next  elections.    [Bratislava SMENA in Slovak on 11 April on page 2 carries a  600-word interview with SNS Chairman Jan Slota by SMENA reporter  Marian Hudec entitled "The Party Is Stabilized." In the  interview, the place and date of which are not given, Slota  discusses the results of the Cadca meeting of the SNS Central  Council. He confirms that the district organizations "tend to  favor" the party's independent ticket for the fall elections and  that only "in the event of the formation of pre-election blocs"  would the SNS contest the elections jointly with the HZDS and,  possibly, the Christian Social Union. Slota also reiterates the  party's demand for the publication of the agreement concluded  between the government coalition and the Hungarian political  parties, saying that "the Slovak nation wants to know for how  many Judas's silverlings it was concluded." In his concluding  reply, Slota denies that the SNS leadership would meet with  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia, during his expected visit to Slovakia. "We did not  invite him to Slovakia and do not consider establishing any  contacts with him," Slota says.]</p>

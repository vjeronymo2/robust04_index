			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with Yun Ho-chin, North Korean </F> representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency and  councillor at the DPRK Mission in Vienna, by an unidentified  correspondent on 10 June -- place not given]    [Text] In connection with China's abstaining from voting,  Yun Ho-chin, North Korean representative to the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and councillor at the DPRK Mission  in Vienna, said on 10 June: "Even if China takes part in the  sanctions, there is nothing to be surprised about. China has  its own opinion and we live according to our own opinion."    [Correspondent] What do you think about the IAEA adopting  the resolution?    [Yun Ho-chin] We are finished with the IAEA. We cannot  accept the IAEA's conduct in which it is distorting the truth in  accordance with the direction and theory of the United States.    [Correspondent] Then will you withdraw from the IAEA?    [Yun] No. However, the resolution has the same meaning as  telling us to withdraw.    [Correspondent] What will happen if you do not receive any  technological assistance?    [Yun] In reality, it has been suspended since last year. If  an objective third party studies and assesses our proposal on  the discharge and measurement of the fuel rods, all the  technological problems will be solved.    [Correspondent] What will you do now?    [Yun] We will take strong countermeasures. If someone tries  to kill us we must defend ourselves.    [Correspondent] What do you mean by a strong countermeasure?    [Yun] That will be decided upon by Pyongyang.    [Correspondent] Will you reprocess plutonium in three months  time from the replaced fuel rods?    [Yun] I am not in the position to talk about this matter,  but if necessary it will be carried out. Even if reprocessing  work is carried out, we will not notify the IAEA [chaechorirul  hadorado iaeae tongbohal gosunopta].</p>

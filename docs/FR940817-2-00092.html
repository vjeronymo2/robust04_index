			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As previously discussed, the Agency interprets section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 211(f)(4) of the Act as establishing a two-stage process for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluating waiver applications. The first stage requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA determine whether an applicant has met its burden of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrating that a fuel does not cause or contribute to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure to meet regulated emission standards. Unless EPA finds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the waiver applicant has met this burden, a waiver may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be granted. The second stage of the process reflects the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretionary nature of the waiver authority provided to the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator by the statute. In this second stage, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator may consider other factors in determining whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> granting a waiver is in the public interest and consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the objectives of the Clean Air Act. In this stage, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator has broad discretion in selecting the issues to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examined and in balancing the potential positive and negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of a waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of the pending waiver application, as remanded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to EPA by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and resubmitted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl, I determined on November 30, 1993 that use of Ethyl's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product HiTEC 3000 in unleaded gasoline at the specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration will not cause or contribute to a failure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve compliance with vehicle emission standards. The data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis upon which this determination was based are described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV above. The data submitted by Ethyl in connection with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this waiver application satisfy all of the quantitative criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for determining whether an additive will ``cause or contribute'' to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a failure to meet emission standards previously utilized by EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, EPA has serious reservations concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present suitability of these criteria. In light of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intractability of the nation's air pollution problems, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering adoption of new criteria which would be utilized in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessing future waiver applications. However, for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl's present application, EPA concluded that it would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to make the required determination concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission effects by utilizing a new methodology or new criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning which Ethyl was not afforded any prior notice. My  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision that Ethyl has met the requisite statutory burden for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of the present waiver application is also based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency's assessment of the newest data provided by Ethyl on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> newer-technology vehicles which do not, when evaluated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separately, indicate any statistically significant increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated vehicle emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency remains concerned about the possible effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuels containing MMT on the functioning of onboard diagnostics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (OBD) equipment. At the time that EPA completed the assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of emissions issues underlying my finding concerning emissions on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 30, 1993, the evidence to support the assertions by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automakers that MMT would prevent the oxygen sensors in OBD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems from operating properly was quite limited and these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assertions had not at that time been tested in any actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles utilizing OBD systems. I expressed concern about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of MMT on OBD systems at that time, and indicated that if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA ultimately concluded that MMT could prevent proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functioning of OBD systems, the Agency would consider appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action under Clean Air Act section 211(c). Since that time, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford Motor Company has submitted further research involving use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of fuel containing MMT in an actual vehicle equipped with an OBD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system, which Ford contends demonstrates that manganese oxides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from MMT use prevent the oxygen sensors in its OBD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems from functioning properly. EPA intends to fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigate the significance of these findings. If further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation supports the concerns expressed by Ford and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automakers, EPA intends to initiate an appropriate rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 211(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since I determined that Ethyl had met its burden regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ``cause or contribute'' finding required by the statute, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency has been reviewing other issues bearing on the exercise of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> my discretionary authority to grant or deny Ethyl the requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver for use in unleaded gasoline, focusing in particular on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potential effects of manganese emissions resulting from use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of MMT on public health and welfare.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency remains concerned regarding the issue of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manganese emissions from vehicles utilizing fuels containing MMT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From a hazard identification perspective, manganese can clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be toxic to the central nervous system, the respiratory system,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the male reproductive system. The level of manganese which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may safely be breathed over a lifetime is not known with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precision. EPA has assessed potential health risks associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with potential exposures utilizing a Reference Concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (RfC), which is defined as an estimate (with uncertainty spanning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perhaps an order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure level for the human population (including sensitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpopulations) that is likely to be without appreciable risk of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deleterious noncancer effects during a lifetime of exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beginning with existing data on the effects of manganese  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposures, the Agency utilized its standard procedure to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a verified Reference Concentration (RfC) of 0.05 &mu;g/m3. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to comments and criticisms by Ethyl and others, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency then utilized a variety of additional techniques to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider potential alternative RfC's based on additional data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the occupational exposure study on which the current RfC is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based (discussed in detail in Section VI&hyph;B&hyph;4 above). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> techniques judged by EPA scientists to be most appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced alternative candidate RfC's ranging from 0.09 to 0.2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &mu;g/m3. Since any formal revision of the present verified RfC of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.05 &mu;g/m3 based on the ORD reassessment will occur in the future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and could not be completed prior to the deadline for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision, I have evaluated the potential health effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with use of MMT in unleaded gasoline based on all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the likely values, focusing in particular on a potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative RfC of 0.1 &mu;g/m3 and the present RfC of 0.05 &mu;g/m3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utilizing the newest and most accurate data available on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal exposures to particulate emissions of manganese from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicular sources, Agency scientists also prepared an exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis in which they attempted to predict the range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases in personal exposure to particulate manganese that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would occur in Riverside, California urban areas if MMT were to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used in all unleaded gasoline. If MMT were utilized in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unleaded gasoline at the specified concentration in urban areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to Riverside, California, the Agency's exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment predicts that the exposures of forty to fifty percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the population in such areas to airborne manganese levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would exceed the present verified RfC of 0.05 &mu;g/m3, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposures of five to ten percent would exceed manganese levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding a potential alternative RfC of 0.1 &mu;g/m3. Although it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is impossible to state whether a health risk would definitely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist at the projected exposure levels, neither can the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility of such a risk be ruled out.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel by </F> Catherine Bernard in Stockholm; date not given: "Sweden Opposes  Notion of `Scandinavian Bloc' Within European Union"]    [Text] [Bernard] What do you think will be the outcome of  the European Parliament's vote [on the enlargement agreement] on  Wednesday [4 May]?    [Dinkelspiel] There is no doubt that a majority of Euro-MP's  [members of the European Parliament] are in favor of  enlargement. What is somewhat worrying me is that MP's might not  reach the quorum to produce the required absolute majority.  However, according to information in our possession, the  outlook seems good.    [Bernard] What would happen should the vote turn out  negative?    [Dinkelspiel] The whole enlargement process would be frozen.  To be sure, the new Parliament would have the option of picking  up the issue in the fall. But should enlargement be rejected  this week, it would be because of institutional quarrels, and I  cannot imagine how the issue could be settled within six months.    [Bernard] Which changes would Sweden like to see implemented  in European Union [EU] institutions within the scope of the 1996  revision of the Maastricht treaty?    [Dinkelspiel] I do not think that it is very polite to  discuss a club's statutes even before becoming a member.  Anyway, it was made clear from the start that enlargement would  take place according to the regulations currently in force.  However, an EU enlargement to 20 to 25 members will require  reforms, which smaller countries are especially interested in.  The EU cannot have 30 commissioners, and its Parliament cannot  consist of 1,000 members.    [Bernard] Is it possible to simplify decisionmaking  processes without decreasing the influence of smaller countries?    [Dinkelspiel] I for one am not a federalist. But in a  number of areas, such as the environment, I would prefer that  decisions be made by simple majority rather than unanimity.    [Bernard] Will the Scandinavian "bloc," i.e., Sweden,  Finland, Norway, and Denmark, attempt to steer the EU in a  particular direction?    [Dinkelspiel] I do not think we will act as a bloc. The  Spanish foreign minister recently noted that Spain's voting  record at the United Nations has been closer to that of Sweden  than that of other European countries. On the other hand,  Scandinavian countries do have common values that they will  uphold, such as environmental protection, social security,  equality between sexes, and free trade. In the short term, I  believe that the EU has a major role to play in two areas: the  fight against unemployment and peacekeeping.    [Bernard] Swedish public opinion, however, seems as yet not  convinced of this. A majority remains opposed to EU membership.  How do you plan to change their mind before the referendum,  which is scheduled for November?    [Dinkelspiel] First of all, we need to challenge a number of  myths, such as the one that says we would be compelled to enter  into a military union. But we also must go beyond the purely  economic debate that has been dominant so far. Here, a crucial  factor is the attitude of the left (social democrats), which  must be more openly pro-European so that EU membership does not  look like the right's pet project.    [Bernard] Do you think the referendum's outcome will be  positive?    [Dinkelspiel] It is not going to be easy. Each and every  supporter of EU membership will have to rise to the fight. But  I do believe Sweden will say yes in the end.</p>

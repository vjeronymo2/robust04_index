			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / The Property Market: Market slow to buy retail stock The revival in property share prices promised to make this spring a golden opportunity for property companies to join the stock market. But this week's placing and open offer by Capital Shopping Centres, a Pounds 830m retail company, met with a lukewarm response. CSC is the retail property arm of TransAtlantic, the insurance and property group. Its sponsor, Robert Fleming, has succeeded in placing 65 per cent of the Pounds 209m-worth of shares on offer with institutions, the remainder being on offer to the public until March 23. However, few analysts expect the shares to provide quick profits. The problem is not that the company lacks attractions. It will be the sixth largest property company on the market and, as the owner of seven of the UK's most prominent shopping centres, it is the market's only large retail sector specialist. Moreover, its high-quality assets, low level of borrowings and good rental growth prospects should ensure a steady rise in its income. Mr David Tunstall of Smith New Court, brokers, says it has 'the best dividend growth prospects of any company in the sector'. One reason why the company has not caught the market's imagination is that this is not the first time shareholders have been offered minority shares in TransAtlantic's property interests. CSC is composed of the retail property interests of Capital &amp; Counties, a long-established property group, which was listed on the stock exchange until 1992 when TransAtlantic acquired its minority interests. But the main reason is the offer is perceived to be too expensive. The shares have been priced at a 13 per cent premium to net asset value, which looks expensive compared with the rest of the sector. Mr Chris Turner of BZW believes that the company's lack of gearing will hold back growth in its net asset value. Even a 25 per cent rise in property values over the next two years might be insufficient to stimulate a rise in share price - if property shares return to being valued at a substantial discount to asset values. These criticisms rile Mr Donald Gordon, the company's chairman. 'They don't realise it is a situation with tremendous upwards potential.' Mr Gordon contends that the company's valuers have underestimated the true worth of the company's assets. According to the prospectus, the directors 'do not believe that . . . this value properly reflects the long-term investment worth of the regional shopping centres in the London area'. Their argument carries a certain weight, as shopping centres have tended to perform relatively well compared with competitors in the high street. But investors are concerned about a possible competitive threat to CSC's flagship centre, a 1.32m sq ft shopping centre at Thurrock, which accounts for about half its total assets. Blue Circle, the cement company, has drawn up plans for a rival shopping centre, Bluewater Park, at Dartford in Kent. Analysts estimate that the close proximity of the rival centre could take 20 per cent of Thurrock's shoppers. Mr Gordon is sanguine about the rival scheme. 'I personally would welcome some competition,' he says. 'We have a vast educational problem in re-educating the shopping public that shopping is a joy to do instead of being a chore.'</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Authorities shake-up could boost spending Local government reorganisation in England and Wales could bring a sharp rise in spending and hamper managerial reforms, the Audit Commission warns today. In England and Wales the government plans to replace the current two-tier system of counties and districts with new single-tier 'unitary' authorities, based on amalgamations of districts, in 1996 and 1997. The commission, which acts as a watchdog for the public sector, says this will be the most complex local government reorganisation yet attempted. But councils are not preparing for the change, it says, and some newly created authorities 'could start life in a financial crisis, possibly inheriting high spending commitments and low balances from outgoing councils'. 'Outgoing' authorities, whose abolition is certain, may wish to enter into 'costly and long-term' commitments, unimpeded by any need for long-term budgeting, according to the commission's report. Figures for building new swimming pools - a local government responsibility  -suggest that outgoing local authorities spent freely before the last reorganisation to affect non-metropolitan England and Wales, in 1974. In that year, 160 new swimming pools were opened, and more than 100 the next year. But from 1977 to 1990, the number opened never exceeded 50. The report says: 'The Audit Commission is aware that some councils facing reorganisation are already planning to commission new projects.' Reallocating needs-based government grants to the new councils could also be expensive. Mr Bob Chilton, director of local government studies for the commission, said grants to county councils were currently redistributive, because they tended to spend equally across the areas they covered. If smaller unitary authorities were created, needier districts would receive more, while the wealthier areas would receive less, under the government's formula. Mr Chilton suggested that the government might be forced to pay out extra funds to reduce the effects on the 'loser' councils. Compulsory competitive tendering of white-collar services could also be damaged, and delayed. Mr Chilton said: 'There are two separate reform processes which do not mesh.' He said some authorities were using impending reorganisation as an excuse not to prepare for the next round of tendering, which is scheduled to start 18 months after the new councils are formed. More basic preparations are also lacking. By the end of last year, 40 per cent of district and 30 per cent of counties had still failed to compile full registers of council assets - supposed to be completed nine months earlier.

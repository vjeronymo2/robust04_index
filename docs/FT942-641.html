			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Soundtracs shows 22% interim rise Encouraging economic activity in the US helped Soundtracs, the USM-quoted maker of audio equipment, to increase first half sales by 29 per cent to Pounds 3.32m resulting in pre-tax profits up 22 per cent, from Pounds 251,000 to Pounds 307,000. Mr Todd Wells, chairman, said that growth had been sustained in spite of flat sales in central Europe and disappointing results in Japan. The result, for the six months to April 30, included a maiden full contribution from Spendor loudspeakers. Earnings per share were up 23 per cent to 2.05p (1.67p) and an unchanged interim dividend of 0.92p is declared.</p>

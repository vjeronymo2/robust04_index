			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Spain set to reject budget compromise SPAIN is likely to reject British proposals to break the deadlock over the Delors II plan for future financing of the Community. The British presidency's compromise keeps the same ceiling on revenue of 1.25 per cent of EC gross national product, but allocates marginal increases in transfers to poorer member states. It also adds small amounts to spending on policies like research and development and foreign policy, which France in particular is keen to see. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, had originally proposed a one-third increase in the EC budget, raising the revenue base from its ceiling of 1.2 per cent to 1.37 per cent by 1997. This would have meant an increase in the annual Community budget from Ecu66.8bn (Pounds 54bn) now to Ecu87.5bn in 1997, in today's money. Mr Delors subsequently suggested raising the revenue ceiling to 1.32 per cent of GNP by 1999, increasing the budget to Ecu86.2bn (in 1992 money) by then, and giving the poorer countries close to the doubling in development aid the Commission originally planned. Spain - in alliance with Ireland, Portugal, Greece and the Commission - had said the UK's suggested ceiling was unacceptable. Last night Spanish officials said formally they were still studying the new proposals, but privately they dismissed them as a non-starter. The main changes in the UK proposal are to add an extra Ecu1.25bn to the cohesion fund over 1993 to 1999, raising it to Ecu13.5bn, and to increase slightly structural funds for backward regions. The cohesion fund, created at Maastricht on Spanish insistence, is to help Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece to meet EC environmental standards and build up transport links with the rest of Europe. The structural funds, however, apportion much more to the EC's backward regions, located largely in these countries. It is these funds which will be the main battlefield in today's negotiations. The European Commission, supported by such countries as France, Belgium and Luxembourg, has said it fears today's debate could polarise between the rich north and poorer south.</p>

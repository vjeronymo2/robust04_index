			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Flotation of Qantas may include global offer MR RALPH Willis, the Australian finance minister, yesterday raised the possibility of an international offering of Qantas shares in the planned public flotation, scheduled for next year. Mr Willis said the international offering option depended on the outcome of the current trade sale. Both British Airways and Singapore Airlines have lodged bids for shareholdings in Qantas. Mr Willis also announced that the underwriters for the flotation would be ANZ McCaughan Securities, County NatWest Australia, CS First Boston Australia and Potter Warburg. The bitterly-contested take-over bid by Campbell Soup, the US food group, for Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, has spilled over into the courts. Campbell yesterday applied to the Supreme Court of New South Wales to resolve an earlier agreement which may restrict Campbell's voting rights. Arnotts asserts that the agreement, made in 1985, prevents Campbell from voting more than 14.9 per cent of Arnotts stock, even if Campbell achieves minority control of the company. Campbell yesterday said it disagreed with this assertion and was seeking a hearing to have the issue resolved. Campbell, which already controls 33 per cent of Arnotts' shares, is bidding Dollars A8.80 a share for the balance. The offer values Arnotts at Dollars A1.2bn (USDollars 833m). Howard Smith, the shipping group, has claimed success in its Dollars A115.5m takeover bid for Alexandra Towing, the UK tug operator, claiming 91.7 per cent of Alexandra's capital. The offer, which still requires clearance from UK regulatory authorities, will remain open indefinitely. North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian resources group, has bought Girdlestone Pumps of the UK for an undisclosed sum.</p>

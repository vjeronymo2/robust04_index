			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Rolls-Royce to shed 1,000 more jobs ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine and industrial power group, is to shed an additional 1,000 jobs in its UK aerospace operations next year because of continuing difficult trading conditions in its civil and defence aero-engine businesses. The latest restructuring, confirmed yesterday by the company, will increase the total of job cuts in its aerospace activities to 3,000 next year on top of the 3,000 jobs it is losing this year. The company announced last year that it planned to shed 5,000 jobs in 1993 and 1994 in the face of the prolonged recession in the civil aerospace market and the post-cold war downturn in the defence sector. It said the need to make additional reductions at its aero-engine plants in Derby, Bristol, Sunderland, East Kilbride and Hillingdon, near Glasgow, followed a continuing review of requirements. The company has not ruled out compulsory redundancies. Although Rolls-Royce this week announced new civil aero-engine orders worth about Pounds 150m, it said overall conditions in the civil aircraft market were not improving. It added that the Pounds 230m provisions it made in its 1992 accounts to cover the two-year 1993-94 restructuring programme would also cover the additional 1,000 job cuts next year. In total, the company will now see its aerospace workforce reduced from 29,000 people at the end of last year to 23,000 by the end of next year. The additional cuts are expected to involve about 350 jobs at Bristol, where the company's military engine business is concentrated, about 140 jobs at Derby, the centre for civil engines, with the rest spread around the company's other UK plants. The UK group is facing intense commercial pressures from its two bigger US competitors, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, which have also been engaged in heavy restructuring. All three big aero-engine makers are fighting to win new business in a diminishing market depressed by airline losses, overcapacity and defence spending cuts. Rolls-Royce, whose aero-engine activities mustered a profit of only Pounds 5m on aero-engine sales of Pounds 1.078bn in the first half of this year, is also facing heavy research and development spending on its new generation of high-thrust Trent engines. These are to power the new large wide-body aircraft being developed by Boeing of the US and the European Airbus consortium. Sir Ralph Robins, Rolls-Royce chairman, recently said he did not expect to see any recovery in the civil aircraft market before 1995 or 1996.</p>

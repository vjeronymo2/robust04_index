			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA has waived prior notice and opportunity for public comment on this rule because it believes that such prior notice and opportunity for public comment, at this time, would be contrary to public interest within the meaning of section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final MCSAP rule published on September 8, 1992, indicated that States must achieve compatibility with Federal safety rules within published Tolerance Guidelines by October 1, 1994, the first day of Federal fiscal year 1995. Based on State submissions for Federal fiscal year 1994, the FHWA now believes that 13 States have not yet achieved an acceptable level of compliance for intrastate safety rules and, unless changes are made in such State laws, these States will lose all MCSAP funding on October 1, 1994. Each of these States, however, has achieved full interstate compliance and substantial intrastate compliance. The FHWA has decided that it should revise the amount of MCSAP funds subject to reduction due to a lack of intrastate compatibility to ensure that important safety programs may be continued in the States while providing an incentive to States to achieve further intrastate compatibility with Federal motor carrier safety rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By promulgating an interim final rule at this time, the FHWA hopes to provide State legislatures sufficient time to consider amendments to State laws, if necessary. Typically, State legislatures meet during the first three months of the calendar year. While the FHWA notes that the effect of this interim final rule is to lessen the reduction in MCSAP funds States will experience unless they revise their intrastate rules, the FHWA also recognizes that this action will reinforce for the States the consequences of this incompatibility. Concurrent with this action, the FHWA is writing to the 13 affected States explaining the basis for determining that their intrastate rules do not fall within the Tolerance Guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Likewise, the FHWA believes that adopting an interim final rule at this time will provide State agencies with adequate time to adjust their programs to accommodate lower MCSAP funding levels before October 1, 1994. If the FHWA delays this action to accept public comment before taking the action, the FHWA believes that States will not have adequate notice before October 1, 1994, to take action to avoid the reduction in MCSAP funds or to plan accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, the FHWA finds that it would be contrary to the public interest to provide notice and opportunity for public comment before issuing this rule. Nevertheless, the FHWA is opening a public docket for this rule and providing 60 days for the receipt of public comment. The FHWA will consider all comments received during this 60 day period in determining whether any revision is necessary to the rule published today. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA has determined that this document does not contain significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 or a significant regulation under the regulatory polices and procedures of the DOT. It is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal; therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. There should be no economic impact on private entities as the action is entirely related to adjusting distribution of funds to public entities to maintain or enhance enforcement of safety regulations. This rule will allow the 13 States with identified intrastate incompatibilities to remain in the MCSAP at a 50 percent funding level. The additional funds made available from these incompatible States will potentially provide increased funding for innovative and high priority projects for the States with comprehensive programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this rule on small entities. Based on the evaluation, the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule relates to the requirements States must meet to qualify for Federal funding under the MCSAP. This rule does not impose any direct requirement on small entities that will result in increased economic costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612. This is a grant program to induce States to adopt compatible safety regulations. The effect of the change adopted today will be to reduce the impact on States that have made substantial efforts to adopt compatible regulations, but which do not fully comply. The action increases the individual discretion of States which would otherwise lose access to Federal funds because of exemptions and other tolerances applicable to wholly intrastate transportation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

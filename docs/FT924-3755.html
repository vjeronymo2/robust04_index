			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Channel 5 TV consortium meets deadline on funding A NEW national television channel looked increasingly likely last night after Channel Five Holdings, the only bidder for the franchise, met a critical deadline on funding. The Independent Television Commission confirmed that documents showing at least 70 per cent of the project was financed had been delivered at 5.30pm. A decision on whether or not to award the franchise will be taken by the ITC on December 17. It is believed that in addition to Thames Television, the main driving force behind Channel Five Holdings, the project has the backing of Time Warner, the world's largest media group. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has also written to the ITC saying that it would like to invest in Channel 5. The new channel will be capable of reaching up to 70 per cent of the UK population, but before it goes on air millions of video recorders have to be retuned. Many are tuned to the frequency that Channel 5 will use and will suffer interference. Channel Five Holdings was the only bidder for the franchise, and was thus able to bid the minimum Pounds 1,000 a year. Unlike most ITV companies it will not have to pay an additional levy on advertising revenues. The consortium, which needs to raise about Pounds 150m, plans to launch a series of city-based stations starting with London as early as next July. The format will be influenced by Toronto's City-TV channel, with emphasis on local news, films and music. If the ITC gives the go ahead, ITV's London companies Carlton Television and London Weekend Television will be the first to face competition for advertising revenues. However it will need to be convinced that the retuning can be successfully carried out before deciding to award the franchise. Developments in the method of broadcasting, which it is claimed will greatly reduce the need for new aerials, have increased confidence in the new channel. Channel Five Holdings hopes to take the concept of City-TV to other UK cities such as Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow throughout the decade in co-operation with local partners. The channel would also be broadcast by the Astra satellite, giving immediate access to 3m homes. ITV in competition row, Page 4</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by Michel </F> Colomes and Christian Makarian; place and date not given: "We  Know That the Serbs Have Transferred Their More Recent Equipment  to Other Areas"]    [Text] [LE POINT] Are you still satisfied with the  ultimatum and its impact?    [Leotard] We can be satisfied. We had a specific objective  limited to Sarajevo, with requirements we set and which are  currently being met. However, this result is not enough. Other  objectives remain to be achieved. First of all, the siege must  be lifted. It must be possible to enter and exit Sarajevo  freely, and humanitarian convoys must be able to enter the city  as a matter of course. France has just submitted a new  resolution to the Security Council.    Then, unfortunately, there is more to the crisis than just  Sarajevo. We must enforce the resolutions already passed --  there are 49 of them!    [LE POINT] Are you not worried about the risk of seeing the  Serbs transferring to other fronts the equipment they have  withdrawn from Sarajevo?    [Leotard] This is not a risk, it is a fact. Information in  our possession shows that the equipment placed under UN control  is rather old, while equipment withdrawn beyond the 20 kilometer  interdiction zone, as well as that concentrated in the Pale  area, is much more recent and powerful. This is precisely why  we must now turn to other enclaves, which are besieged by Serbs,  Bosnians, or Croats.    [LE POINT] The reopening of Tuzla airport is your next  objective, with a deadline set for 18 March. But do you have  enough men to achieve this?    [Leotard] Personnel is a problem throughout the former  Yugoslavia. The UN secretary general has been asking for  additional forces for months. Enforcing a peace plan will  require several ten thousand men. For example, we now control  around Sarajevo a zone which went from roughly 1,200 square km  to 13,000 square km. Mere arithmetical thinking would tell us  that we therefore need 10 times as many men. This is far from  being the case. Thus we deployed four French helicopters from  the Split detachment; they are able to go from one hill to the  next, and therefore to greatly increase Blue Helmet intervention  and prevention capabilities. While it has decided not to send  in more troops, France proposes a different arrangement in the  field, such as transferring an additional French battalion from  Bihac to Sarajevo, for example.    [LE POINT] Can we hope to see the Americans taking part in  this effort?    [Leotard] We certainly hope so. But at the same time, we  must also point out that there are American soldiers in the air,  American soldiers in the Adriatic, American pilots in Italy,  American foot soldiers in Macedonia, American doctors in Zagreb.  What is missing is the most important element: foot soldiers  in Bosnia. We also need to bear in mind that Washington  promised to send an infantry contingent as a contribution to  enforcing a potential peace settlement. On this issue, I would  also like to add that if every European country made the same  effort as France has, we would have all the human capacity we  need. France said so at the latest European Council in  Copenhagen, but we could not make ourselves heard. This is a  worrisome tendency on the part of Europe, which does not view  this crisis as one that can be dealt with primarily and  essentially by the Europeans.    [LE POINT] You have just released a White Paper on French  defense for the next 20 years which opens a debate on what the  missions of the French Armed Forces should be. Traditionally,  such missions are presented as consisting of three circles.  First circle: Europe and Central Europe, where all our forces  would be engaged. Second circle: external actions, for  instance in the Mediterranean. Third circle: more specific  missions overseas, for instance in Africa and in overseas  territories. Can we retain all three mandates?    [Leotard] To these three purely geographic approaches, we  have substituted a definition of our defense policy objectives  which combines permanent and innovative objectives. First  objective: To defend France's interests. Its vital interests  such as the national territory, its sovereignty. Its strategic  interests, such as our supply routes or the balance of forces in  Europe or in the Mediterranean. And its interests as a world  power, its interests as they relate to its rank, its  international responsibilities, its status as permanent member  of the Security Council. Second objective: To build a European  defense system and to contribute to world security, as our  borders are no longer our first line of defense. Third  objective: To implement a global defense concept, not only in  military terms, but also in terms of how we view the nation,  with our values, with those of the Republic and democracy.    Do we have the means to continue meeting all these  responsibilities? I believe we must do what it takes to have  them. Obviously, there are limitations, but we have the  capability to intervene anywhere in the world should it become  necessary. The issue of the necessary means is raised in the  White Paper. We answer it both by developing intervention  scenarios for French forces and by emphasizing -- this is a way  to be rational -- the probable multinational nature of most  future interventions. As part of Europe, of course, with our  allies, as is currently being done in Bosnia, as was done in  Cambodia and Somalia. For our interests as a world power, I  used the word multilateralization. We have no problem with the  fact that such interests must nowadays be expressed on a  European scale.    [LE POINT] How do you reconcile what you call  multilateralization and the protection of the national territory  through [nuclear] deterrence?    [Leotard] We do not believe in sharing atomic weapons at  this point. This is an issue that must remain under national  jurisdiction as it affects our vital interests. On the other  hand, with the exception of nuclear matters, it is very  important that we look into multilateral or multinational  actions, especially with our German friends, in view of  potential future crises.    [LE POINT] Speaking of nuclear deterrence: Can we remain  credible without resuming testing?    [Leotard] I would give a two-part answer to your question.  First, France's current deterrent is totally relevant, totally  reliable, and, I might add, completely at the level of those of  other world powers, and this will remain true for quite a while.  Second, there is the issue of the renewal of today's weapons,  which must take place from the years 2005, 2007, 2010 onward,  depending on weapon types. To ensure such renewal, the next  president of the Republic will certainly need to be in a  position to authorize new tests if we are to maintain our  credibility into the third millennium and if we want to acquire  the simulation capability we need -- a capability which in  itself requires testing. The question is not whether we should,  but when we need to resume testing.    [LE POINT] Do we not need to cross the Rubicon and trade  conscription for a professional army?    [Leotard] I believe that we both need to work toward a  number of professional units and to maintain the national  service. This is why the 1994 budget provides for the creation  of 1,000 additional jobs in the army. We also put a stop to  personnel cuts, which is in sharp contrast with the 40,000  military jobs suppressed over the last two years. We do not  question the need for a national service. First of all because a  country such as ours, with real integration problems, cannot  underestimate an integration tool such as the national service.  I should add that given the missions we must carry out today,  our Armed Forces need the current numbers of conscripts. In  other words, contrary to a widespread idea, switching from  conscription to a professional army would be highly problematic.  First of all because it would substantially deplete the Armed  Forces' human resources. Conscripts are far from being the army  valets we hear about; they fulfil many highly important and  technologically useful functions with high added value. And  second, external operations such as the ones being conducted in  the former Yugoslavia involve 40 percent of conscripts. This is  therefore a choice to be made at the national level. Besides,  during the Gulf War, when it was decided not to send any  conscripts -- a decision I personally regret -- the Armed Forces  did not take kindly to this situation. I would really like the  country to accept this idea that it is the people itself which  defends not only its territory, but also a number of values.  And not just people who are paid to do it. This is a real  debate, and I totally accept the political risks, knowing that  in the majority there are a number of people whose opinions  differ from mine.</p>

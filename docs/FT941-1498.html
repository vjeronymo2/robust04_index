			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Mexico in crisis after killing: Political turmoil after assassination of the ruling PRI party candidate Colosio Mexico has been thrown into political turmoil by the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI). The death of Mr Colosio, who was shot in the head and chest late on Wednesday in the border city of Tijuana, heightened fears of instability just weeks after an Indian rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas and after months of economic stagnation. Mexico's attorney-general said yesterday that Mario Aburto Martinez, 23, had admitted to the killing, although his motive was not yet known. Mr Aburto, a mechanic arrested at the scene, had claimed to be a pacifist. Despite the closure of Mexico's financial markets yesterday, the price of Mexican shares and bonds fell sharply in London and New York, although they recovered from their lows. New York analysts said prices of New York-quoted Mexican shares suggested a fall of 4-5 per cent in the Mexican stock market. However, last night the US set up a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) credit line to help Mexico weather financial jitters when markets reopen today. The PRI, or more likely in practice President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, will have to select a new presidential candidate for this August's election. Under Mexico's constitution, officials are not permitted to run for the presidency if they have held government office in the six months before the elections. This means that unless the constitution is changed, no member of the current cabinet could run. This would leave Mr Ernesto Zedillo, former education minister and Mr Colosio's campaign manager, as the front-runner. Although Mr Zedillo is considered politically inexperienced, his chances of being chosen as the PRI's new candidate improved last night when another leading contender, Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy to the troubled southern state of Chiapas, said he would not stand. However, Dr Ignacio Burgoa, professor emeritus of law at the National Autonomus University of Mexico, says the government, with the support of at least one opposition party, could muster enough votes to change the constitution in 10 to 15 days. That would enable Mr Pedro Aspe, finance minister, and a host of other cabinet ministers to run. Mexico's ruling party has been in power for 65 years, and Mr Colosio was the favourite to win the August elections. A former social development minister and president of the PRI, he represented continuity with the economic and political policies of President Salinas. The new candidate will be weakened by being the party's second choice, and will have just five months to set up his campaign. Democratic reforms, passed by Congress on Wednesday night, go a long way in letting the opposition compete on equal terms with the PRI, making elections potentially the most competitive in the nation's history. On the other hand, the sympathy felt for the PRI after Mr Colosio's assassination may lead to an increase in support. Mr Salinas appealed to Mexicans for calm and unity, and appeared to rule out the possibility of a state of emergency. The assassination of Mr Colosio comes in a period of unusual political instability, and the possibility of a conservative backlash was being aired yesterday. Many Mexicans saw a link between the peasant uprising in Chiapas, last week's kidnapping of Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, the co-head of Mexico's largest bank, and Mr Colosio's murder. Mexico's economy has also been vulnerable in recent weeks, with the peso having depreciated sharply against the dollar as the government sought to boost a stagnant economy. The Bank of Mexico is expected to defend the peso today when markets reopen.

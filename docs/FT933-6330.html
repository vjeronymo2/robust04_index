			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Dangerous times for Pepsi and Jackson THE pop star Michael Jackson has intensified south-east Asia's cola wars and raised doubts that he will be able to hang on to his lucrative contract with Pepsi-Cola, which is sponsoring his world tour. Pepsi says its sales in Thailand have risen 16 per cent following two months of promotions associated with the singer-dancer's visit to Bangkok this week. Pepsi has a slight edge over Coca-Cola in the Dollars 500m (Pounds 338m) Thai soft drinks market. But Pepsi executives were left biting their nails when US police launched an investigation into child abuse allegations against Mr Jackson, which his lawyers denied. Reuters yesterday reported authorities as saying they had no evidence to support the allegations. Mr Jackson finally gave his second concert in Thailand to great acclaim yesterday after two postponements, which had infuriated fans. His doctor said he was dehydrated after his first - and typically energetic - concert on Tuesday in Bangkok's sweltering heat. Coca-Cola pounced, hurriedly buying space in the English-language newspapers favoured by Thai yuppies. 'Dehydrated?' the advertisements asked yesterday. ' ..There's always Coke.' Pepsi, whose Thai office switchboards play Michael Jackson hits to callers on hold, yesterday put a brave face on the dehydration saga. 'When you're number two, I guess you to try to do everything,' said Mr Tony Illsley, president of Pepsi-Cola International in the Asia-Pacific region. However, a Pepsi spokesman in the US yesterday struck a more ominous note: 'Because of the seriousness of the allegations and all the sensitivities involved, we're proceeding responsibly. We are following the investigation closely and our plans will depend on how it evolves.' Jackson's advertisements of the early 1980s are considered the most successful soft drink commercials ever made. The bad publicity will also further depress executives at Sony, disappointed with sales of Jackson's latest album, Dangerous, which was released as part of the estimated Dollars 65m contract he signed with the Japanese entertainment and electronics group in 1991. US sales have fallen short of expectations. US advertisers tend to shy away from scandal. Pepsi dropped its 'Like a Prayer' commercials in the US after Madonna, the singer, created a furore with the video of the song of the same name. Similarly, the Florida Orange Citrus Commission decided to pull its advertisements featuring Burt Reynolds after the film star filed for divorce, and Earvin 'Magic' Johnson lost his Converse athletic shoes spot and other endorsements after he announced he had been infected with the virus that causes Aids.</p>

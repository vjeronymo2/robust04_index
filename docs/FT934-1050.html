			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Dollar firms against yen The US dollar continued its ascent against the Japanese yen and also firmed slightly against most European currencies. However, it ended the London session off the day's highs on late profit-taking, writes Conner Middelmann. Traders reported sluggish dealings as most market participants were squaring their positions ahead of the holidays. After breaching technical resistance at Y110.50, the US currency hit a six-month high against the yen at Y110.80. It finished at Y110.55, up from Y110.10 at Friday's close. In New York it ended at Y110.60. The yen also lost some ground against the D-Mark, which closed at Y64.52, up from Y64.29 on Friday. The yen continues to be undermined by concern that the fiscal measures needed to boost the Japanese economy are being delayed by political problems, said Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International. Depressed by the stalled parliamentary debate on political reform and a delay in the proposal for the draft budget for Japan's next fiscal year, the Nikkei stock index slid 647 points to 17,404. Continued speculation over further sharp cuts in the 1.75 per cent official discount rate was also keeping the currency under pressure. While the market is discounting a  1/2 percentage point reduction in the rate, there is increasing talk of the discount rate falling to 0.5 per cent or even to zero next year. All this is in sharp contrast with the US, which has recently seen a string of strong economic data. Moreover, as the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets today, there is increasing talk that the body may be shifting from a neutral policy stance towards a slight tightening bias. The minutes of the last FOMC meeting in November, due to be released this week, will be keenly eyed for any hints of a policy shift. The Italian lira posted a further rise against the D-Mark following Saturday's approval of the 1994 budget package by the lower house of parliament. The budget will now move to the Senate and market participants are hoping for a swift approval before the December 23 deadline. This spurred fresh hopes for a  1/2 percentage point cut in the 8 per cent discount rate, with some observers saying it might happen before the end of the year. 'A couple of years ago the Italians cut rates on December 20, and last year they cut on December 22 - they are quite keen on last-minute moves,' said Ms Alison Cottrell, European economist at Midland Global Markets. However, other analysts said they expect Italy to wait until the Bundesbank lowers German interest rates again. The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its twice-yearly Economic Outlook yesterday said that, assisted by increased fiscal stringency as well as income restraint, monetary policy in Italy is set to ease, with nominal interest rates falling in line with German ones. Italy's currency was further boosted by market rumours that the country's credit rating was about to be upgraded. However, Moody's Investors Service, who have rated Italian government debt single-A-1, said the country's credit ratings are not currently under review. The lira finished at L980.0 against the D-Mark, up from L985.8 at Friday's close. The D-Mark softened across the board in thin, trendless dealings. The French franc rose to a new high since August's revamp of the European exchange rate mechanism, reaching FFr3.4066 to the D-Mark. It ended at FFr3.409, up from the previous close of FFr3.424. Data showing a FFr9.04bn French current account surplus in September lent support to the franc, an analyst said. At its latest money market operation, the Bank of France drained FFr7.9bn and left its intervention rate at the tender unchanged at 6.20 per cent. The Belgian franc also firmed against the D-Mark, closing at BFr20.75, from BFr20.91 on Friday. The US dollar appreciated to DM1.7135 from Friday's DM1.7045. It closed in New York at DM1.7129. The German money market remained tight as seasonal pressures pushed the overnight rate towards 6.20 per cent, prompting another injection of temporary liquidity by the Bundesbank via its Paragraph 17 facility. The Bundesbank today is due to call for bids on two-week securities repurchase agreements at a fixed 6 per cent, for allocation tomorrow. The sterling money market had a 'pretty peaceful day' thanks to a relatively small shortage, a money dealer said. The Bank of England announced a shortage of Pounds 650m which it later revised to Pounds 850m. In its morning operation it purchased bills totalling Pounds 165m: Pounds 40m of band 1 bank bills and Pounds 125m of band 2 bank bills at 5 3/8 per cent. In the afternoon round it bought a further Pounds 211m of band 1 and 2 bills, and finally provided late assistance of around Pounds 430m. The March short sterling futures contract edged ahead 0.01 point to 94.81. The pound ended little changed at DM2.5450, up from DM2.5425 on Friday. The Treasury's announcement that it plans to repay the Ecu5.0bn seven-year revolving bank credit arranged in September 1992 had no impact on the money market. 'I do not think this has any practical implications for the money market,' another trader said.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Observer: Briefs encounter What do you call your underwear? In South Korea, the J. Enterprise company has incurred the wrath of US lawyers for marketing a range of underwear called James Dean. Dean died at 24 in a 1955 car crash. As elsewhere, he is a popular icon in Seoul, where cafes and restaurants are named after him. But in what is turning into a rebel without a corset clash, the US-based Curtis Management Group, representing the family and estate of the deceased film star, says J. Enterprise Ltd - which is likely to sell Dollars 31.3m of the undergarments this year - has violated trademark laws. Expensive business, trademark actions. Far cheaper surely to turn the other cheek.</p>

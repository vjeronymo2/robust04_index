			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shell puts Dollars 74m into Chilean offshoot ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL, the petro-chemical group, has injected Dollars 74m (Pounds 42.8m) of new capital into its subsidiary in Chile, where it is investing in forestry and mining. Chile is the focal point of Shell's relatively new forestry business. The company owns 60 per cent of a Dollars 460m pulp mill at Nacimiento in the Bio-Bio region, which has its formal opening next month, and an associated Dollars 110m eucalyptus forest. Partners in this project, which will produce 220,000 tonnes of pulp a year for use in tissue paper, are two US groups, Scott Paper and Citicorp Banking. Shell has more than 60,000 hectares of plantations in Chile. Mr Robert Turner, president of Shell Chile, says Chile has a natural advantage in forestry - trees grow twice as fast as in the northern hemisphere. But he says Shell Chile will now pause to consolidate its position in forestry. 'Growth in Chile in the immediate future will come from mining.' Billiton, Shell's mining and metals division, is spending Dollars 14.5m on exploration this year, mainly on a huge copper deposit at Collahuasi in the Tarapaca region. Mr Rodney Lay, managing director of Billiton Chile, points out that the world's three biggest copper mines are in the country and that Collahuasi 'appears to be a classic Chilean deposit. Everywhere they look they find copper.' Billiton's partners in the copper project are Falconbridge of Canada and Chevron of the US. If the go-ahead for a mine is given, Collahuasi would cost between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m and produce 75,000 to 80,000 tonnes of copper in concentrates a year to start with, but Mr Lay says a mine could not start up until 1995. Billiton's sole current operating mine in Chile is Choquelimpie, near Arica in northern Chile, which is pioneering high-altitude, low-grade gold mining and last year produced 100,300 troy ounces of gold and 64,000 ounces of silver. With its partners, Northgate of Canada (35 per cent) and Citibank (23 per cent), Billiton is spending Dollars 3m this year exploring for more reserves at Choquelimpie, which in theory runs out of ore in 1993. Shell now has more than Dollars 600m invested in Chile, up from Dollars 70m ten years ago, and the number of employees in Shell companies has grown from 300 to 3,000.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Motorola earnings exceed forecast SHARES in Motorola, the US semiconductor manufacturer, surged Dollars 3 to Dollars 101 1/2 in after-hours trading on the New York stock exchange yesterday after reporting earnings sharply above forecast. Third-quarter earnings jumped to Dollars 254m, or 92 cents a share from Dollars 127m, or 47 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to earn between 67 cents and 83 cents a share. Sales in the quarter totalled Dollars 4.48bn against Dollars 3.48bn in the same period last year. Nine-month earnings amounted to Dollars 682m, or Dollars 2.50 a share, up from Dollars 272m, or Dollars 1.02, a year earlier. Sales for the nine months totalled Dollars 11.97bn, against Dollars 9.59bn. Nine-months earnings per share fully diluted were Dollars 2.40, against Dollars 1.01. Last year's figures include a loss of Dollars 123m from the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting standard. Motorola said that its third-quarter net margin on sales was 5.7 per cent, compared with 3.7 per cent a year earlier, while in the first nine months net margin on sales was 5.7 per cent, up from 4.1 per cent a year earlier. Mr Gary Tooker, president and chief operating officer, said sales in the company's semiconductor products segment rose 31 per cent for the quarter, to Dollars 1.51bn. Orders rose 25 per cent and segment profits increased, he added. In the general systems sector, sales rose 43 per cent to Dollars 1.35bn, while orders rose 58 per cent. Segment profits also increased, Motorola said. The company did not provide any forecast, beyond saying that third-quarter and nine-months results were not necessarily indicative of those to be expected for the full year.</p>

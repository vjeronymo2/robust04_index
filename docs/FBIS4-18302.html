			<p>BFN     [Text] Saarbruecken -- The Turkish ambassador to Germany,  Onur Oymen, welcomes the planned deportation of militant Kurds  from Bavaria. "I find it absolutely right, and I welcome the  ruling of Bavarian Interior Minister Beckstein," Oymen said on  Saarland radio on Saturday [2 April].    The Kurds who are to be deported from Germany are neither  threatened by capital punishment nor torture in Turkey, Oymen  said. Turkey is a "law-governed state just like Germany." In  the last 10 years, the Turkish Parliament has not passed a  single death sentence. Moreover, Turkey is a member of the  European Anti-Torture Convention, Oymen stated.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: McKay secures banking facilities Shares in Mckay Securities, the property investor and developer, moved up 5p to 115p yesterday as the company announced that all its banking facilities had been put on a secured basis, with the earliest expiry date being September 30 1996. Satisfactory agreements had been concluded with the unsecured banks on normal banking terms, the company said. Since January sales of the supermarket at Brighton and two flats at Parkside, London SW, had taken place 'at satisfactory prices'. Together with undrawn committed facilities available, the company had adequate funds to meet all current and planned commitments. The second half of the financial year was expected to show an improvement in underlying profitability over the first, but there will be a provision of Pounds 680,000 for refinancing costs.</p>

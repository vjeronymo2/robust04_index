			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] During a working-level contact with North Korea on  10 January, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  delivered a technological check list on the collection of  samples from nuclear material and the examination of an  operation diary [unyong ilchi] of seven nuclear facilities and  requested that North Korea inform the IAEA of its decision on  accepting inspections within this week.    The IAEA also informed the North Korean side that in order  to  inspect seven facilities in accordance with the technological  check list, it is necessary that at least six to seven  inspectors carry out activities for three weeks.    It was learned that the technological check list delivered  to  North Korea includes items on determining if the number and  material of the five megawatt-nuclear fuel rods in Yongbyon  correspond with what North Korea had previously reported to the  IAEA, examining the operation diary, and replacing surveillance  equipment.    In particular, it was learned that, if a radiochemical  laboratory is a reprocessing facility, the amount of nuclear  material remaining in tanks and pipes will be measured. In  addition, samples from the laboratory will collected and  inspectors will check sealed devices and replace surveillance  equipment. Public attention is focused on the North Korean  response, which is expected in two or three days.</p>

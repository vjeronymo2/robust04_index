			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALADDIN OWNER GINJI YASUDA FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY  </P> <P> Japanese businessman Ginji Yasuda filed Monday to put the ailing Aladdin Hotel  under federal bankruptcy protection, citing total debt that outstripped the  resort's assets by more than $38 million.  </P> <P> Yasuda, the first foreigner to be licensed to operate a Nevada casino, reported  in the Chapter 11 filing that his Ginji Corp. owed $121.2 million to various  creditors while having total assets of $82.9 million.  </P> <P> The bankruptcy filing, which had been widely expected, comes on the heels of  the Nevada Gaming Commission's decision last week to yank Yasuda's license and  give the Aladdin until next Tuesday to comply with a list of conditions to  allow its casino to remain open.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Talks This Week  </P> <P> Commission Chairman John O'Reilly said the bankruptcy filing has not changed  the commission's insistence that the Aladdin hire several new officers, put a  $3-million cash infusion into the casino and disclose the source of recent  loans to the resort.  </P> <P> "I don't think the primary focus or goal has really changed," O'Reilly said. "I  would hope they bring forward information Tuesday that will show their  compliance with the conditions and justifications for further licensing."  </P> <P> James Shea, an attorney who worked on the petition, said the hotel has already  begun to comply with the commission's conditions, including the hiring Monday  of longtime gaming figure Robert Brooker to be general manager.  </P></p>

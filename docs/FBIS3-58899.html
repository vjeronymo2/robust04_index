In a telephone conversation with ZDF, the officer  said that the Bundeswehr would build three new schools and a  dike. He did not think that the good relations with the Somalis  would worsen. Kammerhoff stressed that the local police chief  and the chairman of the district council belonged to the same  clan as the man killed. Both had inspected the scene of the  incident with the commander and expressed their opinion that  "anyone who intrudes here and intends to steal must reckon with  being killed."</p>

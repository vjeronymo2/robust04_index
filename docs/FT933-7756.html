			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kenyan tea output record forecast KENYA'S tea production rose by 22.42m kg in the first half of 1993, compared with the same period last year, Reuter reports from Nairobi. The rise gave weight to predictions that a record output would be achieved by the end of the year, a leading brokerage firm said. 'The crop figure for the month of June 1993 has been announced at 17,053,611 kg, showing an increase of 2,836,090 kg or 19.95 per cent over the same period in 1992,' said the Mombasa-based African Tea Brokers. 'The cumulative figure (for end-June) now stands at 113.42m kg - an increase of 22.42m kg or 24.64 per cent over last year,' ATB said. The brokers said that growing areas had reported low temperatures and isolated showers earlier this year, but it has recently warmed up. The Kenya Tea Board forecast in March that output could rise to a record 210m kg in 1993, from 188.1m kg last year and 203.6m kg in 1991. But the record estimate was threatened in the early months of the year by low temperatures, after scattered seasonal rain fell in all tea-growing areas. ATB said that 161,188 packages were sold in four auctions at an average price of 102.66 Kenyan shillings (Dollars 1.57 at current prices) in June, compared with 189,200 packages at 57.10 shillings (Dollars 1.73 at last year's prices) in the same period last year. Although auction prices have risen in local currency terms, devaluations of about 60 per cent since January have wiped out these gains in hard currency terms. The brokers said the market for all teas declined with closing rates below opening levels in June, especially for brighter grades, because of selective buying from Britain and Pakistan - among the top buyers of Kenyan teas.</p>

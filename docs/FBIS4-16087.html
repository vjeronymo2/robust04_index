			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] The heads of Belarusian and Russian Governments  signed a package of eight documents Tuesday [12 April] leading  to the setting up of a monetary union of the two countries. The  most important of them is the treaty on the merger of their  monetary systems and on the functioning of the joint monetary  system.    Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich told journalists that the  treaty did not infringe on the interests of either country. He  emphasized that it was a treaty of equal partners.    Kebich admitted that the National Bank of Belarus did not  quite approve of the documents. One of the articles of the  treaty is inconsistent with the country's Constitution saying  that only the National Bank had the right to print money and  issue credits. Kebich said that this article would be amended  accordingly.    Kebich said that if two-thirds of the Belarusian parliament  did not approve the Moscow agreements, the government might call  a referendum on the issue. In his words, the signing of the  package marked the end of a marathon.    IF Note: Kebich wants the referendum to be held  simultaneously with the June 23 presidential elections. He told  INTERFAX that, according to sociological polls, a majority of  the country's population supported a monetary union with Russia.  Kebich is said to stand a good chance of winning the  presidential race.    A high ranking government expert told INTERFAX that the  treaty would have a significant impact on the presidential  elections. He thought that the attitude towards the merger of  the monetary systems would be the dividing line in the  elections. He thought that a favorable political environment  was necessary for the merger.    The expert did not rule out the possibility that in the  aftermath of the presidential elections the new political  leaders of Belarus would make a political statement on the  merger.    IF Note: The merger will proceed in stages. At the first  stage which would start on 1 May 1994 Russia will lift customs  duties in trading with Belarus. Minsk will reciprocate with  lifting the payment of all kinds of transit duties on Russian  goods and will let Russia use strategic military bases on  Belarusian soil. At the second stage, which is expected to  start after the presidential elections in Belarus, the assets  and liabilities of the Central Banks of Russia (CBR) and the  National Bank of Belarus will be merged. Only the CBR will  operate as a bank of issuance. Within certain limits Belarusian  citizens will be able to exchange the national currency for  Russian rubles.</p>

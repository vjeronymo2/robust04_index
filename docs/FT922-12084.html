			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: JCI shows improvement to R59.6m A SIGNIFICANT improvement in performance at the Joel mine helped the gold mines in the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) group to boost profits in the March quarter. The group posted net profit after tax of R59.6m (Dollars 20.7m), a 2.1 per cent increase over net profit in the December quarter. The upturn came in spite of a 2.2 per cent drop in the average gold price received to R33,134 a kilogram. Total gold produced rose by 3.1 per cent to 12,361kg on account of a 3.5 per cent improvement in the average grade to 4.11 grams a tonne. The improvement in the group's results was attributed to the performance of Joel, where the grade had increased by 18.1 per cent to 6.45 grams a tonne and production had risen by 13.5 per cent to 1,560kg. Net profit after tax rose to R7.4m from R890,000. The group said it was confident of repeating these results in the current quarter. The improved performance at Joel reflected more selective mining, which allowed a significant reduction of the dilution percentages in the ore mined, the group said. Mr Kennedy Maxwell, head of JCI's gold and uranium division, said he did not believe the strategy currently employed at Joel would have a big impact on the mine's reserves. He said JCI believed the gold price would recover to levels which would allow the group to return to low grade areas and mine them profitably. The group's Randfontein mine benefited from a similar approach. It saw the yield rise to 3.6 grams a tonne, a level last reached in June 1987. Gold production was 2.5 per cent higher at 8,014kg, while both revenue and costs per kilogram were slightly lower. Net profit after tax dropped by 7.7 per cent to R50.3m on account of a much higher tax bill. The mine again paid out a R5.2m productivity bonus to workers, effectively a further 12 per cent increase over their 5 to 6 per cent basic increase. At Western Areas, R6m profit from uranium offset a R5.4m loss on the gold operations. Net profit from Western Areas slipped by 37.5 per cent to R1.8m .</p>

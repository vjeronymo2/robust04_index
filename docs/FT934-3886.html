			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Car sales up 19% as recovery grows New car sales in the UK jumped last month by 19.4 per cent year on year as the recovery accelerated. For the first time diesel cars accounted for more than a quarter of all new car registrations. The UK is virtually the only car market in western Europe where new car demand has grown this year. Registrations in the first 11 months have risen by 12.6 per cent, according to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. This compares with a fall of more than 15 per cent in western Europe in the first 10 months. The recovery in UK new vehicle demand is becoming more broadly based as the commercial vehicle sector also emerges from recession. Registrations of new commercial vehicles in November rose by 6.3 per cent year-on-year. Commercial vehicle sales remained depressed in the first half of the year but have now been higher than a year ago in each of the past three months. The first signs of recovery came from the heavy truck sector of the market late last year, as hauliers began to replace ageing fleets. However, in the past two months higher demand has also been seen in the small business sector, with rising sales of vans. New car sales in November rose to 127,674 from 106,902 a year ago, while registrations in the first 11 months increased to 1,704,696 from 1,513,698 in the corresponding period last year. Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, claimed yesterday that 'much of the increase in new car sales could be attributed to intensive marketing efforts' by carmakers, which were squeezing profit margins. The SMMT admitted that the big jump in car sales last month was 'quite startling'. The strength of demand for diesel cars has taken the industry by surprise. Sales of diesel cars in November accounted for 25.7 per cent of new sales compared with 15.9 per cent a year ago. In the first 11 months of this year diesel sales rose 71.6 per cent to 325,004 from 189,934 a year ago. Car sales table, Page 10 Consumer credit slows, Page 10</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Decision To Refer Greece to the European </F> Court of Justice"]    [Text] The EU [European Union] Commission's decision  yesterday to refer Greece to the European Court of Justice due  to the "embargo" against Skopje, is particularly unfortunate for  our country. First, the decision could be considered extreme,  given that it is the first time the EU Commission has taken such  a measure against one of its members, which also happens to hold  the EU presidency.    The EU Commission ignored the political aspect of the  Greek-Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]  dispute, taking into consideration only the legal and trade  aspects of the "embargo"--which we should note has also  questioned in our country. This development came as an  unpleasant surprise, but it also raises other questions, because  both the Security Council and Matthew Nimetz, U.S. President  Bill Clinton's special envoy for the Balkans, have recently  stressed the political dimension of the Skopje issue. In fact,  they stressed that a prolongation of the uncertainty would  threaten the stability of the whole region.    Therefore, we ask: What are criteria of the EU Commission,  which is the executive body, for completely ignoring the above  aspect and making yesterday's decision without any prior  decision by the EU Council of Ministers, which has the basic  authority on issues related with the EU solidarity?    Aside from all this, the EU Commission's decision to refer  Greece to the European Court of Justice constitutes strong,  almost one-sided pressure against our country, especially in  view of the talks in New York scheduled for 11 April on the  Skopje issue and also coming on the eve of the Greek prime  minister's visit to the United States.    All the above points and questions should be examined very  seriously by the Greek Government. Because first of all, they  indicate significant differences between our foreign policy in  the Balkans and EU ambitions and goals in the region, to the  extent that the EU's policies show any homogeneity or  consistency at all. Secondly, yesterday's decision highlights  the worrisome drop in our country's influence in the EU's  central bodies. This certainly is not due solely to the  discontent arising from the Greek countermeasures against  Skopje....    In other words, yesterday's reaction by the Government and  opposition to the "unfair" decision of our "partners," who were  under emotional pressure, is worthless and useless. What is  important is to correctly evaluate the developments that gave  rise to this decision and react calmly, based on our national  interests.</p>

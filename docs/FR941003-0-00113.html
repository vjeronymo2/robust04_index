			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment on differing appraiser classifications: Why does the proposed rule not distinguish between the different levels of certification, such as a Certified General Appraiser compared with a Certified Residential Appraiser?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We do distinguish between certified general and certified residential appraisers in those instances where the distinction must be made. Thus, when the reference is to multifamily programs, ``certified general'' is intended and the rule will usually so state. When we are referring to single family programs that require the services of a certified appraiser, as described in &sect;267.5(b), the rule makes no distinction because either a certified general or a certified residential appraiser would be appropriate for the assignment. Some jurisdictions have provided for other variant classifications which this rule does not seek to distinguish. We rely instead on the state accreditation agencies_prompted by the benefits of reciprocity and guided by the Appraiser Qualifications Board_to maintain comparable standards within the different classifications for use by FHA, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council members and other interested agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) and the Farmers Home Administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment on continuing the use of DVA certificates of reasonable value (CRVs) and HUD conditional commitments: According to HUD's Direct Endorsement regulations, in particular 24 CFR 203.5(e): ``In lieu of appraising the property, the mortgagee may utilize a HUD conditional commitment (for proposed construction only), or a Department of Veterans Affairs certificate of reasonable value.'' Will this continue to be the practice under the Roster system?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Lenders may continue to rely on conditional commitments and CRVs. Part 267 will not affect this interchangeability. For some time now, both HUD and DVA, by administrative instructions, have required certified or licensed appraisers for single family appraisals. Moreover, appraisals for veteran housing programs must comply with USPAP. Thus, DVA and FHA requirements are comparable in key respects and are mutually acceptable. Of course this interchangeability could end if either agency were to lessen its standards for appraisers or appraisals. We point out also that HUD requires virtually all applications for mortgage insurance to be processed under the DE program, so very little use is made of HUD conditional commitments. This fact tends to discourage the mutual recognition of CRVs and conditional commitments (or at least DVA's recognition of HUD commitments) since 38 U.S.C. 1831 requires that CRV appraisers be assigned on a rotational basis from a fee panel selected and maintained by DVA_a requirement incompatible with the DE lenders' freedom to select their appraisers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment on the integrity of DE staff appraisers: It is naive and pointless to require that DE lenders separate the appraisal function from their underwriting operations in order to protect the autonomy and integrity of staff appraisers. Policy and decisionmaking for every corporate component coalesce at the top of the business structure and filter downward; a staff appraiser cannot avoid being influenced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are aware of the potential for pressure on staff appraisers, but short of prohibiting the practice altogether, there is no completely satisfactory solution. We believe that by removing the appraiser from the direct supervision of the loan production department, two advantages accrue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the appraiser is at least free from the everyday case-by-case control of loan officers. An appraiser may sense that too many unfavorable appraisals can impede on his or her career track (of course, a self-employed appraiser under contract with a lender can feel similar pressures), but there will at least not be instances where one's immediate supervisor looks for a specific value in every case assigned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, when the nexus of decisionmaking shifts upward, if undue influence is manifest, it is usually easier to fix accountability. If there is a consistent problem, it will very likely have originated at upper corporate levels. Top management of a maleficent lending institution will find it more difficult to avoid culpability by claiming that fraudulent or misleading appraisals are the result of nothing more than faulty supervision or insensitivity to potential trouble at the loan officer level. Of course none of our precautions, including appraiser independence, can guarantee that a staff (or contract) appraiser will escape undue pressure. Ultimately, we look to the integrity and long-range business judgment of the mortgagees themselves to counter serious abuse and destructive practices. As we have observed previously, there has been a very good overall record on the part of mortgagees and staff appraisers in this regard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment on the advisability of the Roster system: The idea of establishing a Roster for single family appraisers appears to be an offshoot of the fee panel system and is therefore a repudiation of the mortgagee's right to select the appraiser.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Roster and the fee panel are in fact totally different in concept and purpose. The fee panel was initiated as a means of controlling the quality of appraisers in terms of training, diligence, judgment and professionalism. It functioned mainly at a time when there was little other assurance in these respects. It afforded a means of training appraisers in FHA requirements and procedures and it also served to limit the pool of appraisers so that panelists could be kept active in FHA programs and their experience level would benefit accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Circumstances have now changed completely. First and most importantly, FIRREA has raised and standardized the level of appraiser competence nationwide so that it is no longer a major concern. Second, the law now permits DE mortgagees to select appraisers. This means that a system of assigning panelists, unless the mortgagee requests the assignment or is not DE approved (and most now are) would be illegal_a fact which is overlooked by those commenters who urge HUD to retain the strict panel assignment system. In a practical sense, it also means that there are far more potential FHA single family appraisers than this agency, with its increased budget constraints, could hope to train in the manner that it once did. We must now rely on FIRREA and State accreditation boards to do much of what HUD has done in the past. The fee panel will continue in a diminished role, and only for those lenders who wish to continue using it. This does not mean that HUD will abdicate its responsibility for guarding against poor appraisal work. We are instituting the Roster as a means of monitoring and quickly remedying problems. However, unlike the fee panel system, the Roster will list any applicant who holds current credentials under state certification/licensing law, who has acquainted himself or herself with FHA program requirements, and who has a good professional record, including competency in performing FHA assignments. The Roster will thus provide a rapid means of confirming that the appraiser is in good standing at the time the mortgagee requests an FHA case number and identifies the appraiser selected. That is its purpose_it is a monitoring control, not a system for training and qualifying FHA appraisers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment on the need to list fee panelists on the Roster: The proposed rule does not clarify whether fee panelists must be listed on the Roster.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

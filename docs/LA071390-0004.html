			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIA SUSPENDS ITS INDEPENDENCE  </P> <P> Your article merely points out that Lithuania is ready to accept the fact that  without strong American and European political and economic support Lithuania  is doomed to bleed into economic collapse.  </P> <P> But there's no victory for Gorbachev in this affair, for within a year  Gorbachev will not be able to enforce any agreements with the republics of the  Soviet Union because of his diminishing political stature.  </P> <P> The bottom line is simple -- the Russian Empire is crumbling and no Gorbachev  and no Bush can save it. For Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are fortunate enough  to possess qualities which guarantee victory -- intelligence (vision revelance,  acceptance of reality) -- and emotional intensity (love for freedom and  independence).  </P> <P> ADOLPH DONINS  </P> <P> Oxnard  </P></p>

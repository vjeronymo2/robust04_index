			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / How To Spend It: A touch of rural bliss in the city ANYBODY IN London between March 5 and 8 might like to head for The Business Design Centre, Islington, north London, where a most uncity-like activity will be taking place. There, in the midst of one of the capital's most urban boroughs, The Country Living Fair will be celebrating, in its own inimitable way, the joys of rural bliss. Gathered together under one roof will be a large collection of that vast army of crafts people whose work somehow embodies the rural ideal. Besides being able to buy almost anything from a beautifully-made rocking horse to a hand-knitted sweater or a piece of painted furniture, the visitor will be able to watch many crafts people actually at work. Potters will be potting, painters painting, country cooks cooking, embroiderers will be embroidering - every exhibitor has been through a rigorous selection process and been invited to attend, so standards are high and the interest should be enormous. Among so many delights it is hard to choose just a few but Weekend FT readers will want to know that our own Philippa Davenport, in her capacity as cookery writer on Country Living magazine, will be there, ready to answer your culinary questions. Look out, too, for the fine cotton bedlinen from Cologne and Cotton - prices are exceptionally good and quality is high. Then there is the stunning blue and white ware made by Michael and Carol Francis - in particular beautiful tulip vases and charming brick vases. Then there are Andrew Young's green jugs and colander bowls, Sally Green's painted furniture, Lloyd Loom furniture and so much more. With six pavilions, each representing a different theme (crafts, interiors, gardens, food and drink, leisure and environment and style) it ought to keep any keen visitor busy. Tickets cost Pounds 6 for adults. The fair is open from 10 am every day and closes at 8pm on March 5 and 6, at 6pm on March 7 and 5pm on March 8. The show is virtually sold out and it would be wise to call the Business Design Centre on 071-288-6461 to check ticket availability.</p>

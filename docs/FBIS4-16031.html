			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, 12 Apr -- "I will stay in Sarajevo to  continue the mediation in contacts between representatives of  the Bosnian sides and the U.N. command and achieve easing of  tension," special representative of the Russian President  Vitaliy Churkin, currently in Pale, told ITAR-TASS over the  telephone today.    "Unfortunately, I can give no optimistic forecasts. Despite  the fact we have managed to ease the situation around Gorazde,  the general military-political situation in Bosnia is very  complicated after the air-strikes," he said.    "The Serb side refuses to meet representatives of the U.N.  force command for understandable reasons. I have to make  shuttle trips between the Serb and Muslim parts of Sarajevo as  part of my mediation. This is what I have been doing for two  days, this is what I will do on Wednesday.    "There will be more meetings with Radovan Karadzic and the  U.N. force command. I also keep contact with Serb President  Milosevic," said Churkin.    Asked about the truthfulness of reports saying NATO aircraft  bombed downtown Gorazde by mistake on Monday, the Russian  diplomat said "Mr. Karadzic told me about it, however,  representatives of the U.N. force command deny the information".</p>

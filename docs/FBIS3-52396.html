			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Islamabad -- To effectively monitor fresh influx  of Afghan refugees, the government has imposed visa restriction  on all Afghan national crossing over to Pakistan through land as  well as air route.    The reason which led to this drastic measure is that in  recent days well over 40,000 Afghans, including men, women and  children, had crossed over to Pakistan. There were serious  apprehensions that their number might further increase if  effective precautionary measures were not taken.    According to well informed official sources the government  has conveyed to Rabbani-led Afghan government the reasons for  such a drastic action. However, the response of Kabul regime is  not known.    Pakistan embassy in Kabul has also been apprised of the new  policy and directed to follow a certain procedure before  granting visas to intending Afghan nationals visiting Pakistan.    In view of the federal government's decision the  administration in the Frontier province [North-West Frontier  Province -- NWFP] has been directed to keep an eye on illegal  arrivals from Afghanistan and "maintain the sanctity of the  border". It was also requested that a record of Afghan  nationals crossing the border every day should also be  maintained.    The sudden increase in the number of Afghans crossing over  to  Pakistan is due to heavy fighting in Kabul and its surroundings.  A recent report of the United Nations High Commission for  Refugees indicated that a large number of those Afghan refugees  who were repatriated under the UN umbrella have also started  returning to Pakistan and are desperately trying to reoccupy  their houses in different refugee camps in the NWFP.    Pakistan played a host to well over three million Afghan  refugees during the Mujahideen's Jehad against the Soviet forces  and Dr Najibollah-led Kabul regime. [passage omitted]</p>

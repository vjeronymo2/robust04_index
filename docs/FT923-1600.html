			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Air New Zealand stages strong recovery AIR New Zealand yesterday reported a strong recovery in net profits to NZDollars 121.16m (USDollars 65.8m) for the year to June 30. This compares with NZDollars 19.97m for the previous 15 months. The company turned operating losses of NZDollars 14.47m in the previous 15 months to profits of NZDollars 134.3m following what the directors said was a significant turnaround in core costs. This included a further cut in staff by 590 to 8,825 and was in spite of an 8 per cent rise in seat-kilometres flown. Mr Bob Matthew, chairman, said wide-ranging changes in work practices had led to productivity improvements. Significant growth was achieved in international revenues, especially in Asia, Japan and Europe. However, Mr Matthew said the growth was offset 'by stubborn recessionary pressures' which hit sales in North America, Australia and New Zealand. Net yields remained under pressure on most routes, with the Tasman and the Atlantic routes suffering from 'aggressive discounting by American-based and other carriers'. Mr Matthew said progress had been made in achieving a permanently lower cost base which would help Air NZ cope with recently-announced regulatory and structural changes in airline policy in Australia and New Zealand to be implemented over the next few years. He said international conditions remained volatile and highly competitive and Air NZ's domestic market was yet to show a rise in trading volumes. The group's trading performance so far this year was 'mixed', with earnings in line with expectations. However, the directors were optimistic that the airline could continue its recovery towards 'more acceptable' levels of profits. Sales and other gross operating revenues rose 13.1 per cent to NZDollars 2.21bn. Abnormal items - relating to redundancy costs and the sale of the airline's Fokker Friendship fleet - showed losses of NZDollars 13.1m compared with profits of NZDollars 26.3m. The directors are recommending a final dividend of 6 cents, making 10 cents for the year. This is 2 cents higher than forecast. Air NZ and Brierley Investments (BIL) are bidding for a strategic stake in Qantas Airways, the Australian government-owned airline, AP-DJ reports from Wellington. Mr Matthew said his airline and BIL, a New Zealand hotel and investments concern, were carrying out a due diligence examination on Qantas. Due diligence involves a detailed study by a potential suitor of a takeover target's financial accounts to assess its value. A bidding process for the sale by the Australian government of a strategic stake in Qantas was likely to start 'within the next few days,' Mr Matthew said. Qantas, Australia's national airline, is 100 per cent owned by the Australian government. But the government intends to sell up to 49 per cent of Qantas in a trade sale, and is looking for international airlines and other companies to obtain strategic shareholdings in Qantas. The rest of Qantas will be sold through an initial public offering in Australia at a later date.</p>

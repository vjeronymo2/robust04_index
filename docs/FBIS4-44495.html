			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporters Liu sheng-fen (0491 5110 5358) and </F> Cheng Chang-yu (2052 4545 3842) in Taipei: "Taiwan Businessmen's  Enthusiasm Unabated in Investing on Mainland" -- First Quarter  Investments Totaling 314 Projects and Exceeding US$200 Million;  Tientsin Is Among the Top Five Most Popular Areas"]    [Text]  The enthusiasm of Taiwan's businessmen to invest in the mainland  remains unabated. The Investment Commission of the Economics  Ministry announced yesterday (7 May) that as of the end of the  first quarter of 1994, more than 10,000 applications from  Taiwan's businesses to invest in the mainland have been approved  with the total amount of investments exceeding US$3.8 billion in  value. Tientsin has, for the first time, squeezed itself into  the top five most popular areas. Investments in the manufacture  of basic metal products are expected to increase.    According to statistics announced by the Investment  Commission yesterday, 314 projects for indirect investment in  the mainland were approved by the government with a total amount  of investments reaching US$246 million in value. This has  brought the total number of approved projects, by the  government, investing in the mainland to over 10,000 and the  total amount of investments to US$3.836 billion. The  investments are mainly made by Taiwan's businesses for the  manufacture of electric and electronic products, plastic wares,  food, beverages, precision machinery and basic metal products in  the mainland.    The Investment Commission admitted that the statistics  showed  that Taiwan's businessmen's enthusiasm to invest in the mainland  remained unabated. However, the government has adopted measures  to cool off the across-Straits exchanges under the influence of  the Chientaohu Incident. The April meeting to examine special  cases involving investments in the mainland was called off. As  for the schedule to resume this meeting, the Investment  Commission said that it was a matter of policy and that it was  waiting for further instructions.    The statistics compiled by the Investment Commission showed  that Shanghai remained the most favorable spot on the mainland  for Taiwan's businesses to make investments. Tungwan of  Kwangtung ranked second; and Shenchen took third. For the first  time, the city of Tientsin squeezed itself into the rankings to  take fourth. Amoy ranked fifth.    A large amount of investments went to the manufacturing of  basic metal products amounting to US$51.59 million in value. As  for the number of projects, as many as 48 projects approved were  in the manufacture of electric and electronic appliances and  products.    Apparently the aforementioned figure announced by the  Investment Commission sharply differs from the US$10 billion  quoted by the mainland source as the total amount of Taiwan  businessmen's investments there. The Investment Commission  believes that the figure quoted by the mainland source may  possibly include the amount of investments that the Taiwan  businesses had preliminarily promised to make. As for the  credibility of the figure revealed by the Investment Commission,  the commission pointed out that since last year when Taiwan  businesses with investments in the mainland were asked to  register once again, the majority of them had complied with the  request. Thus, the figures should be quite reliable.    However, an official of the Investment Commission pointed  out: Many entrepreneurs with investments in the mainland have  failed to register themselves for their mainland investments and  their cases were reported to the authorities by other  businessmen. Scores of such cases were handled by the  Investment Commission. Huang Ching-tang, head of the  commission, said that the commission will check and verify the  cases. If they are found to be true, these entrepreneurs will  be fined between 3 million and 15 million yuan in accordance  with the Regulation on Relations Between Peoples Across the  Straits.</p>

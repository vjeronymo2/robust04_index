			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HAVE YOU HAD AN ABORTION? WOULD YOU?  </P> <P> The subject comes up every year about this time, after the anniversary of the  U.S. Supreme Court's controversial 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing  abortion. But with a more conservative court and President Bush's anti-abortion  stand, the air is even more charged this time around. Tell us how Roe vs. Wade  affected your life. If you've had an abortion, legal or illegal, do you regret  it now? Which side of the controversy are you on, and why?  </P> <P> When a Child Isn't Perfect  </P> <P> They call them "special" children, those with mental retardation, autism, spina  bifida or other disabilities that set them apart from "normal" kids. If there's  a "special" child in your family, tell us how you've adjusted to the reality,  and how you cope with the fact that your child may never become independent.  </P> <P> Send your comments to Family Life, Orange County Life, The Times, 1375  Sunflower Ave., Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626.

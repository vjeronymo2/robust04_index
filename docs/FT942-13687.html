			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / International Company News: ITT hopes to salvage takeover of Ciga chain ITT Sheraton of the US is believed be hoping that its deal to buy Ciga, the Italian luxury hotel chain, can be salvaged, in spite of indications that it faced collapse. ITT is thought to be hoping that its threat to withdraw from the deal will lead to a drop in Ciga's soaring share price, allowing the chain's creditor banks to deliver a majority of shares to the US group. ITT announced last Thursday that it had recalled all its staff from the 35 Ciga hotels, where they had been preparing the way for the takeover. The announcement followed a sharp rise in the Ciga share price, which threatened to increase substantially the L900bn (Dollars 532m) ITT agreed to pay for the chain earlier this year. The share price rise resulted from the unexpected success of a L983bn rights issue, launched on March 17, which had been widely expected to be poorly subscribed, as it was priced at L1,000. ITT's offer was the equivalent of L740 a share. The failure of the rights issue would have allowed Ciga's 22 creditor banks, led by Mediobanca, to take on the shares and sell them to ITT. However, since the rights issue, Ciga's shares have been trading at above L1,000. Ciga's creditor banks were yesterday reported to be discussing the unexpected outcome of the rights issue with Mediobanca. Ciga is likely next week to declare the rights issue a resounding success. The group could raise at least L670bn, and may even sell the outstanding 280m shares at an auction in 10 days, if the Ciga share price does not drop. Continued enthusiasm for Ciga shares could scupper the ITT deal. It is understood that ITT has no contractual obligation to go ahead with the deal unless the creditor banks can deliver the majority of the shares.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Properties firm A bright property sector was enlivened by recommendations fom Kleinwort Benson and SG Warburg, as well as some positive weekend press comment. Among those doing well, British Land rose 5 to 385p, as did Land Securities, to 663p, while MEPC added 9 at 496p. Press speculation that Ladbroke Group was considering floating its property division caused little interest in the market. While the company was said to be denying the move to analysts, many said they believed that such a development would eventually find its way on to the company's debt-cutting agenda, although not until next year. Ladbroke shares climbed a half-penny to 210p. RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, firmed 3 to 735p in the registered ahead of first-half results due on Thursday. The group is forecast to announce profits of Pounds 170m to Pounds 200m, up to 25 per cent ahead of last year's as a result of improved productivity, acquisitions and currency gains. Royal Bank of Scotland continued to receive support from a broker's buy recommendation on Friday, adding 4 at 292p. National Westminster was restrained by speculation of a large preference share issue, but analysts were sceptical and added that it would have little impact on the ordinary shares, which closed a penny firmer at 481p. Oil group Burmah was held back as investors digested last week's results and decided that they were slightly more disappointing than the headline figure suggested. The shares slipped 4 1/2 to 773p xd. In spite of the Labor Day closure of the US markets, Enterprise Oil was bought by US institutions operating in London and rose 6 to 494p . The majors, Shell Transport and BP, were restrained by a weaker oil price and ended slightly easier on balance at 665p and 307p respectively. Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome was held back by reports of a Japanese drug found to be capable of inhibiting the death of cells infected by HIV, the virus that causes Aids. The drug will need to be tested in animals for at least two years before any clinical trial can be considered so the drug is many years away from the market. Wellcome is always vulnerable to negative sentiment from Aids stories. The shares shed 9 at one stage and closed 5 off at 744p. Glaxo improved 2 to 620p ahead of full-year results on Thursday, with volume boosted by heavy activity in the traded options market. Analysts expect about Pounds 1.66bn, up from Pounds 1.43bn in 1992, but there are some worries that in the light of the new harsher climate for the drugs industry the accompanying statement could encourage profit-taking. Medeva advanced 5 to 123p xd as securities house Smith New Court repeated a buy recommendation, arguing that the share price, which has halved since a profits warning last month, was cheap. Also, word leaked out that French owned SGST was preparing an enthusiastic piece of research. Dealers pointed to a recommendation from a small broker aimed at private clients as the reason behind strength in Enviromed, up 7 at 118p. Whispers of a big rights issue ahead of Cadbury Schweppes' results on Thursday were being heard. Analysts said that while such an event would not be surprising, similar talk has been well aired in the past. The shares gained 2 at 476p. Shares in shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft were in demand after it announced a further order from Qatar to provide spares, maintenance and training for four fast strike craft which it ordered from Vosper last year. They rose 12 to 674p. Vague talk that GKN was taking a look at Westland, in which it has a stake, was heard, although analysts dismissed suggestions of a takeover. GKN closed at 488p xd and the latter put on 8 at 244p. A positive annual meeting held by engineering group Siebe boosted the stock, the shares gaining 9 to 541p. Figures released at the weekend showing a sharp increase in UK car sales boosted several stocks in the motor sector. These included distributor Bletchley, where the shares jumped 25 to 335p, ahead of Friday's interim figures; Dagenham Motor, which hardened 3 to 139p; and Pendragon, 5 better at 283p. Steel group ASW Holdings fell 10 to 214p after it reported interim figures below market expectations, inspite of returning to profit. Half-time figures came in at Pounds 1.5m against a loss of Pounds 2.1m last time. Brokers moved to downgrade full-year expectations following the figures, with Smith New Court reducing its forecast by Pounds 3m to Pounds 11m. Conglomerate Suter cheered the market by reporting bumper profits and the shares hardened 4 to 184p. Birkby, the property and vehicle hire company, rose 6 to 190p and Cosalt, the manufacturer and supplier, was lifted 13 to 130p. Dealers said a bear squeeze was responsible for pushing both stocks higher. Birkby received additional support from the property market's recent good run. Elsewhere, food maufacturing issues were mostly positive, with Hoare Govett advising clients to switch out of capital goods stocks and to go overweight in the sector. Nervousness ahead of results today pulled down Hillsdown, off 3 at 165p. Publisher Harrington Kilbride jumped 16 to 250p ahead of interim results today. Meanwhile Haynes, the publisher of technical manuals, leapt 37 to 455p after a boost in profits to Pounds 3.95m and a confident statement from the chairman.</p>

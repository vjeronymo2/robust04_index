			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Gavrilenko report: "One `Desert Storm' Will Suffice"] </F>   [Text] The Orenburg Oblast Administration building has  been picketed. The participants in this protest action demanded  the cancellation of Russian-U.S. exercises in the Totsk training  area and the rejection of cooperation with servicemen from the  U.S. Third Infantry Division under the command of General  Holder, which participated in operation "Desert Storm" in Iraq.    Earlier, local representatives of 14 public movements and  parties, including the Orenburg organization of the Agrarian  Party, protested the joint exercises in Totsk.    The protest against the "peacemaking exercises" is beginning  to strike a chord in other oblasts and republics in the Urals  and Volga region.</p>

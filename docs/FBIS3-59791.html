Introduction </H5>   Optical fiber cables carry extremely high volumes of  information with little attenuation. They have such advantages  as being free of electromagnetic interference, thin in diameter,  light, and energy efficient. Therefore, they are viewed as one  of the greatest inventions of the twentieth century as a  transmission medium to support the information-oriented society.  Although optical fiber cables were unimagined just twenty-five  years ago, their stunning development and progress have begun to  virtually replace the old copper wire communication cables  technology which has sustained a one hundred year history.    Serious development of optical fibers began in 1970. The  initial stage was experimental research, then there was a series  of failures under actual environmental conditions.  Characteristic failures included:    1. Increased attenuation due to hydrogen.    2. Fiber breakage.    3. Eccentric cores.    4. Separation of glass and resin due to water penetration  Increased attenuation.    5. Increased attenuation due to bubbles in coating layers.    6. Difficulty in splicing because of lowered adhesion  between  glass and coating layers.    7. Difficulty in splicing because of increased jacket  stripping force.    Many research projects for improvement were launched on the  basis of these failures. Today, both functionality and quality  have reached near perfection.    This paper introduces:    1. The present state of functionality and quality;    2. The trends of productivity and cost efficiency;    3. Fulfilling the needs of the market.    I hope this paper will be a contributive reference for the  application and expansion of optical fiber cables.  <H5>  2. Research and Development </H5> <H5>  (1) Improved Functionality </H5>   One of the major characteristics of optical fibers is their  large information-carrying capacity. Most of the current  transmission systems employing optical fibers use a method of  sending light pulses as a signal. The information carrying  capacity is determined by the duration of the interval between  the light pulses. When pulses are sent over long distances, they  expand and overlap adjacent pulses, and become undistinguishable  upon reception. This expansion of pulses is called dispersion.  There are the following types of dispersion:    1. Modal dispersion;    2. Waveguide dispersion;    3. Material dispersion.    As Figure 1 shows, in the case of light injected into fibers  with comparatively large diameters, there is a wide variety of  light ray components, from the component that is propagated  along the interface of the core and the cladding while being  totally reflected repeatedly, to the component that is  propagated along the center of the core and experiences  practically no total reflection. These components exist  discretely, and each one is called a mode. The delay time is  different for each mode. This is the cause of the spreading of  pulses in the case of multi-mode fibers, in which one pulse  consists of many modes. By utilizing the refractive index  dependence of light velocity, the graded index (GI) fiber was  developed. In this fiber, the mode dispersion is cancelled by  making the refractive index in the center of the core high and  the refractive index on the periphery low. However, as it is  impossible to completely eliminate pulse spreading due to modal  dispersion, there is a tendency to deviate from use of this  fiber. When the core diameter is made sufficiently small, a  condition is formed where these modes are unable to exist except  for one. In the single mode fiber, which was designed with this  condition, there is in principle no pulse spreading due to modal  dispersion, and so transmission at an extremely high bit rate  became possible. At present, virtually all communications fibers  are of this type. Even this single mode fiber has limitations on  its information-carrying capacity. The reason for this is pulse  spreading due to material dispersion and waveguide dispersion.  The cause of pulse spreading due to these two kinds of  dispersion is that delay time is dependent on wavelength. This  dependence of delay time on wavelength is relative to  alterations in glass composition and distribution of refractive  index. Even when a laser diode is used as the light source, the  light does not oscillate on a single wavelength, but is composed  of a plurality of wavelengths. Therefore, pulse spreading occurs  due to differences in the delay time of each wavelength. To  minimize this pulse spreading, the center of the wavelengths of  the light source should be made to reach the maximum point on a  graph of the relationship of light velocity to wavelength. This  is illustrated in Figure 2. The maximum point is called the  zero-dispersion wavelength. Currently, the most widely used  light source wavelength for single mode fibers is the 1.3 &mgr;  band. The zero-dispersion wavelength of fibers used is also 1.3  &mgr;, the same as that of the light source wavelength.             Recently, use of a transmission system has begun which  employs the 1.55&mgr; band, in which the attenuation of optical  fibers is lowest. Also, by increasing the difference in  refractive indices between the core and the cladding, and  reducing the core diameter, the fiber whose zero-dispersion  wavelength is shifted to 1.55 &mgr;, called the dispersion  shifted  fiber, was developed and is now in use. This system was first  used by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) of Japan. A  repeaterless transmission was realized by ocean cable over the  120 km distance from Matsuyama to Oita. This cable was installed  in 1988 with an information carrying capacity of 1.6 Gbps.  Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) plans to use the dispersion shifted  fiber in a cable (TPC-5) to be laid in 1995-1996 on the floor of  the Pacific Ocean. The use of recently developed optical fiber  amplification technology is also planned for this system. KDD  plans to send 5 Gbps signals of light over a distance of 9,500  km with no conversion of light into electricity, relaying it  with optical fiber amplifiers.    Another distinguished characteristic of optical fibers is  their attenuation. The major component of the glass used to make  optical fibers is SiO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; . As shown in Figure 3, the  manufacturing methods include the modified-chemical vapor  deposition (MCVD) method in which the raw material of  SiCl&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt;  is vaporized and oxidized, and the outside  vapor deposition (OVD) method and vapor-phase axial deposition  (VAD) method, in which hydrolytic dissociation is performed in  the flame of a burner. In each method, because the core and  cladding are produced while rotating, there is, in principle, no  eccentricity of the core, but actually, the core sometimes  becomes eccentric when glass rods are connected at each end for  handling. For this reason, total inspection of the core  eccentricity is conducted.       The vapor pressure of SiCl&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt; , the raw material of  optical fibers, is much larger than that of salts of  transitional metals, which induce increased attenuation.  Therefore, it is easy to eliminate transitional metal  impurities. However, as the raw material can be adulterated with  SiHCl&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt;  or with moisture due to leaks into the raw  material supply pipes, OH groups become incorporated in the  glass. These OH groups absorb light, inducing worsened  attenuation. In the VAD method, which was developed in Japan,  because glass is synthesized by hydrolytic dissociation of the  raw material in a flame, there is in principle much adulteration  with OH groups. Therefore, undertaking the development of  technology to remove OH groups after glass synthesis, success  was ultimately achieved with the use of chlorine to remove  hydrogen. After the removal of OH groups, the causes of  attenuation are Rayleigh scattering, which has a larger effect  at short wavelengths, and molecular vibrational absorption of  Si-O, which has a larger effect at long wavelengths. Rayleigh  scattering is dependent on the concentration of the dopant in  the core. For the formation of refractive index distribution,  usually germanium is added to the core to increase the  refractive index. In contrast, fluorine may be added to the  cladding to reduce the refractive index. Rayleigh scattering is  suppressed by making the core of pure SiO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  because  of no dopant in the core. Japan has developed the fluorine  dopant technology and has realized the pure silica core single  mode fiber in which attenuation is further reduced by  10-15&percnt;.  These fibers were used in 1992 in the second trans-Pacific  optical fiber cable (TPC-4).    As in the previous description, dispersion shifted fibers  have attained the limit for information-carrying capacity, and  pure silica core fibers the limit for attenuation. Figure 4  shows an attenuation-wavelengthcurve for a typical optical fiber  and the causes of that attenuation.       Optical fibers are made of glass. Glass is well known as a  fragile material. Therefore, ever since the early stages of  optical fiber development, research has been conducted on ways  to maintain their strength. Glass is strong to begin with; its  fragility is due to the fact that there are cracks on its  surface. Optical fibers are produced drawing the molten glass  preform. In this process, optical fibers are coated with resin  to protect their surface before it can touch a hard object, so  that the optical fiber retains its original degree of strength.  This technology was also invented in Japan. Figure 3(d) shows  the concept of the drawing machine. Because the adhesion of  foreign substances to the surface of a fiber weakens its  strength, cleanliness is also emphasized in the fiber  manufacturing process not only for attenuation but also for  strength. Because it is in reality impossible to achieve  100&percnt;  cleanliness, weak spots are intentionally broken with a certain  tensile load that is applied beforehand, so that the weak areas  are not shipped. This process is called screening.    On the one hand, when hard resin is used as the coating  material, the fiber receives minute bends when a non-uniform  lateral pressure is applied, increasing attenuation. On the  other hand, soft resin is unable to fulfill the role of  protecting the surface of the fiber. Therefore, the resin for  coating has a two-layer structure, composed of a soft resin  which protects the fiber, and outside this is a hard resin which  protects that soft resin. Atop this, for the purpose of  distinction, color is applied with ink. When foreign particles  become stuck on in the coating process, the outside diameter  becomes larger in spots, so that bends arise in fibers when they  are combined as cables, increasing attenuation. Several colored  fibers are lined up side by side and covered with resin. This  resin layer is called ribbon coating. The structure is shown in  Figure 5. When the ribbonized fibers are separated, the ribbon  coating is removed. But if the ink sticks to the ribbon coating  at this time and is stripped, it becomes impossible to  distinguish the fibers; so countermeasures for this must be also  considered.       On the one hand, if the adhesion between the soft resin and  the glass is high, the coating cannot be stripped away cleanly  at the time of splicing. On the other hand, if there is no  adhesion, difficulties arise when the ribbon fibers are spliced.  The fibers and the coating will slip after the coated resin at  the ends of the fibers is stripped, and when the ribbon is held  at the resin part, because the length of the extrusion of the  fibers is not uniform splicing is impossible, as shown in Figure  6. The degree of adhesion, therefore, must be controlled to  satisfy these two conditions. Coating strippability is also  related to Young's modulus. This is shown in Figure 7.             The prevention of generating air bubbles in coating layers  is  also important. When there are many air bubbles, bends arise in  the fiber due to non-uniform stress. This increases attenuation.  Especially at low temperatures, the Young's modulus of the resin  increases, and the difference in thermal contraction between the  glass and the resin can produce a large stress, increasing  attenuation. The generation of air bubbles is prevented by  revising the die structure and by process parameter control,  such as resin temperature. An on-line air bubble sensor has also  been developed.    Consequently, the materials used to coat the glass are also  important. We can observe that many kinds of studies have been  made from every angle up to the present time.  <H5>  (2) Improvement in Quality </H5>   As in the description in part (1), the functionality of  optical fibers has reached its limits. The next step would be to  produce optical fibers without variance in this functionality so  as to ship them with assurance, and to prevent loss of  functionality after shipping. Group activities by production  technicians for improvement have been very effective for  reducing variance in production. Control of the purity of the  gas used and leak checking in the supply pipes are important for  low attenuation. Because alteration of the distribution of the  refractive index causes the variance of the mode field diameter  (power distribution of the light to be propagated in the fiber),  the cutoff wavelength (wavelength limit in which single mode  propagation is possible) and the zero-dispersion wavelength,  inspection is conducted at the preform stage, and feedback is  made if there are any abnormalities. Especially in the steps  after glass synthesis from fiber formation to coating,  cleanliness control in the manufacturing process is important  for strength.    It is also essential that characteristics of fibers remain  unchanged for many years after cables are laid. If hydrogen is  dissolved in the glass, attenuation increases because of light  absorption by hydrogen molecules. Origins of this hydrogen  include the decomposition of resin used as the coating material  and the oxidation of metals used to form the cable. As  countermeasures, resin which produces little hydrogen is used,  and oxidation-resistant metals are used to plate the metals  used. Also, if defects exist in the Si-O network within the  glass, hydrogen reacts with these defects, increasing  attenuation even further. Therefore, it is also important that  no defects be formed in the glass network in the glass synthesis  process. Figure 8 shows the spectral attenuation of a fiber in  which attenuation is increased by hydrogen.       Quartz glass is water dissolvable. Its dissolution is  accelerated by tensile force applied to the fiber. The fibers  are stranded in the cable, and receive a slight amount of  tensile force. Water vapor in the cables causes the gradual  growth of cracks on the surface of the optical fiber, so that  finally, breakage can occur as a result of a small tensile  force. Breakage lifetime depends on original strength of the  fiber, the tensile force that is applied to it, and a value  n expressing the speed of crack growth. The value  n is a numberthat is determined experimentally from  the relationship between the tensile force applied to a fiber  and the breakage lifetime. It depends on temperature and  humidity. Figure 9 shows one example of the relationship between  tensile force applied to a fiber and the breakage lifetime. The  slope of the curve is the value n. The strength of a  fiber decreases even in a state without load stress; the speed  of this decrease in strength depends on the kind of resin used  for the coating.       The properties of resin change when it is exposed to  humidity  or ultraviolet light. This process can lead to changes in the  characteristics of fiber. First, the color of the resin yellows  due to ultraviolet light, making distinction difficult. Since it  has been found that fibers may change in color when stored for a  long period of time in a warehouse with fluorescent lamps,  countermeasures have been taken. It has also been observed that  adhesion may change between glass and coating layer due to  humidity, and bubbles appear within the coating layer. Bubbles  which exist within the coating layer from the start also grow,  causing problems. With the increase in the number of fibers used  in high-fiber-count cables, cable splicing requires more time,  causing the fibers to be exposed directly to rain or humidity in  manholes. In extreme cases, the manholes can be flooded. In such  cases, the humidity resistance of resin is important. Changes in  adhesion are considered to be caused by breakage of the hydrogen  bonds between the glass and the resin by water. This is shown in  Figure 10. Adhesion is scrupulously controlled in the fiber  manufacturing process, but when this adhesion changes due to  humidity, problems occur at the time of cable connection. The  appearance and growth of bubbles within the coating cause  micro-bends of fiber, which affect attenuation. Bubbles at the  glass-resin interface are especially important factors in  attenuation.       The resin used for fiber coating has been developed with the  above points in mind, and resin has been developed in which the  kinds of problems observed earlier do not arise. Table 1 is an  example of the results of underwater, high temperature or high  humidity conditions accelerated degradation tests. When a fiber  is left in water at 100&deg;C for 16 hours, delamination may  occur between the glass and the soft resin, and bubbles appear.  As a result, attenuation increases. Also, when a fiber is left  for four months at 95&percnt; humidity and 60&deg;C, the  stripping  force may change, making connection difficult. Leaving a fiber  at the low temperature of -40&deg;C may also increase  attenuation. When a fiber is left under water for six months, it  is possible that the fiber's strength decreases. These phenomena  depend on the type of resin used for coating. By selecting an  appropriate type of resin, strength reduction can be prevented.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Optical fiber cables have become highly reliable.  <H5>  3. Production Methods </H5> <H5>  (3) Improvement in Productivity </H5>   As the price drop in the optical fiber market has been  remarkable, it is natural that every maker is concentrating on  increasing productivity. The main factors that determine  productivity are speed of glass synthesis, drawing speed, and  preform size. In 1989, it was reported that the speed of glass  synthesis was 9 g/min by the OVD method of Corning, and the  preform size was 90 km/preform. These values were slightly  higher with Japan's VAD method. A glass synthesis speed of 20  g/min at the laboratory by the VAD method has been reported. The  drawing speed of 1,200 m/min is also the highest that has been  reported.    In the VAD method, improvements have been made to the  structure of the burner for flame hydrolysis in order to  increase the speed of synthesis. When drawing speed increases in  the drawing process, coating resin is applied to hot fibers, and  the resin decomposes. To avoid this, it is necessary to  sufficiently cool the fibers after they emerge from the drawing  furnace and before they enter the coating die, therefore, the  distance is lengthened from the drawing furnace to the coating  die. Drawing towers that are twenty meters or more in height are  also being considered for this. In response to high speed  drawing, technology has been developed to apply pressure to the  resin inside the die that will be used to coat fibers, and high  resin curing speed has been achieved. In the early development  of optical fibers, thermosetting silicone resin, which is  extremely stable chemically, was used. But more recently, to  increase the drawing speed, UV-light curable resin is more  common because of its very high curing speed. To advance the  curing speed even further, high-power UV lamps have been  developed.  <H5>  (4) Cost Reduction </H5>   The cost of optical fibers includes indirect expenses such  as  the cost of research in addition to expenses for raw materials,  personnel, and facilities. Since SiCl&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt; , the raw  material of the glass, is a byproduct of the production of  silicon for semiconductor devices from the raw material of  SiHCl&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt; , refining and transportation compose most of  the raw material expenses for the glass. However, the  requirements for the resin material to be used in coating are  stringent, as written in the explanation in section 2, and this  kind of resin is not produced in as large a quantity as other  plastics, so it is quite costly. The cost of gases such as  oxygen, hydrogen, and helium and the cost of electricity are  also high. Personnel expenses per unit length of fiber during  the manufacturing process are relatively low because of  increased productivity, as in the description in section (3).  However, as inspection items are added for quality improvement,  the expenses in this aspect remain high. Facility expenses have  decreased somewhat due to increased productivity, but there are  also factors increasing facility expenses, such as the  enlargement of machines, factory automation, and the  installation of sensors for quality improvement. Facility  expenses do not necessarily decrease in direct correlation to  increased productivity.  <H5>  4. Market Needs </H5> <H5>  (5) Increase in Types of Cable Structure </H5>   There are many types of optical fiber cable structures,  depending upon the applications. Since different types of cables  are used overseas, the number of types is further increased.  First, the cables used domestically will be discussed. Cable  structures can be explained by looking at the number of fibers  included in one cable. There are single-fiber cables in which  one fiber is housed in one cable. These generally have a  structure in which strengthening materials and jacket are  applied to the inner fiber. For cables of up to about 12 fibers,  a layer type is used in which fibers are stranded around a  strength member. Up to about 48 fibers, a unit structure is used  in which units of eight fibers are stranded with each other and  then further stranded around a strength member. In cables of one  hundred fibers, a grooved spacer structure is used in which five  4-fiber ribbons are housed in each groove of a spacer with five  grooves.    In an era in which optical fibers reach each house, as many  fibers as houses go out from the telephone office, necessitating  the use of high-fiber-count cables. The highest fiber count in  cables currently laid is 1,000, and the diameter of this  1,000-fiber cable is just 40 mm. Eight-fiber ribbon is used in  this cable. This is shown in Figure 11. In the slotted core type  cable, water-swelling tape is used for protection against water  entry. At present, the development of super high-count cable  with higher fiber count is under way. The structure of these  cables use stranded units of ten 16-fiber ribbons. Cables of up  to 4,000 fibers are being considered. This is shown in Figure 12.             Ocean cables are laid at depths reaching several thousand  meters from cable laying ships, so they receive large tensile  forces. The water pressure they are subject to after being laid  is also very large. In the structure used by KDD, the fiber  units are encased in three divisions of steel shells to make  them resistant to that tensile force and water pressure, and  steel wires are stranded around these. This is covered with a  copper tube, which transmits electrical power, and on top of  that, two layers of polyethylene, low-density polyethylene and  high-density polyethylene, are used to block seawater. To combat  any water penetration, a compound to prevent the spreading of  water is used to fill the area between the steel components.  This is shown in Figure 13.       The special feature of optical fibers is that they are not  subject to electromagnetic interference. Therefore, it is  possible to construct composite fiber-optic power cables, in  which optical fibers are included in power cables. It is also  possible to lay optical fibers parallel to high-voltage power  cables that are laid along steel towers. Composite fiber-optic  overhead ground wires are widely used at present. Here, overhead  ground wires laid parallel to power cables are used as pipes,  and optical fibers are encased inside these pipes.    Overseas, the loose tube cable is the standard. The fibers  are inserted into a tube, and the tube is then filled with a  jelly to prevent water permeation. Caution must be exercised  because the jelly may erode the resin used for coating.  <H5>  (6) Production Capacity and Delivery Times </H5>   In 1992, 2.46 million kilometers of optical fiber were  produced in Japan (from a survey by The Japanese Electric Wire  and Cable Makers' Association). In a plan by NTT, B-ISDN is to  be constructed and optical fibers are to be laid to every  household by the year 2015. There are reports that this plan may  be postponed because of falling income levels at NTT, but it is  clear that even if the plan is delayed two or three years, many  fibers will be necessary. The companies involved will have  sufficient production capacity to fully respond to those future  needs. The preparation of such a production system will also  result in shorter delivery times from ordering to shipment.  <H5>  (7) Development of Related Technologies </H5> <H5>  1. Fusion Splicing </H5>   To join optical fibers, the ends of the fibers are cleaved  to  mirror surfaces, and then aligned and fusion spliced with  heating by electrical discharge. In the case of single mode  fibers, the core diameter is extremely small, at only 8 &mgr;,  and  it is necessary for the fibers to be aligned as precisely as  possible. For this alignment, the sides of the fibers are  illuminated, and their position is thereby confirmed for proper  alignment during splicing. Confirmation of core position is  conducted automatically through image processing based on  information from a CCD camera. At present, the loss due to  splicing is at the extremely low level of 0.03 dB.    To join ultrahigh-fiber-count cables, fiber by fiber  splicing  would take an immense amount of time. Therefore, a technology  has been developed whereby fiber ribbons are joined all at once.  For this mass fusion splicing technique, it is necessary that  each fiber that is to be spliced should be heated identically  with electrical discharge energy. It is set so that all the  fibers in a ribbon are placed in the position where the energy  is uniformly distributed. This is shown in Figure 14. In this  method, ribbons of up to sixteen fibers can be simultaneously  spliced.       A fully automatic fusion splicer is being developed. This  machine will automatically conduct operations from jacket  removing to reinforcing after splicing. When use of this fusion  splicer is begun, splicing will be possible at about four times  the speed of conventional splicing machines. The industry is  looking forward to this machine as it will create great labor  savings and shorten training time as well.  <H5>  2. Connectors </H5>   Even with the development of a fusion splicer that can  handle  sixteen fibers at once, quite a long time is needed to splice  ultrahigh-fiber-count cables such as those that encase four  thousand fibers. Even with the fully automatic fiber splicer,  calculations show that it would take a full day to splice cables  of this type. Therefore, discussions are being held regarding  the development of high-count-fiber connectors. Thefiber count  in a connector so far developed is sixteen. The connectors line  up the cores of mating fibers by inserting two pins called  guide-pins into the guide-holes on both sides of the fiber  ribbon. The accuracy of the alignment is within 1 &mgr;, and the  loss due to splicing has reached an average level of 0.2 dB. The  structure of the connector is shown in Figure 15. The  development of eighty-fiber connectors is also in progress.  There are two methods: one in which eighty fibers are lined up  in one row, and the other in which sixteen fiber connectors are  arranged in five vertical rows. Taking two minutes as the  connecting time for one connector, the joining time of four  thousand fibers cables would be just one hundred minutes.     <H5>  3. Surveillance System for Optical Fiber Network </H5>   Along with progress in the deployment of optical  communications systems, the effects of accidents involving  optical fiber cables breakage will become extremely serious.  Conventionally, nitrogen gas was sealed inside a cable at a  certain pressure, and accidents were detected by monitoring this  gas pressure. However, to suppress costs the gas-pressurized  cable system has been abandoned, and instead, attenuation is  measured periodically. When attenuation increase is detected, it  is necessary to switch immediately to spare fibers. NTT has  developed the system shown in Figure 16. In this system, light  of a different wavelength from the signal light wavelength is  used to measure the attenuation of a fiber in use.       The optical components used in this system include a coupler  that combines light of two different wavelengths and a fiber  selecting switch that is used to launch the measuring light into  each fiber sequentially. The coupler is made with the technique  of fiber fusing. The switch is composed of the mechanically  movable master connector and the connector arrays opposed to the  master connector. However, it is hoped that a non-mechanical  switch will be developed in the future. To reflect the measuring  light at the end of the fiber under test, a filter is installed  which passes the signal light through but causes the measuring  light to reflect. The switch to a spare fiber, in case any  abnormality is detected, is made by a mechanical optical switch.    As optical fibers become more and more widespread, to  construct an accurate data base of information regarding optical  fiber networks that is necessary for cable maintenance and  management, including manufacturing data, characteristics of  transmission, installation date, placed location, and data on  spliced lines, automatic renewal of the current manual  collection processes is being considered by NTT. This would  enable the quick selection of idle fibers for new subscribers  and quick switching from lines with problems to idle lines. The  main components for the system are the connector with memory,  the local controller (LCTR) (a simple transmitter with  microprocessor) which sends information from this memory to a  central workstation, and appropriate optical fibers. The  connector with memory is used when joining optical cables in a  manhole; when joining the connectors, the memory chips on the  connectors are also fixed on the printed circuit board (PCB).  The LCTR gathers information from the memory chips through the  PCB and sends the information to the workstation at the  telephone office viaappropriate fibers. The system structure is  shown in Figure 17.     <H5>  5. Summary </H5>   Since the latter half of the 1970's optical fibers have been  made into cables and laid on site. In the meantime, trouble of  various kinds has occurred in the factory and on site, and  improvements have been made in response to these problems. At  present, almost all of the problems have been exhausted, and it  seems that the industry has neared the point of perfection in  creating countermeasures for these problems. With their  excellent reliability, these optical fibers will be laid on a  global scale in the future. As a result, it is expected that a  high level information society will be realized with various  services available at a low cost, and that a number of new  industries will be established in relation to this achievement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 20 Apr (PL) -- The most important thing is  the path that is opening up, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  told Cuban television today, referring to the Conference on the  Nation and Emigration aimed at normalizing relations with  residents abroad.    The conference also intends to seek the way in which we all,  in a responsible and civilized manner, with respect and mutual  understanding, can discuss common issues henceforth, the  minister told the evening television newscast, upon arriving  from a successful tour of several South American countries.    According to the foreign relations minister, for a long time  the emigre community has been used as an instrument against Cuba.    As the reality of Cuban residents abroad is expressed  differently and as the reality of the country changes, steps are  taken as a result of a new situation, demonstrating the audacity  of our project and the country convoking it, Robaina added.    The foreign minister said conditions continue to be as  abnormal as before; therefore, it cannot be asked that ties with  emigrants be normal.    Once more Cuba, rising above these circumstances, is capable  of finding a solution and its own subject in these times,  Robaina asserted.    Some 200 guests from over 40 countries will participate, on  their own behalf, in the meeting that will run from next Friday  to Sunday in this capital.</p>

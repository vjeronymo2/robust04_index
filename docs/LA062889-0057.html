			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Journalist Bill Moyers will receive $5 million in funding for public television  productions during the next three years through a grant from the John D. and  Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The funds will be divided evenly between  public television stations WTTW (Chicago) and WNET (New York), which serve as  co-presenters for Moyers' programs. Of the $5-million MacArthur grant, $3.75  million is a challenge grant in support of the weekly production of Moyers' "A  World of Ideas," and $1.25 million will create a discretionary fund on which  Moyers can draw to produce new documentaries or specials.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero has announced new  decisions regarding the real currency. Ricupero, who met with  the Chamber of Deputies Economy Committee, came to seek  guarantees that farmers would continue to produce food. Today  it was agreed that the government will renegotiate the farmers'  debts, and give them up to 10 years to repay. The government  will likewise pay the overdue farming insurance debts and  suspend for three months the Bank of Brazil lawsuits against  farmers in arrears.    During a luncheon with commerce representatives, Ricupero  explained the implementation of the new currency. During this  luncheon he gave advance notice of some of the points of the  economic plan:    Credits: The government will not adopt any measure to reduce  consumption of goods like cars and household appliances.    Interest rates: They will continue to be high until the  economy reaches stability.    Contracts: Those in real cruzeiros will be converted into  URV's [real value units] based on the URV rate of 1 July.    Ufir [Reference Fiscal Unit]: It will not be abolished. It  will continue to index income tax paid in advance and overdue  taxes.    Postdated checks: Banks will accept checks written in real  cruzeiros until 1 August.</p>

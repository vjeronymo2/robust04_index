			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE  </P> <P> A woman who gave birth to twins despite an abortion attempt was placed on five  years' probation Thursday for child endangerment.  </P> <P> Vickie Judkins, 24, of Oceanside was ordered by San Diego Municipal Judge H.  Ronald Domnitz to perform 160 hours of volunteer work.  </P> <P> Judkins has already performed 100 hours of volunteer work in a soup kitchen in  Oceanside and was given credit for that. She was fined $100 and given credit  for one day previously spent in jail. No further jail time was imposed, and  none was requested by the prosecutor.  </P> <P> Judkins pleaded guilty March 21 to child endangerment involving the Dec. 30,  1987, birth of one of the twins.  </P> <P> She testified against her mother, Ida Franks, 47, of Oceanside, who is charged  with manslaughter and child abuse. Judkins said her mother who used a  Lysol-soaked straw on her days before the births in an attempt to induce an  abortion.  </P> <P> However, Deputy Dist. Atty. Harry Elias said the charges stem from conduct that  occurred after the births, not from the botched abortion attempt. Judkins said  one baby was born dead and the other child died, allegedly at her mother's  hands.  </P> <P> The bodies of the infants were disposed of and never found. Judkins told  authorities that her husband and her mother put them in a trash bin off  Interstate 5.  </P> <P> Domnitz ordered that if Judkins becomes pregnant again she must consult a  doctor and seek counseling. She has two other children.  </P> <P> A trial date of June 23 has been set for Franks. She has pleaded innocent and  remains free on her own recognizance.  </P></p>

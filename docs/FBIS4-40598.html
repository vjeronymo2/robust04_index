			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Prime-Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is  confident that next July the G-7 countries will grant Russia  political membership of their club. The Big Seven are planning  to hold a summit conference in Naples.    Talking to newsmen Sunday at a Moscow airport before  boarding  a flight for Milan where he is to attend a session of the World  Gas Union, Chernomyrdin said there was a direct link between his  trip to Milan and the Naples summit. He said he would discuss  Russian membership of the G-7 club with his Italian counterpart  Silvio Berlusconi who is to chair the Naples summit.    When he visited Washington on June 21, Chernomyrdin would  discuss the issue with President Clinton. He felt there were no  obstacles for Russian integration into the G-7 club.    According to Chernomyrdin Russia wait with a request for  economic membership of the G-7 club. Moscow realized, he said,  that it could be invited to work on political issues first and  only then join G-7 economic efforts.    In Milan Chernomyrdin would be planning to discuss Russian-  Italian relations with Prime-Minister Berlusconi and clear up  where the two countries stood on the package of agreements he  signed in Italy last January.</p>

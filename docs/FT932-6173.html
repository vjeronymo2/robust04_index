			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Cheam shows 38% advance to Pounds 3.3m Cheam Group, the south of England water supplier, turned in a 38 per cent pre-tax profits advance - from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 3.3m - over the 12 months to end-March. The outcome was achieved on turnover up by Pounds 1.77m to Pounds 13.7m. An improved final dividend of 7p (4p) is recommended, raising the total for the year to 11p (7.5p). The dividend is more than three times covered by earnings per share of 37.2p (26.6p). Mr Andrew Kennedy, chairman, the improvement had been achieved in the face of increasing industry regulation and in spite of a 1 per cent voluntary abatement of the increase in water supply charges permitted by the regulator.</p>

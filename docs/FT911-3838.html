			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Travis Perkins declines to Pounds 20.36m THE RECESSION in the UK housebuilding industry has caused pre-tax profits to fall for the second year in succession at Travis Perkins, the builders' merchant and timber group. Last year profits fell by almost 38 per cent, from Pounds 32.8m to Pounds 20.36m. In the previous 12 months pre-tax profits fell by 16 per cent. Mr Tony Travis, chairman said: 'The current year will be another difficult one for the construction industry. The first three months of this year, particularly January and February, were very poor. First-half profits, therefore, will be down sharply on those achieved in the corresponding period last year. 'The downturn is such that it will be very difficult to catch it up during the rest of the year - even allowing for a recovery in the second half of the year.' Pre-tax profits last year were reduced by about Pounds 4m charged against bad debts: 'Bad debts, as a proportion of sales, were about three times higher than we would expect in a normal market,' said Mr Travis. Redundancy costs reduced profits by a further Pounds 1.5m. There was an exceptional charge of a similar amount to cover the final costs of integrating the Travis Arnold and Sandall Perkins businesses, merged in 1988. There was a net reduction of about 400 staff last year, achieved through a combination of natural wastage and redundancy. The group, on the other hand, raised about Pounds 3m from property sales. Turnover fell by 3.6 per cent from Pounds 360.9m to Pounds 347.7m. Volume sales were down by about a tenth. Profits in the second six months fell by more than half to Pounds 6.9m. This compares with a 21 per cent fall to Pounds 13.5m in the first half. 'The last quarter of 1990 was particularly gruelling, with bad debts and redundancy costs adding to overheads as building activity continued to decline,' said Mr Travis. The group declared a final dividend of 5.5p making a total payment of 8p, the same as in 1989. Dividends were 1.7 times covered by earnings per share of 13.8p (22p). COMMENT About three quarters of Travis Perkins' sales go to the housing market for repair, maintenance and improvement, as well as new house building. It is therefore an ideal recovery stock as mortgage interest rates come down and confidence in the housing sector starts to pick up. The company has no debt and is well managed - gross margins actually improved slightly last year in one of the most difficult periods for construction sales. The problem is in gauging the timing and likely extent of the recovery. Housebuilders have reported a rise in sales since interest rates began to fall in February. Much of this, however, will be stock and it will take time for a recovery to work through to building material sales. The company is right to be cautious. Profits this year could slip further to about Pounds 18m. This would put the group on a prospective p/e of 19 which looks expensive. Hold for the long term and buy on weakness.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Letter: Wider case for industry Sir, It is encouraging that Mr Jackson's article ('The incredible shrinking industrial base', November 16) reaches the conclusion, albeit reluctantly, that we have to reverse the decline in UK manufacturing. However, I would like to push the case harder and remove his depression and reluctance. If General Motors doesn't sell cars and consumers don't buy imports from Asia/Pacific manufacturers, Blue Cross-Blue Shield as health insurers will end up without the business and the jobs. Furthermore, we believe that up to about one-third of the jobs lost in UK manufacturing over the past decade represent sub-contracting of specialist services to specialist firms in everything from security to catering, and that for every job in manufacturing there is one in the service industries. This is why we believe the CBI National Manufacturing Council initiative is vital to the whole of the UK and why manufacturing must win a larger share of today's highly competitive international markets. Mark Radcliffe, deputy director-general, CBI, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU</p>

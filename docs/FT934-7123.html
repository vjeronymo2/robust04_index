			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / The English sense of foul play: While his countrymen mourn, Dominic Lawson views this week's World Cup results with relief FINALLY, we have been put out of our misery. England are out of the World Cup or, as the sports writers insist on calling it, 'the greatest footballing show on earth.' The misery in question, however, is not chiefly that of the England soccer team but of the millions of us who find the national game ugly and pointless. We dreaded the thought of the saturation coverage which would ensue if the England team qualified for the finals. We remembered how, during the last World Cup, it was impossible to arrange a dinner party in case it clashed with yet another game in England's unlikely advance to the semi-finals. Or one did go ahead only to find guests rushing from the table asking if there was a television in the house. But, as I say, we are out of our misery. The summer will be filled instead with the proper and civilised sound of leather on willow rather than leather on head or boot, or whatever other parts of the anatomy footballers use to play their random, undisciplined and rowdy game. There was a danger that one or other of the home nations would qualify for 'the greatest footballing show on earth.' Had Wales qualified then it would immediately have been adopted, even by people who normally regard the celtic fringes as fit subjects only for after-dinner jokes. Fortunately, however, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all managed to emulate England's non-achievement. The Republic of Ireland did qualify and the inevitable happened: the English press began to describe that nation as part of 'the British Isles.' True enough, but it was the first time I had heard this expression outside of a geography text book. The point, of course, was to persuade us that we are in some way still connected with, and intimately involved in, 'The greatest footballing show on earth.' Had Ireland not qualified all would not have been lost. Eventually, the list of referees chosen to arbitrate in the World Cup finals would have been published and there might well have been an Englishman on it. There would have ensued innumerable newspaper articles about 'England's man at the greatest footballing show on earth.' I wrote last week that I had been so buried in writing a book that no items of news penetrated my consciousness. This was not quite the case. The one event of global importance which was so insistently reported that even I knew, was the England soccer team's loss to the Netherlands. In particular, I gleaned the impression that it was unfair. It was all the fault of a German referee. This, it seemed to me at the time, was the worst thing about the media's obsession with the travails of the England team: we were always unlucky. If it was not a conveniently German referee, then it was an injury to England's best player, or the run of the ball which was 'cruel', or our manager's inexplicable failure to select our best side, or one of their players should have been sent off. No one ever seemed prepared to admit that other nations had, perhaps, produced more talented players and that is why they won and we lost. Somehow the idea persists that we ought always to win, and that if we do not, we are the victims of malicious fortune, or bad management. To a small extent this national disease of making excuses has spread into the nobler game of cricket. I would be rash to comment on the last week's High Court libel action over the matter of alleged Pakistani ball - tampering in Test matches against England. But it is hard to avoid the impression that the main stimulus to the press's charges was the desire to find a reason for the England team's defeat which did not include the fact that the Pakistani team were simply much better players. This whingeing would be more tolerable if, when England win, we were able to do so without any gloating. It is hard to remember when an England victory was not so greeted by the home press. Doubtless other nations are as bad. Some might be worse. But I am delighted that they will be the ones to endure more months of hyperbole and hackery, while we in England can open a newspaper or watch television without being forced to take part in 'The greatest footballing show on earth.'

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / EC tries to keep war out of Bosnia THE European Community will today hold talks in Lisbon with representatives from Bosnia-Hercegovina's three ethnic communities to try to prevent the Yugoslav republic sliding into civil war. The meeting, occasioned by sharp differences between Serbs, Croats, and Moslems over holding a referendum next week on independence, coincides with fresh attempts by Croatia and Serbia to split the republic between them. According to government officials in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia which will act as the United Nations headquarters when peacekeeping forces arrive, there is every likelihood that the Moslem community will be left without any republic if the plan by Croatia and Serbia goes ahead. 'This could lead to the emergence of radical forces among the Moslem community. They could become powerful. This would undermine our tolerant tradition,' said Mr Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, deputy premier. Bosnia's Moslems, who are Sunni, make up 42 per cent of the 4.3m population, followed by Serbs (33 per cent) and Croats (17 per cent). The EC called for this referendum last month as a precondition for recognising Bosnia. But while Serb leaders have urged a boycott, Moslems support the vote as a means of having an independent Bosnia internationally recognised, and Croats remain ambivalent. The Serb-dominated rump presidency wants Bosnia to remain part of a smaller Yugoslav federation, mainly because 70 per cent of the military industrial base is there. The plan to divide Bosnia was mooted during secret talks a year ago between Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman and Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic. It was shelved when the federal army intervened in Slovenia and Croatia on June 25, but has since been revived, under a different guise. Because the United Nations, and the EC, have insisted that 'the internal boundaries of Yugoslavia cannot be changed by force, or without the consent of the parties concerned,' Zagreb and Belgrade have adopted new tactics. They have encouraged their respective sister parties in Bosnia to agree peacefully to divide the republic from within. Moderates among Serbs and Croats have been marginalised. The rise of the Zagreb-backed Croat nationalists in Bosnia has isolated the Moslems. Previously, Bosnia's Croats and Moslems together opposed attempts to split the republic. Now Mr Marte Boban, new head of the Croatian Democratic Union, is negotiating a carve-up with the Bosnian Serbian Democratic party, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, a close ally of Mr Milosevic. Few government officials in Bosnia doubt the inherent dangers in this, even if Bosnia's Croats and Serbs agree to it. 'What would happen to the Moslems?' asks Mr Haric Silajcic, Bosnia's foreign minister. 'Should the EC accept a peaceful break up of the republic carried out without the consent of the Moslems?'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 35 (525)] </F>   [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin called his U.S.  counterpart Bill Clinton on the telephone to discuss the  situation in former Yugoslavia. Yeltsin's press secretary  Vyacheslav Kostikov told Interfax that the two men had "agreed  on holding off air strikes in light of the diplomatic efforts  being made by the Russian side in recent days."    According to Kostikov, the U.S. President "highly  appreciated  President Yeltsin's diplomatic initiative which resulted in  defusing the crisis around Sarajevo."    "It was confirmed that decisions on the situation around  Sarajevo will be made only in the framework of the UN," Kostikov  told Interfax, and affirmed that over the short term  consultations in search of a settlement to the Bosnian conflict  will continue .    He maintained that Boris Yeltsin's Sarajevo initiative  reduced the dangers of a crisis which threatened to engulf the  entire world and made a peaceful resolution of the conflict a  realistic probability.    This initiative, he told Interfax, scored a large diplomatic  victory for Russia on the European and world arena.    "Without firing a shot or threatening anybody, or  jeopardizing the lives of its soldiers or spending a ruble  Russia won a major battle for its international status,"  Kostikov said.    "Not only did it return to the sources of its historic  policy  and role in the Balkans and protect Serbs, who are our kin in  religion, culture and national spirit, Russia also showed the  scale of its influence in Europe and the world," the press  secretary said.    He said that UN and NATO diplomacy "nearly brought the world  to the brink of a world crisis which could have developed into a  war in which large countries would be involved."    Kostikov said that, unlike his opponents, Yeltsin did not  make much noise, but showed who is the undisputed leader in  Russia.</p>

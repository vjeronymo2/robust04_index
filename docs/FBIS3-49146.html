In an interview for the third programme of Polish Radio,  Drzycimski noted that the former communist bloc was the main  region where conflicts and wars are emerging.    Drzycimski also welcomed the statement on Monday from  General  John Shalikashvili, chief of the United States General Staff,  that Russia will not be granted the right of veto over the  eventual entry of central European states into the Atlantic  alliance. Until now, it had seemed as though it was not NATO  that would decide on accepting or rejecting new members, but  Russia, Drzycimski said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Hydraulics Projects in Tissemsilt"] </F>   [Text] Water, that rare commodity, gets a lot of attention.  Its rational management requires investments...    In that context, and for the year under way, the Hydraulics  Directorate has decided on an action plan that includes  strengthening the potable water system (AEP) and capturing and  mobilizing more water resources. Specifically, the plan involves  19 projects either already launched or soon to be started, which  among other things will increase water resource mobilization  capacity in the locality of Ammari and bring potable water from  the Theniet El-Had AEP to the communes of Guisba, Laayoun,  Ferradj, and Khemisti. The latter project, which has been  entrusted to the Hydro-Projet company, is already under way.    Another project in this sector involves bringing potable  water for the locality of Lardjem from wells in Rechaiga (Tiaret  wilaya) via Tissemsilt. This operation has finally put an end to  the problem of potable water supply for the daira's chief town,  which is situated about 40 km from Tissemsilt.    Previously, potable water was brought to the town in tank  trucks. The system is operated by by the Tissemsilt Water  Production and Management Enterprise.    However, while this project has finally brought relief to  Lardjem, inhabitants of the daira of Bordj Bou-Naama and its 12  attached localities must be patient, since it will be awhile  before they enjoy a regular and adequate supply of the precious  liquid. Water resources being sparse in this part of the wilaya,  water use in the daira is strictly controlled under a potable  water distribution program.    According to the director of hydraulics, a definitive  solution of the problem will require building a dam with a  storage capacity of 80 million cubic meters [m[.sup]3[/]], at  the site known as Koudiat-Frarsfa. Studies for this water  project have been designed and carried out.    Under the heading of AEPs, it may be opportune to note also  that work has begun, in the chief town of the wilaya, on a water  tower with a storage capacity of 1,000 m[.sup]3[/]. This  water project will increase potable water storage and  distribution capacities in the town, which is experiencing rapid  growth, especially on the northern outskirts.    On the drainage front, three large AEP projects have been  approved, one of them adding 14 km of pipe in seven zones in the  chief town of the wilaya. The other two projects involve  building a 2-km concrete conduit for transporting waste water.    Realization of these two projects has been entrusted to  Hydro-Technique, an Algiers-based company that specializes in  the field and has a contract to build a small dam with a storage  capacity of 4 million m[.sup]3[/].    That's in addition to another project, the dam at Bougara,  which has a storage capacity of 14 million m[.sup]3[/].    The dam has not been exploited since going into service in  1991. A study of irrigation possibilities has just been  completed. Water from the Bougara dam will be devoted  exclusively to irrigation of an agricultural perimeter,  according to the hydraulics directorate.</p>

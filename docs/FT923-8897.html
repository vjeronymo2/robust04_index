			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / International Company News: Den Danske Bank moves to stabilise confidence DEN DANSKE Bank has brought forward publication of its half-year interim report in the hope that this step would stabilise international confidence in the Danish banking system. This follows Thursday's announcement of a DKr1.5bn (Dollars 897m) first-half loss by Unibank, the country's second largest bank, and the resignation of the bank's chief executive. Danske reported a pre-tax profit of DKr6m, down from DKr1.5bn in the first half of last year, but Mr Sorensen described the result as 'satisfactory in the circumstances'. The result was drawn down by a loss on the value of securities of DKr335m. Last year, this item lifted profits by showing an increase of DKr1.29bn. Mr Knud Sorensen, Danske's chief executive, as well as the chairman of the Danish Bankers' Association, yesterday dismissed suggestions that the situation in Danish banking is comparable with Norway and Sweden. 'Of course, there is not a Swedish-Norwegian situation in Denmark. The Danish banks are much better capitalised,' he said. Danske's capital adequacy ratio is 11 per cent and Unibank's is 10.6 per cent. The result this year included the encouraging news that loss provisions have fallen to DKr1.04bn from DKr1.34bn last year. Provisions this year are equal to 0.56 per cent of outstanding loans and guarantees. This year's report includes an extraordinary costs item of DKr228m, which covers redundancy payments. Staffing at the bank will fall by 10 per cent this year. The staff cuts contributed to a fall in the bank's operating costs of DKr100m to DKr3.29bn. Mr Sorensen declined to make a forecast for the rest of the year but he noted that loss provisions were likely to remain high. The group's balance sheet total was reduced by DKr20bn to DKr357bn, mainly by bringing down engagements with foreign banks. Deposits increased by DKr6bn to DKr152.9bn, while advances fell by DKr15bn to DKr168.5bn, reflecting a cautious lending policy, said the bank. Hafnia, Denmark's troubled insurance group, announced that staffing in its Danish companies would be reduced from 2,500 people to 2,000 this autumn.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / 'If we have to suffer, it is preferable to being ruled by the hypocritical British' THE anxiety on Hong Kong's streets yesterday was visible. Shaking heads in disbelief, people lingered by bank screens watching the falling stock market. The market may have seen the biggest one-day fall since the June 1989 Tiananmen killings, but the talk of the town was of politics, perfidious Albion and the strange ways of China. Hong Kong may be a British colony but it is emphatically a Chinese city. The result of Governor Chris Patten's proposals has been to divide Hong Kong society. That division has produced strong reactions among a people adverse to venting their anger, especially in public. At what would normally have been a sedate business lunch yesterday, one senior Chinese executive of a large Hong Kong property company lost control, to general astonishment. He said the people of Hong Kong had taken so much flak from Britain and China over the past 14 years. 'What does he think he is doing now with so little time to go? China is changing; it has embraced the market economy; it wants its people to get rich; Hong Kong can play a key role in that. All we want is a quiet life.' On the streets of Central, the main business, retail and tourist district on Hong Kong island, Hong Kong Chinese vented their dismay and anger, but not all oppose the governor's stand. An assistant hotel manager declared himself for Mr Patten. 'I support Patten's proposals because I think Hong Kong people should have the freedom to decide what they want. That there are more protests now shows people are beginning to know better what sort of society Hong Kong is and recognise what their needs are. 'I think business people might not want changes because they do not want what they are enjoying to be taken away. They are considering their own interests.' Ms Ella Kwok, a nurse, is also a strong supporter of the governor. An investor in the stock market, who has seen more than a fifth of the value of her shares wiped out in three weeks, she believes China is to blame. 'They should not say things like the statements made concerning the container terminal and the airport contract. I think the governor is doing everything for Hong Kong people's long-term interests. 'If one side has to back down, I hope it is not the governor. 'He has more guts than the other governors before him. I hope he can stand firm.' The worsening relations between Britain and China has stirred anti-British sentiment within Hong Kong - something never far from the surface. Among some people, China's staunch opposition to the governor is seen as repaying the indignity of colonialism. 'I think China is right,' said one secretary. 'The British have lived well in Hong Kong for a long time and they need to be put in their place.' One hears echoes of these sentiments on the streets. Ms Chow, an office administrator, is in no doubt about Mr Patten. 'I do not like Patten or what he is doing. I think he is making Hong Kong a mess,' she said. 'He is doing everything for himself. It is naive to believe that Britain has Hong Kong people's interest at heart; they enjoy the notion of doling out democracy. If we have to suffer, it is preferable to being ruled by the hypocritical British.' A civil servant who gave his name as Mr Ho said the governor had gone too far and should back down. 'When he deals with China, he should go one step at a time,' he said. 'Hong Kong is still not used to his way of doing things. I do not think China wants to do this but is forced to.' Throughout the day, however, the overwhelming call was for Britain and China to sit down and talk. This view was given expression by a housewife who said: 'The two sides should sit down calmly and talk about what is good for Hong Kong, what is good for its economy. They should look at the agreements again or find a middle way to solve the problem.' She also made the saddest observation on the fall-out from the controversy. 'I have lost confidence that Hong Kong will change for the better.' Additional reporting by Karen Tang.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Paris, June 23 (AFP) -- Israeli Deputy Foreign  Minister Yossi Beilin on Thursday [23 June] commended France for  what he called its "courageous" decision to launch a  humanitarian military intervention in Rwanda.    After a meeting here with French Minister Delegate for  European Affairs Alain Lamassoure, Beilin added that he hoped  that once Israel had sorted out its own regional problems, it  could help other countries to deal with theirs. [passage omitted]    Beilin, on a working visit to Paris, also discussed with  Lamassoure the renegotiation of a trade agreement between Israel  and the European Union, which was first signed in 1975 and  reviewed in the early 1980s, he said. They also talked about  cooperation in scientific research.    Beilin was later due to meet Foreign Minister Alain Juppe  and  President Francois Mitterrand's chief of presidential staff,  Hubert Vedrine.</p>

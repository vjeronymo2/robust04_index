			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Abbey Yesterday's full-year results will do little to encourage Lloyds Abbey Life's biggest shareholder to increase its stake. Selling life assurance products to Lloyds Bank customers has proved far from recession-proof. New business figures are generally better than achieved by competitors without the benefit of a captive audience. The long-term argument in favour of bankassurance remains intact. But the slower rate of growth suggests bank customers are not all lining up to buy insurance. Lloyds Abbey faces a hard slog reaching customers in the numbers talked about when the alliance was first hatched. With its exposure to estate agencies and mortgage lending, Lloyds Abbey's earnings might be expected to recover smartly once the housing market turns. Economic revival will equally help sales of profitable regular premium life products. But that may not mean sharply higher dividends. This year's unchanged pay-out is only just covered by distributable profit. Higher sales of life assurance will have to be backed by additional capital. Some will have to come from retained earnings. While interest rates are low, a 5.2 per cent yield will doubtless provide some support for the shares. But the market is likely to remain sceptical until the growth prospects are clear.</p>

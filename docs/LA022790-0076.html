			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROKERS AND HOUSEWIVES: TOKYO SKID SPARES NONE  </P> <P> A wide variety of Japanese companies could be hurt by the recent plunge in  stock prices on the Tokyo exchange, financial experts said Monday.  </P> <P> Banks, insurance companies and securities firms, which all hold massive stock  portfolios, may have to take losses on their investments when they close their  books March 31, the end of the Japanese fiscal year. And these short-term hits  could be the mildest effect of the past week's 11% drop in the Nikkei index of  225 stocks.  </P> <P> Economists and brokerage experts are more concerned that Japanese housewives,  who have provided a steady base for the market's remarkable performance over  the past several years, could become disillusioned and abandon stocks, much as  individual American investors fled the market after the October, 1987, crash.  </P> <P> Worse still, economists believe that the recent volatility in Tokyo is more a  symptom than a disease. And the disease -- which is both economic and political  -- is serious.  </P> <P> "There are economic, political and bureaucratic reasons for the market falling  on hard times," said Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities  International in New York.  </P> <P> The Japanese are widely disillusioned with their political system, which has  been battered by corruption and bribery. And although the country's recent  elections were expected to quell some of these concerns, some new appointees  have been tainted, Brusca said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the two bureaucracies that previously worked in concert to boost the  stock market and the economy now seem to be at odds. The Bank of Japan wants to  raise interest rates to quiet inflation, but the Ministry of Finance believes  that interest rate hikes would further damage the stock market.  </P> <P> But the most serious concerns are economic. In previous years, Japan benefited  from what was termed the "triple merits" -- low interest rates, a strong yen  and low oil and commodity prices.  </P> <P> "Right now, that process is working in reverse -- triple demerits, so to  speak," said John Hickling, portfolio manager of Fidelity International Growth  and Income Fund. "Interest rates and oil prices have gone up a lot, and the yen  has been very weak against the dollar."  </P> <P> High interest rates tend to depress corporate earnings, which in turn depress  stock prices. And increasing oil and commodity prices could boost inflation.  The strong yen, meanwhile, has given the Japanese stunning purchasing power,  which is bound to wane along with the currency.  </P> <P> Those factors will make it difficult for the Japanese stock market to quickly  recover from its recent losses, market experts said. The Nikkei average, a  primary indicator of overall stock prices, has fallen 14.4% from its December  highs and dropped nearly 11% in just the past week.  </P> <P> The impact of such a decline could be substantial on a wide variety of  companies that hold and trade securities.  </P> <P> Brokerage houses, which generate well over 50% of their revenues through retail  trading, could be hurt the most, particularly if small investors are scared  away. These investors are the bread and butter of the Big Four investment  houses, despite the fact that big institutions such as banks, insurance  companies and manufacturing concerns control about 60% of the shares listed on  the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Moreover, a souring market makes it difficult to bring companies public,  another major source of revenue for the securities firms.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a diverse group of manufacturers have used a system called zaitech,  in which they will actively buy and sell securities to boost corporate profits  with capital gains. These companies could also get pinched by the drop in stock  prices.  </P> <P> Then too big financial institutions have substantial securities holdings that  could be hurt by the drop in the Nikkei average. But these declines are not  expected to result in losses on the banks' earnings statements.  </P> <P> Japanese banks, for example, often hold large stakes in companies that do  business with them. In most cases, the banks account for these holdings at  their purchase prices, leaving them with huge unrealized profits.  </P> <P> However, some banks have recently attempted to offset losses on problem foreign  loans. Consequently, they've sold these undervalued holdings, recorded the  gains on their books and repurchased the stock.  </P> <P> Those moves could prove costly if the stock market continues to decline and the  banks find themselves forced to recognize the declining value of the stocks on  their balance sheets.  </P> <P> But since most Japanese banks have pursued this strategy with only a small  portion of their stock portfolios, the market decline is not expected to cause  immediate losses.  </P> <P> Indeed, experts compared the effect of the overall market drop to the impact of  a one-year drop in Southern California real estate prices on the net worth of a  person who bought a home 30 years ago.  </P> <P> "These are securities they have owned for years and years. They have huge,  hidden reserves," said Gregory A. Root, president of Thomson BankWatch, a  widely followed bank rating agency in New York.  </P> <P> Last December, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, or Japan Economic Journal, published  figures that show major Japanese banks have about $300 billion in unrealized  stock profits. For most Japanese banks, those unrealized gains alone far exceed  the net worth of the largest U.S. banks. And that doesn't include billions more  in unrealized gains in real estate that those banks own.  </P> <P> At the time, Dai-Ichi Kangyo, the world's largest bank, had the equivalent of  $35 billion in unrealized stock gains. Sumitomo Bank had the equivalent of  about $28 billion in unrealized gains.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SPILLED LOAD OF SULFUR CLOSES I-5 NEAR NORTH L.A. COUNTY LINE  </P> <P> A load of dry sulfur spilled and caught fire on the Interstate 5 this morning,  forcing the closure of all lanes of the Golden State Freeway near the northern  Los Angeles County line, the California Highway Patrol reported.  </P> <P> All northbound lanes were closed at 9:30 a.m. when a tractor-trailer pulling  two flatbed trailers skidded during a light rain and dozens of 50-pound bags of  sulfur spilled across four lanes of the highway at Lebec, Officer Jim Biehl  said.  </P> <P> The truck did not turn over and the driver, Mohammad Khan, 24, of Ridge Grove,  was not injured. Biehl said at least 20 of the bags of sulfur began to burn or  smolder, sending a white cloud about 200 feet into the air.  </P> <P> As the sulfur cloud continued to grow, the CHP closed the southbound lanes of  the freeway at 11:15 a.m.  </P> <P> By noon, the CHP could not say when the freeway would be opened.  </P></p>

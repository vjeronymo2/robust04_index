			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEHIND THE WHEEL / FERRARI 348TS: PERFORMANCE ART  </P> <P> Ferrari builds motor cars in much the same way Claude Monet painted landscapes  -- not to please the populace, but more to satisfy self, a technique and a  coterie.  </P> <P> Mellowed by mystique and myth, living very high off racing legends, its  reputation secured by a product-appreciation rate indeed close to that of  Impressionist art, Ferrari sees no need to advertise its cars.  </P> <P> Nor does this Italian company have a public relations representative in the  United States.  </P> <P> The year 1990 is halfway into history. Yet Ferrari is just now getting around  to introducing its 348 series sports car that actually was built last year but  will still cost $103,400. Without a radio. Without a spare.  </P> <P> All of which supports a sales-and-marketing rationale which seems to be this:  Simply getting a Ferrari is the best deal a buyer can make.  </P> <P> Despite such indifference, Ferrari sells everything it makes and may very well  have been back-ordered since 1949.  </P> <P> * A barely used Ferrari Testarossa currently costs $100,000 more than a new  Testarossa. Because all new Testarossas have been sold out for the next few  years.  </P> <P> * A really used Ferrari -- a 250 GTO race car built in 1962 -- recently was  bought by a Japanese collector for $14.6 million. GM should find such profit in  selling 28-year-old cars.  </P> <P> * Now the 1989-cum-1990 Ferrari 348ts is dribbling into Southern California  showrooms. If you want one from Hollywood Sport Cars, don't expect to be  impressing tourists on Melrose any time soon. "We got a couple of (deliveries)  for June, but we don't know about July yet, and August is a long way off," said  general manager Cris Vandagriff. "We're sold out three years in advance."  </P> <P> Said a sales representative for Newport Imports of Newport Beach: Order your  Ferrari 348 now. Pick it up some time after Memorial Day. That's Memorial Day  1996.  </P> <P> An obvious question: Is there anything in this world worth a six-year wait?  </P> <P> The definite answers: Mr. or Ms. Right. Blue-eyed twins. Peace in Northern  Ireland. A quit-claim deed to Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Also a Ferrari 348ts.  </P> <P> And not because it is an outrageously expensive car, a known quickener of  pulses and envy. Nor because Magnum PI made it a virility heightener. But  simply because a Ferrari is the best at what it was designed to do.  </P> <P> Forget cost and image. Consider only purpose, craftsmanship and inexorable  evolution.  </P> <P> By such measurement, the Rolls-Royce is the superlative of rich, regal  transportation. At the other end of that scale, the humble, snuffling,  pirouetting Hyster forklift becomes the ultimate example of vehicular utility.  </P> <P> Ferrari, like no other motor car, assumes its place among the pure by being  constructed around the lusty essence of a thinly disguised sports-racing car.  </P> <P> Or as Enzo Ferrari explained before his death in 1988: "La Ferrari was born  with racing and with racing it progressed and developed. Can the automobile  deny its origins? I don't think so."  </P> <P> And the urgent pedigree of the new 348 -- from the first ripping snort of its  290-horsepower engine to the initial tug of broad tires biting like pit bulls  -- remains an instantaneous suggestion to motor somewhere in a secure but  horrendous hurry. Preferably beneath a helmet.  </P> <P> Ferrari's 348ts and 348tb (for transversale spyder, or targa, and transversale  berlinetta, or coupe) replace the enormously successful 308/328 series.  </P> <P> They were handsome, powerful, fast and desirable. Yet not an impossible act to  follow. Ferrari simply has crafted a successor that is better looking,  stronger, faster and thoroughly irresistible.  </P> <P> Styling, naturally, is by Pininfarina and sculptured heavily from aluminum and  composites. It is a grand softening of the 308/328's swoopier lines and sharper  edges, retaining enough of the old to satisfy those thinking of moving up, but  adding touches of today for anyone intent on purchasing a milestone of the  '90s.  </P> <P> The Testarossa's air intakes that feed left- and right-side radiators have been  transferred to the 348. But they are smaller, aren't so obtrusive and are much  less suggestive of cheese graters.  </P> <P> Like the ears and orthodontics of Britain's royal family, the sloped nose, chin  dam and hunkered-down derivatives of all modern Ferraris are with the 348.  </P> <P> Yet there are distinctions. The 348 runs on 17-inch wheels (compared to  16-inchers on the 328) that fill the wells better than Schwarzenegger fills a  work shirt.  </P> <P> The car is taller, wider and with a longer wheelbase than the 328. Overhangs  are shorter, which further increases that crouch with the whole appearing  blunter, more purposeful.  </P> <P> Incredibly, amid all these aesthetics, there are uglies.  </P> <P> The side air scoops are formed from composite panels screwed into the doors.  The screw heads are Phillips, black, quite exposed and stick out like four zits  on a bare shoulder.  </P> <P> The grille is also a yawning illusion, a dummy. It catches nothing but bugs and  slow sparrows because the car's radiators are in its flanks where they breathe  through the door intakes.  </P> <P> But that's the classical look. Tradition dies kicking and struggling. Until the  world gives up starched underwear and buttonholes in lapels, Ferrari likely  won't give up grilles that go nowhere.  </P> <P> Looks, however, are the least of the 348.  </P> <P> Bore and stroke of Ferrari's 32-valve, V-8 engine have been increased with  displacement improving from 3.1 to 3.4 liters. Changes in lubrication,  electronic engine management and the design and layout of intake manifolds  combine to increase power from 260 horsepower to 290.  </P> <P> The 348 remains a mid-engined car. But the engine is now set north to south and  longitudinally, instead of east to west and transversely, and that allows more  room for improved things.  </P> <P> A new gearbox and transmission (actually a carry-over from a Ferrari Formula 1  racing car) is now mounted behind the engine instead of beneath it. So the  entire power and timpani section has been lowered to reduce the car's center of  gravity by about 2 inches. Ergo, flatter handling and better steering response.  </P> <P> Race cars do not come with cruise control, automatic transmission and power  steering. These are conveniences for car travel shared with sightseeing and  chatty relatives -- but outright impediments to any bonding of man, machine,  speed and road.  </P> <P> So the 348's fixings and interior are quintessential Ferrari; unfrilled, all  purpose, and with basic geometry everywhere. Hence, a plain, rectangular hood  for instruments made stark by florescent orange numbers and needles on black  dials. Also no radio. But the car is wired for one, should you ever prefer  Ottmar Liebert's nouveau flamenco over the burbling snarl of Ferrari's four  tailpipes.  </P> <P> The gear lever is a tall, chromed stick with a bar billiards ball on top. It  sprouts from a stainless steel gate that's a cattle guard masquerading as a  shifting template.  </P> <P> The horn. On a stalk? Hidden beneath a cornet symbol on the spokes? Nah. It's  that old-fashioned button stuck right in the middle of a medieval Momo steering  wheel.  </P> <P> Punch the brake and the accelerator is right there where it has been since the  dawn of crash gear boxes -- flush and only an inch to one side of the brake  pedal. Perfect for rolling the foot and sweet heel-and-toe shifting for moments  when the road is empty, the corner is a clean sweep and the ghost of driving  legend Alberto Ascari whispers to some of us.  </P> <P> A Ferrari makes demands. It can even be an intimidating drive. The brakes are  firm and not for the feather footed or high of heel. Gears are given up  smoothly only when the moment, the engine, the clutch and shift are in concert.  </P> <P> But finding that moment, being the conductor of a coordinated downshift,  earning some respect from a benchmark machine that rises above the best of our  abilities . . . ah, there's the defiance but also the satisfaction of Ferrari.  </P> <P> So we took the 348ts to Angeles Crest where even doing things legally and easy  in a standard sedan means a succession of body rolls and agonizing shrieks from  tires trying to swallow their rims.  </P> <P> The Ferrari found this mountain road its primer. Whatever the suggested speed  at any corner, the 348 could triple it and remain flat. We crowded no vehicle  to the crest. But they moved aside and waved us through anyway -- full hand  waves, we might add.  </P> <P> The 348's brakes do not snag fiercely, like anchors, and power doesn't kick in  like an afterburner. So whenever misjudgment lightens one end or corner of the  car, gentle brushing of brakes or throttle downloads the Ferrari until it  squats deep on all fours.  </P> <P> The car is loyal, predictable, balanced and an absolute rocket on Velcro. Yet  it can also be driven slowly and daily. It will not lug at low speeds in high  gear or chug in freeway crawls. And the suspension will jiggle no love handles.  </P> <P> Still, the 348 much prefers to play hard, to be wound up tight through the  gears to where it sings alto and looks around for some Mercedes or 300ZX to  entice. Or to slide alongside a young gentleman on a yellow-and-chrome  Harley-Davidson who grins because he also knows the marrow of things  mechanical.  </P> <P> But enough of such rhapsodizing.  </P> <P> The Ferrari 348 has trunk space so minimal, so misshapen it can only be used  fully by factory-supplied fitted luggage. Minor repair bills are usually  four-figure affairs. Antilock brakes are standard but an air bag isn't even an  option. The Ferrari's Roman nose is about 5 inches off the ground, so even  gentle driveways create much grazing of the car's chin and greater gritting of  the owner's teeth.  </P> <P> It is expensive, impractical as a commuter car, arrogant down to its $1,300  gas-guzzler tax and most certainly is a 170-m.p.h. anachronism in a 65-m.p.h.  society. So arrogant, in fact, the company is delivering new 348s with 1989  construction dates to avoid compliance with U.S. passive restraint requirements  for 1990 models.  </P> <P> But Ferrari will make 4,000 cars this year and has presold each one. The 4,500  Ferraris that will be built next year already have customers. Vandagriff says  even he really doesn't fully understand the addiction. But he has seen the  worst of the lust at work.  </P> <P> He remembers a Northern California customer, a woman, who in the '50s ordered a  Ferrari 375 Mille Miglia. She wanted a scarlet Ferrari with cappuccino-tan  interior and, obviously, left-hand drive.  </P> <P> Enzo Ferrari -- a born chauvinist who believed a woman's place was making pasta  and driving Fiats but never a Ferrari -- handled the order personally. He  shipped the woman a right-hand-drive car. It was yellow with green seats and  brown carpets.  </P> <P> Remembers Vandagriff: "The car arrived, the woman took one look at it, said,  'Thank you very much,' and accepted it on the spot."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1989 FERRARI 348ts  </P> <P> COST:  </P> <P> Base: $102,350  </P> <P> As tested $103,400 (includes leather interior, automatic climate control,  anti-lock brakes, electric windows, mirrors and door locks.)  </P> <P> ENGINE:  </P> <P> V-8, 32 valves, 3.4 liters developing 290 horsepower.  </P> <P> TYPE:  </P> <P> Two-seat, mid-engined, high-performance sports car with targa body.  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE:  </P> <P> 0-60 (as tested) 5.5 seconds.  </P> <P> Top speed (manufacturer's estimate) 171 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Fuel economy, EPA city-highway, 13-19 m.p.g. ($1,300 gas guzzler tax applies.)  </P> <P> CURB WEIGHT:  </P> <P> 3,240 pounds.  </P> <P> THE GOOD:  </P> <P> Pure performance, benchmark handling, purposeful comfort.  </P> <P> Long on performance design, short on convenience frills.  </P> <P> Safer investment than an Orange County condo.  </P> <P> Penultimate, classic sports car -- with Ferrari Testarossa the classy ultimate.  </P> <P> THE BAD:  </P> <P> A radio would be nice.  </P> <P> Air bags would be better.  </P> <P> THE UGLY:  </P> <P> Exposed screw heads on air intakes.  </P></p>

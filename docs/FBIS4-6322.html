			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["YONHAP from Beijing"] </F>   [Text] William Taylor, deputy chief of the U.S. Institute  for Strategy and International Affairs, said on 19 April that  "North Korea would likely accept additional nuclear inspections  by the International Atomic Energy Agency as soon as possible."  He also said that "countries concerned should first take steps  to provide economic support to North Korea, to recognize it as  state, and to normalize relations with it."    Deputy Chief Taylor arrived in Beijing on 19 April after  visiting North Korea on 12 April at the invitation of the North  Korean authorities for the participation in President Kim  Il-song's 82d birthday festival. In an interview with YONHAP  News Agency, he said that "although he is carrying a letter  signed by Kim Yong-sun, chairman of the Reunification and Policy  Committee of the North Korean Supreme People's Assembly to a  South Korean high-level authority, he cannot disclose its  contents right now." He has strongly expressed the intention to  convey North Korea's formal position to the South Korean  Government regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, North-South  summit talks, and the resumption of North-South dialogue.</p>

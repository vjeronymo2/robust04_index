			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Algerian PM turns to technocrats MR Belaid Abdessalam, the new Algerian prime minister, has appointed a small team of technocrats to help him restore the authority of the state, after nearly four years of political and economic turmoil. He has filled two of the most sensitive portfolios - justice and education - with men the late President Mohamed Boudiaf, assassinated three weeks ago, would have wished to see at the posts. Professor Ahmed Djebbar, the new minister of education, returned to Algeria six months ago with the former president after several years of exile in France. Mr Abdelhamid Mahi-Bahi, the justice minister, was state prosecutor in the western town of Oran. Mr Abdessalam retained seven ministers from the outgoing government. They include Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the respected foreign minister, who two years ago brokered a measure of peace in Lebanon; Mr Abdenour Keramane, the minister for industry; Mr Farouk Tebbal, minister of housing; and General Khaled Nezzar who, as minister of defence and member of the five-man collegiate presidency, appears to be a key player in Algeria. Mr Hacen Mefti, a senior manager of the state oil and gas monopoly Sonatrach, replaces Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine as minister of energy. The latter piloted a more liberal oil and gas exploration bill through a hostile national assembly last December and recently presided over the signing of exploration agreements with Atlantic Richfield, Mobil Oil, Phillips Petroleum and British Petroleum. Mr Laoussine had asked to step down. Mr Mohamed Hardi, a civilian, takes over the Interior Ministry where he will be seconded by Colonel Mohamed Tolba. This marks the exit, from the government at least, of General Laarbi Belkheir, a close associate of former President Chadli Bendjedid. Mr Hardi has worked closely with Mr Reda Malek, who was co-opted into the collegiate presidency after the death of Mr Boudiaf and the appointment of Mr Ali Kafi as acting head of state. The five men have publicly ruled out running for the post of president in any future election. Mr Messaoud Ait-Chaalal, who becomes a special adviser to Mr Abdessalam, is a former Algerian ambassador.</p>

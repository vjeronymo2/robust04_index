			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Battery gets new charge It costs on average Pounds 1 an hour in batteries to play a game on a hand-held computer with a colour screen, as many parents know to their cost. When the batteries are dead they simply end up on the rubbish tip  - 12bn batteries are disposed of worldwide every year. A small UK mail order firm is now pitting its wits against the might of the big battery companies with a machine that, its developers say, can recharge general-purpose batteries and extend their life by up to 10 times. Rechargeable batteries made from nickel cadmium are already widely available, but in 1992 still only accounted for 2 per cent of consumer battery sales in volume terms. Their big drawback is that they cannot be used with the most power-hungry items such as games. The Battery Manager is designed to recharge most of the disposable consumer batteries on the market today - zinc chloride and alkaline. The recharger has been designed by the development arm of Kleeneze Holdings, which produces the Innovations catalogue found in many of the UK's Sunday newspapers. The technology used is not new but has previously been too expensive and not researched fully, says Andy White, who developed the product. The electro-plating process is similar to that for silver plating cutlery. In short, when a zinc-chloride battery is used the zinc from the electrode is dissolved in the electrolyte and dissipated. To recharge the battery the zinc particles are plated back on to the electrode. The big battery makers are dismissive about the potential success of the product. 'Someone invents a recharger that will recharge primary (alkaline or zinc) batteries every year. We never see anything come on to the market that makes any impact at all,' said a spokeswoman for Ever Ready. 'Apart from the fact that it may explode, you will get poor performance,' she added.</p>

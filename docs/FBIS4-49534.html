			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zhang Zhipeng (1728 1807 7720) and </F> XINHUA reporter Zheng Jian (6774 1017)]    [Text] Bucharest, 4 May (XINHUA) -- When Romanian Prime  Minister Vacaroiu met with General Zhang Wannian, member of the  Central Military Commission and chief of the People's Liberation  Army of China General Staff, and his party on the afternoon of 4  May, he said that the Romanian Government is sincerely pleased  with the tremendous achievements scored by China in economic and  social development and that it is determined to further develop  and expand its friendly cooperation with China.    Vacaroiu said: A traditional friendship exists between  Romania and China; they share identical or similar views on  major international issues, and their government departments  have been holding contacts with each other at regular intervals.  He expressed the hope that the meeting to be held by the mixed  committee of the two governments soon will further promote the  vigorous development of trade and economic relations between the  two countries.    During the meeting, Zhang Wannian stressed that China and  Romania are good and old friends. He focused his briefing on  China's political stability, economic development, national  unity, and social progress.    This morning, Lieutenant General (Chevlin), state secretary  of Romania's Ministry of National Defense and chief of the  Romanian armed forces joint staff, held formal talks with Zhang  Wannian. Both sides unanimously expressed their belief that  great changes have taken place in the two countries in recent  years but that these have not affected Sino-Romanian friendship.  The friendly relations between the two countries, between their  peoples, and between their armies have enjoyed further  development under the new historical condition. At the end of  their talks, Romanian Defense Minister Tinca met with Zhang  Wannian and his party.    Zhang Wannian and his party arrived here on the afternoon of  3 May for a four-day goodwill visit.</p>

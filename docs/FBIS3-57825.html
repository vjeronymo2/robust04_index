Claes pointed out that  the Belgian Government and the municipalities had no knowledge  of the developing incidents, adding that the PKK [Workers Party  of Kurdistan] supporters would be deported tonight.    The foreign ministers discussed ways to prevent such  regrettable incidents. Cetin pointed out that following the  German and French ban on the PKK, the terrorist organization  transferred its activities to Belgium. Cetin indicated that PKK  supporters congregate in areas heavily populated by Turkish  citizens as a method of provocation. He added that Turkey  expects the Belgian Government to show sensitivity on this  issue. Cetin pointed out that the press statement issued by  Louis Tobback, the Belgian interior and immigrant affairs  minister, was unfortunate. He warned Claes not to meet with the  supporters of the separatist terrorist organization.    Claes, in turn, stated that these kinds of incidents were  also not approved by the Belgian public. Pointing out that they  will not tolerate terrorism, Claes thanked Turkey's ambassador  to Belgium for his efforts in assuaging the situation.</p>

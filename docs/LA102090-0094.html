			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FIEN'S 3 TOUCHDOWN PASSES LEAD ROYAL TO 28-0 VICTORY  </P> <P> Ryan Fien hit Jeff Creed on scoring passes of 29 and four yards and Tony Liming  on a 11-yard touchdown throw to lead Royal High to a 28-0 victory over Agoura  in a Marmonte League game Friday night at Moorpark College.  </P> <P> The victory kept Royal (6-1, 3-1 in league play) within one game of Thousand  Oaks and Westlake in the league standings.  </P> <P> Agoura (5-2, 2-2) committed turnovers on four of its first six possessions. The  other two ended in punts. Altogether, the Chargers had five turnovers.  </P> <P> Royal, however, capitalized on only one of the first-half turnovers, suffering  an interception and a fumble inside the Agoura 10-yard line to erase scoring  opportunities.  </P> <P> The Highlanders' first touchdown came on a one-yard plunge by senior running  back Richard Naranjo late in the first quarter. The score was set up by a  36-yard run by tailback Robbie Smith, who rushed for 88 yards in 10 carries,  including 82 yards in six carries in the first half.  </P> <P> Fien proceeded to hit Creed with two touchdown passes in the second quarter and  connected with Liming in the third quarter. Liming also had two interceptions.  </P> <P> In the second half, Agoura was again unable to move the ball, facing a brisk  wind in the third quarter and a 28-0 deficit by the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Agoura's best scoring opportunity came in the third quarter when quarterback  Sean Fitzgerald faked an option pitch and sprinted 63 yards to the Royal 17.  However, the Chargers turned the ball over on downs.  </P> <P> Fien, a junior, finished with nine completions in 19 attempts for 164 yards.  His three touchdown passes give him 12 this season. Creed has six touchdown  receptions and Liming has five. GREG GUSS  </P></p>

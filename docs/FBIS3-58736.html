The latest figure, which Bundeswehr  leaders did not expect to be so high, was part of the savings  package the government and coalition want to use to bridge a  budget deficit of DM5 billion.    Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (CDU) and other ministers  affected by the cuts will meet Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on  17 January. The Bundestag group leadership is to hold  discussions on 18 January, and on 19 January the budget  committee is to discuss the necessary cuts, the paper adds.    The Defense Ministry leadership and defense experts in the  government coalition were planning to absorb most of the latest  cuts within the existing structures and with a planned  Bundeswehr size of 370,000 men. The Defense Ministry hoped that  these would be the last cuts and that the Bundeswehr would have  a budget of DM47.5 billion at its disposal from 1995, as agreed  between the chancellor and the finance and defense ministers.

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Arts: Up with sex, down with violence - Television Listen to the claims of those busybody organisations which campaign to impose their tastes on everybody else, read the 'Shock] Horror]' stories of their finger-wagging allies in the tabloid papers, and you will believe that sex'an'violence on television is, as ever, on the increase. But if you sit down for week after week, year after year and monitor the output, you will find that something much more interesting is happening. Far from going up, the incidence of violence has actually gone down since the worst days of the 1970s and early 1980s, yet equally clearly, sex is, indeed, on the increase. Hence the wonderful sight last week of the tabloid press up on its hobby horse having a fit of the vapours over the explicit pictures in BBC2's Buddha Of Suburbia. 'Shame Of BBC's Porn Play' shrieked the Sun on Wednesday and then, purely in the public interest you understand, and despite its own distaste for such things, it provided photographs of the actresses in the nude. This seems to have struck the Daily Mail as a wizard wheeze because next day it splashed 'A full frontal assault' across a double spread, above a story which began 'BBC bosses refused to make eleventh-hour cuts to last night's episode of the controversial sex drama The Buddha Of Suburbia despite public concern over explicit scenes.' Nowhere did it explain how there could have been 'public concern' over scenes which the public had not seen. More surprising, however, given the obsession of such newspapers with the supposed need for censorship, is the blindness to the sea change that has occurred in the last 15 years. If you went into any British television drama department today with a series of The Sweeney (or Starsky And Hutch for that matter) made in the late 1970s you would be told they were untransmittable because of the violence. The head of drama would freeze-frame the video at the point where six beefy villains in balaclavas, armed with pickaxe handles, were leaping from the back of a Transit van to set about poor old DI Regan and his DS George Carter. Go away, you would be told, and come back with something more thoughtful: why not swap psychology for violence? Have a look at Cracker or Between The Lines and see how the old idea of 'action' has switched very largely from physical to mental. Whether this change is a good thing is debatable. Those of us who do not happen to like watching violence will be content, but if my great aunt were alive she would be most upset. She used to sulk through the likes of Panorama muttering 'What about a nice bit of violence for poor old auntie?' and then, when Dragnet or Big Breadwinner Hog came on, drum her heels on the floor and giggle. She lived in Purley, read Jeffrey Farnol, and never hurt a fly. Why should such people be forbidden their violent fix? And what about violent young men? Some doctors and criminologists argue that violence on television is cathartic, and serves as a substitute for the real thing: take it away and such delinquents will be more inclined to go out and do it themselves. Perhaps the present increase in reports of violent crime results from the decrease in violence on television? Of course there is still violence on television, from children's animated cartoons to bought-in Hollywood movies (and we shall come back to the question of Hollywood's role). But anyone monitoring the amount and intensity in the broadcasters' own programmes, especially in peak-time drama, would have to admit that there has been a significant reduction. What the tabloid press seems to have missed is the simultaneous increase throughout the mass media in references to all things sexual, whether pictorial or verbal. There are many possible reasons, ranging from a continued long-term reaction against Victorian hypocrisy to the supposed needs of the Aids industry. Since papers such as the Sun with its 'Page Three girls' have themselves contri-buted so obviously to this change it seems bizarre that they are blind to it. To a generation which now accepts nudity as readily in television drama as it does on Page Three or in the National Gallery, the 'fetch the smelling salts' pose of outrage adopted by the tabloids whenever one of the Redgrave women sheds her underwear seems ludicrous. This assertion is based not only upon evidence from my own children and their friends, now in their twenties, but from last week's edition of Open Space on BBC2. Presented by a remarkable woman named Isabel Koprowski, this made a common sense plea for Britain to move further and faster down this road and begin to catch up with our Continental partners. In many people, she pointed out, hostility towards explicitly sexual material arose from the belief that pornography always means violence towards women, a lie repeated endlessly by the busybody organisations and some of their tabloid allies. It is almost entirely untrue of Britain's soft porn (the only sort legally available) and very rarely true of the hard porn available across the Channel. This stuff is actually about enjoyment, and, in the print media, more and more the enjoyment of women as well as men these days. In their own defence the busybodies and tabloids would probably say that a still picture of a naked woman (or man, presumably) was one thing but vigorous rumpy pumpy on the screen in the corner of your living room was something else entirely. It is certainly true that representations of sexual intercourse have now become almost commonplace in British television drama. In the past few weeks we have seen brother-sister incest in some detail in Stephen Poliakoff's Close My Eyes on Channel 4. In Scarlet And Black we have watched from within several ladies' chambers as Monsieur Sorel's ladder (did he always pack a collapsible model?) whanged against their balconies, a signal at which nighties would slide magically to the floor. Even the ITV soccer drama All In The Game has had them playing hide the sausage . . . though with the woman on top, naturally. In 1993 anything else would be desperately politically incorrect. What the B &amp; T brigade never seem to ask themselves is whether there might, perhaps, be some point to these scenes other than a desire to outrage them. While watching The Buddha Of Suburbia did the oh-so-easily-shocked gentlemen on the tabloids really not notice that the big sex scene was supposed to be comical? That even as the director's wife with the voracious sexual appetite was riding our hero to such a noisy climax, he (underneath, natch) was gazing around in utter boredom? That his girl friend, pleasuring the director on the other side of the room, was also deep in a cocktail party conversation about the ICA? This drama (final episode at 9.25 on BBC2 tonight, heaven only knows what sort of a record rating it will get) is a satire about the social mores of Londoners in the 1970s. Attitudes to many subjects - Asians, contemporary music, mysticism - have been represented and variously parodied, ridiculed or attacked, and it would be odd, given the time and attention that so many people devote to it, if sex were to be left out. The trouble with the B &amp; T attacks is that by spreading outrage indiscriminately over anything at all to do with sex, they end up conveying to the impressionable, and especially to those who actually see very little of this sort of material, that there is nothing to choose between, say, the closing sex scene in last week's Buddha Of Suburbia and the opening sex scene in the Hollywood movie Basic Instinct. Yet the truth is that the television scene was funny and telling whereas the movie scene (with the woman on top, of course, first humping her victim and then slashing him hysterically with a knife) is utterly repellent. So much so that I, a cinema and TV critic for 30 years, turned my face away in shame for the human race. If we cannot distinguish between these things we are lost.</p>

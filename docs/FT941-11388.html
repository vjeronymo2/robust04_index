			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Advisers in favour of regulation, not PIA Sir, In response to your article, 'Squabble may spoil life's ambition' (January 26), your readers may be intrigued to learn that at a large meeting of members of Countrywide Independent Advisers last week there was almost 100 per cent support for statutory regulation rather than the Personal Investment Authority. The primary objection was that the constitution of the proposed board is seen to favour public interest groups; put another way, self-regulation is no longer self-regulation. What is interesting is that these are independent financial advisers speaking. IFAs are not normally known for expressing views in favour of any sort of regulation, let alone statutory regulation. But IFAs have come a long way. Like others they see the proliferation of different regulators for different parts of the personal investment sector to have been a signal failure of the Financial Services Act and welcome the rationalisation proposed. Regulation is good for IFAs. It has very positive marketing advantages. IFAs are in favour of a single regulatory body with status, stature and teeth. Who better than the government? Government will be fairer than the PIA as proposed. Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman, thinks it would be a waste of effort and resources if the PIA were not now to proceed. Surely this is not so. The cumulative experience in getting us thus far would be absorbed by government. Many of the people involved would be available to government. It is a nonsense to imply that government would be starting afresh. Furthermore, if all the PIA has done is to crystallise thinking, it will have been worth it.

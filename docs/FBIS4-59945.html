			<p>BFN     [Text] Two missile frigates have been repaired and today  joined the naval fleet of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The  repair work on the frigates Shamshir [sword] and Zubin [javelin]  was carried out by experts at factories belonging to the First  Naval Zone of Iran.    Also today, a reconditioned hovercraft joined Iran's First  Naval Zone Armed Forces. To recondition a hovercraft, with less  than 75 percent of the parts needing repair or replacement,  would cost 4 million pounds [as heard] or its equivalent of hard  currency in a Western country such as Britain.</p>

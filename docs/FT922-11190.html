			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Arts: The Thieving Magpie - Opera North/Leeds Opera North celebrate the Rossini bicentenary with the new production of a work especially dear to all Rossinians. La gazza ladra, a semiseria opera, is pastoral in convention, radical in approach to that convention. In its treatment of a historical case of social injustice - a servant-girl condemned to death for stealing cutlery actually filched by a tame magpie - it moves with unflinching steadiness from innocent domestic comedy to dark tragedy. The opera is not the less powerfully affecting for adhering to the intimate confines of the semiseria tradition. On its own it should have put paid to the durable 'lazy Rossini' calumny once and for all. But like all masterpieces of art whose innovations are concealed beneath a supposedly familiar surface, it poses particular problems of reception for those who come to it with their Rossini notions fixed entirely by The Barber. Structurally, it is a 'big' achievement for a semiseria - amply developed and scored (as befits a work written for La Scala), requiring patient unfolding, delicate characterisation, singing at once emotionally expressive and freely virtuosic, and a producer's ability to phase the movement toward tragedy. For all these reasons, La gazza ladra is given far less often than it deserves: this production is the first in Britain since ENO's of 1978. Gratitude to the company is therefore unfettered - but not blind. Opening night did not, I feel, entirely rise to the occasion. That may well happen during the run; on Friday the throat infections of two leading singers, Andrew Shore as the villainous Mayor and Matthew Best as the heroine's much-tried father, must surely have left their mark. Already the ensemble virtues of the production, by Martin Duncan in Sue Blane's designs, and the sensitive qualities of Ivor Bolton's conducting were much in evidence. Jeremy Sams's new translation is crisply singable, with characteristically felicitous touches. The sepia-tinted cut-out scenery and use of footlights manifest both 'period' sensibility and quick, intelligent modern stagecraft. All the roles are aptly acted; in a marvellously rounded portrayal of Victorian values in action - which includes, of course, the sexual harassment of servant-girls - Mr Shore proved the evening's star in spite of vocal vagaries. But during the evening I came to sense slightly less complete trust in the work's inherent vitality than I expect from an Opera North show. Damagingly heavy cuts have been made to the score. The production opens with comically dancing servant-folk and closes with an ill-advised infusion of late 20th century psychodrama: the heroine Ninetta, fatally undone (in Mr Duncan's eyes) by her trials, goes bonkers during the opera's final strains of happy-ever-after music. Good 'political' insight, bad production idea. In between, certain episodes were handled with superb economy. What was missing on Friday was an overall security of tone - and, to be tactlessly frank, a sufficiently vigorous display of Rossini singing skills. Banishing the memory of Della Jones's 1978 ENO Ninetta, I still found Anne Dawson lacking in attack, sharpness of delineation, forwardness of tone. Her characterisation, so seriously and gracefully undertaken, can be deemed 'English' in both the good and less good connotations of the epithet. Ditto the gentle, musicianly Pippo (one of opera's great pants parts) of Elizabeth McCormack, and too many smaller roles undersung; Arwel Huw Morgan's ripe Fabrizio is an honourable exception. The Giannetto of Barry Banks, an excellent high tenor, is particularly ill served by the cuts. On Friday the promise of the show was never fully realised. But subsequent performances may well tell a different tale - and the opera itself is a wonder. Leeds Grand Theatre; in repertory until May 9, then on tour to Nottingham, Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield</p>

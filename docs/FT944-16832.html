			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / German engineers demand 6% pay rise IG Metall, the German engineering workers' union, yesterday called for a 6 per cent pay rise next year, and flatly rejected any attempt to delay the introduction of a 35-hour week. Mr Klaus Zwickel, the union's leader, said the claim was justified by the gathering economic recovery, rising productivity after mass redundancies over the past two years, and the need to give further stimulation to consumer demand. The claim was immediately condemned by the engineering employers as 'illusory', and as the wrong signal for the forthcoming pay round. The employers want the 35-hour week (due to be introduced from next October) to be renegotiated, in order to keep down costs in Germany's most important export industry. The 6 per cent claim, which affects some 3.8m workers in the industry, is based on forecasts by IG Metall of consumer price inflation next year of 2.5 per cent, and productivity growth of 3.5 per cent. It amounts to a recommendation to regional branches, which then submit their own precise claims and negotiate with the employers. At the same time, Mr Zwickel defended the proposed rise as an important way of stimulating the economic recovery, and boosting consumer spending. 'People who have suffered from three years of net reductions in their income have simply postponed their plans to buy new cars, refrigerators, and washing machines for longer and longer,' he said. 'The greatest brake on our economic recovery is (the lack of) private consumption. A significant increase in wages would support internal demand, secure existing jobs and create new ones.' His argument was rejected by Mr Dieter Kirchner, chief executive of Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers' federation, who insisted that cost cutting remained the employers' highest priority in order to save jobs in the industry. The claim also became instant election campaign material, with Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the Free Democratic party economics minister, saying that flexible working hours should have precedence over wage increases, in order to promote Germany's industrial competitiveness. Mr Zwickel insisted that the present trend towards shorter working hours must be maintained, in order to create the opportunity for more jobs. For that reason he flatly rejected the employers' move to reopen the debate on the 35-hour week, which was won by IG Metall after a seven-week strike in 1984. That strike secured the union a staged move to a 35-hour week and has reduced the working week progressively from 40 hours to the present 36. In spite of the confrontational tone of the statements by union and employers, there is a considerable degree of common ground between them. Both stress particularly the need to preserve existing jobs, and both are therefore likely to maintain the current deal allowing flexible cuts in working hours, without full wage compensation. Mr Zwickel said that far from slowing down, the reduction in jobs in the engineering industry was still continuing, with total employment in the second quarter of the year down 7.1 per cent compared with 1993.</p>

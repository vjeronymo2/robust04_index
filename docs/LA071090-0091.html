			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: THOMAS JEFFERSON DECLARED UNDER THE INFLUENCE  </P> <P> I have received a complimentary copy of a magazine called Heads Up, a  publication of the Beer Drinkers of America.  </P> <P> If all the beer drinkers in America are members of that organization, it must  be very large indeed, and very powerful politically. It is more likely, I  suspect, that its members are in the brewing industry.  </P> <P> I do not qualify, by habit, for membership (I generally drink wine), but I am  amused by the industry's pretensions to patriotism. The cover shows three men  in Colonial costume examining a document written on parchment. They are in a  tavern before a great fireplace. Their table holds two full beer mugs and one  lighted candle. In the table of contents it is noted that this scene was  "re-created" in Gulliver's restaurant in Irvine.  </P> <P> I am always glad to learn some previously unknown tidbit of American history,  so I was surprised but not displeased to learn in an article called "Ye Old  Public Taverns Were a Source of Inspiration, Warmth . . . and American Liberty"  that Thomas Jefferson actually wrote one of his drafts of the Declaration of  Independence in a tavern.  </P> <P> Not only was he in a tavern, he was drinking ale. I quote:  </P> <P> "Thomas Jefferson sat at the Indian Queen Tavern in Philadelphia facing a blank  sheet of parchment. Taking a long drink of his freshly poured ale, he touched  his pen to paper and scratched, 'When in the course of human events . . . . ' "  </P> <P> It is fascinating to think that Jefferson may have been a little tipsy when he  wrote that most cherished of American documents. Perhaps the ale accounts for  his misspelling of "inalienable" as "unalienable," an error that has been  perpetuated in copies of the declaration to the present day. It is said that  Jefferson in his other writings spelled the word "inalienable."  </P> <P> We may also wonder whether it was the ale, and the tavern setting, that caused  Jefferson to omit women from his phrase, "We hold these truths to be  self-evident; that all men are created equal. . . ."  </P> <P> In his biography, "Jefferson the Virginian," Dumas Malone notes that in his  original draft Jefferson had written "We hold these truths to be sacred and  undeniable," but this rhetorical flare-up was toned down later, either by  Jefferson himself or by Benjamin Franklin.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, though Jefferson may have been under the influence of ale when he  composed it, his declaration has stood the test of time. As Malone says, "No  other American document has been read so often or listened to by so many weary  and perspiring audiences. Yet, despite interminable repetition, those well-worn  phrases have never lost their potency and charm."  </P> <P> Certainly a close second to the declaration would be Lincoln's "Gettysburg  Address," which he wrote on one sheet of paper before leaving the White House  for the cemetery. He made some revisions the night before the talk. Oddly, the  phrase "under God," in "this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of  freedom," did not appear in his original copies. He ad libbed them. But they  appear in all subsequent copies. One thing I doubt seriously, is that Lincoln  had drunk any beer or spiritous liquor while he was composing it.  </P> <P> Heads Up also notes that the flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write "The  Star-Spangled Banner" in 1814 was sewn by Mary Young Pickersgill on the floor  of a Baltimore brewery.  </P> <P> In an article on "America's No. 1 Song" (Atlantic, July, 1986) Daniel Mark  Epstein explains that Mary's sewing room was too small for the flag, which was  30 feet high and 42 feet wide, so she and her little daughter worked on their  hands and knees on the malt-house floor of Claggett's Brewery. They finished  just as the British fleet was approaching Baltimore Harbor.  </P> <P> Key was a prisoner of the British during that night of rockets red glare and  bombs bursting in air, and at dawn, when he saw the flag still flying, he wrote  his poem on an envelope.  </P> <P> Not only was the flag sewn on a brewery floor, but the poem was set to the tune  of an English drinking song, "To Anacreon in Heaven," a hymn to the ancient  Greek poet Anacreon, who loved wine and lovemaking above all else. London  gentlemen spent nights of alcoholic singing and revelry in his memory.  </P> <P> According to Heads Up, Key's words were published on a handbill the next day  and were soon "being sung in Baltimore taverns."  </P> <P> So "The Star-Spangled Banner" is a dubious national anthem, not only because of  its libertine origin, but also because of its notoriously out-of-reach high  notes and low notes, on which the best voices -- pop, operatic and rock --  routinely founder; also, it can not be marched to.  </P> <P> I don't drink beer when I write. If I did, I'd probably write phrases like "We  hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable."  </P></p>

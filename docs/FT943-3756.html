			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Lone pilot crashes at White House The pilot of the aircraft that crashed on a White House lawn early yesterday, after penetrating high-security air space, had 'a history of mental illness', investigators said, Reuter reports from Washington. A US secret service spokesman identified the pilot, who died in the crash, as Frank Eugene Corder, aged 38, of no fixed address. The single-engined Cessna had been stolen from the county airport at Harford, Maryland, about 50 miles from Washington. President Bill Clinton, his wife Hillary and their daughter Chelsea were asleep a few hundred yards away across Pennsylvania Avenue in Blair House, a guest residence, when the aircraft crashed at about 2am, sliding against the White House. The family has moved out of the mansion while repairs are made. A witness said that the aircraft's engine had been switched off. The aeroplane swooped from the direction of the Washington Monument and passed over a high, steel-rail fence before ploughing into the White House lawn.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Cabinet approves draft financial law GERMANY came a step closer to introducing a modern regulatory infrastructure for its financial markets yesterday when the cabinet approved the draft of the second Financial Markets Promotion Law. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said that the law counted as a 'quantum leap forward' for the international competitiveness of Germany's financial services sector and was one of the most important pieces of legislation in the life of the current parliament. The long-awaited law will make insider dealing a criminal offence in Germany for the first time, punishing offenders with up to five years in jail or a fine of up to DM500,000 (Dollars 309,000) It will also establish a regulatory body to supervise the German securities industry, a German version of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission responsible for policing the US securities markets. In addition it will introduce new disclosure thresholds for share stakes, making it obligatory for shareholdings to be declared when they reach or go over 5, 10, 25 and 75 per cent. At present stakes only have to be disclosed when they reach 20 to 25 per cent compared to 3 per cent in the UK. The draft law was first proposed by Mr Waigel, finance minister, in January of last year. It is likely to enacted by parliament in the first half of next year.</p>

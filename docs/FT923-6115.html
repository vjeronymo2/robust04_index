			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Equity Issues: Bankers await result of French Maastricht poll INVESTMENT bankers are waiting for the French referendum on ratification of the Maastricht Treaty on September 20 to see whether stock market conditions will improve, providing a more favourable environment for international equity issues. They hope to see a steady stream of international equity offerings from European state-controlled companies this autumn, as governments in Spain, Italy, Sweden and France push ahead with privatisation programmes, but this could depend on the referendum's outcome. 'If France votes against European economic and monetary union, the equity markets will not be as conducive to new issues,' said one Japanese banker, warning that a 'no' vote would upset the currency, fixed interest and equity markets, whereas a 'yes' vote would help boost sentiment in Europe's financial markets. Activity in the international equity markets has dried up in recent weeks mainly because of poor market conditions - although some syndicate managers have warned that investor demand is much weaker during the summer months especially following Wellcome's large global offering. European governments such as those in Italy and Spain are eager to reduce their budget deficits in order to help meet the targets set out in the Maastricht Treaty on European economic and monetary union. In addition, some governments are less willing to make heavy investments in the state-owned industries. Already several European companies have announced their intentions to raise capital in the equity markets. They are expected to use either straight share offerings or equity-related issues such as convertible bonds and bonds with warrants. Repsol, the Spanish state-controlled oil and gas group, plans to raise up to Pta100bn with a share offering aimed at international investors. The international offering is expected to reduce the state's stake in Repsol from 62.3 per cent to 40-50 per cent, bankers said. The Spanish group recently raised Pta80bn with a convertible bond issue aimed at domestic investors. The bonds are due for conversion at the end of September. Elsewhere in Europe, Sweden's centre-right government is due to launch its most ambitious privatisation with the sale of shares in Procordia, the food and pharmaceuticals group. The share sale is likely to take place in October or November although details of the international tranche are still to be decided, according to bankers involved in the issue. The French state is due to reduce its stake in one of the three state-controlled insurance companies - AGF, UAP and GAN - and if the Socialists lose at the next election, it is likely that a new centre-right government would step up the pace of privatisation. One investment banker warned that governments will come under pressure to launch their sales of shares in state-controlled companies fairly swiftly in order to avoid clashing with Italy's large privatisation programme aimed at reducing the government's level of indebtedness. The privatisation programme is seen as a test of the government's ability to improve the state of the economy. Four Italian public sector groups - IRI, ENI, ENEL and INA - were transformed into joint stock companies this month as a first step towards privatisation.</p>

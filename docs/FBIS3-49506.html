Madeleine Albright and  head of U.S. Armed Forces John Shalikashvili.    The U.S. project Partnership for Peace has been formulated  in  such a way, Baudys said, as to offer an almost unbelievably wide  choice from "zero cooperation to the closest possible  cooperation," allowing bilateral adaptation between the Czech  and NATO armed forces.    "Under the project, we want to achieve a maximum number of  concrete military steps," Baudys said, adding that he believed  this would make "all NATO members see that the Czech Republic is  capable of accepting its share of responsibility for the  European security."

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Ma Chenguang: "Negotiable Notes To Be </F> Regulated With New Law"]    [Text] China is introducing a law on bills of exchange to  better regulate their proper use and circulation, an official  from the State Council said yesterday.    The draft of the Law on Negotiable Instruments has been  completed and will be submitted to the State Council for  deliberation soon, said Li Shishi from the council's Legislative  Affairs Bureau.    As indicated in the draft, negotiable instruments will  include bills of exchange, promissory notes, bearer shares,  bonds and negotiable certificates of deposits, Li said at an  international seminar in Beijing.    The law is intended to ensure the proper handling of  transactions involving payments, exchanges, credit, and  financing and dissolving debts.    The introduction of a socialist market economy in China has  led to the increasing use of various negotiable instruments for  finance, investment and international trade. The growing role  these documents play calls for a timely law to regulate their  use .    The lack of such a law has resulted in disputes and crimes,  such as circulation of bad checques and fake bills, he said.  According to the draft law, these crimes will be severely  punished.    The law will stipulate the pattern of negotiable instruments  and the information that they must include. It also will  establish details about the transfer of holders' rights and cash  deposits and the effectiveness period for the documents.    Research for the draft began in 1990 and was mainly compiled  by experts from the People's Bank of China, he said. After  deliberation at the State Council, the law will be submitted to  China's legislature for approval.    Li spoke at a two-day seminar on negotiable instruments,  which was organized by the China Chamber of International  Commerce and the International Chamber of Commerce.    The organizers said they wished to draw useful experiences  from other countries through the seminar to provide perspective  for China's compilation of its law.    Analysts at the seminar said the draft law is expected to be  passed this year.</p>

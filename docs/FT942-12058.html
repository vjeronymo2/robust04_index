			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Brazilian Workers' party softens policy: Presidential election hopes prompt moderation Brazil's left-of-centre Workers' party (PT) has agreed a watered-down policy on the country's foreign debt which should help the election chances of its leader, Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, front-runner in polls for October's presidential elections. At the party's annual conference at the weekend, Mr da Silva and other moderates saw off calls for an immediate moratorium on Brazil's foreign debt if the PT won the presidency. Instead, a future PT government will seek to renegotiate existing accords and only suspend payment as a final measure in the face of creditors' intransigence. Brazil is the developing world's biggest debtor and last month closed a Dollars 49bn (Pounds 33.5bn) debt rescheduling after four years of negotiations. PT leaders insist the rescheduling was a bad deal for Brazil and that their government would seek better terms. However, some analysts believe an incoming PT government would have many other more urgent domestic problems to confront. At the annual conference, several delegates attacked the International Monetary Fund and said debt payments should stop if they threatened Brazil's foreign reserves, standing at more than Dollars 30bn. Mr da Silva, who has moved from the left to the centre of the party since his defeat in the last presidential election in 1989, also moderated other policies in areas such as foreign investment and access to abortion. The main problems a PT government would aim to tackle include social issues such as education, health, agricultural reform and land. In opinion polls Mr da Silva is comfortably ahead of his nearest rival, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, former finance minister. Full campaigning will probably not get under way until after the football World Cup final in the US in July. Mr Cardoso was yesterday expected to announce a formal election alliance between his party, the centrist Brazilian Social Democrats (PSDB), and the right-of-centre Liberal Front (PFL), the second largest party in Congress. The alliance will give Mr Cardoso support in north-east Brazil, where the PFL is strong but Mr Cardoso weak.</p>

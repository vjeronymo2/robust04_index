			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Case for abolishing banks' floating charge Sir, It is encouraging to read (Letters June 22) that a leading banker - Mr Derek Sach, of the Royal Bank of Scotland - has called for the abolition of the floating charge in the UK. At the time when the Department of Trade and Industry is reviewing existing insolvency legislation, it is important to look at the power which a bank derives from the floating charge and determine if that power is healthy in a modern highly competitive industrial economy. Not only do the powers of an administrative receiver under a floating charge cause concern and uncertainty to the borrower, but such charges create serious disadvantage for unsecured trade creditors which supply an apparently sound company, while unaware of the current extent of its borrowings and without the level of information about its liquidity which is available to the bank. It is the floating charge which underpins the capital gearing approach of the banks to small and medium enterprise (SME) lending in the UK, highlighted in the Confederation of British Industry August 1993 report, Finance for Growth. Reliance is placed on security rather than information and the income stream indicated by future prospects of the enterprise - an income-gearing approach. This encourages the provision of short-term finance. Without the all-embracing safety net of the floating charge for banks, lending proposals would inevitably be more critically assessed to the benefit of the banks and the businesses concerned. The elimination of the floating charge and the removal of the preference it gives to one creditor whose prime concern is not the continuing viability of the business and the jobs at stake, would create a more robust lending environment in the UK. There is no reason to believe that UK bankers, given time, would not match the performance of bankers in other industrialised countries, including Germany, Japan and the US, where floating charges are unlawful, in their lending to the unquoted sector. This would surely be to the benefit of Britain's SMEs in the medium to longer term. It would also help redirect the traditional thrust of our corporate insolvency process, moving away from retribution for the debtor and towards his rehabilitation.

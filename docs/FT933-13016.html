			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Carlsberg-Tetley deal with Eldridge Pope CARLSBERG-TETLEY and Eldridge Pope are forming a trading alliance designed to widen distribution and boost market share of their beer brands. Under the agreement, Carlsberg-Tetley - created earlier this year from the merger of the UK brewing operations of Carlsberg and Allied-Lyons - will become the principal supplier of lager, led by the Carlsberg and Castlemaine brands, to Eldridge Pope's 180 pubs. It will also acquire the Dorset-based brewer's beer wholesaling business for Pounds 5.8m, giving it access to other free trade pubs and further strengthening its position in the Wessex area. The operation last year made a profit of Pounds 425,000 on turnover of Pounds 8.2m. Regional distribution of the combined portfolio will be handled by Eldridge Pope from Dorchester. Carlsberg-Tetley's depot in Bournemouth will close at the end of the year. Carlsberg-Tetley will sell Eldridge Pope's Thomas Hardy and Royal Oak cask ales as part of its national portfolio elsewhere in the country and will sign a three-year production contract with the Dorchester brewery. The Dorset brewer is to strengthen its own sales team to expand sales to wholesalers, including other brewers, retail pub groups and the take-home market. Eldridge Pope's wholesale wine operations will continue to supply customers throughout the country but Carlsberg-Tetley will distribute wines in in the Wessex region. The deal should help to consolidate Eldridge Pope's recovery from costly hotel and computer ventures. Mr Christopher Pope, chairman, said yesterday that the company's objectives were to become a leading pub retailer, develop its brands nationally and expand its wine wholesaling. 'This alliance gives us the opportunity to move forward on all three fronts at once', he stated. Funds from the sale of the beer wholesaling operation would be used for improvements to the company's pubs and possible expansion of the estate. Mr Don Marshall, Carlsberg-Tetley's managing director, said the alliance would strengthen sales and distribution of the company's brands in more than 550 outlets in the Wessex region and offer cost savings from the merged operations. Shares in Allied-Lyons closed 3p up at 548p while Eldridge Pope shares, quoted on the USM, gained 5p to 104p. See Lex</p>

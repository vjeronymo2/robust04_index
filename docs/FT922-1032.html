			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa futures prices hit fresh 16 1/2 -year lows LONDON COCOA prices fell to fresh 16 1/2 -year lows yesterday as the inexorable decline continued. Some traders now see the second position contract falling to Pounds 500 a tonne before long. The September contract touched a low of Pounds 520 a tonne in early trading before recovering to close at Pounds 523 a tonne, down Pounds 7 on the day. Two main factors are keeping prices permanently under pressure, according to Mr Tony Chadwick of Prudential Bache. First, West African crops - particularly in the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer - have been better than had been expected, and second, demand from the former Soviet Union has fallen dramatically. The combination of better production performances and lower consumption than expected has forced analysts to revise sharply downwards their original projections for the first deficit in the world cocoa supply-demand balance for eight years. The International Cocoa Organisation has cut its forecast to 115,000 tonnes from an earlier 140,000 tonnes and Gill &amp; Duffus, the London trader owned by ED &amp; F Man, last month reduced its estimate to 107,000 tonnes from 177,000 tonnes. The Economist Intelligence Unit is predicting a deficit of only 83,000 tonnes. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, said yesterday's decline followed light trade selling in a market 'devoid of any speculative interest'. The only factor on the horizon that could provide any bullish news was the talks in Geneva from July 6 on a new international cocoa agreement. 'This has been largely ignored and there is a possibility of a surprise,' he said. Cocoa producing countries last week issued a statement, after a meeting in the Ivory Coast, urging consumers to join in working towards an agreement with price-supporting clauses by the end of the current cocoa year in September. 'Producer countries feel it is vital to envisage interim provisions to face up to the grave crisis in the cocoa economy before a new accord takes effect.' The EIU in its latest World Commodity Forecasts predicts a 'sluggish upturn' in prices next year to an average price of 60 cents a lb compared with an average of 51 cents this year. But it points out that the market has 'a disconcerting habit of confounding the pundits. Every new low is seen as the bottom and yet prices go on falling'.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY S&amp;L FOUND NEGLIGENT; BROKER GETS $900,000  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court jury has awarded $900,000 to an Altadena real  estate broker after concluding that Family Savings &amp; Loan was negligent  when it failed to prevent a former teller from defrauding the depositor of $1.2  million.  </P> <P> The real estate broker, Wilbert B. Simms, has alleged that the teller, Nghia  Thi Sabol, lured him into a fraudulent business partnership when she was teller  at Family's Pasadena office in 1980. She accepted money from Simms as part of a  bogus plan to make short-term loans to Vietnamese immigrants in Southern  California, according to the civil complaint. Under the plan, Sabol was to  invest her own funds with Simms in loans that were to pay high interest.  </P> <P> Simms' attorneys argued that Family Savings management should have been aware  that Sabol had written checks for large sums against insufficient funds on a  thrift account while she was employed there. The complaint alleged that  management ignored "suspicious" conduct by Sabol and contends that managers  should have warned Simms to be cautious. The complaint also alleged that Sabol  was allowed "unfettered access" to Simms' bank records. Family Savings  contested the negligence claims.  </P> <P> Simms sought damages of $1.6 million. However, after reviewing evidence  presented during the three-week trial, the jury concluded that Simms was  partially negligent and provided a lower damage award.  </P> <P> In 1986, Sabol was convicted of grand theft in Los Angeles Superior Court and  sentenced to seven years.  </P> <P> Between 1980 and 1982, Sabol persuaded Simms to provide cash, jewelry and real  estate equity to finance the lending scheme, the civil complaint said. Sabol  used a forged Family Savings passbook to delude Simms into believing that she  had deposits of about $500,000, according to the complaint.  </P> <P> Simms handed over some of the money to Sabol through her teller's window at the  branch office, and she continued to take money from Simms after leaving her  position at Family Savings, the complaint said.  </P> <P> Executives at Family had no immediate comment on the case. The loss was the  latest in a series of legal problems at Family Savings. Oliver A. Trigg Jr.,  ousted as the thrift's chairman in 1988, was ordered to sell his shares in  Family Savings after a lengthy federal investigation into possible fraud at the  thrift.  </P></p>

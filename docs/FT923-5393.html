			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (10): Committed rebuilder - Profile of Heinz Eggert HEINZ EGGERT is a tall man whose casual dress and spontaneous manner belie his inner toughness. He has forthright views about how Germans in east and west should react to unification and is not shy of expressing them. He certainly does not look, or talk, like a typical minister, although he has headed Saxony's interior ministry for almost a year. Mr Eggert, has brought to the job the committed outlook of one who suffered under the old regime and is determined a new start should be made. 'I want to see that yesterday's people don't become tomorrow's masters,' he says. 'I don't want our children to experience what we went through'. Thus he is prepared to work an exhausting day from 7.30am until 11.00pm. Often, he goes out later to tap the views of people in the bars and cafes, especially those frequented by extreme left- or right-wingers. He is unsure whether he will continue with this gruelling job after the legislative period ends in 1994. He sees little of his wife, four children, dog, and 12 rabbits. What keeps him going is the huge task of rebuilding an administration which will oversee the painful transition to the free market. Having been hounded by the Stasi (security forces) himself - he even found out his doctor had given him energy-draining drugs - the railway worker-turned-theologian has thrown himself wholeheartedly into his new task. 'German unification has brought enormous opportunities for Germany and Europe, but these also mean enormous responsibilities. We have to shoulder these,' he says. It has meant harsh decisions. Even before he took on the minister's job in Dresden, he dealt severely with former members of the old regime when head of the council in the small town of Zittau, near Czechoslovakia. While believing people can change for the better, Mr Eggert has no patience with those who made others suffer. 'I can't tolerate the use of taxpayer's money to pay people who used their positions to harm or degrade others,' he says. The obvious cases - those who worked or informed for the Stasi - have been dismissed, including 800 police officers. But there are numerous cases of people whose careers were intertwined with the old regime and who are now hard to remove under west German law. Mr Eggert finds this frustrating. 'The legal apparatus of west Germany is not suitable for a time of reconstruction in the east after 40 years of communist dictatorship'. Also taking up time is the need to deal with extremists, particularly those on the right who have whipped up violent resentment against foreign asylum-seekers at a time of acute economic and social uncertainty. In Mr Eggert's view, the fundamental problem goes beyond the housing shortages, unemployment, rising prices and other upheavals. West Germans should be ready to give up some of their cherished prosperity and advantages to help those in the east rebuild their lives. They should not see unity as something to be simply welcomed as if nothing had really changed. 'It is the challenge of the century'. But east Germans, too, should not hark back to the simplicity of the old days, when pressures were fewer, though living standards were lower. He feels that the press, unshackled after cravenly toeing the party line, expresses a far more negative attitude than east German people themselves.</p>

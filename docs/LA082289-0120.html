			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Organization of African Unity laid down tough conditions for talks with the  South African government, adopting a nine-page strategy document that endorses  the known negotiating position of the African National Congress, South Africa's  main black nationalist group. The document, adopted by an OAU ad hoc committee  meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe, calls on Pretoria to lift the existing state of  emergency, free political prisoners, end a ban on political organizations and  restrictions on individuals, withdraw troops from black townships and end  political trials and executions.  </P></p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Waking up to the pension scheme threats Here is a warning to European finance directors: beware of representatives of AMP Asset Management offering you a computer disc to check the prospects for your company pension scheme. The results could upset you. The self-testing disc comes with a report called The Threats to Company Sponsored Pension Provisions in Europe* which is equally careless of its readers' peace of mind. Probably the threats are overdone, but it is clear that many European companies have grown complacent about their pension costs. Only a few European countries have large numbers of funded company schemes. The UK and the Netherlands feature separate corporate funds invested mainly in securities, while Germany maintains a book reserve system in which the liabilities are usually financed through the balance sheet. Schemes also exist in Switzerland and Ireland. Elsewhere in Europe unfunded state schemes predominate. These are coming under immense pressure from social and demographic changes; the big French industry-wide repartition schemes are in heavy deficit, and unaffordable pensions promises are at the centre of the Italian budget crisis. How will the pressures which are undermining state systems affect company schemes? The report focuses on 15 company schemes in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany, plus a Dutch industry-wide fund. Raising the costs of company schemes are demographic factors, including longer life expectancy and fewer younger employees, together with pressures for early retirement. Second, there is the likelihood that governments will try to offload state pensions liabilities on to employers - for instance, through compulsory contributions - while at the same time corporate taxes may be increased to help solve budget problems. The UK government has already made one raid on pension funds by modifying their dividend tax exemptions last year. Finally, there are the investment risks. Returns were unsustainably high in the 1980s and have tailed off. This might even be the start of an offsetting period of poor returns. If inflation stays low, pension funds can live with low nominal investment returns. But the great days of big surpluses and contribution holidays will have to end. In the US companies have been distancing themselves from these threats by switching from defined benefit to defined contribution structures (which now account for almost 60 per cent of corporate pension plan assets). Not only is the investment risk transferred to employees but it is much harder for companies to be forced through retrospective legislation to pay for upgraded benefits (such as pensions for unmarried partners). Why is AMP adopting scare tactics? It would like to break into the pension fund management business in Europe, and it no doubt has an interest in upsetting the the status quo. But as a subsidiary of the antipodean insurance giant Australian Mutual Provident it also has an actuarial input on the impending pensions crisis. Australia has implemented a Superannuation Guarantee Charge, a compulsory employer pension fund contribution that will rise from 3 per cent to 9 per cent of pay (12 per cent including employee contributions) by 2002. In the UK, the Labour Party's Social Justice Commission has just proposed compulsory payments into second-tier funded schemes, and the National Association of Pension Funds has warmed to the same theme. In these circumstances companies running their own pension plans would face a progressive loss of control of the funding costs and benefit structures of the schemes. According to AMP, they should watch developments very closely and consider switching to defined contribution funding or to external providers. There is an element of special pleading in this report. Insurance companies are, after all, keen to recapture some of the company pensions business they have lost over the past 40 years. But AMP is right to argue that now is the time for companies to stop being complacent about their pension costs and start to worry. *Published by AMP Asset Management in conjunction with First Consulting.

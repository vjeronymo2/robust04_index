			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Charity account changes are urged SIGNIFICANT changes designed to make charities' accounts more intelligible were published by a Charity Commission committee yesterday. The new draft statement of recommended practice - called Sorp 2 - on which the commission is conducting consultations until May 14, is likely to form the basis of statutory accounting regulations under the 1992 Charities Act. The committee concludes that assessing a charity's financial position is 'quite different' from doing the same with a profit-driven business venture. It says: 'The key issue for the reader of charity accounts is to understand how incoming resources have been applied and what changes have taken place in the various funds of the charity during the year.' It recommends amalgamating the conventional income and expenditure account with a reconciliation and analysis of the movement of funds, to bring together in a single statement 'a complete picture which gives a true and fair view of the charity's activities'. The committee's draft statement emphasises the need for accounts to address the adequacy of a charity's resources to meet its commitments. The draft proposes an expansion of the narrative section of trustees' reports to ensure that accounts are correctly interpreted. The statement also suggests changes to the way charities define fundraising, administration and publicity costs. Both the Charity Finance Directors' Group and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations welcomed the draft. But the finance directors are concerned that the new regulations will not be mandatory for charities that are registered companies. Sorp 2, Charity Commission, 57-60 Haymarket, London SW1Y 4QX.</p>

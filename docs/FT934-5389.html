			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Carlton takes its cue for the super league: Raymond Snoddy examines the first of the big ITV takeovers The consolidation of the ITV network followed the expected script to the letter yesterday as Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications made an agreed bid for Central Independent Television valuing the company at Pounds 758m. Mr Green, who bought a 20 per cent stake in Central for Pounds 29.5m in 1987 from Ladbroke Group, pounced less than a week after Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, proposed changes that will allow one company to own two large ITV licences. The deal - subject to parliamentary approval of the rule change - will make Carlton by far the largest ITV company, broadcasting to 20m people and accounting for about 30 per cent of the ITV advertising market. If the rest of the script runs to form, Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada Group, and Lord Hollick, chief executive of MAI, the dominant shareholder in Meridian Broadcasting, could soon join Mr Green as power brokers of the ITV network. Granada, which owns 20 per cent of LWT, is expected to make a - probably hostile - bid for the rest of the London Weekend station. Lord Hollick's likely targets are Anglia Television or HTV. Three super-ITV companies would then control more than 70 per cent of ITV's Pounds 1.5bn-plus advertising revenues. With this would come the power to take decisions, which at present lies with an unwieldy 14-company structure. Talks between Carlton and Central began on Wednesday, the day the proposed rule change was announced. Central was still planning to bid for Anglia but on Thursday decided to put it on ice to see whether a deal could be done with Carlton. Negotiations continued over the weekend and the Central board agreed the deal late on Sunday. The deal values Central's shares at Pounds 26 each - two years ago they were less than Pounds 7. It comprises Pounds 204m cash, Carlton shares and Carlton preference shares. Carlton accompanied the takeover news with preliminary results for the year to September, showing a 26 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 126.1m on turnover up 56 per cent to Pounds 1.09bn. Earnings per share rose from 33.4p to 42p, and a final dividend of 11.3p makes a total of 18.7p, up 10 per cent. Carlton Television - nine months after going on air in London - made a Pounds 14.6m contribution to profits. Ten years ago Mr Green reversed the unknown Carlton into the Fleet Street Newsletter to produce a company capitalised at Pounds 10m. The newly enlarged Carlton would be capitalised at more than Pounds 2bn. Yesterday Mr Green, shoes kicked off, chomping contentedly on a cigar, expressed exasperation at Labour MPs who condemned him for jumping the legislative gun. He suggested the agreed bid was a model, with commitments to regional production underlined and plans for more programme production. 'In television English is the international production language,' said Mr Green, who is looking at the possibility of following BBC World Service Television into international markets, particularly in Asia. He is also chairman of Independent Television News, in which Carlton has an 18 per cent stake. 'We now have a platform to go all over the world,' he said, promising an increase in programme production in Central's Nottingham studios. The two companies are complementary in that Carlton is a publisher-broadcaster commissioning most of its programmes from independent producers, while Central makes a significant proportion of programmes in house. However, savings will have to made to protect earnings. First signs are that the target will be to take Pounds 10m a year out of costs which could mean job losses, mainly in administration. Mr Leslie Hill, Central's chairman and chief executive, will continue to lead it as a separately run subsidiary and will join the Carlton board. Yesterday he said that the proposed deal - for which Carlton already has acceptances representing 39 per cent of the equity - meant an end of uncertainty for Central. 'We can go on and build the business without looking over our shoulder all the time.'

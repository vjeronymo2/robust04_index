			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC PARAMETERS: NEW ZEALAND;  </P> <P> USE A COMB  </P> <P> This is the debut of a new Opinion feature -- excerpts of editorials and  commentary from around the Pacific Rim.  </P> <P> As a recent arrival, the U.S. Ambassador can be forgiven any flaws in her  knowledge of New Zealand. Mrs. (Della M.) Newman complains that hotels have a  "mirror on the wall over here and a wall plug over there and none in the  bathroom.  </P> <P> Now, how am I supposed to do my hair?"  </P> <P> She is right, of course. It is the New Zealand way. The wall plug "over there"  is for convenience in making a cup of tea or coffee without calling room  service . . . . The plug is missing from the bathroom for fear that with all  the water around, using an electrical appliance could produce a shocking  hairstyle. Standard current is 240 volts, Your Excellency.  </P></p>

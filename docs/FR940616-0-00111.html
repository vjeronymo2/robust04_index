			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Stricter Standards for Work-or-Repay Provision (&sect;386.34) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that grantees be required to arrange for all scholars to attend an extensive pre-enrollment work-or-repay seminar series at which participating agencies in the city or State (along with the grantee) would provide clearly detailed information regarding job opportunities for and subsequent responsibilities of scholars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees that a job seminar would be valuable for many scholarship recipients and potential rehabilitation employers. Such an activity, however, should be at the discretion of the grantee and not a regulatory requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Flexibility in Future Applications of Work-or-Repay Requirements (&sect;386.34)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter encouraged flexibility in the application of this requirement to emerging fields like independent living.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees that the work-or-repay provision should apply only to academic training and that fields such as independent living (IL) do not currently provide academic training subject to the work-or-repay provision. The Secretary plans to support future post-employment training grants in IL under training authorities that are not subject to the work-or-repay provision. However, it appears likely that research and curriculum development advances will soon make academic training, particularly in community colleges, possible. Therefore, in anticipation of the need to provide academic or certificate training opportunities, the Secretary has also retained IL as a Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program field.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Work-or-Repay Tracking Systems (&sect;386.34(g))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters expressed concern that the proposed regulations inappropriately place grantee institutions in watch-dog roles. In particular, there was objection to the requirement for documentation that the grantee has checked for addresses of missing scholars with alumni organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary does not believe that the requirement that the grantee check with university-sponsored alumni organizations if it is experiencing difficulty in locating a scholar is inappropriate. The regulations do not constitute a basis for forcing disclosure of records from any private organization. If a grantee cannot document, because of the inability to locate a scholar who has graduated, that requirements of the work-or-repay provision have been met by an individual, the grantee will be responsible for reporting to the Secretary that the individual has not completed the requirement. The Secretary will then initiate enforcement actions as outlined in &sect;386.43. The intent of the regulations is to have the grantee exhaust all possibilities to locate and contact the individual before the matter is referred to the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Texan high-speed rail project near collapse Plans to build a Dollars 6.8bn high-speed railway linking the main cities in Texas were on the brink of collapse yesterday after Morrison Knudsen, the US construction group, decided to back away from a key element of the financing. The group said it had decided to withdraw its guarantee for an initial Dollars 200m convertible bond offering because it was not prepared to take the risk alone. The project now faces missing a December 31 deadline for having in place its first-round funding of Dollars 170m. The Texas TGV, using technology developed for France's train a grande vitesse, would have been the first high-speed system in North America. The railway industry had hoped it would set a precedent for similar projects across the US and Canada. The railway was due to have been built by the Texas TGV Corporation, a private-sector consortium comprising Morrison Knudsen and private Texan interests. GEC Alsthom, developer of the French TGV, and Bombardier, GEC Alsthom's North American licensee, were to provide the technology.</p>

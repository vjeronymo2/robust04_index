			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / People: Foseke - turning over a new Liffe No-one else has made a success of it yet, but Karin Foseke is prepared to give it a go. The new director of equity products at Liffe, London's derivatives exchange, next week sets about the arduous task of selling equity and index options to British institutions and the investing public. LTOM, the traded options market under the umbrella of the stock exchange, was a failure. Merged into Liffe and under a new roof for the past year, equity index options have faired slightly better, but the volume on individual stock options has actually dropped. Why does Foseke think she can do better? The Swedish-born American citizen, who says she acts American or Swedish depending on what mood she is in, acknowledges that is 'a good question' but believes her background should enable her to tackle the problem afresh. She spent 18 years in the US, including at the Beverley Hills office of Prudential-Bache Securities advising on equity options strategies. She then moved to London, where she and her husband Peter Jorgensen were hired as a team to develop the London end of Swedish exchange OM - she as business development director, he as managing director. While OM London more or less owed its existence at the start to Swedish turnover tax (abolished at the end of 1991) driving business offshore, many members of the London exchange community were impressed with Foseke's drive. Since leaving OM early last year, she has been at WestPac London as head of distribution within the financial markets group, but says she missed the buzz of an innovative, successful market. At Liffe, Foseke, whose boss is business development managing director Roger Barton, will have to tread carefully with those members of LTOM who had wanted a managing director representing their interests and reporting directly to the chief executive. There is also unhappiness at how long the appointment took to make. Meanwhile, the advice from one LTOM old hand, who readily admits past mistakes and welcomes a fresh face, is simple: 'I hope she doesn't listen to us.' ***** Stephen Unwin, formerly head of banking at Kleinwort Benson and who before that ran Kleinwort's banking operations in the US, has joined Butte Mining as a non-executive director. Butte has never made a profit since it was floated on the London stock exchange six years ago; it startled the mining industry last May by launching a legal action in the US against 70 defendants, including former directors and advisers, claiming damages of at least Dollars 325m. Unwin, 52 and now a consultant, says he would not have joined the Butte board 'if I did not believe in the merit of the litigation. It will take a year or two, but I said I would help out at this difficult time for the company.' He stresses that he was not acting as a consultant to Butte and says that so far he has not discussed whether he would be paid anything as a director. David Lloyd-Jacob, Butte's chairman, says he has known Unwin for about ten years since they both worked in New York and recently had increasingly been seeking his advice. He says: 'Butte needs to ensure we have the financial resources to fight the US case to the end. With his financial background, Unwin is an ideal addition to the board.'</p>

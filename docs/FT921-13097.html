			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Bond dealers to play with more open hand / A look at proposals to reform the world's biggest financial market FOUR months after they opened their joint investigation into attempts by Salomon Brothers to rig the US government bond market, the US Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have drawn up a range of proposals for reforming the world's biggest financial market. Until the Salomon scandal broke last August, the Dollars 2,000bn market for US bonds and notes was lightly regulated, old fashioned and dominated by a few big dealing firms. However, the status quo, which was often highly profitable for the leading participants, is due for a shake-up if proposals outlined in the joint study, published late yesterday, are adopted. In light of Salomon's misdeeds, the study recommends that policing and supervision of the market be tightened, and that the main regulatory role over the primary dealers be switched from the New York Federal Reserve to the SEC. This should please Mr Richard Breeden, the commission's ambitious chairman, who has long been keen to extend the SEC's influence over the bond markets. The antiquated and closed bidding procedures of the auction system will be replaced by a computer screen-based visible bidding process. The big dealing firms, such as Salomon, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, will find their valuable primary dealership franchises - which grant them exclusive rights to trade directly with the New York Fed and bid in the auctions - opened to other institutions. The joint study recommends that in future the Treasury should intervene in the bond market if squeezes develop. A squeeze occurs when a few participants control a large portion of a new issue and use that dominance to extract a high price for the securities from other investors, especially those who have sold the issue short and need to cover their positions. A squeeze occurred in May last year when Salomon gained control of more than 90 per cent of an issue of two-year notes, partly through illegal means. The squeeze led to claims that some investors lost millions of dollars, and to lengthy disruption of market prices. The new policy is a reversal for the Treasury. For years it refused to interfere with the market because of the uncertainties that would be created. The Treasury has pledged to intervene when squeezes develop legally, arguing that even the perception of market manipulation can undermine the integrity of the market place and produce higher costs for the taxpayer. The proposed method of preventing abuses is simple. If a serious squeeze is detected, the Treasury has a range of options. It could: Offer an extra amount of the issue in one go to the market; Ask the New York Fed to sell as many new securities as Ask the Fed to lend securities to those who were victims of the squeeze. The anti-squeeze plan will meet criticism. The long-standing argument against intervention is that the threat of additional issues by the Treasury creates unwelcome uncertainty in the market. Ms Heather Ruth, president of the Public Securities Association, which represents bond market dealers, warns that participants might bid less aggressively at auctions because they would not want to be caught with a large holding of bonds or notes that could lose value if the Treasury suddenly added new supply to the market. This, she says, could lead to higher interest costs for the taxpayer. Defenders of the Treasury plan argue that a commitment to stamp out unruly price movements will bring interest costs down because they would attract more investors to the market who welcomed the protection against potentially damaging squeezes. Among the study's other proposals, the Treasury, the SEC and the Fed have come up with a more open, automated alternative to the current system. At the moment, investors submit sealed bids and the securities are awarded first to those who bid the highest, because the Treasury is keen to sell the securities at the lowest interest rate. The new system would involve an ascending-price plan, a complex process which would allocate securities based upon the lowest interest rate bidders are willing to accept. Participants would be able to view the progress of the auction at every step  -that is, how many investors were willing to bid at each rate - via computer screens. However, these changes will have to wait. First, the current automation of the auction system has to be completed, which is not likely to be until the end of this year. Second, the views of the market are to be canvassed before any changes are introduced. The primary dealers, until recently a tight-knit community of big trading firms, face fresh competition if the study's plan for opening up the auction system is adopted. The authorities want to grant a wider array of financial institutions direct access to the auction process. Until now, only the 38 primary dealers have been able to bid competitively in auctions so they have recommended that some of the requirements that primary dealers have to meet, such as maintaining a minimum 1 per cent share of total customer activity in the Treasury market, be removed, and that all government securities brokers and dealers registered with the SEC be allowed to submit bids for customers in auctions. Apart from the new anti-squeeze policy, which will be introduced on the first occasion a squeeze develops, the measures in the joint study remain just proposals. Whether the other measures are adopted depends primarily upon Congress, which will hold a series of hearings about the proposals over the next few weeks. The first opportunity to gauge how much support the joint study has comes today when the Senate securities subcommittee hears testimony from the regulatory authorities who drew up the proposals. The indications are that the study has the backing of the sub-committee's influential chairman, Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut. Earlier this week when the study's first details were known, Senator Dodd said: 'The reforms initiated by the Treasury and other agencies to date . . . will go a long way toward broadening the market, restoring investor confidence and providing for the issuance of Treasury debt at the lowest possible cost to the US taxpayer.'</p>

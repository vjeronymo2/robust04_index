			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Western bankers hail doubling of Russian interest rates RUSSIA'S central bank has raised its interest rates to 170 per cent this week, double the level of a month ago, in what is being hailed as a breakthrough in the bank's acceptance of market principles. The rate represents a much higher real annual rate, because of its method of calculation. Russian banks grant credits on a monthly basis, at one twelfth of the annual rate, or just over 14 per cent a month. this is equivalent to around 400 per cent a year, not far short of the inflation rate, now running at 15 per cent a month. One western expert in Moscow said yesterday that this was a real step forward by the bank, not just because interest rates had gone up, but because there was 'now an intellectual acceptance that interest rates should reflect the real cost of money, and that these should be borne by the borrower.' The move, coupled with decisions by the government to liberalise coal prices, slash budget expenditures by 20 per cent and limit credits to other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States to Rbs800bn this year, is seen by the world financial institutions as the most convincing promise of tough financial discipline for many months. Such promise has also been accompanied by some economic gain, with the rouble stabilising at around 1,050 to the dollar, and production falls slowing. However, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for finance, is now under intense pressure from industry to relax his policy. The IMF and the World Bank, in charge of disbursing the assistance to Russia agreed at the US-Russian summit in Vancouver in April and the Group of Seven industrialised countries' Tokyo summit in July, see the next two to three months as critical. There is now intense debate within the financial institutions and G7 governments on when the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of the 'systemic transformation facility' should be awarded. Senior officials in the US administration believe there is sufficient proof of Russian good intentions to pay it now, but the IMF remains more cautious. The coal price liberalisation is particularly controversial in Russia, since coal producers are claiming they will need to raise coal prices by four or five times to compensate for the loss of government subsidies. Steel and other metal producers argue that the higher prices will lose them the price advantage they enjoy over western producers - a price advantage which has triggered accusations of dumping, especially of aluminium. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, will come under intense pressure when he returns from holiday in late July from industry groups and the regions to loosen the constraints. The pressure will come at a time when he is attempting to keep regional support for a new constitution. 'We have at last reached the point where we are hitting the real issue,' said the western expert yesterday. 'Will they be able to hold the line which they have been able to establish, or not. The next two to three months will be decisive.'</p>

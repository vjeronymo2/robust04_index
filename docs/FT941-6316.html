			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Salomon to advise on UK debt sales The UK Treasury has appointed Salomon Brothers International to advise on disposals of its remaining holdings of debt in privatised UK companies in the next financial year. It is the first time that Salomon Brothers has been awarded a senior role by the UK Treasury since it was ditched from the BT2 privatisation, after being involved in a US Treasury auction scandal in 1991. The Treasury said it had taken the unusual step of appointing a non-UK bank because Salomon 'gave us the best presentation'. The Treasury sold Pounds 1.3bn of similar debt in 1992 through a complex auction, arranged by Barings, in which 13 privatised companies were invited to bid to buy back their debt. Outside investors were allowed to compete for BT debt. The government still holds a total of Pounds 2.86bn of the debt - Pounds 1.22bn of BT debt and Pounds 1.64bn of electricity debt - which was left on the companies' balance sheets at the time of privatisation. However, some of that debt is very short-dated and unlikely to be sold. Salomon will advise the Treasury on which and how much debt to sell, and how to sell it. The government aims to raise Pounds 5.5bn in privatisation proceeds in the next financial year. The debt sale will allow greater leeway in the timing of further electricity offerings. However, one difficulty in selling the debt is that, with coupons of more than 12 per cent - much higher than current market yields - it would have to be priced at a premium of around 30 per cent above its notional value, which could make it unattractive to potential buyers.</p>

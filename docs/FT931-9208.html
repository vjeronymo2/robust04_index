			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Kozyrev in plea to US over Bosnia peace MR ANDRE Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, yesterday appealed to the US to back the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia - and said the Bosnians should have 'no illusions' they would get more help from the international community, including the US, than available under the plan. In Washington, meanwhile, the European Community today will make clear to the US that it continues to give full support to the international mediators' plan for a Bosnian peace settlement. Mr Kozyrev was speaking to the Financial Times after a meeting in Moscow over the weekend with Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the US special envoy for Bosnia. Mr Kozyrev claimed that he had a 'clear understanding' with both Mr Bartholomew and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state. He expected the US to support the Vance-Owen plan 'with only a few corrections, but they must be small corrections'. He was 'cautiously optimistic' that the Vance-Owen plan would soon be put to, and adopted by, the United Nations Security Council. Mr Kozyrev said the virtue of the Vance-Owen plan was that 'it left everyone equally unhappy'. Russian-US-European co-operation on former Yugoslavia has been close and the Russian government has so far backed both sanctions against Serbia and UN intervention. Now, however, Mr Kozyrev is giving a clear signal that an independent effort by the US to elaborate a different strategy would not find support in Moscow. The EC's continued backing for the mediators' plan will be stressed in Washington today by Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish foreign minister, whose country currently holds the EC presidency. Mr Petersen is due to have talks with Mr Christopher after being briefed by the mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, in New York yesterday. The Danish minister said developments since the EC foreign ministers' reaffirmation of their support for the Vance-Owen plan on February 1 had merely confirmed that this was the right formula for dealing with the Bosnian conflict. 'The full and unequivocal support for the Vance-Owen plan is called for,' he said.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Caricom switches stance on Nafta CARIBBEAN Community countries worried about the North American Free Trade Agreement have changed their stance and are to support US President Bill Clinton's efforts to have it implemented. The members of Caricom and several countries in Central America had consistently argued they would lose markets in the US and Canada to Mexico if Nafta was implemented. They feared a more competitive Mexico, with free access to its northern neighbours, would drive Caribbean and Central American products out of the market. The community now says it fully supports the agreement, and it and other countries in the region, 'will have to learn to live with Nafta'. 'The region is committed to Nafta, to the extent that it will support all efforts to have the legislation approved by the US Congress,' said Mr Patrick Manning, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago. Mr Edwin Carrington, the community's secretary general, and the region will continue to support Nafta, providing its concerns are being taken into account. The Caribbean's change of heart comes after the region started lobbying legislators in Washington to consider proposed legislation for transitional arrangements to protect the region's markets from Mexican competition. Caribbean countries are asking US legislators to support proposals for a three-year 'grace period' during which the region's exports to the US and Canada will have parity with Mexican products. The proposal aims at giving them time to negotiate possible membership of Nafta.</p>

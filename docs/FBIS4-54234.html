			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear friends: This morning, Thursday 26 May, the  Ninth National Assembly's Fifth Session opened at the Ba Dinh  Conference Hall in Hanoi. Before the session, the National  Assembly deputies visited the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and laid a  floral wreath.    Attending the opening session were party and state leaders  Do  Muoi, Le Duc Anh, and Vo Van Kiet; Pham Van Dong and Vo Chi  Cong, advisers to the party Central Committee; and many senior  revolutionary cadres. The opening session was also attended by  members of diplomatic corps in Hanoi. After the ceremony to  salute the national flag, National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc  Manh opened the session. He said:    [Begin Nong Duc Manh recording] Today, the Fifth Session of  the SRV's Ninth National Assembly begins its session. On behalf  of the National Assembly Standing Committee, I wholeheartedly  welcome and extend my wishes for the good health of the party  and state leaders, National Assembly deputies, distinguished  guests, members of the diplomatic corps, international friends,  and all people and friends present at this solemn opening  session of the National Assembly. [applause]    Dear National Assembly deputies, in the past few months our  national situation has experienced many positive changes. The  socioeconomy has continued to stabilize and develop, creating  the opportunity to achieve and overfulfill key targets in the  1994 duties outlined in the National Assembly resolutions.  National defense and security have been maintained. Foreign  relations and other areas have been making significant progress.  Many legal documents and resolutions issued by the National  Assembly have been implemented in real life, thereby positively  serving the renovation undertaking.    This is the result of the efforts exerted by our entire  party, people, and Army as well as the implementation of a  foreign policy of openness to increase relations with countries  in the region and expand relations with all the countries of the  world, both near and far. This is also the result of the  efforts exerted by the government, sectors, and echelons in  their concentration on guidance and management for the  successful implementation of targets set by the National  Assembly resolutions.    We still face many difficulties, however, because of the  slow  process of overcoming long-term shortcomings and problems as  well as the higher demands in the new development period. The  new situation requires more and greater efforts on our part to  fulfill the 1994 goals and duties outlined by the National  Assembly resolutions.    The renovation undertaking requires the National Assembly to  accelerate and heighten the quality of its legislative  activities aimed at gradually building a uniform and complete  legal system to serve the undertaking of national construction  and protection effectively, maintain order and discipline, and  truthfully carry out state and social management according to  law. [end recording]    Chairman Nong Duc Manh clearly stated that in this session  the main duty of the National Assembly is to examine and pass  the labor code and five other laws. The five laws are: the  revised law on the organization of people's councils and  people's committees, the revised law on the election of people's  councils, the law on the promotion of domestic investment, the  law to levy a tax on the transfer of land use rights, and the  law to revise and amend some articles of the Law on Military  Obligation. The National Assembly will also offer its views on  the planning of the civil law.    Also in this session, the National Assembly will hear a  government report on the implementation of the National Assembly  resolutions during the first half of this year. It will also  consider supplementary government reports on the implementation  of the National Assembly resolution on practicing thrift and  fighting waste, corruption, and smuggling; the allocation and  execution of the state budget for 1994; the situation regarding  foreign investment in Vietnam and the effectiveness of using  investment capital; and our government's foreign relations  activities during the first half of this year.    The National Assembly will examine reports by the National  Assembly Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, the  Supreme People's Organ of Control, the Nationality Committee,  and other National Assembly committees on their activities  during the first half of 1994.    On the basis of those reports, the National Assembly will  discuss, analyze, and correctly evaluate the true national  situation from the beginning of this year to the present in  order to determine effective lines and measures to continue the  successful execution of its duties in the second half of 1994.    In response to the state president, the National Assembly  will consider and approve the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of  the Sea. It will also consider, discuss, and decide on some  other important issues.    Lastly, National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh said:    [Begin Nong Duc Manh recording] Dear National Assembly  deputies, the Ninth National Assembly's Fifth Session is opening  at a time when people throughout the country are  enthusiastically welcoming major national anniversaries in the  1994-95 period. Recently, our compatriots countrywide jubilantly  marked the 40th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu victory. This  provided an occasion for our compatriots at home and abroad to  review our glorious national history, uphold the national  tradition of unsubmissiveness, further consolidate the universal  solidarity bloc, and continue to take the renovation process to  a higher stage of development. We also marked the 104th  birthday of the great Uncle Ho. Once again, our compatriots and  combatants nationwide became even more profoundly aware of Uncle  Ho's distinguished services. Let us be determined to follow the  socialist path chosen by our party, people, and Uncle Ho.    The resolutions of the seventh party congress and the  midterm  national party congress entrusted our entire party and people  with new and important tasks. Let us grasp all advantages,  overcome all dangers, and do all we can to serve the cause of  national construction and defense and the task of making the  people rich and the country powerful, as well as of bringing  about social justice and civilization.    In view of the new situation, and as members of the  highest-level organ of power, National Assembly deputies have a  very heavy duty to fulfill; namely, building a law-governed  Vietnamese state that truly belongs to, comes from, and works  for the people. Acting in line with that spirit, I solemnly  suggest that National Assembly deputies develop democracy,  contribute views, seek solutions, and suggest ways to carry out  the agenda of the National Assembly successfully.    I would like to declare the Fifth Session of the SRV's Ninth  National Assembly open. I wish the session success. Thank you,  comrades and deputies. [applause] [end recording]    Dear friends, following Nong Duc Manh's opening speech to  the  National Assembly, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai delivered  a report on behalf of the government and the prime minister on  the fulfillment of the tasks for the first six months of 1994 as  set forth by the National Assembly's resolutions, and on a  number of important issues that need to be resolved in the days  ahead to implement successfully the National Assembly's  resolutions on the tasks for 1994. In evaluating the current  situation, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai pointed out the  following four outstanding traits:    1. The tempo of economic and financial growth of previous  years continued to be maintained and developed in the first six  months of 1994, thus producing relatively good progress in  production, goods circulation, finance, money, and external  economic relations. The growth rate than that of the same  period in previous years.    2. Along with economic growth and an increase in the income  of the vast majority of the population, cultural and social  activities also made marked progress.    3. Our country's diplomatic relations continued to be  broadened and strengthened in accordance with the need for  multilateralization and diversification.    4. Changes for the better were made in the direction and  supervision of the state management system.    Regarding the first outstanding trait, Deputy Prime Minister  Phan Van Khai said:    [Begin Phan Van Khai recording] The fine economic and  financial achievements of the past several years continued to be  maintained and developed in the first six months of 1994, thus  producing relatively good progress in production, goods  circulation, finance, money, and external economic relations.  The growth rate was higher than the same period in previous  years. It is expected that the winter-spring grain output will  reach a record volume of 1 million tons more than last year, an  increase of 10 percent. The rural economy continued to show an  increase in industrial and special crop yields as well as in the  development of animal husbandry, aquaculture, and  non-agricultural occupations. Industrial output in the first  six months of the year increased by 12 percent over the same  period last year. The target set for the whole year was 11  percent.    With the relatively harmonious development of various  economic elements, cities, and industrial centers, a number of  major electrical power and transport projects have been  completed and put in use. These include the last group of  generators of the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Plant, the electrical  power plant in Ba Ria, the 220-kilovolt power grid of Ba  Ria-Long Binh, the road section from North Thang Long to Noi  Bai, and so forth,    The most significant project, the 500-kilovolt power grid,  has been completed on schedule following two years of  construction despite countless difficulties and obstacles. It  reflects a high level of effort by all parties involved to  ensure stable and safe operations. Experimental operation  started on 20 May and the network will be officially switched on  by early June to carry electricity from north to south, an  indication of mutual development in the national economy and  people's lives.    The increase in export value was estimated at 27 percent;  the  target was 20 percent. Import value increased by 23.4 percent.  The amount of official development aid, or ODA, signed in the  first quarter of this year nearly doubled compared to all of  1993. Direct foreign investment projects licensed in the first  six months may reach a total of $2 billion in registered  capital, or two-thirds of all of last year. The amount of  capital actually put in use increased by 60 percent over the  same period last year.    Total retail merchandise sales were estimated to increase by  37.6 percent to respond to the diversified demands of the  people, who now have better incomes and purchasing power. The  transportation of goods and passengers, services for domestic  and international tourists, and other services have proceeded to  new heights. The retail sales index of goods and service for  the first four months of the year increased by 5.4 percent,  mainly due to an increase in the price of food staples during  the Tet festival. Prices have returned to normal since March.    According to reports from the Statistics General Department,  the consumer goods index in May 1994 increased by 0.6 percent  over April; food staples increased by 1.1 percent, non-food  goods by 0.2 percent, and services by 0.4 percent. If we  compare May 1994 with December 1993, the price index has  increased by 6 percent; food staples have increased by 11.1  percent, other goods by 1 percent, and services by 5.9 percent.  In short, prices this year increased more rapidly than the same  period last year, though the increase mainly affected food  staples, a trend that suits the government's policy of not  letting the price of food staples fall too low.    Domestic budget expenditures were planned to increase by 50  percent over the same period last year. The annual increase was  planned at 31.5 percent. Phase two of the new wage policy,  which would introduce an increase of 25 percent to the wage  fund, has been developed since early this year in a way that  will not cause sudden changes in prices or strain the cash flow,  and will ensure smooth monetary circulation. The exchange rates  and gold price did not suffer any sudden fluctuations. The  credit system was significantly expanded, and the balance  surplus was estimated to increase by 23 percent over late 1993.    The rate of credit loans to the non-state sector -- mainly  to  farming households -- increased from 30 percent in 1993 to 40  percent in first half of this year. [end recording]    In the second part of his report, Deputy Prime Minister Phan  Van Khai outlined the major tasks that need intensive guidance  in the last six months of the year. These tasks are:    1. To continue to maintain a healthy and stable financial  and monetary market with the main aim of balancing the budget.    2. To ensure the constant progress of major projects and  create conditions to increase investment in various economic  sectors.    3. To expand external relations and external economic  activities.    4. To continue to implement the National Assembly  resolution on practicing thrift and fighting waste, corruption,  and smuggling.    5. To widen and improve the efficiency of scientific,  educational, cultural, and social activities.    6. To speed up economic reform in tandem with  administration reform.    In the last part of his report, Deputy Prime Minister Phan  Van Khai commented that after the first half of 1994, reality  clearly shows that opportunities and risks are entangled. This  requires new actions for a new stage of development.    Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai affirmed:    [Begin Phan Van Khai recording] As a result of good  socioeconomic development, the cultural and physical lives of  our people have been improved to a higher level. The vitality  of the society has been enhanced, as demonstrated by the strong  progress of many business establishments, entrepreneurs, and  families in both urban and rural regions and plains and highland  regions. This strength can be further developed along with the  wider and more in-depth continuation of renovation, the most  concrete task of which is to combine economic reform with  administration reform. This is the foundation for the effective  motivation of all outside sources.    In the new situation, the implementation of the policy of  the  great national unity bloc will reach a higher level of  importance, with a concrete step being the upcoming conference  of the Vietnam Fatherland Front. This conference will motivate  the talents and manpower sources of all Vietnamese -- domestic  and overseas alike -- to contribute to the undertaking of  building the fatherland. It will surely bring great potential  toward accomplishing the objectives of a rich people, powerful  country, and equitable and civilized society.    The government, National Assembly, Fatherland Front, and  other mass organizations should endeavor in their positions and  responsibilities to organize, encourage, guide, and help the  people strive to fulfill and exceed all targets and duties for  1994 as stipulated by the resolutions of the National Assembly,  thus preparing well for 1995 and later years. [end recording]    Dear friends, after listening to the government report, the  National Assembly continued its work and heard the following  reports:    -- Tran Dinh Hoan, minister of labor, war invalids, and  social welfare, read a report on behalf of the government on the  draft labor code.    -- Bui Ngoc Thanh, vice chairman of the National  Assembly's Committee for Social Issues, read an investigative  report on the draft labor code.    -- Finance Minister Ho Te read a report on behalf of the  government on the draft law on land use transfer tax.    -- Tran Van Nhan, vice chairman of the National Assembly's  Economic and Budget Committee, read an investigative report on  the draft law on land use transfer tax.    This afternoon, the National Assembly deputies met for group  discussions to prepare for the plenary discussion on the draft  labor code.    The National Assembly will resume its work in the conference  hall tomorrow morning.</p>

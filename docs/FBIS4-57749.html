			<p>BFN     [Text] San Carlos de Bariloche 20 May (NA) -- The Fourth  Ibero-American Congress closed its debates today with the  reading of the final recommendations from each of the four  commissions in which the congress was divided.    The commissions debated the following topics: Commission No.  1, state reform; Commission No. 2, community law; Commission No.  3, the three rights and freedoms of the individual; and  Commission No. 4, technological compatibility.    Commission No. 1 recommended that the region's governments  "should establish the dissemination of information through data  transmission networks in the fields of education, science and  technology, economy, health, and justice, thus favoring the  Ibero-American integration process."    In the political-judicial aspect, it recommends "the need to  promote an overall plan for judicial reform, including the  development of its overall conversion to data processing, and it  also must contemplate an adequate training of judicial branch  magistrates, officials, and employees."    It also suggests that it would be convenient to "create a  permanent development and integration center within the  administration of justice to apply new technologies with the  objective of obtaining, classifying, storing, and disseminating  its facts."    The commission that debated community law discussed "the  scope of the flow of data that crosses borders in relation to  the rights of the citizen." In this respect, the commission  stated: "International agreements must attune their ideas to  prevent unequal legislation in the member countries from  stopping the inappropriate use of technical practices, thus  compromising the fundamental rights of the individual."    It is recommended that "a community right that contemplates  the problems of data processing should be quickly implemented"  within the framework of the Common Market of the South and other  integration systems.    Regarding the rights and freedoms of the individual, it has  been proposed that "the rights and freedoms of the individual be  protected against the bad use and abuse of data processing when  applied to the use of data, thus guaranteeing human dignity."    It also has been recommended that "self-determination  regarding information, when it is understood as the right of the  individual to control the inclusion and processing of his  personal data in data banks and its dissemination, will be  legislated through an express constitutional norm as a  fundamental right in order to preserve the individual's  identity, dignity, and freedom."    To this effect, it was suggested that "specific legislation  be approved to regulate, in an overall manner, this right to  self-determination regarding information."    Regarding ethics, the need was proposed "for formulating  ethical rules of conduct that will include respect for the  dignity, identity, freedom, and security of the human being, and  a spirit of cooperation between the world's nations with the  intention of helping the less developed countries have access to  knowledge in electronic technology regarding information and  communication."    The recommendation in the field of education points to the  "incorporation of the tools that offer new technologies in the  dealing of information in the educational and research processes  at all levels in Ibero-American countries."    Finally, Commission No. 4, harmonizing of technology,  proposes that "training be given every privilege and that  universities be given a more active role, including the  generation of interdisciplinary development and the  strengthening of research as a service to the community."    It has also been recommended that "computers must be made  easier to use if there is the intention of seeking solutions to  help with the work of all persons who use computers because it  is not possible to readapt the tasks on the basis of  technological solutions if certain users cannot use that  technology."    Some 402 legal experts and specialists from Latin American  countries, the United States, Spain, France, Italy, and Belgium  participated in the congress.</p>

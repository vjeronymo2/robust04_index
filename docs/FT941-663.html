			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Volvo to ask shareholders to alter terms of bid for BCP Volvo, Sweden's biggest manufacturer, yesterday faced more fallout from the collapse of its merger with France's Renault. It was in the awkward position of having to put to its shareholders terms for the full takeover of a subsidiary company which it believes are too generous. The dilemma concerns the consumer products group BCP, which Volvo last year agreed to take over in a deal with the government on the break-up of Procordia - jointly controlled by Volvo and the state. Procordia was split into BCP and Pharmacia, a pharmaceuticals company still controlled by the government. Taking over BCP, a strongly profitable company, and holding a residual 25 per cent shareholding in Pharmacia were two key elements in a plan by former Volvo chairman Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar to build a diversified Volvo following the merger of its car and truck operations with Renault. The new Volvo board is committed to the BCP and Pharmacia investments, despite the collapse of the Renault deal. But it wants to change the terms of its bid for the 26 per cent of BCP that it does not already hold because a surge in Volvo's share price of more than SKr200 since the Renault merger was scrapped has left it open to paying almost 50 per cent more than it intended when it made the bid last October. In the first of three alternatives, Volvo offered one new Volvo share for six BCP shares, valuing BCP shares at SKr71 each. The same offer now values BCP shares at SKr104 each, which one Volvo executive described as 'definitely too generous'. The original cash alternative was set as low as SKr47 per BCP share. These terms were never voted on by Volvo shareholders because they were to have been put to the same emergency meeting planned to vote on the Renault merger. That meeting never took place. But the Swedish Securities Council has ruled that Volvo must present the original terms to its shareholders at next month's annual meeting. The new Volvo board will, therefore, be putting a proposal formulated by the old board to their shareholders - and hoping it will be rejected so a new bid for BCP can be formulated. Volvo also announced a five-for-one share split yesterday.</p>

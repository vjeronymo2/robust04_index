			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The messiah of bounce who makes his disciples jump - Keith Wheatley meets the former fish farmer putting a new spring into the British way of leisure IN SPITE of the success of Neighbours, there remains a fault-line difference between how the young of Australia and Britain experience childhood. A trampoline in the garden is the birthright of every young Aussie. Rugged and cheap, they help pass weekends and school holidays until Bruce is old enough for a driving licence. In the UK, however, trampolines are seldom found outside schools and sports clubs. Gradually, the situation is changing, thanks to former trout farmer Chris Prentis and his company, Supertramp. This year, it will sell garden trampolines worth Pounds 225,000 at prices ranging from Pounds 139 to Pounds 1,299 for the biggest Super-Kangaroo model. As the name might suggest, Australia figures large in the genesis of this business. In 1984, Prentis returned to England after a spell farming in Western Australia. He had three young daughters who missed not so much the Wide Brown Land as a daily bounce on their own trampoline. 'I couldn't believe it but there wasn't a company in the UK that could sell us a simple, weather-proof trampoline to keep out in the garden,' recalls Prentis. 'We were in the early days of creating a trout farm, but I designed and had built about half a dozen trampolines. I sold them a via a free ad in a farming magazine. We did incredibly un-businesslike things such as driving one right up to North Yorkshire ourselves when we had a customer there.' Nowadays, Supertramp's customer base extends from Argentina to Senegal and there are no more personal deliveries. Building trampolines from locally-sourced components was Prentis's first - and avowedly last - experience of British industry. 'When we wanted springs, we sent a sample and said 'Like this, please.' But 70 per cent were unusable.' Had Supertramp stuck with local manufacture and assembly, the business would never have got past being another kitchen-table hobby. The account books from that period show trampolines as just another column in the farm sales ledger, next to smoked trout pate and whole fish. What convinced Prentis he was on the track of something worthwhile was the reaction of every customer - and their friends - once they had seen a trampoline in action. 'There's always a problem marketing an unknown product - and the garden trampoline bears little relation in use to the item that people reluctantly encountered in the gym when they were at school,' explains Prentis, a down-to-earth countryman in his late 40s and an unlikely messiah of bounce. 'But everyone who's had one at home for a week knows that their kids would never give it up.' Five years ago, he discovered a Queensland firm that would supply flatpack trampolines, albeit in full container loads. This was the turning point for Supertramp. Prentis family cars were expelled from the barn as hundreds of Action Goliaths were unloaded and stacked in the medieval gloom. The business has never had any specific capitalisation, evolving out of the general farm trading overdraft of around Pounds 70,000. Initially, the need to provide substantial letters of credit two or three times a year to finance a container load of trampolines meant individual negotiation with the local high street bank, but these transactions have become regular enough now to be subsumed into the general trading account. One question that remains unsolved is how best to market and promote the product. Prentis says he has no budget for a big advertising campaign, although a weekly classified in Exchange &amp; Mart continues to pay dividends. 'The British people don't grab hold of new ideas with any significant enthusiasm,' he says. This meant it paid to have entry-level models at only a couple of hundred pounds as well as the bigger versions at around Pounds 1,000. Demonstrations at county shows and country fairs proved a strong marketing ploy, although enormously time-consuming for a man who was also trying to catch and smoke trout from two lakes outside his home. A display troupe was formed and toured England in an old coach bearing the conspicuous sign Supertramp - thus starting rumours a few years ago that the rock group of that name had retired and taken up fish farming in Devon. 'Initially, we thought we just had to give demonstrations, but gradually we realised that we had to be part of the entertainment and that letting people pay and spend five minutes bouncing was the answer,' explains Prentis. Although shows are fewer in number now, they still provide great visibility and a big sales peak in the weeks immediately afterwards. By 1988, the trampolines' column in the ledger had begun to eclipse the trout sales, so Prentis decided to close the fish operation in the spring of 1989 after a winter nearly devoid of essential rain. 'We were selling all we could produce, but the operation was just too small to create enough turnover for more than a proprietor doing all the work. Anyway, I wanted to spend time on the trampolines.' Supertramp has just two full-time employees, Prentis and an office administrator, with warehouse and marketing staff brought in as necessary. The company has yet to report a profit, although the owner says it could if he were to change the policy of directing all spare resources at the search for market growth. There are encouraging signs from agents in Italy and the Netherlands, as well as a network of 200 sport shop agents in the UK. 'Talk about green. We didn't know anything about trampolines or the leisure business,' laughs Prentis as he looks back. 'All businesses are a voyage of discovery. Do you reach the golden fleece before you come unglued at the bank?' Supertramp, Langlands, Uffculme, Devon EX15 3DA. Tel: 0884-841-305. Fax: 0884-841-319.</p>

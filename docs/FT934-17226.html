			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The London Metal Exchange COPPER market was attempting yesterday afternoon to find a consolidation level after falling earlier to six-year lows. The three months delivery price touched bottom at Dollars 1,665 a tonne before being steadied by a short-covering rally and some expected technical buying. But it was still showing a loss on the day of Dollars 36 when it ended after hours trading at Dollars 1,683.50 a tonne, Dollars 89 down from the end of last week. Analysts said the end of the technical squeeze recently meant that the market could no longer ignore oversupply, which would take some time to remedy, as few producers were prepared to cut output. The three months ZINC price leapt to a high of Dollars 906 a tonne in the morning, encouraged by talk of possible output cuts in North America. But by the close no news had emerged and the price was back at Dollars 886 a tonne, down 50 cents on the day. NICKEL sentiment remained poor and as latest Russian forecasts suggested this year's production decline would not be as large as originally thought prices slumped to fresh 6 3/4 -year lows. COFFEE prices fell further before finding industry and trade support. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>-- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY  <F P=103> OW2105190794 </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> BFN     [Text] On 19 May, a Foreign Ministry source said the UK  has asked Japan through diplomatic channels to stop extending  yen loans to Iran. Japan resumed yen loan programs to Iran  starting in May 1993. The UK has made the request for reasons  such as Iran's support for terrorist activities conducted by  radical groups that advocate Islamic Fundamentalism.    The UK is the second nation, following the United States, to  ask Japan to stop extending yen loans to Iran. The Japanese  Government has judged that it has become increasingly likely  that the Iranian issue will be a key topic at the July Naples  summit. It has therefore made firm its plan to stop extending  yen loans to Iran for this year, tentatively until the  conclusion of the Naples summit.    However, depending on the outcome of the Naples summit, it  can be expected that the government may face further difficulty  regarding the second phase of yen loans to Iran. The government  is likely to be pressed to make a difficult political decision  on whether or not to continue extending yen loans to Iran.</p>

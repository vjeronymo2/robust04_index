			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with V. Hruzdeyev, administrative head, Ministry </F> of Agriculture and Food, by B. Polishchuk, correspondent: "Let's  Honor and Respect Spring Wheat"]    [Text]    [Polishchuk] Have the predictions regarding the need to  resow  winter wheat over considerable areas been confirmed?    [Hruzdyevev] Yes, they have. We must resow winter wheat on  2,300,000 hectares and perform supplementary sowing on 339,000  hectares. That represents one-third of the areas involved.    [Polishchuk] And how does that compare with last year?    [Hruzdeyev] Twice as many tracts were dropped as occurred  last. This is particularly true in Nikolayev, Odessa, and  Kherson oblasts, where 45-63 percent of the appropriate areas  must be resown in winter wheat. At many sites it did not sprout  during the autumn because of the drought, or it was damaged by  frosts, as was also the case in the Sumy, Poltava, Zaporozhye,  Kharkov, Donets, and Crimean regions.    [Polishchuk] With what crops do you plan to resow?    [Hruzdeyev] Basically with barley, oats, peas, corn, millet,  rye, and sorghum. Such operations are already widely underway in  the southern oblasts.    [Polishchuk] Viktor Hryhorovych, at the very beginning of  spring last year our newspaper brought up the matter of the  underestimation for extreme situations of spring wheat as an  insurance crop. It was a matter of expanding the areas to be  sown in that crop in a year of mass resowings so as to  compensate in case there was a shortage of grain for making  bread and pasta-type products. Was there some movement in this  regard?    [Hruzdeyev] There was. This past year more than 22,000  hectares were sown in spring wheat.    [Polishchuk] This year--as they say--even God has commanded  that the grain reserves be filled to overflowing.    [Hruzdeyev] Yes. There is a clearly manifested tendency to  expand the area sown in spring wheat. Whereas formerly there  were some farmers who were quite dissatisfied with its varieties  because of a low crop yield, nowadays there are several  varieties of spring wheat which have a high yield. Among these  are, for example, Kharkov-15, Kharkov-16, Kharkov-37, and a  number of others. In testing fields they have produced 45-50  quintals of grain per hectare.    [Polishchuk] Does Ukraine have a large enough supply of  spring wheat seeds for the present sowing?    [Hruzdeyev] There are enough seeds to sow this crop over a  larger area than last year. They are kept principally in state  reserves and in the system of seed farms under the Institute of  Vegetation, Plant Breeding, and Genetics imeni V. Yuryev, which  is located in Kharkov. A certain quantity of such seeds could be  made available subsequently by the Ukrayina Experimental Farm,  which is located in the Myronivskyy Rayon in the Kiev Region.  Its farms, which were already engaged in studying spring wheat  last year, now have these seeds.    It's important to bear in mind that the value of spring  wheat  consists not merely in filling up the grain reserves when and if  there is a reduction in the area sown in winter wheat. At  present spring wheat seeds are also valuable--so to speak--as a  kind of national currency. At one time Ukraine's services, in  particular, those of the Kharkov plant-breeders, were utilized  to good advantage by entire regions of the former Soviet Union.  With the latter's disintegration, the demand for spring wheat  seeds at first declined, but now it is abruptly increasing.  There are many requests from the near abroad. If we had enough  of these seeds, we would not have to beg for fuel. We could  exchange one commodity for the other.    [Polishchuk] And so we ought to apologize to spring wheat  and  accord it the honor and respect that it has come to deserve. Is  that what you mean?    [Hruzdeyev] I certainly do. We have to calculate everything  and not give in to extremes. If we do, the mistakes we make  could take years to overcome.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: Foreign investors watch Seoul surge - The Emerging Investor Foreign investors wanting to enter the Seoul bourse could only watch in frustration last week as the general share index reached its historical high of 1023.61 on Saturday. A 10 per cent ceiling on foreign stock investments in listed companies has largely kept new overseas investors out of the market since the quota was quickly filled for the most attractive shares after the market was opened to foreigners in January 1992. Ironically, the expectation that the government would soon raise the foreign ownership limit to 12 per cent has caused the recent surge in share prices as domestic investors bought blue-chip stocks in anticipation that they would rise further once the ceiling is raised and more foreign capital flows into the market. There is little doubt that there is plenty of pent-up foreign capital waiting to be released into the Korean market. The Seoul bourse 'has great potential because it is undervalued. Korea didn't go ballistic as other Asian markets did last year,' said Mr Gareth Evans, branch manager for Barings Securities in Seoul. The country's economic fundamentals are also strong, with GNP expected to grow by at least 8 per cent this year because of an export boom aided by a weak Korean currency. Companies reported their best first-half earnings in seven years, with a 70.6 per cent rise in aggregate net profits for listed companies. Analysts predict that the share index could reach 1,100 by the end of the year. But there are doubts over whether the government will adhere to its promise to raise the limit to an expected 12 per cent by December and 15 per cent by next June. The government is worried that more foreign capital inflows will increase inflationary pressure when inflation is already expected to rise above the government's target of 6 per cent for this year. In addition, Korean companies fear that a new influx of foreign capital will cause an appreciation of the Korean won, which would dampen exports. Raising the foreign ownership ceiling would also contradict the government's current policy of preventing the stock market from overheating. Officials have repeatedly tried to cool down the market this year because of concerns that domestic investors would eventually cash in on their gains and then spend the money, which would contribute to inflation. During the past week, the government tried to intervene in the market and depress prices by ordering the country's three investment trust companies to sell shares. But this strategy is proving futile since these institutional funds 'have less and less of the blue-chip stocks that are leading the rally,' said Mr Bruno Leroy, head of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull in Seoul. Another factor that has supported scepticism about the government's promise about a foreign limit increase is that the pledge was made in June by Mr Hong Hae-hyong, the finance minister, when the market was falling as foreign investors pulled out because of the tensions over the North Korean nuclear dispute. The government has often floated proposals about a rise in the foreign ceiling to bolster market confidence during weak periods, but then it has fallen silent after share prices gained strength. Most foreign brokers in Seoul, however, believe that the government this time will stick to its commitment and proceed with a rise in the limit. 'Time is running short for South Korea if it wants to meet its deadline and join the OECD by 1996,' explained Mr Leroy. 'Membership conditions are likely to include increasing the foreign ownership ceiling to 25 per cent.' However, it is not ruled out that the government may try to attach other conditions to control foreign investment inflows if the ceiling is raised. One possibility is to increase advanced deposit requirements for foreign investors to 40 per cent of their buy orders from the current level of 20 per cent. Foreign securities houses have complained about the measure, introduced in January as part of the government's market cooling efforts, because it has created legal problems for US investors, who are barred from making deposits under SEC rules, and delayed carrying out buy orders for other foreign investors. Moreover, the government has suggested that it may set a monetary ceiling on foreign capital inflow for stock investments that could prevent the ceiling increase from being completely filled. There are also doubts as to whether the government will accept the recommendations of an advisory panel on financial liberalisation, which suggested that the foreign ownership ceiling be abolished by 1999. Korea has been extremely reluctant to allow the foreign takeover of its companies and this attitude is unlikely to change. Meanwhile, foreign investors eager to acquire Korean blue-chip stocks trade on the informal over the counter market, where they must pay premiums ranging from 10 per cent up to 75 per cent. Another means of acquiring Korean securities is through the overseas issuance of equity-linked convertible bonds. But the ministry of finance has banned Korean corporations from issuing overseas bonds during the fourth quarter because the Dollars 1.25bn limit set by the government for such issues this year has already been reached. An exception, to the ban, however, was the government's decision on Friday to allow Pohang Iron and Steel and Korea Electric Power to become the first Korean companies to be listed on New York Stock Exchange as of next month. Nine other Korean companies believed to be qualified for the New York stock exchange could be listed as early as next year.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Ten best performing stocks  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Friday   Week on week change Stock                    Country    16/9/94    Dollars       %  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Compania Suzano (Pfd)    Brazil      7.3598     1.6127   28.06 Cherat Cement Co.

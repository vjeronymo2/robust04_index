			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DID BAD BOY BART MAKE BILL COSBY CHANGE HIS SHOW? 'NO WAY MAN!!!'  </P> <P> Bill Cosby was wearing a Bart Simpson T-shirt with the radical dude saying "Yo,  Bill!" when he was asked if upcoming changes in "The Cosby Show" are a response  to competition from "The Simpsons."  </P> <P> "All of the changes were made B.B. -- Before Bart," Cosby told Entertainment  Weekly in an interview being published next week.  </P> <P> The magazine cover features Cosby wearing the Bart shirt.  </P> <P> Fox TV's runaway hit "The Simpsons" has moved from Sunday nights to Thursday,  challenging NBC's top-rated "The Cosby Show," in a Bart vs. Bill match-up as  TV's top pop prepares to battle the smart-aleck Bart Simpson. Both air tonight  at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> The shows will be programmed head to head for the first time tonight, although  they are both reruns. "The Cosby Show" starts its new shows in September, a  full month before Fox will have new offerings of "The Simpsons."  </P> <P> Does Cosby feel pressured? In his own conversational style, he seems critical  of Fox.  </P> <P> "TV should be moving in a direction from the Huxtables forward, not backward,"  Cosby said. "The mean-spirited and cruel think this (the screwed-up Fox  families like the bewildered Simpsons and the bitter Bundys of "Married . . .  With Children") is 'the edge,' and their excuse is, that's the way people are  today. But why should we be entertained by that?" he asks.  </P> <P> Cosby said he's changing "The Cosby Show," re-energizing it with nine new  writers, as a matter of principle.  </P> <P> "I'm working harder and enjoying it more. And whether the audience is there in  the numbers or not, I am proud of what we've done," Cosby said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAY LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FULLERTON'S OLSEN HITS RECORD 13TH HOMER  </P> <P> Catcher D.C. Olsen of Fullerton High School hit his 13th home run to set an  Orange County single-season record in Fullerton's 6-1 Freeway League victory  over host Troy Thursday.  </P> <P> The junior hit a three-run homer over the left-center field fence off Troy  starter Robbie Williams to break Andy Ruscitto's mark of 12, set in 1986 for  Valencia.  </P> <P> Olsen, who had gone four games without a homer, now has 18 home runs in his  high school career and is four shy of the county career mark of 22. That was  set by Ruscitto from 1984-86 and tied by Lance Marks of Dana Hills this season.  </P> <P> "I was so relieved when I saw the ball go out," Olsen said. "I've been really  pressing the last two weeks, but I found out you can't hit a homer whenever you  want, so I just came in today relaxed and looked to hit the ball hard."  </P> <P> Olsen's record was soon in jeopardy because teammate Bobby Patel had two homers  through five innings, giving him 12 for the season. But Patel struck out in his  final at-bat.  </P> <P> "I was really pulling for Bobby to tie me," Olsen said. "It would have been  great for both of us to share a record like that in the same season."  </P> <P> Olsen's homer was his only hit of the game and left him one hit shy of the  county's single-season record of 51 set in 1985 by Los Alamitos' Robbie  Katzaroff.  </P> <P> Olsen claimed the county's best-ever season batting average, finishing at .595.  Steve Evans of Anaheim set the old mark of .585 in 1980.  </P> <P> Nearly lost in the record-setting was the two-hit pitching of Fullerton's Rene  Arias. Arias (8-3) allowed only a double to the first hitter he faced, Steve  Freidrich, and a fourth-inning leadoff homer to Matt Carter.  </P> <P> Fullerton (13-12 overall, 7-8 in league play) stopped Troy's 10-game winning  streak, but Troy (14-9, 11-4) had previously clinched the league title.  </P> <P> In another Freeway League game:  </P> <P> Sunny Hills 10, Sonora 1 -- Chris Looney pitched a five-hitter, striking out  nine, to lead Sunny Hills (15-11, 10-5) at Sonora (12-12, 7-8). Jason Sugarman  had three hits, including a two-run home run in the sixth inning, and Kenny  Overby had two hits, including a two-run home run in the seventh inning. Steve  Ashton had three hits, scored twice and had one RBI for Sunny Hills. KEN HILL  </P></p>

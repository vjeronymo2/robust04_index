			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: ANALYZING DIETARY LINKS TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE  </P> <P> You're introduced to someone new, but before you complete the handshake you've  forgotten her name. Or you spend a good part of your day searching for "lost"  items -- car keys, eyeglasses, a pen. All of us experience occasional lapses of  memory and may joke that we're "getting Alzheimer's." In most cases we simply  haven't been paying attention and focusing on the task at hand.  </P> <P> But for the million or more victims of Alzheimer's disease in the United States  and their families, this condition is no laughing matter, and it involves a  great deal more than just inattention.  </P> <P> Alzheimer's is a progressive neurological disorder in which nerve pathways that  carry messages within the brain become tangled and blocked by plaques. The  production of certain chemicals, known as neurotransmitters, used by nerve  cells to communicate with each other, is reduced. When normal nerve signals  can't be relayed, depression, delusions, agitation, weight loss and changes in  memory, may result.  </P> <P> Although more prevalent in older people, Alzheimer's is sometimes seen in  persons younger than 50. Since it frequently occurs in families and in those  with Down's syndrome who live past 40, a genetic component is suspected.  </P> <P> Fear of the enormous physical and psychological toll that this disease exacts  has spawned numerous nutrition practices that claim to help prevent onset or  minimize symptoms. One compound that has received attention is choline.  Contrary to some claims, choline is not a vitamin for humans under normal  circumstances. Our livers are able to make enough to meet our needs. Additional  choline is also found in foods such as milk, egg yolks, dried beans and peas,  and foods containing lecithin.  </P> <P> As its name suggests, choline is a component of the neurotransmitter  acetcylcholine, as well as of certain cell structures, so it's not absurd to  speculate that supplements might help reduce symptoms of Alzheimer's.  Unfortunately, most research shows that supplementing the diets of Alzheimer's  patients with either choline or lecithin produces scant improvement in memory  and may aggravate depression.  </P> <P> While many persons fearful of Alzheimer's have been popping choline and  lecithin supplements, others have been attempting to purge their diets of the  mineral aluminum. Humans have no known nutritional requirement for aluminum.  But as the third most common element in the earth's crust, it is widely  available in most grains and vegetables and in drinking water, with small  quantities occurring in animal products.  </P> <P> Aluminum-containing compounds are often used as food additives and may be found  in food colorings and certain brands of salt and baking powder. Aluminum foil  and cookware may also serve as sources of aluminum in food, although in most  cases the aluminum contamination is minimal. Larger quantities may leach into  food when tomato dishes such as spaghetti sauce or chili are simmered for hours  in aluminum pots -- although the total amount the food might contain still  remains low.  </P> <P> For some, the greatest source of aluminum may be aluminum-containing antacids  and buffered pain relievers, which may provide 50 times the amount obtained  from foods. Still, most evidence suggests that healthy people generally can  eliminate most dietary aluminum long before toxic effects set in.  </P> <P> The real concern shouldn't be how much aluminum we consume but rather if it is  contributing to Alzheimer's disease. Here the evidence is incomplete.  </P> <P> Researchers have shown that high levels of aluminum in the blood can accumulate  in the brain, producing a type of encephalopathy, or brain disorder. Recently,  this type of condition has been seen in kidney patients receiving  aluminum-containing antacids to help prevent bone disease. In the past, kidney  patients undergoing dialysis, a procedure that mimics the role of kidneys by  cleansing the blood of wastes, were at risk since the dialysis process also  contaminated the blood with aluminum. In this case, when the kidneys are  impaired, aluminum clearly produces toxic effects.  </P> <P> But analysis of brains of Alzheimer's victims for aluminum accumulation has  produced conflicting results. While some researchers have found high amounts of  aluminum in the characteristic nerve tangles, this finding has been disputed.  And even if scientists were confident that brain aluminum levels are elevated  in Alzheimer's, no one knows which comes first, high aluminum or the disease.  </P> <P> Some suspect that the degenerative changes taking place within the nerve cells  of Alzheimer's patients actually promote aluminum buildup in the cells. Others  speculate that aluminum may be involved in plaque development, since  aluminum-containing compounds have been found at the core of these plaques, or  that aluminum somehow contributes to the nerve-cell snarls. Obviously, more  research is needed before the precise role of aluminum in Alzheimer's can be  determined.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, you might wonder what you should do about aluminum cookware. The  answer is, cook with it. And as always, cook nutritious wholesome foods. If  you're really convinced your memory is slipping, see a doctor. But for most of  us, forgetting at least part of what we should remember is a normal feature of  everyday life.  </P> <P> Question: I suffer terribly from stomach gas shortly after I eat. Are there any  dietary steps I can take to help control it?  </P> <P> Answer: The biggest culprits include large, calorie-laden meals, and fatty  foods in particular, since they slow the rate at which foods leave the stomach.  Carbonated beverages and chewing gum are also better set aside. In addition to  all the other problems it causes, smoking is linked to increased air swallowing  and gas production. If you've experienced symptoms commonly referred to as  "heartburn," avoid fatty foods, alcohol, chocolate and pepper.  </P> <P> You might also find some relief by modifying your eating behavior. If you tend  to be a rapid eater, slow down. And while it's important to drink plenty of  fluids, limit the amount with which you wash down food.  </P> <P> Medications are sometimes used to reduce carbon dioxide production, but this is  something you should discuss with a doctor.  </P> <P> Q: Is there any evidence that development of diabetes is influenced by either  the composition of the diet or levels of physical activity, or by some  combination of the two?  </P> <P> A: Studies have failed to find a consistent link between the composition of the  diet and diabetes development. In part, this may be explained by the difficulty  in obtaining accurate dietary information. Beyond that, unfortunately, many of  the studies that have explored the question have failed to take into account  the numerous other factors that could explain differences in incidence of  diabetes between two populations or within subgroups of the same population.  </P> <P> When it comes to physical activity, the picture is really no less certain,  although such a relationship is biologically plausible. It's clear that  exercise can modify the body's short-term ability to handle glucose and blood  sugar. But there is only sparse and inconsistent evidence that long-term lack  of exercise increases the risk of adult-onset diabetes.  </P> <P> There are many reasons to argue for both a prudent diet -- rich in complex  carbohydrates, low in fat, salt and sugar -- and for regular physical activity.  But the question as to whether these measures can reduce the risk of  adult-onset diabetes requires further research.  </P> <P> Q: My daughter joined her high school swim team last semester. When I took her  to the doctor, he discovered that she was anemic. Can the strenuous exercise  also cause her problem?  </P> <P> A: A recently reported small study of swimmers suggests a more direct  explanation for your daughter's anemia: low iron intake. Investigators could  find no evidence of changes in blood profiles at the end of a season of  competition, suggesting that the muscular exercise of swimming does no damage  to red blood cells.  </P> <P> However, in that study, not one of the six women involved consumed even as much  as 60% of the Recommended Dietary Allowances. Some consumed considerably less.  Assessment of the relationship between iron intake and menstrual losses in  these women indicated that about half of them simply were not taking adequate  amounts to offset their losses.  </P></p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Gummer rejects shopping schemes Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, yesterday demonstrated his determination to revitalise urban centres by refusing planning permission for two out-of-town retail developments. He also signalled a tougher line on town-centre planning by refusing permission for a shopping development on the site of the former cattle market in Ludlow, Shropshire, as the design was not sympathetic with its surroundings in a 'special, historic town'. Mr Gummer told the 80th anniversary celebrations of the Royal Town Planning Institute that he would be making a series of announcements in the next few months as part of an 'urban quality initiative'. He said: 'At the heart of the sustainable development strategy is the question of urban quality. 'Improving urban quality means encouraging the re-use of land in our cities. It means adapting buildings that form part of the familiar townscape for the uses people expect to find in their towns and cities.' The out-of-town applications which Mr Gummer rejected were for outline planning permission for a supermarket and petrol station on the edge of Ludlow, and for a sub-regional shopping centre at Duxford, near Cambridge. Plans for a shopping centre beyond Cambridge's green belt were drawn up in the late 1980s to ease congestion in the city centre.</p>

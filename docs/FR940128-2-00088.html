The December 1 Filing was Texas Eastern's third quarterly filing to recover such costs and was filed pursuant to section 15.2(C) of the General Terms and Conditions of Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1. Ordering Paragraph (A) of the December 30 Order required certain tariff sheets be ``refiled within fifteen days of this order to conform to the conditions set forth in the body of this order, and the ordering paragraphs below.'' Texas Eastern states that the tariff sheets listed in Appendix A are submitted to satisfy the requirements of the December 30 Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Eastern states that section 15.2(C) of the General Terms and Conditions has been revised in compliance with the December 30 Order as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Section 15.2(C)(2)(a) has been revised to extend the amortization and recovery period to two (2) years for buyout costs which are incurred after January 1, 1994 and which, in the aggregate, exceed fifteen (15) million dollars for a quarterly filing; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Section 15.2(C)(2)(a)(i) has been revised to reflect that applicable customers under Rate Schedules CDS, FT&hyph;1, LLFT and VKFT will be billed each month for a GSR Demand Surcharge Amount calculated by multiplying their current MDQ for a month times the GSR Demand Surcharge rate; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Section 15.2(C)(2)(a)(ii) has been revised to reflect that with the exception of the GSR Demand Surcharge component already designed to be paid over twenty-four (24) months, each customer shall have the option of paying its GSR Demand Surcharge obligation for any quarter in twenty-four (24) monthly installments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Section 15.2(C)(2)(a)(iv) has been revised to clarify that the payment obligation for the GSR Demand Surcharge Amounts, together with applicable carrying charges, accrues in full as of the close of the month in which service was provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Section 15.2(C)(5) has been added to reflect an annual true-up, as of any twelve (12) month period ending June 30, of the recovery of GSR costs allocated to be recovered from customers under Rate Schedules CDS, FT&hyph;1, LLFT and VKFT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Eastern states that pursuant to section 15.2(C) of the General Terms and Conditions, ninety percent (90%) of GSR Costs are allocated to customers under Texas Eastern's Rate Schedules CDS, FT&hyph;1, LLFT, and VKFT in the form of a CSR Demand Surcharge calculated using customer MDQs. Texas Eastern's December 1 Filing allocated $12,701,656 of GSR Costs, inclusive of prior period adjustments and carrying charges, to its customers under Rate Schedules CDS, FT&hyph;1, LLFT and VKFT. However, Texas Eastern states that total customer MDQs under Rate Schedules CDS, FT&hyph;1, LLFT and VKFT have changed slightly since the December 1 Filing. Attachment A details the calculation of the new GSR Demand Surcharge unit rate based upon MDQs effective January 1, 1994. As a result, Texas Eastern submits Sub Sixth Revised Sheet No. 25, Sub Sixth Revised Sheet No. 30, Sub Third Revised Sheet No. 34A, Sub Third Revised Sheet No. 34B, Sub Third Revised Sheet No. 42A, and Sub Second Revised Sheet No. 42B to reflect this slight change in total firm customer MDQs. Texas Eastern states that the rates for Rate Schedules IT&hyph;1, PTI, LLIT and VKIT are not impacted by the slight change in total firm customer MDQs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed effective date of the tariff sheets is January 1, 1994, consistent with the December 30 Order or the effective date of the tariff sheets they replace. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Eastern states that copies of the filing were served on firm customers of Texas Eastern and interested state commission.

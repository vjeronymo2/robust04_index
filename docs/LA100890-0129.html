			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRITISH POUND SOARS AS IT ENTERS EC'S CURRENCY GRID  </P> <P> The British pound and London's stock market soared today as sterling formally  entered the European currency float after years of resistance from British  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  </P> <P> The pound began trading within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism early in  London after an agreement was clinched with the rest of the 12-nation European  Community over the weekend.  </P> <P> Britain announced Friday it was dropping its longstanding opposition to joining  the EC's semi-fixed currency grid. The pound surged as a result, with buying  fever spreading to the stock market today.  </P> <P> Trading volume for the day soared to 1.08 billion shares, an all-time high,  helped by an estimated 300 million shares at the opening that included leftover  orders from Friday.  </P> <P> A London Stock Exchange spokeswoman said the highest daily volume recorded was  997.3 million shares on July 9, 1987.  </P> <P> "I can't remember the last time we turned over 500 million shares, let alone  900 million," one dealer said.  </P> <P> The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 top shares, or "Footsie" as it  is called, ended 57.7 points higher at 2,201.6.  </P> <P> The pound rose as high as 3.05 German marks in a spectacular rally that brought  it up 10 pfennigs since Friday.  </P> <P> Dealers said economic history was made when trading screens flashed the "go"  signal.  </P> <P> This took the form of an announcement this morning by the Bank of England of  the rates at which the pound -- once the world's leading currency in Britain's  imperial heyday -- is aligned to the German mark. It is set at 2.95 marks and  may fluctuate in a band between 2.7780 and 3.1320.  </P> <P> After rising just above 3.05 marks, the pound eased to around 3.03. That was  well within its limits, but some analysts thought it might go higher during the  week.  </P></p>

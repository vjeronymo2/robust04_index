			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: ShareLink gets Pounds 42m valuation from offer SHARELINK Investment Services yesterday announced an offer and placing of 7.9m shares at 250p each, valuing the telephone-based stockbroker at Pounds 42.1m. Half of the shares are being offered to the public with the rest placed with institutions. It is fully underwritten by Hill Samuel. Trading starts on July 30 when there will be 16.8m shares in issue. The company is raising Pounds 5m of new money to pay off Pounds 3.5m redeemable preference shares and Pounds 1.2m of borrowings. Mr David Jones, chief executive, said he wanted an ungeared balance sheet to enable him to invest in new services. ShareLink, which currently specialises in equities and traded options, is looking at expanding into insurance and banking. Its two biggest shareholders, Foreign Colonial Ventures and the British Coal pension fund, both of which have a 32 per cent stake, are expected to sell about half their shareholdings. COMMENT There is no direct competitor with which to compare ShareLink. For obvious reasons it likes to compare itself with Direct Line, the company owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland which specialises in telephone insurance and recently trebled first-half profits to Pounds 15m. But notwithstanding its plans to expand, ShareLink remains a different animal. It is currently dependent on the stock market and to some extent must be regarded a cyclical stock. The issue price represents 16.6 times pro forma earnings per share before exceptional items and a notional gross dividend yield of 3.75 per cent for year ended March 31. James Capel predicts that pre-tax profits will rise from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 5.5m. About Pounds 1m of the predicted rise is due to BT3, indicating an underlying rise of 45 per cent. The forecast puts the shares on an undemanding prospective multiple of just over 11.</p>

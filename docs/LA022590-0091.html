			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIDS TESTS  </P> <P> Your article (Part A, Feb. 16) about hospitals taking unauthorized AIDS tests  hit an angry chord in me.  </P> <P> Last year when I was scheduled for an operation the surgeon came to me and  asked me to take an HIV test so he'd know whether to take special measures to  protect his operating room staff.  </P> <P> I thought about it overnight and then went back with a counter proposition. I'd  agree to the test -- if he and his entire operating room staff would take the  test too so I could eliminate anyone who registered HIV positive. After all,  they'd be working with sharp instruments and if anyone who's HIV positive cut  himself or herself and bled into my open wound, I'd be in big trouble.  </P> <P> Needless to say, the suggestion that I be tested was dropped very quickly.  </P> <P> I have no idea whether I was tested secretly. But if those tests are being  made, why not extend them to cover all hospital personnel and have the results  available to patients whose lives might be jeopardized if an accident happens  in treatment or surgery. Fair?  </P> <P> JOHN W. BLOCH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

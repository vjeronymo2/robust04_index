			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Observer: The real thing As Europe embarks on its hols, spare a thought for the poor Russian motorist. Petrol stations are few, and filling up the family car can often involve several hours' queueing. Indeed, some towns near Moscow have been known to ban the sale of petrol to visitors from the capital in order to conserve their own scarce supplies of fuel. Hence, it comes as no surprise to learn that farmers in the Kursk region are turning to a more reliable and purer source of horsepower. The price of a 'good workhorse' has been rising sharply. It is now between 15,000 and 20,000 roubles, or between Dollars 110 and Dollars 150. That may not sound a lot by western standards, but it is three or four months' salary for local people.</p>

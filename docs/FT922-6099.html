			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Trade gap widest since 1990: April imports surge prompts fears over whether recovery can be sustained BRITAIN'S trade and current account deficits widened unexpectedly last month, pointing to increased activity in the domestic economy but casting doubts over whether the recovery can be sustained. The visible trade deficit jumped from Pounds 891m in March to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 1.36bn in April, the highest since August 1990. The Central Statistical Office estimated that the deficit on current account, which includes a projected Pounds 300m surplus from 'invisible' trade such as services and transfers, increased last month to Pounds 1.06bn, the biggest since January last year, from Pounds 591m in March. Imports, when measured in volume terms and minus oil and so-called erratic items such as aircraft, ships, oil rigs and precious stones, set a new record in April. While some economists said the jump in imports was a welcome sign of recovery, others expressed concern that import volumes had already recouped the recession-linked decline before any real recovery in the economy had become apparent. Yesterday's figures cast some doubt on the UK's ability to maintain strong economic growth in the medium term without experiencing the constraints of a widening trade deficit. 'The figures bode ill for the sustainability of the recovery,' said Mr Leo Doyle, an economist with Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank and securities group. At the Treasury, however, a spokesman pointed out that some pick-up in imports was to be expected as the economy recovered. He said exports were still strong and warned that monthly trade figures could be erratic. The April deficits were much higher than the City's consensus forecasts of Pounds 600m for the current account and Pounds 900m for the visible trade account. They reflected a sharp 3.5 per cent increase in the value of imports to Pounds 10.15bn last month. Exports, at Pounds 8.79bn in April, were 1.4 per cent lower than in March. However, exports, although down last month, have been running at a historically high level. The volumes for both exports and imports in the latest three months are the highest ever recorded. The deficits had a mixed impact on financial markets. Shares were marked down on the news and continued lower partly because of falling prices on Wall Street. The FTSE-100 index, up 12.1 points before the announcement, closed at 2,704.6, down 10.4. Sterling, protected by relatively high interest rates and membership of the European exchange rate mechanism, shrugged off the bad news and gained against both the D-Mark and dollar. At the London close, the Bank of England's trade weighted sterling index was 93.1, up 0.3 on Friday's close, while the pound closed 0.5 pfennigs higher at DM2.9425 and up 1.35 cents at Dollars 1.828. In New York, the pound closed at Dollars 1.825 and stood at DM2.94225 in late trading.

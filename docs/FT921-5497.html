			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems call for poll tax 'loan' - Local authority finance A CALL for the Budget to include an interest-free loan from government to local councils to pay for the poll tax 'non-payment surcharge' was made yesterday by Mr David Bellotti, the Liberal Democrats' local government spokesman. Mr Bellotti said that the Pounds 300m loan would cost only the interest charge, estimated at Pounds 30m, because the principal would be recovered as councils pursued those who had not paid. The party will launch today its 'shadow Budget' or two-year recovery programme under the slogan 'Turning Britain Round'. Though final figures have yet to be approved by full councils, provisional surcharges in a number of urban areas such as Manchester, Leicester, Reading and Rochdale are likely to be at or about Pounds 50. Mr Bellotti said it was unacceptable for poll tax payers to have to be charged more because of those who did not pay, and that it was fairer for the cost to be borne by the taxpayer. He added that he did not believe the Conservatives would gain from any delay in sending out bills, because people already blamed the government for the poll tax and knew they were going to receive the bills eventually. Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, dismissed the proposal as 'setting up a government bank to bail out authorities which have been least effective in their efforts to collect the community charge.' Ministers are sceptical about the need for councils to set large other adjustments figures. Liberal Democrats committed themselves yesterday to a Pounds 675m package of help for childcare. Most would be spent on guaranteeing pre-school education for all children aged three and four. A further Pounds 100m would be for tax-free childcare vouchers and Pounds 50m for local authorities to boost childcare provision. The party is also pledged to increasing child benefit by Pounds 1 a week per child in 1992-93 at a cost of Pounds 640m.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Shevardnadze reigns over Tbilisi ruins: A daunted former Soviet foreign minister back in Georgia A MONTH since his return to his native Georgia, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, whose premonitions about a military coup and disagreements with Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, forced him to resign as Soviet foreign minister, is daunted by the challenges he faces. Speaking in his office in Tbilisi, just a short walk from the old KGB headquarters and prison now in ruins, Mr Shevardnadze said the decision to come back to Georgia had been difficult. 'I am not sure - and I am still not sure - if it is possible for Georgia to come out of the crisis. I knew I had to participate in trying to get the country out of this mess. I knew I had no right just to watch from the sidelines.' His friends say Mr Shevardnadze, the republic's communist party leader from 1972 to 1985, returned to heal the wounds and unite Georgian society, ripped apart last January. During three weeks of bloody street fighting in Tbilisi, a cosmopolitan Caucasian city, opposition parties fought to oust Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the republic's nationalist and hardline president elected a year ago. More than a hundred people were killed, and parts of the capital were destroyed. The fighting pitted the urban population against the countryside, which supported Mr Gamsakhurdia. Under Mr Gamsakhurdia's rule, Georgia virtually became a pariah state. All links were cut with the outside world, and with Russia, its neighbour on which it depends for most of its raw materials and energy. This is one reason industrial production has plummeted 40 per cent compared with a year ago. Some 80 per cent of enterprises were at a standstill in the winter because of energy shortages. On his return to Tbilisi, Mr Shevardnadze moved quickly to restore links with the international community. The republic is now a member of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank and Georgia's independence has been recognised by the US and the European Community. But Mr Shevardnadze said such recognition was not enough to snuff out the opposition, restore stability and revive the economy. 'The opposition is diminishing. But only last week, it tried to blow up a tunnel linking the western parts of the republic with the east,' he said. 'The opposition will not continue to diminish if the economy does not improve. What good are slogans of democracy for people who are hungry? Other little Gamsakhurdias will emerge if we do not tackle the economy.' Relief supplies from the US have brought some respite, especially for the hospitals. But Mr Shevardnadze, who heads the State Council, an interim broad-based body which has replaced parliament and the presidency until elections next October, is working on an economic reform programme. This entails plans for privatisation aimed at attracting foreign investment, and tapping the creative and entrepreneurial skills of Georgians. Mr Shevardnadze and Georgian economists believe the economy of this republic of 5.5m, rich in manganese deposits, citrus fruits, spas, and tea, will then prosper. Mr Valerian Advadze, chairman of the council's economic commission, said IMF and western credits would help Georgia negotiate its Dollars 1.3bn share of the former Soviet Union's external hard currency debt. Mr Shevardnadze, meanwhile, is eager to consolidate relations with neighbouring Ukraine, Armenia, and Turkey, as well as Russia. 'We are drawing up a detailed agreement with Russia which will cover economic, trade, military and political issues. We will retain the rouble as the unit of currency,' he said. On the question of Russian troops, Mr Shevardnadze is more cautious. 'This is a difficult problem. Of course no country is happy to have the presence of a foreign army on its territory . . . but the Russian - and not the Soviet - army is defending our borders with Turkey,' he said. 'If we withdraw them, our borders will be completely open. Georgia is not ready to defend its own frontiers. We are forming our own army, but it is very expensive since our economy is completely destroyed,' he said. As for Mr Shevardnadze's own future, he remains reticent. 'I will stay here in Georgia, though I have not yet decided to stand in the elections. Maybe, if the democratic parties form a block, I would be interested in standing - but only as an independent,' he said, confirming that, as in the past, he will be nobody's man.</p>

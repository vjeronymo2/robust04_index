			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> EVEN A VIOLENT CRIMINAL HAS AN INTROSPECTIVE SIDE  </P> <P> When Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald sentenced James A. Melton six  years ago to be executed for the robbery and murder of a Newport Beach man, he  told the defendant it was too bad, because he liked him.  </P> <P> I remember being a little surprised. Covering Melton's trial, I hadn't found  anything likable about him at all.  </P> <P> Melton, a large man, appeared menacing. He glared when spoken to. He never  smiled or talked with his lawyer. He never watched the witnesses or even  appeared to be listening to them.  </P> <P> During his death penalty hearing, he doodled on a piece of paper while two  women who took the stand described in heart-wrenching detail how he had raped  them. One rape occurred as the woman's terrified young son watched.  </P> <P> During a short recess, I strained over the courtroom railing to see what Melton  had been doing: He was drawing airplanes.  </P> <P> In many years of court reporting, I had never seen a killer so callous, so  bored with the proceedings. He did not testify, even at his death penalty  hearing. Even participation in his own trial appeared to be too much of an  effort.  </P> <P> But that was six years ago.  </P> <P> Since doing interviews with Death Row inmates, I have come to know James Melton  better. And now, as the judge who sentenced him, I see another side of him.  </P> <P> Melton, 37, now says that he had been given such heavy doses of prescription  drugs at Orange County Jail that he was barely aware that a trial was going on.  If he did not look at the witnesses, he says now, it was because he had no idea  who was on the stand.  </P> <P> The outlook for a successful appeal for Melton is rather grim. The state  Supreme Court turned down his first appeal earlier this year. Melton's  appellate attorney, Robert F. Kane of San Francisco, is genuinely convinced  that Melton was impaired by a drugged condition and that kept him from getting  a fair trial.  </P> <P> I believe Kane is a conscientious lawyer, but I have no idea whether Melton was  drugged. I can only say that it's surprising that the James Melton I have  interviewed at San Quentin is the same person his jurors saw. He's an  interesting man, introspective, who searches for answers to why he became so  violent. Melton at the trial was dull, mean-spirited, inhuman.  </P> <P> Kane recently asked me whether I would write a declaration about my  observations of Melton during the trial. Kane had hoped that it would help  support the appeal argument that Melton had been drugged.  </P> <P> This was out of the question, of course. Reporters are not supposed to be  involved in their stories. But the request bothered me: Would I even want to  help?  </P> <P> Melton acknowledges that he has a terrible criminal past but claims he is  innocent of this murder. Do I believe him? No.  </P> <P> Melton and another inmate had been planning this robbery while he was in prison  for a previous crime. Melton was found with the victim's car and possessions.  </P> <P> With such overwhelming evidence, and with Melton's incredible history of rapes,  robberies and assaults, the trial results, including the death verdict, were  inevitable.  </P> <P> But a nagging question remains: Did Melton really give his jurors any choice at  all in deciding between death and life without parole? No. Melton, for whatever  reasons, acted like his own worst enemy.  </P> <P> Melton's first execution date, set for last month, was routinely postoned while  his appeals continue.  </P> <P> Melton called me from San Quentin State Prison just before then. "You know my  execution will be put off, and my lawyer knows it. But all I know is I'm set to  die," Melton told me. "This thing is getting so close, I figure I better get  more involved."  </P> <P> If Melton ever is executed, I'm not sure what my reaction will be. I do know I  will feel a sadness that he probably never fully understood the terror he  created on this earth. But I'll also wonder: If Melton really wanted to save  himself, why did he wait six years to try?  </P></p>

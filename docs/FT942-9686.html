			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Daewoo to launch cars in Europe Daewoo Motor, the Korean carmaker, plans to enter the west European car market next year with the launch of its cars in the UK and Ireland. The company, the third largest vehicle maker in Korea, is establishing a wholly owned importer-distributor in the UK with the aim of setting up a network of 75 to 100 dealers. They will be recruited this year, with the franchise launched next spring. The company hopes for a 1 per cent share of the UK new-car market by 1998, implying sales of about 20,000 a year. Mr Leslie Woodcock, formerly managing director of Suzuki GB Cars, has been appointed managing director of Daewoo's UK car operations. Daewoo Motor was formerly a joint venture with General Motors. Daewoo took over full control in 1992. It plans to launch versions of its Espero and LeMans/Racer family cars, developed from the previous generation Vauxhall Cavalier and Astra models, under co-operation with GM.</p>

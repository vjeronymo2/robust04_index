			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YANQUI DON'T GO HOME -- YET;  </P> <P> PANAMA: LAW AND ORDER HAS BROKEN DOWN. WITHOUT U.S. HELP IN TRAINING NEW POLICE  FORCES, VIOLENCE WILL WORSEN.  </P> <P> President Bush and Secretary James A. Baker III may be on the verge of turning  the military success of the Panama invasion into the political fiasco of the  1990s. The U.S. Southern Command's newspaper headlined the problem earlier this  week: "Breakdown in law, order spreads fear."  </P> <P> That's putting it mildly. An internal report prepared by the Southern Command  portrayed the successor to Manuel A. Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces, the  Public Forces, as indequate in terms of personnel, training, organization,  discipline and morale. Which means that the President's rush to withdraw all  the American troops sent to Panama in December is terribly misguided. Indeed,  the United States has no choice but to become more involved in re-establishing  the security of Panamanians and Americans in the country.  </P> <P> U.S. help in keeping order and training the new Public Forces will take months.  Although thousands of arms have been confiscated since the invasion, armed  robberies and other assaults are widespread. What's more, many Panamanians  don't yet trust the new police force since many of its members previously  worked for Noriega. In response, some Panamanians have called for the formation  of local defense brigades, which would no doubt increase the violence and  death.  </P> <P> "How long?" was the question most asked during Vice President Dan Quayle's  visit to Panama last weekend. President's Bush answer should be, "Not yet."  </P></p>

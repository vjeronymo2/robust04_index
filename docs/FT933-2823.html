			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: All systems 'go' for coffee scheme COFFEE-producing countries meeting in Bogota have agreed on both the retention scheme and the statutes for the new producers' association to be launched next week in Brazil. Mr Jorge Cardenas, head of the Colombian Coffee Growers' Federation, stressed that producers were not forming a cartel but trying to ensure organised supply. Retention will begin on October 1 with each country holding back 20 bags of coffee for every 100 bags exported. If the coffee price index stays at 75 cents a lb or more for 20 days, retention will drop to 10 per cent of exports. If the price then reaches 80 cents a lb or more for 10 days there will be no further retention until prices drop again. All the coffee held back must come from the current harvest and an international company will audit the scheme. Penalties will be applied to those not keeping back the full amount -- for example, producers will have to retain double any proven shortfall. The association's committee will decide whether stocks are to be freed and when. Observers at the meeting included several countries that will now probably join the association. Ecuador has already decided to do so but Mexico said it could give no definite answer as yet. Countries committed to the association account for some 85 per cent of world coffee production. The Bogota meeting was essentially a technical discussion in preparation for the September 23 launch and Mr Cardenas called it 'a real success'. The association aims to co-ordinate production and exports among as many producers as possible and will also work to expand coffee consumption. Mr Frederico Robalinho of the Brazilian trade ministry said the association was very well prepared for next week's meeting and he was optimistic about its future. Mr Andrade Vieira, Brazil's minister for industry, trade and tourism, is to be the first executive president and the headquarters provisionally being estabilished in Brasilia.</p>

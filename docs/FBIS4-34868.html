			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Daly Valet] </F>   [Excerpts] Many people might consider U.S. Government  officials, both past and present, the leaders of the putschists  and the leaders in stalling tactics, following the failure of  the Washington and Governors Island agreements. If the United  States truly controls everything in Haiti, an important step has  been taken with Bill Clinton's latest decisions. This important  step has caused many Haitians problems, lavalassian [Aristide  partisan] and putschist alike. If you (?doubt that), go to Rue  des Miracles and see the Bank of Boston; if you go to Delmas 18,  you will see that the Bank of Nova Scotia is closed; if you go  to Citibank on Delmas Road, you will see that all its doors are  closed. Not one penny is available to the Haitians, regardless  of their political positions. Consequently, many people (?are  angry). You can visit parliament in the meantime.    The U.S. Government has revoked the green cards and visas of  many legislators who set up Jonassaint's de facto government.  The visas and the green cards of Thomas Eddy Dupiton, Dejean  Belizaire, Bernard Sansaricq, Osny Eugene, and Romel Manigat  have been revoked.    Sen. Dupiton says he did not expect the United States to  take  such a step since he has always considered it a democratic  country, a country where all citizens' opinions are respected  even though they differ. [passage omitted]    Many Haitians who are used to traveling abroad say that Sen.  Sansaricq has many businesses in the United States, so you can  imagine his discontent. Sen. Dupiton has relatives, children,  and so on. The Artibonite senator admits that he regrets  nothing, even though he considers the decision to cancel his  green card unjust. [passage omitted]    Not all legislators close to Jonassaint have had their visas  revoked. Some of those who have not been hit by the measure,  such as Margareth Martin, say, however, they are waiting their  turn. This 18 January, legislators protested the fact that many  of her Senate colleagues have been hit by the measure because of  their political positions. Margareth Martin blames the decision  to revoke visas on senators close to President Aristide. Sen.  Martin says they are the senators who used to point accusing  fingers at legislators who do not side with the  president-in-exile:    [Begin Martin recording] It is scandalous that the U.S.  ambassador or the U.S. Embassy cancels the immigrant visas of  Haitian citizens who support the government. I have yet to  receive my letter; I am waiting for it; I am waiting for them.  They can revoke my visa and take back their green card. I will  stay in my country and help establish democracy. [end recording]    [Signal FM adds in a report in French, during the same  newscast: "President Emile Jonassaint's provisional government  issued a communique on 23 June noting that foreigners from  countries that require Haitian nationals to have visas will be  required to have a visa to enter Haitian territory. This  measure concerns U.S. citizens and Canadians, who did not need a  visa to enter the country before now. The French have been  obliged to hold visas for several years, as a sign of  reciprocity with Paris. The government communique states that  foreigners will have to pay a $50 tax upon arrival at Haitian  ports and airports."]</p>

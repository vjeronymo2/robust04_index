			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): 'English' Frenchman to head Unice Francois Perigot is the first Frenchman to take over the presidency of the increasingly important European employers' body Unice. writes David Goodhart. Unice has a vital lobbying role in Brussels and in areas like the European social dimension it even has a formal negotiating status. As these responsibilities have grown so has the potential for tension within Unice between the business cultures of different European countries, especially between the aggressive tone of Britain's employers and the consensual manners of much of continental Europe. Domestically, Perigot is regarded as a liberal and was roundly condemned, even by other businessman, for suggesting that a GATT agreement might be good for French business. 'That earned him his spurs and really clinched the Unice job,' says one senior Unice member. He is also happy to take a tough line against the European Commission on issues like the imposition of European works councils in multinational companies. And having spent 15 years of his working life at Unilever - running both the Spanish and French subsidiaries - he is more than familiar with British business culture. 'He is virtually an English Frenchman,' says his friend Howard Davies, head of the Confederation of British Industry. But the golf-playing Perigot may not always see eye-to-eye with the CBI. Last week he was quoted in the French business daily Les Echos as saying that the European social dimension 'is both substantial and positive' - a sentiment to which few British business leaders would put their names. In any case, Perigot is well versed in the politics of employers' organisations; since 1986 he has been president of the main French employers' body CNPF, a job he is not expected to continue for long.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nam Yu-chol: "Even Limited Sanctions Can Cause </F> Serious Damage to North Korea--Economic Sanctions, Effective  Even Without Chinese Participation--Suspension of Inter-Korean  Trade Also Deals the North a Blow"]    [Text] The North Korean military delegation led by Choe  Kwang, chief of the General Staff of the North Korean People's  Army [KPA], recently visited China to hold a series of talks  with the Chinese leaders. The visit, which was made at a  delicate time when the United Nations was discussing economic  sanctions on North Korea, drew extraordinary attention at home  and abroad. As to Choe Kwang's China visit, which was different  from the courtesy visits by the North Korean leadership, the  local experts had a more-or-less vague assessment that North  Korea may have wanted to maintain a close military cooperation  with China while international tension was increasing. The head  of the North Korean department of a major business group, who is  well versed in North Korean affairs, said, "We understand that  the two sides had an extensive exchange of views over the  pending issues between the two countries regarding the nuclear  issue."    Choe Kwang is a person who is regarded as the No. 2 man in  the North Korean military, whose position is to take the whole  responsibility for military operations under the KPA supreme  commander Kim Chong-il. In particular, he has been directly  involved in purchasing the oil for military use, which is "the  most important job" of the North Korean military. The sources  of information of the Singaporean oil market, who are well  versed in the oil supply of the Asian countries, have watched  with interest Choe Kwang's moves over the last several years.  The reason is that whenever Choe Kwang conducted "military  diplomacy" with Iran and Southeast Asia, there was talk about  oil supply for North Korea.    A bigwig inter-Korean trade agent in Singapore keeping in  touch with the North Korean leadership said in an interview: "It  is certain that Choe Kwang discussed with China the problem of  oil supply for the military." Another trade agent, who supplied  Russian oil to North Korea through a Chinese intermediary, said  that the North Korean military purchased oil for itself through  independent channels different from those of the party and the  Administration Council. The purpose of Choe Kwang's visit to  China is considered to include the problem of oil supply in  preparation for wartime.    That the North Korean military purchased oil independently  through various channels was an object of major concern to the  local strategic experts. We are greatly interested in how much  oil North Korea has been stockpiling for military use. Local  experts estimate that North Korea must be stockpiling oil for  military use that will last for one year in preparation for war,  despite its severe oil shortage. However, according to the  Southeast Asian oil sources, North Korea failed to sign a  satisfactory oil supply contract not only with Iran but with  Indonesia, with which North Korea persistently contracted in  1993.    A U.S. oil expert demanding anonymity, in a telephone  interview, said: "The oil the allied forces spent during the  Gulf war was 300,000 barrels per day. North Korea may not have  even the minimum stockpile it needs." (Al Troner), Singapore  branch head of the U.S. oil journal PETROLEUM INTELLIGENCE  WEEKLY, said: "I have not heard that North Korea is trying to  purchase oil from an oil market."    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher revealed that  economic sanctions against North Korea must, first of all, block  the incoming flow of petroleum and foodstuffs. Most of the  domestic experts have been showing skepticism by saying that  there will be no effect in the economic sanctions against the  North if China, which is providing petroleum and foodstuffs to  North Korea, does not take part in the sanctions. The analysis  that China holds the key to economic sanctions against the North  is only based on government statistics by countries exchanging  trade with North Korea such as China and Russia. Therefore, it  is a mistake to have overestimated the "influence" China has in  the North Korean overall trade.    An expert in North Korean affairs from a private economic  institute claimed: "Even if limited sanctions are taken against  the North, they would be a big blow to the North Korean economy,  which has been recording a negative growth for the past four  years." He also said: "It has been known that the practical  effectiveness of the economic sanctions against the North would  depend on China's attitude. However, even if China does not  participate in taking sanctions against the North, the  effectiveness of the sanctions against the North would be  great." As a basis for this, he pointed out that the ROK and  Japan are important countries in earning foreign currency, and  equipment and materials for heavy industry facilities in  exporting North Korean weapons are from eastern Germany and  Russia. Therefore, when it becomes impossible to change  facilities, North Korea will suffer an enormous blow.    According to statistics by the PRC Customs and the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, North  Korea imported 649,000 tonnes of grain from China and 177,000  tonnes of grain from Turkey in 1992. It is not in the  statistics, but from 1991 to 1993, North Korea imported a large  amount of Canadian and Australian grain through a trading  company in New Jersey, United States. In September 1992, after  concluding a contract under the name of a third country's  company, North Korea brought in 70,000 tonnes of wheat from  Australia. In January 1993, 280,000 tonnes of wheat were  exported to North Korea from western Canada, and 30,966 tonnes  and 25,000 tonnes were exported to North Korea in February, and  March, respectively. These were not listed in the statistics of  the governments of various countries because companies of  various nationalities were involved in the purchase, shipping,  and transportation.    According to North Korea's 1993 economic index as announced  by the Korea Bank, North Korea's GNP was $25 billion. Among the  $25 billion, the total amount of trade was $2.64 billion  occupying only 12.9 percent of the total GNP. (When considering  official statistics that can be tallied), North Korea imported  goods from China (34.8 percent), Japan (14.3 percent), and CIS  (14.6 percent) in 1992. Also 58.2 percent of the overall export  was to these three countries. The Institute of Foreign Affairs  and National Security analyzed: "Economic sanctions against the  North would have a great effect if economic sanctions are taken  against the North internationally, because imports and exports  are concentrated on these countries."    U.S. economist (Gerry Hufbower's) studies show that a mere  36 percent of the 103 instances of economic sanctions imposed  from 1914 to 1983 were successful. However, the effect of  economic sanctions is a relative concept. The meaning of  "effect" will change depending on what political purposes to  pursue in economic sanctions. Therefore, the political purposes  of sanctions on North Korea must be clarified before the effect  of such sanctions is discussed. It is not clear at present  whether economic sanctions on North Korea are intended for the  eventual collapse of the North Korean establishment or whether  they are part of an attempt to pressure North Korea into another  round of negotiations to prevent North Korea from developing  nuclear weapons.    Countries involved in sanctions on North Korea have  different  interests of their own. Major domestic businesses that have  earnestly traded with North Korea have a keen interest in how  sanctions will be imposed. North Korea team leaders of major  general trading corporations say that what they want to know  most are the timetable of the sanctions and details of the  sanctions for each phase. The Samsung Economic Research  Institute said that U.S.-led international economic sanctions  can be imposed in one of three different ways.    Experts say that limited sanctions involving the ROK, the  United States, and Japan may likely be imposed under  circumstances in which China is opposed to UN-led sanctions.  They predict that the United States and North Korea may enter  into negotiations again after economic sanctions, which are of  strong political and symbolic significance, are imposed.    Our government is of the position that if the United States  decides on its action plan, irrespective of whether it be a  UN-led sanction or a partial sanction, our government plans to  map out its own sanction plan depending on the intensity of the  U.S. sanction plan. A government source said that the  "possibility is nil at present that we will take the initiative"  to put an end to indirect North-South trade and ban contacts  with North Koreans.    North-South trade has recently increased, even though  tensions have continuously intensified on the Korean peninsula  because of the nuclear issue. The volume of trade between the  North and South was $187 million (on a customs-clearance basis)  last year, a 7.6 percent increase over 1992. The ROK is North  Korea's fourth largest trading partner, after China, Japan, and  Russia. ROK businesses are North Korea's "extremely good"  trading partners. Based on their strategic policy of  maintaining a "channel of dialogue" with North Korea, big  business groups involved in trade with North Korea have given  the best terms to North Korea even if they lose money. They  have bought North Korean goods with cash advances and sold goods  on credit.    A Singaporean trading agent says: "North Korea has many  unpaid bills in trade with ROK businesses. If sanctions are  imposed, ROK businesses will not be able to receive the money."  However, big business groups say that "we did not begin trade  with North Korea to make profit in the first place." ROK  businesses bought goods worth $178 million from North Korea last  year. The investments for processing on commission, the trade  of goods sold in third countries, and unreported deals were not  unaccounted for in the National Unification Board statistics.  The volume of North-South trade is much greater than what the  government's official statistics show, even though the  government has painstakingly turned a blind eye to this status.  A man involved in trade with North Korea says: "It is no  exaggeration to say that North Korea has bought oil and food  from China with the foreign exchange which ROK business has  `given' it." He also says that the "blow which an end to  North-South trade will deal to North Korea will be enormous."  <H5>  Scenarios of Economic Sanctions on North Korea (Source: </H5> Samsung Economic Research Institute)    1.

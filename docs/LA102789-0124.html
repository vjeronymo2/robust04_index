			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KING MEDICAL CENTER PHYSICIANS CALL REPORTS OF PROBLEMS GREATLY DISTORTED  </P> <P> Two physicians at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center charged at a press  conference Thursday that patient care problems have been greatly distorted and  that the county supervisors are to blame for "deliberate under-funding" of the  institution.  </P> <P> Dr. Lorenzo Brown, a part-time doctor at King and a member of an ad hoc  committee of the Charles R. Drew Medical Society, charged that funding for the  medical center today is "at the same level as in 1981."  </P> <P> This, however, was denied in an interview with Virginia Collins, a division  chief in the county's office of the chief administrator who said her budget  analysis has shown all county hospitals, including King, have received "steady  increases."  </P> <P> Brown further charged that King's trauma patient load in the last 18 months "is  greater than the total for the past 12 years." That was also disputed by county  officials.  </P> <P> Virginia Price Hastings, who is in charge of pre-hospital care at the county  Department of Health Services, acknowledged in an interview that King has  struggled to cope with an increasing trauma load but characterized Brown's  assertion as defying common sense. In fact, she said her records show that  King's trauma load during the first six months of 1989 is down significantly  from last year.  </P> <P> State and federal health authorities on Sept. 12 cited the hospital for scores  of major patient care deficiencies in the areas of nursing, dietary care,  infection control, quality assurance, physical plant and administration. County  health officials have acknowledged problems at King and pledged to correct them  by Dec. 21 in order to avoid a threatened shut-off of about $60 million in  public health-care funding.  </P> <P> The Charles R. Drew Medical Society is a group of physicians who support or  work at King. They include Dr. Arthur Fleming, King's chief of trauma and  surgery, who attended the press conference.  </P> <P> Fleming renewed an earlier attack on The Times, circulating again a lengthy  critique of cases cited in a series of articles about King published earlier in  September.  </P> <P> He charged that the articles presented a "distorted, misleading,  misrepresented, exaggerated view when, in actuality, we have struggled  valiantly to treat an unusual case mix and an overwhelming number of patients  with inadequate resources."  </P> <P> In the articles, The Times detailed what county supervisors summed up as "poor  administration, a lack of highly skilled medical staff and a severe shortage of  space, staff and funding to adequately deal with the hospital's increasing  patient load."  </P> <P> The articles were the result of a months-long investigation that included  interviews with dozens of health-care professionals and a review of hundreds of  pages of documents on patient care at the hospital. The Times series reported  higher death rates at King than at the county's other acute care hospitals and  cited a federal analysis of Medicare death rates that ranked King in the bottom  50 of 5,577 hospitals nationwide.  </P> <P> Complaints about patient care and inadequate resources at King were voiced by  numerous doctors and other medical staff at the hospital. Dozens of individual  cases of patient care were reviewed, and The Times asked outside medical  experts to analyze 12 of them.  </P> <P> But at the Burbank press conference Thursday, Brown called the articles  "irresponsible journalism" based on "distorted accounts of specific cases."  </P> <P> All cases cited by The Times were reviewed by outside medical experts, who  concluded that the cases were egregious examples of bad medicine, suggesting  serious malfunctioning at King. The Board of Medical Quality Assurance is  investigating these cases, which included instances in which patients lingered  and died for lack of timely surgery.  </P></p>

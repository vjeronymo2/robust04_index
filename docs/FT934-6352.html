			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BSG Intl warns on profits Shares of BSG International, the automotive components manufacturer, fell 12 1/4 p to 56 1/4 p yesterday following a warning from the company that a further deterioration in continental European car production would adversely affect full-year profits. The directors estimated that for the year as a whole production would be 20 per cent lower than in 1992. As a result, group pre-tax profits for 1993 were expected to fall from a reported Pounds 12m (restated to Pounds 7.4m for FRS 3) to 'not less than' Pounds 8.5m. Should a sale and leaseback of two factories be completed before December 31 an exceptional profit of Pounds 2m would lift the year-end figure to Pounds 10.5m.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Parties Lack Great Influence in the </F> Sub-Carpathian Region"]    [Text] Analysis of the percentages of voters who took part  in the first round of the parliamentary elections and who cast  their ballots for the nominees of this or that party in the  various districts leads us to conclude that in Ivano-Frankivsk  Oblast (in contrast to Lviv and Ternopil oblasts) most parties  do not enjoy substantial influence.    The only party which does have such influence in some places  is the KUN [expansion not given]. Its local leader, Roman  Krutsyk, garnered 58.4 percent of the votes in the Rogatynskyy  Election District. Two KUN members received 45 percent together  in the Rozhnyativskyy Election District (of the two, Orest  Dychkovskyy obtained 30.2 percent). In four other districts the  KUN candidates received from 5.3 to 6.6 percent. The KUN  demonstrated a great deal of authority and discipline when--upon  the demand or request of the regional leadership--five  candidates of this party (among them was the first deputy  minister of culture and former chairman of the oblast council,  Mykola Yakovyna) a few days before the elections withdrew their  candidacies in order to benefit the other KUN people (only one  person refused to do so).    Ranking second in the percentages of votes received was the  Communist-Socialist Bloc. As predicted at the beginning of March  by the observer of the communist newspaper, PRYKARPATSKA PRAVDA,  specifically in the Central Election District of the oblast  center, which is inhabited by a large number of Russian-speaking  people--as well as by military-service personnel and army  veterans--the candidate of the left-wing forces (the editor of  this very same newspaper, Bohdan Fedkiv) received the highest  percentage of votes in the oblast--a total amounting to 20  percent (the only readon that he did not make it to the second  round was because of the clear victory of his  opponent--Volodymyr Pylypchuk--who won the election). In the  Zaliznychyy Election District of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast the  left-wing candidates (the private entrepreneur Dmytro Shlemko  and the worker Volodymyr Baranyshyn) garnered a total of 10.1  percent of the votes. In the four other districts left-wingers  obtained totals ranging from 1 to 9.8 percent (the former first  secretary of the KPU [Ukrainian Communist Party] Obkom, Zynoviy  Kuravskyy, whose victory in the Snyatynskyy Election District  the communists were counting upon, received only 8 percent).    The chairman of the UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly] Kiev  Committee, Serhiy Hrinchuk, garnered 17.3 percent of the votes  in the Dolynskyy Election District, while two other UNA  candidates in Kolomiya and Kosova received 2.6 and 2.8 percent  respectively.    The head of the so-called "National Movement of Ukraine),"  Borys Holodyuk, received 14.6 percent of the votes in the  Zaliznychyy Election District of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, while  his comrades-in-arms in the Central and Nadvirnyanskyy election  districts garnered 0.5 and 1.5 percent respectively.    The head of the regional organization of the NRU [People's  Movement of Ukraine (Rukh)] (the Chornovol-led group), Ivan  Shovkovyy, received 7 percent of the votes in the Kolomyyskyy  Election District, while 6 other NRU candidates obtained from  0.9 to 3.8 percent (most of them are employed within the state  administrative system).    The leaders of the Ukrainian Christian Democratic Party  (UCDP), which functions de fact only in this oblast--the  Sichkos, father and son--received 1.9 and 2.1 percent  respectively.    Deputies of the previous convocation of the VRU [Ukrainian  Supreme Council] obtained the following percentages of votes in  this oblast: the chairman of the oblast council, Stepan  Volkovetskyy--61.2 percent; Pavlo Movchan--57.9 percent;  Volodymyr Pylypchuk--57.6 percent; Dmytro Zakharuk--3.1 percent;  Vasyot Kostytskyy--27 percent (first round); Petro  Osadchuk--30.2 percent; Lyubomyr Pyrih--21.2 percent; Volodymyr  Shlemko--7.7 percent; Zynoviy Duma--5.68 percent; and Bohdan  Rebryk--1.1 percent.    The hetman of the Ukrainian Cossacks, Major-General  Volodymyr  Mulyava, garnered 63.48 percent of the votes; the head of the  Union of Repressed Ukrainians, Yevgen Propyuk, received 52.1  percent; the minister of the economy, Roman Shpek received 34.1  percent; the former commander of the Ukrainian Navy,  Vice-Admiral Borysk Kozhyn, obtained 22.3 percent; and the  deputy minister of energy and electrification, Zynoviy Butso,  obtained 12.3 percent.</p>

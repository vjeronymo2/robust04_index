			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: 'Tombeaux': a busy ballet from Bintley - Clement Crisp reviews the latest work created for the Royal Ballet TOMBEAUX is David Bintley's new creation for the Royal Ballet, given its first performance on Thursday night. It is set to Walton's Variations on a theme by Hindemith, and has design by Jasper Conran. It is a plotless piece, its style academic, and it looks on first viewing as if Bintley has said to his public: 'You like steps? Then here are steps, lots and lots of steps'. There is a buzz of activity, a chatter and clatter of movement, that is rather like being trapped by a compulsive talker - one of those monsters who never seem to draw breath and never, ever, tire. As a dance-maker Bintley has unusual facility. Invention is never lacking, nor ideas, nor, indeed, a quick response to music and dramatic situation. Tombeaux is fluent in its choreography, but my initial response is to wonder what it seeks to show, other than Viviana Durante, Bruce Sansom, a quartet of men and ten women, being very busy. The title implies a memorial homage - as Walton to Hindemith - but beyond a slight and passing similarity to Ashton's Scenes de ballet (whose message of succinct classicism Bintley has not received), I can see no relevance. The piece is over-decorated: a dull front cloth and three gauzes (trees, a lion's-mouth fountain, a wash of green) do little to establish mood. Something more sombre is suggested by the girls' handsome tutus - Durante chic in black; the attendant women with blue edges to their black skirts - and the men are unflatteringly garbed in funereal long-johns, their arms bare. The score, a theme with nine variations and a closing fugue, has guided Bintley - his musical responses ever alert - but the result is oddly inconclusive. The dance has a nervous pulse. Pas de deux for Durante and Sansom look as if the choreography is seeking increasingly uneasy and tense ways for a man to manipulate a woman. The writing for the attendant groups is by turns dutifully academic or hyper-active. There are eye-catching groupings as Bintley disposes his forces with real felicity, and his rather conscious inventiveness ('Here's something new]') provides sharp imagery. I admired a thematic phrase in which Durante, supported by Sansom, took a walking step which closed into a fifth position: the effect was inevitable, vivid. The end of Tombeaux is ravishing as, on an otherwise empty stage, Sansom runs from Durante in a widening circle and leaves her in touching isolation. The abiding impression of Tombeaux, though, is of splintered patterns and choreographic stresses. It is driven dancing, uneasy in manner - the short-breathed musical form may have encouraged this response - and curiously arid. It invites, and receives, quick, bright, small-scale dancing from its cast. Tombeaux is at the centre of new Opera House triple bill which begins with Firebird. Our Fokine inheritance - and, for that matter, the Massine repertory - has continuing relevance and importance for dancers and audiences, and the Royal Ballet possesses authentic stagings of masterpieces which it has a duty to show. But if Firebird is to be understood today, it must be better done than on Thursday night. With the exception of Fiona Chadwick, flashing brilliantly through Kastchey's garden as the Firebird, casting was underpowered, and this magical vision of Holy Russia was obscured by meaningless and routine performance. Serious coaching is needed. The evening ended with William Forsythe's In the middle. Sullen, repetitious, noisy, it offers the angry physical attitudes you might expect to find in the playground of a tough, run-down comprehensive school. I find it sad to see Darcey Bussell being beaten up in these surroundings: she is too valuable to waste on such brutalisms. This triple bill is repeated at Covent Garden on Feb 17, March 10,16</p>

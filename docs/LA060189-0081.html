			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> BREAKERS HOTEL, OCEAN CENTER OFFICE BUILDING GIVEN LANDMARK STATUS  </P> <P> The Breakers Hotel and the Ocean Center Building, both on Ocean Boulevard, have  been named historical landmarks by the Long Beach City Council, giving them  some protection against demolition or radical remodelings.  </P> <P> Built in 1925 in the Spanish Renaissance style, the 13-story Breakers building  epitomized the lavish hotels of Long Beach's resort era. It was originally  known as the Wilton Hotel and was built by W. Jay Burgin. The hotel closed last  year and is being converted into senior citizen housing.  </P> <P> Just west of the Breakers is the Ocean Center Building, constructed in 1929 in  the Mediterranean Revival style and designed by Meyer and Holler, well-known  Los Angeles architects who also designed Grauman's Chinese Theater in  Hollywood.  </P> <P> Owners of historical landmarks must obtain approval from the Cultural Heritage  Commission before making any major changes in the building's appearance. The  city can also delay demolition of a landmark for up to a year while negotiating  with the owners, although if no agreement is reached, demolition would  ultimately be permitted. The owners of the Breakers and the Ocean Center, an  office building, have both indicated they wish to maintain the structures as  they are.  </P></p>

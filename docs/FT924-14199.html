			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: Relishing a right royal lifestyle - Grand Hotel / Jill James is pampered at the Ritz in Madrid I IMAGINED the Duke in his later years. Sitting at the window. Quietly. Knitting. I sat there too, one hot afternoon in Madrid, looking out over the city's rooftops. It was 32`C (90`F) outside and too hot for comfort. Inside the air-conditioned hotel suite the French carriage clock timed the silence of the years. Occupying the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's former suite at the Hotel Ritz, with its splendid views over the Prado and with the Retiro park a mere limousine's length away, I felt part of another more dignified age. It was touching to think of the aged Duke sitting at the hotel window wiling away the hours, perhaps trying to marshal his fading memories of England, as the years took their toll. Royalty has always loved the Ritz. But the days when dukes, duchesses and counts took up lengthy residence have virtually disappeared and the international business traveller is beginning to usurp its regal corridors. Of course, royalty still visits 'but it's for much shorter periods now,' concierge Luis Garcia said wistfully. A haunt of Europe's royals since Alphonso XIII founded the hotel in 1910, it is now favoured not so much by the captains of industry as by the supreme commanders. The president of Sony, is a regular. But even the most bid-weary businessmen cannot ignore the handwoven carpets, the fresh white linen, the enormous bowl of fruit, the special chocolates and the marble-tiled gold-tapped bathrooms that are part of its grand style. Neither can they ignore the antique prints, the droplet chandeliers, the beautiful flowers - the hotel has its own florist - the chairs with tassels on the tassels. Nevertheless, audio/visual equipment, simultaneous interpreters, bilingual secretaries, a limousine service, mobile telephones, personal fax lines and virtually any computer you care to name may, these days, be uppermost on the thoughts of many who choose to stay. 'Our guests are people who travel the world the whole time and they want to be received with respect and privacy by human beings and not by robots,' said Mariola Calderon, the hotel's spokeswoman. Its guests also like to eat well. And the terrace restaurant is the place to unwind after a hard day at the screen face. It has a wonderful ambience - you sit in a blue and green oasis in the heart of the capital. The restaurant is still very much a place to see and be seen. Dining at the next table when I was there last month was one of Spain's leading politicians, Jose Bono Martinez, the president of Castilla-La Mancha. Unfortunately, I caught the hotel between chefs, the former French chef having left to start his own business in northern France, so it is difficult to say what the food will be like under the new regime. But new it will be. Alfonso Jordan, the dynamic general manager, is keen to put more emphasis on Spanish cuisine - hence the search for a top Spanish chef. This is as it should be. An outstanding Spanish hotel should offer outstanding Spanish food. I chose simply grilled hake with a tomato concasse. It was perfectly cooked and wonderfully fresh. The city is famous for its seafood, which always strikes me as odd given Madrid's geographical position at the heart of Spain. The wine list could do with a little attention - there are one or two wines which are, perhaps, not worthy of such an hotel - and maybe the waiters who scurry around so self-importantly could be prepared to catch your eye a little more often. Minor quibbles perhaps, but then you are paying for perfection. And perfection does not come cheap. Room prices start at Pta 45,000 (Pounds 254.23) for a double room and Pta 39,000 for single occupancy. Those who have found the money over the years have included the honeymooning Rainiers, the Prince and Princess of Wales, diplomat Henry Kissinger, UK premier Margaret Thatcher, actors Kirk Douglas and Warren Beatty . . . the list goes on.

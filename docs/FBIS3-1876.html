Brief Review of 1993 Work </H5>   In 1993, all fronts in the municipality deeply implemented  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks and the guidelines of  the 14th party congress, conscientiously implemented the tasks  as set forth at the sixth municipal party congress and the First  Session of the 12th Municipal People's Congress, unified  thinking, quickened the pace of advance, made new headway in  various aspects on the basis of the previous achievements, and  made noticeable achievements.    The national economy developed in a sustained, fast, and  sound manner. The main economic targets could be overfulfilled  and the economic growth rate was higher than that in the  previous year. Some of them reached peak levels when compared  with those in the previous years. Positive achievements were  made in macroeconomic regulation and control. The gross  national product was expected to surpass 50 billion yuan, an  increase of about 12 percent over the previous year and the  second fastest growth year since the implementation of the  reform and opening up policy. The total industrial output value  was expected to surpass 120 billion yuan, an increase of about  24 percent. The municipality made achievements in halting  deficits and increasing profits. The rural economy developed in  a sustained manner. After combating the serious droughts, we  reaped bumper grain harvests for 10 consecutive years. The total  output value of town and township enterprises was expected to  reach 54 billion yuan, an increase of 36 percent. Markets were  brisk and there were ample supplies of commodities. The total  volume of retail sales of commodities was expected to increase  by 17 percent over the previous year. The 1993 urban and rural  capital construction tasks were better fulfilled when compared  with the previous years. A group of infrastructural facilities  were completed and began operation ahead of schedule. A total  of 2.4 million square meters of new residential houses were  built, an increase of more than 600,000 square meters over the  previous year. The investment in fixed assets was expected to  increase by 32.4 percent. The investment structure was further  optimized. The revenues increased by about 20 percent and the  revenue growth rate was higher than that in the previous 10  years or so. The urban and rural people's livelihood was  further improved.    Bigger strides were made in reform and opening up.  Enterprise reform was being deepened. The experiments with  various reforms were quickened. Approval was made in 54  shareholding enterprises. The small-sized state-owned  enterprises positively carried out the system characterized by  state ownership, civilian management, amalgamation, and  shareholding cooperation. The trend of setting up markets was  good. There were 11 state- and regional-level wholesale markets  in the province. The reform of the land utilization system and  the housing system was steadily carried out. The social  security system started to be carried out. The trend of opening  to the outside world was good. A total of 3,500 items on using  foreign capital and the relevant agreements involving $3.5  billion in investment were signed, including $2.25 billion worth  of foreign capital, respectively increasing by 100 percent, 82  percent, and 84.6 percent over the previous year. The  municipality made noticeable achievements again on the basis of  the achievements made in 1992 when the amount of foreign capital  used during the year surpassed the total volume of the previous  13 years. The developmental zones tended to develop forcefully.  The major economic targets of the development zones ranked the  municipality among the best in the whole country. Bonded areas  made noticeable achievements in the introduction of businessmen,  development, and construction. The new technology industrial  park zones developed in a sustained and faster manner. The  twelve small development zones made a good start in development.    Situations in the social and political fields of the entire  municipality were also very good. The municipality, as well as  various districts and counties, smoothly completed the  end-of-term reshuffle of their leading bodies. Party committees  and governments at all levels adhered to the principle of  "attending to two tasks simultaneously and achieving competence  in both" and won notable results in building the spiritual  civilization, improving democracy and the legal system, and  strengthening party building. Tianjin continued to be one of the  areas with the best public security in the country. The  anticorruption struggle produced remarkable achievements. Party  committees and governments at all levels established the system  to complete work within a definite time and the system for  various departments to coordinate in work. Education, science  and technology, culture and art, public health and sports,  family planning, and environmental protection all made new  headway, and an important breakthrough was achieved in producing  movies and television programs.    After the publication of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, in particular, the vast number of cadres and the  masses conducted earnest study of it in line with their thinking  and work reality. A new upsurge in the study was created very  quickly throughout the municipality, and an encouraging  situation in theoretical study unseen for many years emerged.    There were also problems and deficiencies in the work of  1993. Our economic development still lagged behind others, with  the growth of gross national product lower than national average  and economic efficiency not good enough. Some weak links still  existed in economic development and the economic structure had  yet to be adjusted more rapidly. Work proceeded in an uneven  manner, and some units lacked the sense of urgency and  responsibility. On the whole, our gap lies mainly in our  inadequacy in the depth in the emancipation of the mind, in the  extent of reform and opening up, and in the degree of economic  development.  <H3>  2. Unifying Thinking With Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Theory as  the Foundation for Successful Work </H3>   The year 1994 will be a very crucial year for Tianjin. To  win success in the work for 1994 and achieve a significant  breakthrough and development, the most important thing is to use  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics to unify our thinking and guide our  action. The theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics that Comrade Deng Xiaoping established inherits,  enriches, and develops Mao Zedong Thought, is the Marxism of  contemporary China, and is the basic guarantee for achieving  success in work and promoting reform, opening up, and the  modernization drive. We should conscientiously study Volume 3  of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the  "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th party  Central Committee in line with the reality of the current reform  and development and further enhance our understanding and unify  our thinking concerning the following issues.    A. We should profoundly understand the important idea that  "development is the essential criterion" and be more conscious  and steadfast in implementing the party's basic line. Comrade  Deng Xiaoping emphasized that development is the essential  criterion, and that "poverty is not socialism, nor is sluggish  development." We should fully understand that, as far as  Tianjin is concerned, if our development is slow and economy not  promoted in the next few years, the development in various  social undertakings will be out of the question, the existing  contradictions and problems will become increasingly  conspicuous, and people's living standard cannot be duly  improved. This is indeed a major issue concerning the future  and destiny of Tianjin and the basic interests of the 9 million  people of the municipality and also an urgent and acute issue  for the entire municipality. We should embrace a strong sense  of development, enhance our sense of urgency and responsibility,  and persistently take economic construction as the central task  without wavering. Faster development depends on the hard work  of everyone. All the people have the responsibility and should  feel the pressure, and all departments and individuals should  take the initiative in serving this public interest and channel  their work to the track of faster development of the  municipality.    B. We should profoundly understand the importance of  "seizing the opportunity" and become more urgent in accelerating  development. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out on many  occasions: "Do not miss the opportunity." For China, there are  not many opportunities for effecting a large-scale development."  We must foster a strong sense of opportunity. We should  profoundly understand that whether we are good at seizing the  opportunity is the key question to decide whether we can gain  the initiative in accelerating development. The year 1994  provides a hard-won opportunity for Tianjin. When viewed from  the current situation at home and abroad and from the situation  of Tianjin, there are many favorable conditions for accelerating  development, but there are also many difficulties. When viewed  from the overall situation, however, we are indeed faced with  the historical opportunity of effecting a large-scale  development. All comrades must approach this issue from an  overall and strategic point of view. Lacking the sense of  urgency in seizing the opportunity and in accelerating  development means lacking the sense of responsibility for our  undertakings. Being unable to seize the opportunity and to  accelerate development means bungling major matters and means,  so far as leading cadres are concerned, dereliction of duties  and irresponsibility for the party's cause and the people. We  must seize the opportunity without any delay and slackness so as  to bring forth a new vigorous situation of racing against time  to accelerate Tianjin's reform, opening up, and economic  development.    C. We should profoundly understand the "quintessence" of  "emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts" and should  conscientiously break away with all sorts of ideas that hamper  the rapid development of the economy. When making an inspection  tour of Tianjin in 1986, Comrade Deng Xiaoping demanded us to  "take bolder steps and effect a faster development." He also  pointed out: "Without the pioneering spirit, we cannot break a  good path and a new path and cannot pioneer a new cause."  Leading cadres at all levels must even more consciously persist  in the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking  truth from fact and must further emancipate the mind. On the  premise of conforming to the standard of "being conducive to  developing socialist productive forces, to building up the  comprehensive strength of the socialist country, and to  improving the people's living standards," we should dare to  reform the conventions that are detrimental to developing the  socialist market economy, dare to pioneer the new path for  emancipating and developing the socialist productive forces,  dare to promote reform and development, and dare to overcome the  ideas of sticking to conventions and being content with the  existing state of affairs. We should foster lofty ideals, aim  high, dare to create a new situation, and resolutely overcome  the ideas of blaming god and men and attempting and  accomplishing nothing. We should be more urgent in accelerating  the development of Tianjin, be more brave in doing pioneering  work, be more enthusiastic in dedicating ourselves to the state.  We should enhance our morale and work energetically to achieve  self-respect, self-improvement, and self-confidence. We should  arouse ourselves for vigorous efforts to make the country  prosperous, should be bold in making innovations, and should  work hard to pioneer new undertakings so as to restore the  magnificent view of Tianjin. We should truly achieve  dialectical integration in the fields of emancipating the mind  and seeking truth from facts. Now that we are doing our best to  accelerate economic development, we should accelerate it as fast  as possible and act according to our capability in order to  avoid losses, serious losses in particular.    D. We should profoundly understand the principle of "taking  a two-handed approach and being touch with both hands" and  actually build well the spiritual civilization in order to  create favorable conditions for accelerating economic  development. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out on many  occasions that we should "take a two-handed approach and being  tough with both hands." Under the new situation, we should  truly have the sense of urgency in two aspects and embark on new  stages in two aspects, that is, we should enhance the sense of  urgency and the sense of responsibility not only in accelerating  economic development but also in building spiritual civilization  and should push both economic construction and spiritual  civilization construction onto new stages. Leaders at all  levels should keep sober-minded, enhance consciousness,  strengthen initiative, and strive for attaining new levels in  order to ensure the smooth progress of Tianjin's reform, opening  up, and modernization drive.  <H3>  3. The Major Tasks of 1994 in Reform, Opening Up, and in  Economic and Social Development </H3>   The general demands of the municipal work in 1994 are to  comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th party  congress and of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the party's basic line, seize the opportunity to accelerate the  pace of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive,  maintain a sustained, speedy, and sound development, strengthen  the building of spiritual civilization, promote comprehensive  social progress, and achieve breakthroughs and major development  in expediting the establishment of the socialist market economic  structure and prefulfilling the second-step development  objectives.    In 1994, party committees and governments at all levels must  concentrate greater energy on accelerating reform and expediting  development. They must propose ideas for realizing the work  objective of deepening reform, expanding opening up, and  accelerating economic and social development, and further  deepening the emancipation of the mind; expand the degree of  reform and opening up, and adopt major measures; achieve great  breakthroughs in all undertakings by making earnest efforts to  do practical work and firmly implementing measures; and attain  the goal of seizing the opportunity and realizing great  development. In work guidance, we must pay attention to  grasping five principles well.    First, we should attend to the relationship between the  quantity and quality of economic development. We should always  persist in taking economic construction as the central task, and  concentrate efforts on pushing economic construction forward. In  developing the economy, we must have new ideas and realistically  channel our ideas to the path of taking enhancement of economic  efficiency as the central task. Regarding all economic targets,  we must adopt measures to fulfill them with earnest efforts,  continue to attend to the work of ending deficits and increasing  profits, and through raising economic efficiency, enable  financial departments at all levels to collect more revenue,  enterprises to earn more profits (money-losing enterprises to  further reduce deficits), and the broad masses of workers to  increase more income in an effort to unceasingly raise the  living standards of the Tianjin people. In developing the  economy, we should pay attention to the increase in total supply  and demands, raise the quality, exert efforts to readjust the  structure, strengthen management, achieve technological  progress, and raise efficiency in an effort to combine rate with  economic returns.    Second, we should attend to the relations of reform,  development and stability. Since development is our aim and  reform is the motivation and fundamental way of development, we  should cultivate the idea of relying on reform to accelerate  development. In addition, we should fully understand that only  under the condition of maintaining social stability can reform,  opening up, and economic development be smoothly carried out.  We should accelerate economic development by deepening reform  and expanding opening up. In making arrangements for economic  work, we should pay attention to creating a fairly relaxed  environment for reform. In 1994, the whole country will make  big strides in reform and issue many measures which will involve  the readjustment of some patterns of interests. We must do  in-depth and meticulous work to prepare for the issuance of  measures, properly handle all contradictions and problems,  maintain a stable political and social environment, and create  good conditions for smoothly promote reform and development.    Third, we should attend to the relationship between  advancing  the work in an all-round manner and making breakthroughs in  some major aspects. The municipality as a whole should make big  strides in all fields of work, seek improvements, achieve major  progress, and comprehensively promote the work. meanwhile, we  should firmly grasp the major work and important aspects that  affect the overall situation, and never lose opportunity to seek  breakthroughs in some major aspects. In the work objective,  the increase of major economic targets, such as the GNP, and all  major work should be better than that of 1993; great  breakthroughs should be made in major work and some weak  aspects; and efforts should be made to maintain a certain level  in some aspects and to strive to march towards the front rank of  the country.    Fourth, we should handle well the relationship between  faster economic development and comprehensive social progress.  While accelerating reform, opening up, and economic development,  we should attach great importance to the development of various  social undertakings, conscientiously strengthen the spiritual  civilization, democracy, legal system, and comprehensive  management of public security, safeguard political and social  stability, maintain coordinated economic and social development,  and promote comprehensive social progress.    Fifth, we should handle well the relationship between  consolidation and improvement on the one hand and innovation and  development on the other. We should greatly value, earnestly  persist in, and continuously improve and upgrade the good work  foundation, traditions, experiences, and methods that have taken  shape in Tianjin over the past many years. We should also  continuously achieve innovation and development to comply with  the new situation. Regarding the major issues concerning the  overall situation and the existing weak links, in particular, we  should all the more adopt major measures and open up a new  situation.    To meet the general requirements of Tianjin's work for 1994,  we should pay attention to the following 15 tasks.    A. We should deepen enterprise reform, transform the  operating mechanism, and gradually establish a modern enterprise  system.    Accelerating enterprise reform is the most important task  for  deepening reform. All enterprises in the municipality,  especially state-owned large and medium-sized ones, should  achieve a breakthrough in transforming the operating mechanism.  First, we should continue to thoroughly enforce the "enterprise  law" and the "regulations" and delegate to enterprises all the  powers and responsibilities they should hold. Second, we should  accelerate the reform of the organizational, managerial,  financial, and accounting systems of enterprises. Enterprises'  inner accounting units should be made smaller based on the  actual conditions, and a market mechanism should be established  within enterprises. We should streamline enterprises' inner  managerial levels and personnel and comprehensively facilitate  and further deepen their reform of the labor, personnel, and  wage systems. Third, relevant government departments should  change their functions, make less interventions, and provide  more service so that enterprise can have a free hand in  management. More than 80 percent of Tianjin's state-owned  enterprises should meet the requirements on transformation of  the operating mechanism by 1994.    We should conduct reform of enterprises' property right  system in an active and prudent manner. State-owned large and  medium-sized enterprises with sole investor may be reorganized  into sole-invested companies when conditions permit; and those  with multiple investors may be reorganized into limited  liability companies or limited liability stock companies whose  stocks are issued to definite units. Some should make active  efforts to win state approval for reorganizing themselves into  limited liability stock companies which issue stocks publicly to  society, including foreign countries; others may cooperate with  foreign firms to establish limited liability companies or  limited liability stock companies; and still others may  institute the cooperative shareholding system. New or expanded  enterprises should adopt the new mechanism and enforce the  company system. We should actively develop the enterprise  groups linked mainly by property right and should expand the  merge and cooperation between enterprises. These types of  reform should be conducted in the 100 budgetary state-owned  large and medium-sized industrial enterprises that we have  arranged. Regarding small state-owned enterprises, their  management should be actively contracted or leased out to people  while their state-owned status remaining unchanged, or they may  adopt the cooperative shareholding system to them. Some of them  may be sold to collectives or individuals. Small state-owned  commercial enterprises should actively conduct these types of  reform, and 90 percent of them should do so in 1994. Proceeding  from reality, urban and rural collective enterprises may be  reorganized into shareholding enterprises or cooperative  shareholding enterprises when conditions permit. We should  implement the "regulations on the supervision and management of  the property of state-owned enterprises" in an orderly manner;  make an inventory and check of the property, define property  right, and clarify debts receivable and debts payable; and  achieve success in the experimental work to reduce enterprises'  burden of debts, to increase the proportion of enterprises' own  circulating funds, and to authorize property management right.  Thirty enterprises should be selected to experiment with the  modern enterprise system.    It is necessary to further quicken the readjustment of the  enterprise organizational structure and the industrial  structure. The assets should be reorganized and the reasonable  distribution of production factors should be pressed forward in  line with the measures of amalgamation, transfer, auctioning,  and bankruptcy. The enterprises that suffer long-term losses  due to poor management should be closed down, suspended, merge  with others, or shift their lines of production.  Simultaneously, these enterprises can use their existing areas,  workshops, and infrastructural facilities to positively develop  the diversified economy. The small number of state-owned  enterprises that are hopeless to halt deficits and have no ways  for shifting their lines of production should settle their  accounts and declare bankruptcy according to laws.    Proceeding from reality, enterprises are allowed to select  the reform methods suitable to themselves. On the premise of  paying taxes according to laws and guaranteeing and adding the  value of state-owned assets, we should try every possible means  to enliven enterprises.    B. It is necessary to quicken the reform in the circulation  sphere and cultivate and develop the market system.    We should foster the awareness of developing large-scale  commerce and trade, cultivating large markets, and enlivening  the circulation sphere on a large scale; be determined to  quicken the pace of cultivating and developing the market  system; and strive to build the municipality into a commercial  and trade commercial center in north China.    We should exert great efforts to well run the existing  markets. The established national and regional markets for  capital goods and the markets for various commodities should  strive to build themselves into the first-grade markets in the  country and enhance their influential power and attractiveness.  Wholesale markets should be set up for bulk agriculture  produce, industrially produced consumer goods, and capital  goods. A group of large-scale and high- quality commodity  markets should newly be built and reconstructed. Several  large-sized goods purchasing centers should be set up. Another  group of specialized wholesale markets and overall trade fairs  should be developed in the areas linking the urban areas with  the rural ones. Various categories of markets should be sure  that business is brisk so as to expand and enliven their  business. The total commodity purchasing and marketing volume  and the total volume of retail sales of commodities should  increase by a big margin. It is necessary to quicken the  development of the markets for various production factors.  Emphasis should be placed on setting up labor markets, skilled  persons exchange and service centers, technology markets,  information markets, real estate markets, construction markets,  and markets for transfer of enterprise property rights. It is  necessary to firmly grasp the construction of a state-level  technological trading market in north China. Particularly, we  should vigorously develop banking markets and positively open  stock exchange centers and gold trading centers in Tianjin. We  should positively develop such self-disciplined organizations as  professional intermediate organizations of market, trade  associations, and chambers of commerce. By dividing duties, all  departments should positively support the setup of markets,  abolish "unnecessary outposts," enthusiastically offer service,  and try all possible means to bring in more skilled persons,  goods, and capital.    C. We should conscientiously implement the state  macroeconomic reform measures and positively achieve the reform  of the income distribution, social security, land utilization,  and housing systems.    In 1994, the country as a whole should make bigger strides  in  reforming the financial, tax revenue, financial, investment,  foreign trade, and planning systems. Resolutely in line with  the unified arrangements of the central authorities, we should  proceed from the overall situation, make a unified arrangement,  and carefully organize forces for implementation. We should  conscientiously work out and implement plans, positively and  steadily coordinate with various fronts, actively suit various  reform requirements, and further improve and strengthen the  macroeconomic regulation and control.    It is necessary to set up a reasonable individual income  distribution system. On the premise that the increase rate of  the wage bills of the staff and workers is lower than the  enterprise economic efficiency growth rate and the enterprise  labor productivity growth rate, the state-owned enterprises  should decontrol the management of their wages. That is,  enterprises have the right to deciding their wage levels and  internal distribution forms. We should conscientiously reform  the wage system of organs and institutions. The administrative  organs should carry out the state functionary system and the  state functionary wage system. The institutions with conditions  are able to carry out the enterprise wage system.    We should establish a multi-layered social security system,  and take active and reliable steps to accelerate reform of the  old-age pension, unemployment, and medical insurance systems for  workers. It is necessary to actively promote reform of the land  utilization system, give full play to our municipality's  advantages of land resources, adopt flexible forms, speed up the  pace to invite business and investments, and achieve great  breakthroughs in the scale of transferring land-use rights and  in introducing foreign capital. We should further expedite the  pace of reforming the housing system in cities and towns, give  simultaneous attention to selling, renting and building houses  while giving due emphasis to selling publicly owned houses,  adopt supporting policies to form a market so as to accelerate  the commercialization and socialization of houses.    D. We should realistically change government functions and  actively carry out organizational reform.    In line with the central plans and the principle of  separating government functions from enterprise management,  streamlining organs, adopting unified plans, and paying  attention to efficacy, we conscientiously conduct reform of the  administrative management system and organizational reform,  promote the public servant system, and achieve breakthrough  progress in changing the government functions. Governments  should not manage enterprise affairs or directly interfere with  their production and management activities, and should decontrol  their operation. As for macroeconomic activities which must be  managed, the governments should reduce and simplify procedures  and raise the working efficiency; they should realistically  shift the emphasis of work to working out overall plans,  attending to policies, using information guidance, organizing  and coordinating the work, providing service, and inspecting and  supervising the work. In short, we should strive not to  interfere with the work of enterprise, give less interference,  give more services, help the grass roots and enterprises  eliminate misgivings and difficulties, and do more practical  things for them.    E. We should further expand opening up to all directions,  both domestically and internationally, and accelerate the pace  of using foreign capital.    We should open the municipality to all directions, to the  higher layer, a broader sphere, and in a comprehensive manner,  and regard using foreign capital of a larger scale as a  prominent task. In 1994, the whole municipality should strive  to reach agreements in directly using a total of more than $5  billion in foreign capital, of which, more than $3.5 billion  should be investments from foreign businessmen. All trades and  professions should be bold and given a free hand in using  foreign capital. It is necessary to make major breakthroughs in  building infrastructure facilities, carrying out major  industrial items, conducting grafting and transformation in old  enterprises, and attracting big financial groups and  trans-country companies to build large projects, develop real  estate, and develop the tertiary industry. In addition to  grasping major items, we should not neglect small ones. Through  two years of efforts, we should strive to make 50 percent of  industrial enterprises, of which, two-thirds of budgetary  industrial enterprises, use foreign capital. We should attend  to the signed foreign capital items and speed up their  construction and operation as quickly as possible. All  committees, offices, and bureaus, and all districts and counties  should realistically strengthen leadership, encourage the top  leaders to grasp this work personally, assign one leading  comrade to manage it specifically, and establish special organs  or work groups to take charge of the work. We should regard  using foreign capital as an essential task, share the targets to  all departments and localities, and conduct evaluation in line  with the demand of the "six ratios." Personnel who contribute to  introducing foreign capital should be awarded.    We should make strenuous efforts to improve the investment  environment. It is necessary to uphold and improve the system of  completing the examination and approval procedures in "one  place," giving "integrated" service, and jointly handling  official work, actively create conditions for running the  existing foreign-funded enterprises well, improve the relevant  policies, laws, and regulations, do a good job in conducting  external propaganda, strive to build our municipality into one  of the areas with the best investment environment in our  province, enable the domestic and foreign businessmen feel an  ease of mind in making investments and convenient in doing  things in Tianjin, and that they can earn money from production  and operation, and can be guaranteed in their legal rights and  interests.    Economic and technological zone, free trade zone, and the  new-tech industrial park are the showcases and a dragon head of  Tianjin in opening to the outside world. During this year, we  must have new ideas, adopt new measures, accelerate the pace of  development and construction, and strive to take the lead in all  fields of work in the whole country.    A large-scale increase should be made in foreign export  trade. We should further rationalize the foreign trade  management system, transform the mechanism of foreign trade  enterprises, and guide foreign trade enterprises to take the  road of integration, industrialization, and  internationalization. Non-foreign trade enterprises should be  encouraged to deal in exports independently and strengthen their  ability of dealing in export and earning foreign exchange.    An even greater steps should be taken in the opening to the  domestic areas. Tianjin should be opened wider to other places,  and service should be improved in order to promote integrations  through good service and promote development through  integrations. Central departments and the places other than  Tianjin should be attracted to make investment actively in  Tianjin. The important role of their agencies stationed in  Tianjin should be brought into full play. Emphasis should be  placed on the integrations and coordination among Beijing,  Tianjin, and Hebei in order to commonly build the "large  Beijing-Tianjin economic circle" in line with the principles of  being integrated to make the best possible use of advantages and  to make up for the deficiency, making overall plans, and  effecting a common development. Great efforts should be made to  strengthen the economic integrations and coordination with the  areas in north, northeast, and northwest China, and, in  particular, with various fraternal provinces and municipalities  in the areas around Bohai Bay.    F. We should accelerate the pace of readjustment and  optimize economic structure.    The acceleration of economic development must be based on  optimization of structure and improvement of economic returns.    Great efforts should be made to readjust product mix. All  categories of enterprises in the municipality should fix their  eyes on the market and try every possible means to readjust  their product mix. They should renew old products and develop  new products in a timely manner to make their products more  competitive and marketable. Through the endeavor of one to two  years, we should turn out a large number of new fine-quality,  brand-name, or competitive products in order to restore the  magnificent appearance of Tianjin's industry.    We should further attend to the readjustment of industrial  structure. In this aspect, emphasis should be placed on  developing energy resources, communications and  telecommunications, and basic raw materials industries and on  turning out the products that coordinate the production of  pillar industries and key foreign-invested enterprises of three  types. Positive support should be given to light industrial and  textile industrial enterprises to open up new paths and change  mechanism. Construction of water, power, gas, and heat supply  facilities and construction of roads and other infrastructure  facilities should be accelerated to enhance cities' functions as  the carrier. Great efforts should be put in accelerating the  building of ports. Great efforts should also be made in  developing commercial trade, storage of goods, financial  insurance, transportation and communications, service to  residents, information consultation, labor export, and all sorts  of professional intermediate service trades. Development of  tourism with Tianjin's characteristics should be expedited.  Real estate trade should be developed rapidly on a priority  basis. Domestic and foreign investment should be absorbed from  a wide range to form a pattern of developing the tertiary  industry in diverse forms, through diverse channels, and at  diverse levels.    Attention should be paid to readjusting investment  structure,  with emphasis on improving economic returns. Capital  construction projects and technological transformation projects  should be arranged in line with the principles of conforming to  industrial policies, having good markets, and having good  economic returns in order to spend the money on where they are  needed most.    G. We should actually strengthen management work and ask for  good economic returns, efficiency, and levels from management.    First, we should pay attention to management of enterprises.  We should vigorously grasp the management of basic projects and  special-purpose projects, strictly enforce rules of operation  and various regulations and systems, strictly enforce labor  discipline, straighten out production order, and achieve results  in cutting production cost and improving quality. Second, we  should grasp management of work. All departments and units  should conscientiously perform various regulations and systems  and strictly enforce work discipline in order to establish a  good work order and constantly improve work efficiency and  expertise. Third, we should grasp the management of trades.  The emphasis of this work is to strengthen the overall,  coordination, guidance, and service work. Fourth, we should  grasp the management of safety. The system of assuming  responsibility for the safety in production should be carried  out conscientiously and the various safety control system should  be executed strictly so as to eliminate all sorts of hidden  peril, prevent the emergence of accidents of all kinds, and  ensure the safety of state property and of the people. Fifth, we  should pay attention to the management of investment. The  project owner responsibility system should be applied to  construction projects, and the progress of construction should  be guaranteed, the quality of the projects upgraded, and the  efficiency of investment improved. Sixth, we should pay  attention to social management. we should strengthen the  management of the overall plan of the city and establish and  improve the scientific and strict managerial methods. We should  strengthen management of the city appearance, municipal  administration, environmental protection, and environmental  sanitation and improve the management and service of the units  and departments that serve as "windows" so that Tianjin can  become a city with a beautiful environment, a good order, and  quality service. All departments and units should bear in mind  Tianjin's status as the municipality under the direct  jurisdiction of the central government when considering all  their work, exert great efforts to strengthen management, and  ensure high standards and strict requirements so that all work  will have good efficiency and high level.    H. We should make great efforts to cultivate and develop new  growing points of the economy.    We should make great efforts to cultivate and develop more  new growing points of the economy to maintain the vigorous  economic growth, promote faster economic development, and  enhance the capacity for long-term development. First, we  should have more courage to develop township enterprises and  foreign-invested enterprises, increase their number, expand  their scale, raise their level, and improve their efficiency.  We should relax policies and actively develop the individual  and private economies. We should develop the neighborhood  economy more rapidly in line with specific local conditions. We  should adopt effective measures to speed up the  industrialization of high and new technology. Second, from  large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, we should develop  a number of backbone enterprises and a number of highly  competitive products which can exert a great influence, make  great contributions, reflect advanced domestic and world levels,  serve as models in reform and management, and pay large amounts  of taxes and profits. We should carry out the "222 project."  That is, we should make a success of the two key enterprises --  the Auto Industrial General Company and the Steep Tube Company,  make a success of the 20 municipal-level key enterprises, and  make a success of the 200 key enterprises of various bureaus,  districts, and counties. Third, we should speed up the  construction of the ethylene, the polyester, and other key  capital construction and technical transformation projects and  make the investment yield returns as soon as possible. Fourth,  we should learn from the opening up and development of  Shanghai's Pudong New Area to accelerate the opening up and  development of Tianjin's coastal new area and strive to build it  into an area with coordinated development of finance, commerce,  foreign trade, and other trades of the tertiary industry, which  is centering on the harbor, the development zone, and the bonded  zone, guided by new and export-oriented industries, and based on  several pillar industries in about 10 years. We should organize  forces from all quarters to step up formulation of specific  plans and definite targets and put them into practice as soon as  possible.    I. We should conscientiously strengthen agriculture and  rural work.    We should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the  national rural work conference, attach great importance to  agriculture and rural work, further strengthen the fundamental  position of agriculture, persist in the integrated and common  development of urban and rural areas, and speed up Tianjin's  agricultural modernization. The general requirements are to  actively develop high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient  agriculture; to achieve faster development of township  enterprises; to greatly promote the spiritual civilization in  rural areas; and to substantially increase peasants' income.    We should continue to stabilize and improve the  responsibility system with household-based and output-related  contracts as the major form and the dual management system  combining unified operation with independent operation.  Operations adaptable to scaled economy may be adopted based on  the voluntary participation of the masses. We should improve  the rural socialized service system, greatly develop the  integrated management of trade, industry, and agriculture and  the coordinated operation of production, processing, and  marketing, and actively cultivate the rural market system. We  should increase the investment in agriculture through various  channels and intensify construction of the basic facilities for  agriculture to enhance the capacity to resist floods and other  natural disasters. We should pay great attention to developing  agriculture with science and technology and increase the  investment in science and technology. On the premise that a  steady increase in grain production is guaranteed and the  "shopping basket" project is made successful, we should actively  adjust the structure of agriculture and the production setup of  rural areas and expand the diversified economy. We should  continue to successfully reduce the burdens on peasants and  enterprises.    Town and township enterprises should further accelerate the  pace of development and develop as quickly as possible. We  should firmly attend to implementing the "project for rising to  a new height in the Eighth Five-Year Plan period." We should  positively carry out the share holding system, develop  enterprise associations, boldly use foreign capital to conduct  technological transformation, develop joint ventures, and  further enhance enterprise vitality. We should pay attention to  technological transformation and strive to expand the scale and  to improve quality. It is necessary to develop increasingly  more townships, villages, enterprises, and enterprise  associations that each generates over 100 million yuan or 1  billion yuan of output value annually.    J. We should rely on science, technology, and education to  rejuvenate the economy of Tianjin.    It is necessary to further implement the principle of  relying  on science and technology to rejuvenate the municipality and  increase the proportion of scientific and technological progress  in economic development. We should organize scientific and  technological forces to tackle major technological problems  cropping up in the course of production and construction while  assimilating imported technologies and blazing new trails in  importing technologies. We should pay attention to bringing  into play the roles of the central scientific research  organizations stationed in Tianjin. The existing scientific and  technological findings should be popularized and applied as soon  as possible. It is also necessary to set up a system for  tracing and assessing the popularization and application of  scientific and technological findings. It is necessary to speed  up the construction of new technology park zones and to firmly  work out and begin implementation of the plan for building a  corridor of science and technology along the  Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway. Applied research, development  research, and scientific and technological service organizations  should gradually carry out enterprise management. From now on,  we should link the allocation of funds to scientific research  units engaged in applied research according to efficiency gained  from popularizing and applying scientific research findings.  Civilian-run scientific research organizations should be  developed positively.    Education is the foundation for rejuvenating the  municipality  with science and technology. We should conscientiously  implement the guidelines of the municipal educational work  conference; quicken the pace of reforming the educational system  and developing education; exert efforts to grasp the fulfillment  of the work tasks; ensure that thinking, work arrangements, and  guarantee measures are put in place; and make noticeable headway  in deepening the reform of the educational system, enhancing  vitality in running schools, upgrading the quality of education  and the efficiency from running schools, and serving economic  construction.    We should further form a strong social practice of  respecting  knowledge and skilled persons, pay high attention to and  realistically achieve work toward intellectuals, and mobilize  and encourage the broad masses of intellectuals to make more  contributions to the municipality's reform and development.    K. The eighteen districts and counties should bring their  roles into full play.    We should exert great efforts to enliven districts and  counties, delegate power to districts and counties, and bring  their different functions into better play. In line with the  principle of integrating responsibility with rights and profits  alongside human, financial, and material resources, we should  balance the relationship between the municipality and districts  and counties. On the basis of clearly dividing the affairs and  rights of the governments at these two different levels, we  should reasonably define the scale and base figures of revenues  and expenditures and enable districts and counties to retain  more when their revenues increase. The affairs relating to  regions and suitable to management by districts and counties  should be managed by districts and counties. The departments  concerned should work out specific plans, implement them as soon  as possible, and ensure that rights should be delegated in a  coordinated manner.    In line with the requirements for changing government  functions, districts and counties should quicken reform of the  self-management system, appropriately simplify administrative  procedures and delegate powers to lower levels, and better  handle affairs originally managed and assigned by the  municipality.    L. We should do our best to seek benefits for the masses and  do real deeds for the people.    The leading cadres at various levels should ensure that they  keep the masses in mind, do things for the masses, and rely on  the masses to do their work; and continue to persistently do 20  good deeds for the urban and rural dwellers in line with the 10  requirements as defined by the municipal party committee. In  1994, we should improve the work of doing concrete deeds for the  people and pay particular attention to work in the following  three aspects: First, we should exert efforts to promote the  economy, ceaselessly increase the income of the urban and rural  people, create more real benefits for the people, and also pay  attention to solving the problems for staff members and workers  with living difficulties. Second, we should grasp the  management of markets and goods prices and control price hikes.  Third, in line with the implementation of the "project of  living in peace," we should exert efforts to grasp the housing  construction and the reconstruction of dangerous and shabby one-  story houses, and set historical records in the areas where  houses are built and completed.    M. We should further strengthen the building of the  spiritual civilization.    In propaganda and ideological work, we should greatly  advocate the major melody and persist in the unity between the  major melody and diverse work to raise people's spirit and boost  their morale. We should intensify the ideological and moral  education with patriotism, collectivism, and socialism as the  major content, advocate the pioneering spirit of the new era,  guide the people, especially young people, to develop the  traditional virtues of the Chinese nation, and train the new  people who have lofty ideals and moral characters and are better  educated and self-disciplined. We should strengthen ideological  and political work, oppose money worship, ultra-individualism,  and the influence of corrupt styles of life with a clear-cut  stand, and resist the erosion of capitalist and feudal ideas.  In press and publication work, we should persist in the correct  guidance of the media. In cultural and art work, we should make  active efforts to create healthy and progressive intellectual  products. We should also achieve success in science and  technology, education, public health, sports, afforestation,  environmental protection, and family planning to promote  comprehensive social progress.    Seizing the opportunity of hosting the 12th Asian Table  Tennis Games and the 43d World Table Tennis Games, we should  launch large-scale activities to "build a civilized city and  become civilized citizens." We should widely publicize the  theme of the games -- "peace, friendship, prosperity,  development." Focusing on the trades that serve as "windows,"  we should extensively launch the emulation activities to "make  people satisfied in Tianjin" and to "create good quality and  attain targets," strive for first-rate service, first-rate  quality, and first-rate efficiency, display Tianjin's outlook,  and win honor for Tianjin and for the state.    N. We should strengthen socialist democratic politics and  the legal system.    Aiming at accelerating Tianjin's reform, opening up, and  economic development, people's congresses at all levels and  their standing committees should exercise the power entrusted by  the Constitution and laws, give full play to the role of  people's deputies, speed up local legislation, and strengthen  legal supervision. We should fully develop the role of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference committees at  all levels in political consultation and democratic supervision.  We should strengthen the consultation with democratic parties  to develop the advantages of all quarters. Trade unions, the  Communist Youth League, women's federations, and other mass  organizations should play their role still better as the bridges  and channels for the party to establish ties with the masses.  We should conscientiously implement the party's policies on  nationalities, religions, and overseas Chinese affairs and  strengthen the work directed toward Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao,  and Overseas Chinese.    We should conscientiously enforce the laws, administrative  regulations, and local regulations issued by the state. We  should step up the legal system and further establish and  improve local regulations. We should strengthen and improve the  law-enforcement by judicial and administrative departments and  the supervision over law-enforcement. We should intensify the  "Second Five-Year Plan" for the education to disseminate laws to  enhance all the people's sense of respect for laws and the legal  system.    O. We should step up efforts to comprehensively manage  public  security to safeguard social stability.    Leaders at all levels should regard the work to safeguard  Tianjin's political and social stability as a major task to  accomplish. They should conscientiously enforce the  "regulations of Tianjin municipality on comprehensive management  of public security." Following the principle that "those in  charge hold responsibility," they should pool the efforts of  different departments and different areas, with the focus on the  latter, and establish a strict responsibility system for  attaining the work targets of comprehensive management of public  security. We should continue to adhere to the principle of  meting out prompt and strict punishment according to law,  sternly crack down on criminal offenses that seriously endanger  public security and serious economic offenses, and continue the  activities to "wipe out pornography" and eliminate the "six  vices" to purify the social environment. Public security,  procuratorial, and judicial departments should achieve success  in their own reform, improve their work systems, upgrade their  work levels, and ensure strict law-enforcement.  <H3>  4. We Should Strengthen Leadership, Implement  Responsibilities, Unite as One, Make Earnest Efforts To Do  Practical Work, and Guarantee the Fulfillment of All Tasks in  1994 </H3>   A. We should further strengthen the building of the party  and the party's leadership.    Strenuous efforts should be made to strengthen the building  of leading bodies. We should build leading bodies at all levels  into strong collectives that are firm in politics, and have  courage to reform, do practical things, blaze new trials, work  in unity and coordination, perform their administrative work  honestly, maintain close relations with the masses of people,  and comprehensively implement the party's basic line. We should  conscientiously implement the principle of building ranks of  cadres of "political integrity who are young, better educated  and professional competent", the principle of choosing cadres  with both ability and political integrity, and the principle of  attending to political achievements and selecting the best  through competition while building the leading bodies, make  bigger strides in selecting outstanding young cadres, and do a  better job in the exchange and readjustment of cadres. We  should entrust cadres with outstanding achievements, good  ideology and work style, and who enjoy mass support,  particularly outstanding young cadres, with heavy tasks and  boldly use them.    We should continue to attend to the building of grass-roots  party organizations and enhance the cohesion and fighting  strength of the party organizations. We should further  strengthen the building of enterprise party organizations in  line with the guiding principle of "giving full play to the core  political role of enterprise party organizations, upholding and  improving the plant director responsibility system, and  wholeheartedly relying on the working class."    We should strengthen the building of party style and  administrative honesty and continue to deepen anticorruption  struggle in a down-to-earth manner. Leading cadres at all  levels should be clean and self-diciplined, do their  administrative work honestly, and serve as good examples. It is  necessary to concentrate efforts on investigating and handling  major and appalling cases and continue to conscientiously check  the unhealthy trends which the masses show strong reaction. We  should persist in unswervingly conducting education on party  style, party discipline and clean politics, pay attention to  building and improving the mechanism of supervision and  restraint, and perfect the responsibility system in building  party style and administrative honesty.    B. We should actively strengthen study and training and  raise  the quality of cadres and the worker contingents.    The realization of Tianjin's grand objective of reform and  development is chiefly determined by the quality of the ranks of  cadres and workers. Grasping study and training well is not  only an urgent task but also a long-term plan. We should form a  study atmosphere in the whole municipality and conduct various  froms of study and training activities. While attending to the  study of theories, Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, and the "decision of the CPC central Committee on  some issues concerning the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure," we should strive to gain knowledge, and  study science, technology and professional knowledge, as well as  foreign languages in line with the requirements of our work. We  should arrange for the training content in line with the  principle of "learning the most useful," study what we do not  know and make up for the lessons we miss. It is necessary to  conscientiously formulate study and training plans and to  establish necessary systems.    Leading cadres at and above the district, county, and bureau  level should do a good job in training as well as in leading the  study. It is necessary to create conditions for cadres and  workers to study and to undergo training, prepare training  funds, and guarantee them time for study. We should extensively  conduct a municipality-wide activity on "comparing with one  another in the achievements of study, professional skills, and  contributions." Relevant departments and mass organizations  should play a positive role in promoting this municipality-wide  study and training activity.    C. We should comprehensively promote the work target  responsibility system, improve work style, raise efficiency, and  firmly carry out this system.    We should comprehensively carry out this system in all party  and government organs and departments, and enable them to meet  high standards and set strict demands, and standardize and  institutionalize this system. We should share the  municipality's major economic and social development targets and  tasks to all levels and urge them to implement them. Those that  can be measured should be measured for evaluation, and those  which cannot be evaluated with measurements should be given  criteria for evaluation of work. Both economic departments and  non-economic departments and various regions and departments  should all be assigned with specific targets and tasks so that  everyone has pressures and targets on their shoulders. In  fixing targets, we should manifest the spirit of accelerating  development and should set specific demands on time limits,  progress rate, quantity, and quality. Some important items of  work should be defined with the signing of letters of  responsibility at each level. In carrying out the system  concerning public service, we should consider the fulfillment of  the assigned targets as an important content to assess official  performance of leading bodies and leading cadres. In this  aspect, each level should assume responsibility for its own work  and supervise the work of the next lower level. Leading organs  at higher levels should give good guidance to the work and  supervise and examine the work of lower levels in order to truly  yield results in this aspect.    We should effect a big change in work style. Subjectivism,  bureaucratism, and formalism should be overcome. We should tell  the truth, do tangible things, and strive for practical results,  rather than indulging in boasting, exaggeration, and  fraudulence. Great efforts should be made to reduce the number  of meetings and ordinary activities. Leading cadres at or above  the district and county levels should use at least one third of  the year to delve deeply into the realities of life to conduct  investigation and study. We should continue to persist in and  perfect the good methods of "jointly handling affairs" and  "handling affairs within a set time" that will help improve work  efficiency. Leading organs should pay high attention to  coordinating work well.    D. We should depend on the broad masses of the people and  mobilize all positive factors to accomplish 1994's tasks.    We should further persist in the idea of doing everything  for  the people and relying on the people to do everything. The  channels to contact with the masses should be broadened, and the  opinions, voice, and demands of the masses should be listened to  in a timely manner. Importance should be attached to the work  concerning the letters and complaints of the masses. In  fulfilling various tasks, we should always mobilize the  initiative of the masses, depend on the masses, and strengthen  the ideological and political work. All reform plans and all  major work measures should garner the comprehension and support  of the masses. Full play should be given to the role of the  working class as the main force to carry out reform and  construction. Old cadres should be respected and taken note of  by bringing their role into full play and efforts should be  given to solve the problems in the livelihood of retired veteran  cadres and workers. "Double-support" activities should be  carried out continuously to strengthen the unity between the  army and the people and between the army and the government. On  the whole, we should further strengthen the mass unity  throughout the municipality, mobilize all positive factors, and  pool the will and wisdom of all the people in Tianjin to attain  the common goal of accelerating development and invigorating  Tianjin.    The year 1994 is key to Tianjin's reform, opening up, and  modernization drive. The municipal party committee called on  the vast numbers of party members, cadres, and the masses in the  municipality to even more closely unite as one to implement the  guidelines of the 14th party congress and of the third plenary  session of the 14th CPC Central Committee under the leadership  of the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its  nucleus, and under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. They  are also expected to work hard and to make bold innovations to  fulfill all tasks and to seize the opportunity to accelerate  reform, opening up, and modernization in Tianjin.</p>

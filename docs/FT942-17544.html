			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Troubles over? - The week ahead Almost every UK reference last year to Invesco MIM, the fund manager, mentioned its record Pounds 750,000 fine from regulator Imro and its involvement in the Mirror Group pension scheme. The fine has been digested and Invesco paid the Mirror trustees Pounds 11m in a settlement without admitting liability. Analysts say the group has cleaned itself up but results for last year, due on Thursday, are expected to reflect a struggle to retain existing institutional clients and attract new business. Most forecasts for annual pre-tax profits are in the Pounds 30m to Pounds 40m range, after an exceptional item of Pounds 11m for the Mirror pay-out, compared with Pounds 12.6m after exceptionals last year. Amec will on Thursday become the latest building and civil engineering company to announce annual results for 1993. Hit more than most contractors from its excursion into UK house-building, it is expected to have bounced back into the black with analysts forecasting pre-tax profits ranging from Pounds 22m to Pounds 25m. This compares with an Pounds 87.5m loss after provisions of Pounds 114.6m in 1992. Another indication of recovery in construction should come on the same day from Hewden Stuart, the UK's biggest independent plant hire group. It is expected to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 18m for the year to January 31, well up on the previous year's Pounds 12m.</p>

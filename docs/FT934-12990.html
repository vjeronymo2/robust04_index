			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: France The CAC-40 raced to a new high yesterday as the Paris bourse sensed the latest interest rate cuts might mark a turning point in monetary policy. Earlier in the week, the franc had weakened against the D-Mark as investors fretted about the economic damage of delaying rate reductions. But it strengthened after the cuts themselves. The favourable exchange market reaction may not create scope for more cuts, however, given the government's determination to wait on the still cautious Bundesbank's lead. Besides, the Bank of France may remain worried about the foreign exchange risks of going it alone, given its need to rebuild reserves. The additional concern is that the underlying economy remains so fragile. The weakness of the German economy and the delays in cutting interest rates suggest any recovery will be muted in 1994. Earlier this month, the OFCE economic institute cut its forecasts of French GDP growth to 0.3 per cent in 1994, compared with the government's 1.4 per cent estimate. On underlying fundamentals, the bourse is already looking strained. A market multiple of 25 times forecast earnings for 1993 and a yield of 3.05 per cent appear ambitious. But there have been more earnings upgrades than downgrades following the corporate reporting season. Dividends also remain well supported and may grow quickly in recovery. The main reason for optimism is the sheer weight of money and the search for yield that is fuelling world markets. US mutual funds have been busy buyers of French equities. But, as yet, no substantial sums have moved from French money market funds into shares.</p>

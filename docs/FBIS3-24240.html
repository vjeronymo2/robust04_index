			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anna Politkovskaya: "Television as a National </F> Problem, or Is Life Possible Without Knife-Switches?"]    [Text] There is not a person in the country who would be  satisfied with television in our country. However, when the  danger started to appear on the horizon of finding ourselves in  a television, and at the same time also in a radio vacuum,  society united with incredible enthusiasm in the struggle for  this narcotic accessible to all.    But in the meantime Premier Chernomyrdin and the cabinet  headed by him did not especially want to give to television the  budget funds earmarked for it. As a minimum, beginning in  November they stopped the transfer to "Ostankino" and to the  Russian Television and Radio Company the funds which they, in  turn, must, without keeping them back in their account, transfer  into the pocket of the Ministry of Communications. And the  Ministry of Communications, as is well known, holds the monopoly  in Russia over the distribution of the SIGNAL. . . .  <H5>  Let Us Turn the Film Back </H5>   At the end of October, Yeltsin decorates the television  workers who have distinguished themselves in the events,  including those from CNN. He acknowledges in public that they  have done more for the country than all the democrats taken  together. However, money for domestic RTV (radio, television)  was nevertheless not found in the treasury.    Further--November. All of the electronic mass media are also  waiting for money, but can by no means wait for it. Their debt  is growing with every day. For the time being, the  communications workers are forgiving [the debt], understanding  that those who prevent the triumph of the new constitution were  almost enemies in November. Of all the forces, radio and  television twist the election campaign, unprecedented for  Russia. Every day, the citizens hear that one or another figure  who felt the urge for politics in his blood has rented  COMMERCIAL hours and minutes on the screen and on the air. Only  a little time will pass and it will turn out that those who had  the urge have also not paid radio and television for the  election campaign.    And here it is December. The whole world, in anticipation of  Christmas, dances around the Christmas tree. We are dancing to  different music: The government has stormed the parliament. It  will never understand its debt to society, it is always fixed on  the future, it promises the television chiefs that as soon as  December 12 is over, we will assume all power and settle  accounts, and we will go on, and everything will become  splendid, and we will begin to live, will flourish, and the  gardens will break into blossom. Alas, we have not started to  live, and things turned out to the contrary. Those who promised  did not seize power. Totally other people seized power.    And how do things stand with the money? Where is it? The  money in the amount of 67 billion in the national Russian  currency? It should already have been turned over to the  communications workers without delay. . . . They are also  people--those who sit in the Russian steppes and hills far away  from the large cities and service the relay stations, which  transmit the signal from one region to the other, from one  antenna to the other. And there are many such people--alone the  departmental settlements of the Ministry of Communications,  which arose for the servicing of the relay stations, come to  16,000 for Russia. And all the people there are without wages,  and sometimes since the summer....  <H5>  Where Is the Money? The Money Is Where? </H5>   I hope is in Gosbank, because it cannot but be there. But at  the same time, I am afraid, it is not. And in the meantime  January has passed. From the government, which was unable to see  to it that budget money went where, in accordance with the law  on the budget for 1993, it should go--from this government there  remain only horns and legs. The guilty, as always, do not  remain, since all the guilty turn into the aggrieved and, in  accordance with Russian tradition, are not subject to further  beating. Boris Fedorov--the former minister of finance, or, as  it turned out, minister without finances and without rights to  control these finances--it now appears had nothing to do with  it. Sixteen thousand settlements continue to sit without money.  Patience is being exhausted. The Ministry of Communications is  trying to improve its situation at the expense of the  weakest--for example, it is announcing price increases for its  services for newspapers and journals, moreover such an increase  that, if it takes place, the majority of them would die at once.  The Ministry has calculated correctly and shrewdly: For  newspapers the people today will already not go into the square,  and it is not to be beaten to death, and even for a  demonstration it cannot be assembled, these are no longer the  times of Gorbachev.    But the journalists were able all the same to consolidate  corporatively at that moment and some of them saved for  themselves the old prices for the communications services.  Although, of course, not for long. Another week passed by after  the "good" papa-Chernomyrdin met with the indignant  editors-in-chief of the leading publications and promised them  to moderate the ardor of the commmunications workers, and peace  for the newspaper all the same capsized: Quietly, without noise  and ardor, the Ministry of Communications all the same raised  the prices, but in a differentiated manner--for some threefold,  for others fivefold, and still others tenfold. Thus, a mere  branch ministry, nothing more, through economic methods effected  a (political?) selection in the state.    And here February came flying. The debts for the signal as  before were not paid. The communications workers are on the  verge of a strike--they are not being paid their wages. Where  are they to turn? They demand. They threaten, they remember that  they have in their hands the very knife-switch which can  extinguish both sound and light. They engage in blackmail,  which, of course, is very shameful. But what is to be done? . .  . A month earlier they were blackmailed.  <H5>  The Hour `X' Is Announced </H5>   If you don't settle the accounts, the communications workers  scream, you will read books in the evening--and nothing else:  Including prime ministers and janitors. Immediately before the  discontinuation of television and radio transmissions, Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin urgently convenes a meeting. The architect  of perestroyka, Aleksandr Yakovlev, recently appointed as chief  of the Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting,  comes, the Minister of Communications Vladimir Bulgak comes, for  some reason pulled hastily out of a polyclinic from tests. We  are on fire, they say. Although, it is clear, we have been on  fire for several months running. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin  speaks his weighty state word at the meeting and promises to  settle the accounts. He sent for Minister of Finance Dubinin.  Although he knows very well that there is nothing to pay with at  the moment. Minister Dubinin declares that he will not  pay--there is no money, even if your life depends on it. Would  there not be a question to put to Minister Dubinin, for what,  they say, do you divide the money? But the prime minister takes  a different road.    The prime minister hammers out a telegram to all the  communications workers of Russia and in a fatherly manner asks  them, for the umpteenth time, to put themselves into the  position of the poverty-stricken state. He asks not to touch the  knife-switch, to leave to the people simply Mary and all the  inhabitants of Santa Barbara. The prime minister gets up on his  knees, as if he is old. . . . This produces an impression: Some  people feel sorry for him, here and there they do not touch the  knife-switch, but here and there they nevertheless turn off the  knife-switch, and there a panic begins. It seized even the  northern capital--for a whole day St. Petersburg did not see and  hear anything from Moscow, and many decided that again a social  cataclysm had occurred.    The prime minister enters into a strict agreement with the  minister of finance that the debts will be paid gradually during  the first quarter. But this, too, is some kind of improbable  oddity--for the time being, they are talking only about  settlement of the accounts for the last year. Up to now they are  not talking about the debts for January and February, which it  was time to clear off long ago.  <H5>  For What Are They Hoping THERE? </H5>   This, perhaps, is the only question in this story which one  does not even need to try to answer proceeding from the classic  laws of logic. Finale. Realm of fantasy [zapredel]. Anarchy.  There is no money to be had anywhere. However, they will  nevertheless take it from somewhere. And in very large  quantities. And not for the poverty-stricken service personnel  of the relay stations, but for quite different purposes. In the  evening of the same day when Chernomyrdin hammered out the  telegram, First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets visited Oleg  Poptsov, head of VGTRK [All-Russia State Television and Radio  Company], at Yamskoye Pole (Russian Channel). Why? They talk  about various things. We will refer only to an, in our view,  very correct opinion, because it belongs to a very interested  person from among Poptsov's deputies. That evening they brought  Mr Soskovets to Shabolovka, where the old historical television  center is located, which the Russian Channel acquired some time  ago. They showed Soskovets the unfinished building, and an oral  agreement was reached to the effect that VGTRK, Poptsov's  fiefdom, above all, falls under the patronage, and this means,  the financing of the Russian government. But, you see, they  screamed that there is a financial abyss, and they shed tears. .  . . However, it is necessary to understand that these will be  enormous expenditures for the budget, comparable even with the  dollars which they threatened to throw at the new palace for the  new deputies. And in order for it to be built in accordance with  the latest state of technology, as Soskovets and Poptsov agreed!  And in order for the installations to be like those at CNN! We  would very much like to know this. Again precisely budget  matters.    Up to now only one of the points of such financing is clear:  The government apparently decided to stop fattening "Ostankino"  and to finance only its information service, and to give all the  remaining time to the [air] waves of private business--in the  disposition of independent television studios and companies.  Strictly speaking, this is not a bad thing and remarkable; what  arouses attention is only the fact that the government for the  umpteenth time has forgotten to consult with the taxpayers, who  are directly involved in the formation of budget funds.  <H5>  Again About Totalitarianism </H5>   It, the accursed demon, is directly related to this story,  too. The point is that those very relay stations with which the  communications workers are blackmailing in order to receive what  is theirs are the most essential stronghold of totalitarianism.    It turned out that the civilized world already for a long  time watches television and listens to radio without any  "fools," it has no need for settlements abandoned a little  farther from human habitation. The world uses satellites. This  has proved to be more ecological and incomparably cheaper than  the daily servicing of relay stations. A satellite is only  expensive to make and to launch, then everything is simpler. But  in the USSR, as is well known, they did not think about  cheapness, and even less about ecology, they talked about the  fact that everything must be listened to that can be listened  to, and that everything must be suppressed that should be  suppressed out of ideological considerations. The archaic relay  stations, which during the time of the Soviets went through more  for the KGB agency than for any other and which now require such  financial infusions as not a single modern television company  would dream of, precisely corresponded to the system of total  control of the conscience of people.    In connection with what has been set forth above, the next  question arises: Perhaps, all of us will have to pull ourselves  together, Mr Chernomyrdin, one last time, and launch the  necessary number of satellites, in order for us to have  everything like people [elsewhere], in order for 16,000  settlements, like the repressed, not to complain in the windy  steppes, and in order for the future to be without relay  stations? I would very much like to hear an answer.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Tories to press ahead on Maastricht ratification THE GOVERNMENT intends to press ahead before the end of the year with ratifying the Maastricht treaty. This in the light of the planned Danish statement in the autumn on the crisis prompted by its referendum which rejected the treaty. The foreign office is keen that the UK should take the initiative on the Maastricht bill during its presidency of the European Commission, and is confident that the proposed statement, which is expected about the time of the Tory conference in October, will enable progress to be made. Before the Commons rose earlier this month, some ministers were paving the way for a possible delay in the Maastricht bill to next year, but the foreign office believes the UK must proceed with ratification during its presidency if its position is not to be undermined. While all plans are on a contingency basis until the French referendum on September 20, ministers have begun discussions about how to handle Tory rebels. One option being considered is to separate the different strands of unease about Europe among Tory MPs on issues such as the Exchange Rate Mechanism, and frontiers. The idea would be to break up 'Euro-scepticism' as such, and to focus on difficulties MPs may have with individual aspects of the UK's links with the rest of the EC. Apart from hardline Euro-sceptics, Tories who have expressed concern about those issues may be offered meetings with senior ministers most closely involved, including Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. That move to allay concerns would run alongside a tough parliamentary regime for the bill itself. A guillotine or timetable motion looks unlikely, since it would focus opposition among other parties, but votes to curtail individual debates on proposed amendments to the bill will still be needed.</p>

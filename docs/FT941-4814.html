			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Death of a golden chance - Robert Champion de Crespigny speaks to Kenneth Gooding While Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny, chairman of the Australian Normandy Poseideon group, yesterday celebrated his unexpected victory in the hostile and contested bid for Aztec Mining, he was also quietly burying another important deal. Poseidon Gold, the subsidiary through which the Aztec bid was launched, also hoped to build a big gold business outside Australia via a joint venture with Metall Mining, the Canadian subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft of Germany. It was forecast that the new PosMetall Gold would emerge in three or four years with an annual output of 300,000 troy ounces of gold from a global spread of precious metal interests. PosMetall would then have been floated in North America and Australia. This plan, however, has crumbled following the recent financial collapse of Metallgesellschaft. Mr Kajo Neukirchen, new chief executive, has made clear he intends to sell Metall. Mr de Crespigny said it was impossible to go ahead with the proposed joint venture because he did not know who would control Metall. 'It is safe to assume that the deal is dead,' he said. Nevertheless, a joint venture gold project under way in Turkey with Metall would continue. Poseidon had expected the Turkish project to be producing in time to fill a predicted dip in its gold output. However, production there had been delayed by permit problems, so the bid for Aztec was made to fill the gap. When the Aztec offer seemed like failing, Poseidon bought 40 per cent of the Boddington gold mine in Western Australia for USDollars 116m (ADollars 83.45m) from Reynolds Metals of the US. This deal has been challenged by another Boddington shareholder, but Mr de Crespigny said he was sure Poseidon would take the stake. Poseidon's main interest in Aztec was its Bounty gold mine, half-way between Perth and Kalgoorlie, where Poseidon operates Australia's biggest single gold mine, the Superpit. The bid will also contribute to Normandy Poseidon's strategic objective of having within five years three core divisions - gold, base metals and industrial minerals - each capable of producing annual operating profits of ADollars 50m. It will give the group control of Golden Grove, which owns the Scuddles zinc mine and also brings with it the Woodcutter mine. Between them, they have an annual output of 200,000 tonnes of zinc. However, Mr de Crespigny said it was not certain that Woodcutters would be kept by his group, which would certainly sell Aztec's coal interests. He said there was no need for Normandy to raise new capital to cover the Aztec deal, and that the group's net debt would be virtually eliminated by the end of this year. Mr de Crespigny faces two areas of uncertainty: his relationship with the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, which owns nearly 20 per cent of Normandy, and charges brought by the Federal director of public prosecutions over the 1989 takeover. Anglo recently reshuffled its assets and handed its Normandy stake to Minorco, its Luxembourg-based subsidiary. Mr de Crespigny, who rarely gives press interviews, said the relationship with Anglo was 'very special,' and he expected it to continue that way. However, Minorco had only 5 per cent of its assets in Australia and would obviously want more. 'How that will come out I don't know,' he said. He also admitted there was likely to be some competition for global projects between Normandy and Minorco. Normandy is concentrating on Australia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Laos. South America was too far away and a move into Africa, on Anglo's doorstep, would, he said, 'be like kicking sand in your mother-in-law's face'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC]  foreign ministers conference has ended in Istanbul. A joint  communique has been issued that mainly discusses the regional  conflicts in the former Soviet Union, disarmament, and  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Sources close to the conference have said that no  concessions  were made to Russia's objections concerning the Azeri-Armenian  conflict and the reduction of Conventional Forces in Europe  [CFE].    The statement supports the idea of holding a conference  within the framework of the CSCE to reach a lasting and just  solution to the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. The statement  says that the problem can be resolved only through negotiations.    The statement points out that the NACC follows developments  in the Crimean Autonomous Republic with concern. It adds that  the problem should be resolved within the framework of the  territorial integrity of the Ukraine.    The statement discusses the Russian military presence in the  Baltic countries without using the word Russia. It says that  the withdrawal of foreign troops from these areas as soon as  possible will contribute positively to the security of both the  regional countries and Europe.    On Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement says that a political  solution should be reached as soon as possible.    On arms control and disarmament, the statement stresses the  importance of fully implementing all the existing agreements on  the issue. The statement stresses the need to fully implement  within this framework the CFE, the agreement to prevent the  proliferation of nuclear arms, and the agreements on chemical  and biological weapons, as well as poisonous gases.    The statement says that an agreement must be concluded as  soon as possible that completely bans nuclear experiments.    NATO Acting Secretary General Sergio Balanzino held a news  conference at the end of the meeting where he said that Russia  accepted the Partnership for Peace plan as it is, but that it  requested a [word indistinct] on how the plan will work.    Balanzino stressed that it was very important for all the  members to reach an agreement. If that had not been achieved,  he said, we would have given a negative message to the world.    Replying to questions, Balanzino said that Russia is a very  important force in Europe and NATO's close relations with this  force will contribute to world peace.    Asked if Kozyrev's objections to the joint statement are a  negative sign that Russia might change its policies in the  future, Balanzino said: I do not know the answer to that  question. I do not know about the future. However, today,  there is no change of policy. Maybe Kozyrev lacked sleep, maybe  he was tired.</p>

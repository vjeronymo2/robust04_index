			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 19, RIA -- Russian troops will start  receiving a new submachine gun already this year, said Chairman  of the State Committee for Defence Industries Viktor Glukhikh.    The new gun developed by designer Ivanov is called Abakan  and  is said to surpass the Ak-74 currently used in the Russian Army.  Glukhikh noted that Abakan has already been field tested and  turned out to be a high-precision weapon. Its calibre is  traditional for the Russian Army (7.62) and magazine contains 30  cartridges.    Glukhikh said it was too early to say when the Army would  adopt new submachine guns and speak about their exports.</p>

The election is the first test of the government's popularity  since presidential elections in 1992. The opposition has cried  foul, alleging that voters had been bused into the towns from  the countryside and that the ink used to mark the (?sums) of  voters wasn't indelible. For their part, the government says  the opposition forged identity cards. Now as Shayk Bekaye  reports in this telex from Nouakchott, the first results are out:    [Begin studio announcer recording] The ruling party in  Mauritania has taken the lead in local elections. Provisional  results give President Ould Taya's Democratic and Social  Republican Party, PRDS, 90 percent of seats in rural districts,  except in the south where there are a majority of black  Mauritanians who voted for the Union of Democratic Forces, the  main opposition grouping. The opposition did much better in the  cities. In Noaukchott and Nouadhibou, there will be a second  round of voting on Friday [4 February] as no party managed to  win an outright majority. The opposition also forced a second  round in urban areas of the east, a surprise for observers, who  had expected the ruling party to do well.    The PRDS did all it could to win in urban centers,  mobilizing  massive financial and material resources and the result is seen  as setback for the popularity of Ould Taya. Officials of his  party were keen to point out that conditions have changed since  1992, when the government was accused of malpractice in  presidential elections. Yesterday's voting brought accusations  of cheating on all sides. Independent observers said some people  were voting more than once but said both government and  opposition supporters were involved.

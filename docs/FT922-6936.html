			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Toray edges lower despite improved fibre sales TORAY Industries, Japan's leading synthetic fibre maker, yesterday posted falls in consolidated earnings for the full year to March. It blamed sluggish demand for its synthetic fibres, and lower profits at its construction affiliate. Pre-tax profits fell 11.4 per cent to Y64bn (Dollars 481.20m) on a 6.5 per cent increase in total sales, to Y976.7bn. After-tax profits plunged 26.2 per cent to Y27.7bn. The company's fibre sales grew 10.1 per cent to Y489.9bn. However, the company said demand for nylon used in tyre cords and fishing nets declined. Sales of chemicals and new businesses declined 0.5 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively. Nylon resin sales slowed because of sluggish demand from the automotive and electronic industries. Polyester film sales also decreased because of low demand and increasing price competition from film for magnetic tapes and industrial materials. Sales of the housing and engineering division rose 7.8 per cent to Y219bn, but operating profits fell 3.2 per cent to Y7.6bn. Toray's non-operating deficit widened by 47 per cent to Y11.9bn, as interest and dividends received fell 24.4 per cent to Y18.6bn. The company's cash and deposit balance plunged 23.8 per cent to Y100bn. The company also posted extraordinary losses on stock holdings of Y2.1bn. For the current year to March 1993, Toray expects further price competition to squeeze earnings, and forecasts a 2.4 per cent drop in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y63bn, on a 4.4 per cent rise in sales to Y1,020bn.</p>

The national flag carrier signed a contract for use of the  airport with Tianjin Airport authorities last November for the  training of its pilots with the permission of related government  offices such as the Foreign and Transportation Ministries.    The Chinese airport was chosen as the site for KAL's pilot  training, which it could not secure at home due to noise  pollution from the flight exercises.    KAL plans to renew the one-year contract every year.    The training began from Jan. 14, and a total of 28 pilots  and  co-pilots have had takeoff and landing exercises, so far,  Transportation Ministry officials said yesterday.    Three different aircraft -- Boeing 747, Boeing 747-400 and  Airbus 300-300 -- have been employed for the training of cockpit  crew.    The training is given every day. The aircraft leave Kimpo  International Airport in the morning and arrive in Tianjin via  the south of Cheju-to Island, and return home in the afternoon,  according to the officials.    Maintenance crew accompany the pilots in preparation for  possible troubles of the aircraft and Air China helps KAL in  maintaining the aircraft in Tianjin, they added.</p>

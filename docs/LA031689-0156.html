			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> HEARINGS ON LAND REPORT  </P> <P> The Board of Education has scheduled five public hearings on the district's  controversial real estate committee report, which includes a proposal to tear  down the historic Beverly Hills High School and replace it with a Century  City-styled high-rise.  </P> <P> The 26-page report explores ways to use the school's surplus and under-utilized  properties to improve school finances.  </P> <P> Public hearings will begin at 7:30 p.m. at:  </P> <P> Beverly Hills High School, 241 Moreno Drive, April 10.  </P> <P> El Rodeo School, 605 Whittier Drive, April 18.  </P> <P> Beverly Vista School, 200 S. Elm Drive, April 26.  </P> <P> Horace Mann School, 8701 Charleville Blvd., May 4.  </P> <P> Hawthorne School, 624 Rexford Drive, May 10.  </P> <P> Under the proposal to redevelop the site, the district would raze the school  and construct a high school on the northern 19 acres. It would lease the  remaining eight acres at Olympic Boulevard and Spalding Drive to a developer to  build an office complex. Depending on the size of the development, the district  could earn as much as $18 million a year from the development.  </P> <P> The committee's other recommendations include proposals to develop the  district's headquarters on Lasky and Moreno drives; a high school parking lot  next to Jimmy's Restaurant, and another parking lot on Elm Drive across the  street from Beverly Vista Elementary School.  </P> <P> The committee also suggested that the district consider leasing a portion of  the Horace Mann School playground on Robertson Boulevard to a developer for the  construction of retail stores. "The portion of Horace Mann playground that  would be used for development could be replaced by a rooftop playing field on  top of the retail structures," the report said.  </P></p>

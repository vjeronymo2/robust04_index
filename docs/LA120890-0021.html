			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRANSTON AND LINCOLN S&amp;L DEBACLE  </P> <P> I was saddened when I read your article about an elderly man taking his life  over the Lincoln S&amp;L debacle. So many in this great nation have been  impacted by the raping and pilfering of our nation's banks over the last 10  years.  </P> <P> It seems to me that our country has slid from its stature. We idolize the power  and wealth of such figures as Donald Trump, Michael Milken, Charles Keating and  Oliver North. Yet not long ago these men would have been hung, not as heroes,  but as the villains and criminals they are. These men produce nothing and suck  the very vitality from the average American person today. Our government is no  better. Today, instead of a leader, we elected an indecisive follower.  </P> <P> I am further saddened that the baby-boom generation has no leaders in its fold.  Yet we have the insurmountable task of bringing America from the trillions of  dollars in debt that recent administrations have bequeathed to us. I see a  rough road ahead, and no one who is capable of rallying this nation back to its  roots. May God help us.  </P> <P> MICHAEL W. FISHER  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

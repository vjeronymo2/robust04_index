			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The crack in the fragile  coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa emerged  again Tuesday [15 February] over Hosokawa's plan to reshuffle  his six-month-old cabinet.    At the center of the expected reshuffle is Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, leader of Sakigake (Harbinger).  Sakigake and the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP)  [SDPJ], the largest force in the seven-party coalition, oppose  the removal of Takemura from the post.    The SDPJ fears that if Takemura is removed, Shinseito (Japan  Renewal Party), the key party in the coalition, and Komeito  would take a decisive leadership in the coalition, political  sources said.    Hosokawa said at a cabinet meeting this morning, "I would  like to approach that decision (on a cabinet reshuffle) from a  comprehensive point of view," according to government officials.    In the same meeting, Sadao Yamahana, an SDPJ minister in  charge of political reform, expressed his opposition to the  reshuffle, the officials said.    At a press conference SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama  expressed his opposition to the reshuffling plan, saying "a  reshuffle which smells of a power struggle should not be carried  out." Murayama said Takemura has satisfactorily carried out his  duties as "head clerk of the cabinet."    The SDPJ leader said a cabinet reshuffle should take place  after the closure of the current regular Diet session in June.    Hosokawa telephoned Sakigake co-leader Hiroyuki Sonoda on  Tuesday morning and urged him to take a cabinet post if Takemura  could not remain in the cabinet. Sonoda rejected the proposal,  political sources said.    Hosokawa and Takemura met for 50 minutes in the afternoon at  the prime minister's official residence and discussed the  possible reshuffling.    Takemura quoted Hosokawa as saying the timing and the scope  of a cabinet reshuffle remains only on "blank paper."    Hosokawa reportedly told Takemura that after concluding  political reform and the Washington meeting with U.S. President  Bill Clinton, a cabinet reshuffle is now on the horizon.    Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, a key strategist in the  coalition, supported Hosokawa's idea, saying, "it is the  premier's exclusive right (to reshuffle the cabinet), so I will  follow his judgment entirely."    Sakigake held an emergency meeting of its Diet members  Tuesday morning. Some members insisted the party withdraw from  the coalition government if Hosokawa forces the change.    Takemura and six SDPJ cabinet ministers earlier in the month  disagreed with Hosokawa's controversial new tax plan to finance  a 6 trillion yen tax cut.    The government faced collapse after the SDPJ threatened to  withdraw from the coalition over the tax plan and Hosokawa was  forced to scrap a proposed 7 percent "national welfare tax" to  replace the 3 percent consumption tax.    Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said his party is willing to  take over the task of governing if the reshuffle leads to the  collapse of the coalition government. The LDP surrendered its  38-year grip on power to the coalition government last August.    Late last year when Takemura was at odds with Ozawa and  Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, over the handling  of political reform bills, Ozawa reportedly asked Hosokawa to  sack Takemura. At the time, Hosokawa rejected Ozawa's advice,  political sources said.    Takemura and Ozawa reportedly buried the hatchet when  Takemura visited Ozawa's residence to extend greetings on New  Year's day. Takemura and Ozawa differ over Japan's future  political structure.    Takemura, who hopes to form a "liberal" force, including  proreformers from the LDP, has said it is not easy to establish  a two-party system, while Ozawa and Ichikawa want to set up a  two-party system, political analysts said.    Hosokawa has said he favors a moderate multiparty system.  Ozawa advocates making Japan an "ordinary nation," calling for  a greater contribution by Japan to international peacekeeping  missions, while Takemura calls for a more modest role in the  international community.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Technology: How to solve a sticky problem - Worth Watching Chewing gum may lose its flavour on the bed-post overnight, but it certainly does not lose its adhesive properties. These prove a nightmare for transport authorities, street cleaners and even nightclub owners. Perpetual Environmental, of Henley-On-Thames, has come to the rescue with GumAway, which uses citrus juices to soften the gum. It takes just a few seconds to soften the gum, which can then be peeled away and the surface washed down with water to prevent staining. GumAway is designed for use on both hard surfaces, such as floors, and fabrics. Perpetual Environmental: UK, 0491 417590.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Parliament Debates the Economy: ERM exit was sole option, says PM MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday launched an unapologetic defence of the government's decision to abandon the European exchange rate mechanism, insisting before a rowdy Commons' chamber: 'There was no choice.' His frequently interrupted speech, targeted as much at his own backbench Euro-sceptics as at the Labour opposition, warned that there was no possibility of a return of the pound to the system 'in the near future' or into an un-reformed ERM. But, in a passage that was not well received by Tory opponents of the Maastricht treaty, Mr Major also insisted he would press on with ratification of the accord once Denmark had said how it would proceed to a second referendum. Nailing his colours firmly to the European mast, he reiterated the case for the treaty and claimed the narrow French and Danish referendum results ensured that 'the British agenda is now on the table'. With the government clearly on the defensive over the future course of economic policy, Mr Major's speech attempted to concentrate on European issues. Against a constant hubbub of abuse and sarcasm from the opposition benches, he began beligerently, claiming Labour had lost the election because the electorate had chosen Tory principles of 'low inflation, low taxes, free trade and freedom from state control'. The prime minister then went on to remind his listeners that the trade unions, Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher and Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, had supported the UK joining the ERM at a DM2.95 rate. To the jeers of his opponents, he then went on to describe the 'exceptional circumstances' which led to the decision to take the pound out of the system. He blamed a speculative attack provoked by the French referendum, Germany's highest interest rates for a decade and, in a tacit reference to the Bundesbank, 'injudicious comments that should never have been made'. Accepting his central role in the decision, he added: 'I take full responsibility for the actions and policies of my chancellor.' But his explanation for the events did not escape some withering observations from the opposition benches. Mr Alex Salmond, the Scottish Nationalist leader, interrupted to ask how, after years of defending the ERM, he had only just discovered the 'fault lines' in the system. Mr Major replied that no one had anticipated the size and scale of the speculative attack against the pound. Turning to government economic policy, he made clear there was no room for complacency: 'Nobody should believe that a floating exchange rate is a free meal, always allowing interest rates to fall to a very low level.' The government would now use the existing narrow money target, the behaviour of broad money and asset prices and the exchange rate as means of keeping pressure on inflation. He also stressed the need to bear down on public expenditure as a 'tough but necessary' control on prices. On European policy, he tried to steer a course between 'fundamentalists' opposed to any return to the ERM and those who backed an immediate resumption of sterling's membership. Instead, the prime minister argued that reforms to the system would be a precondition for re-entry. 'I do not see that we could readily return to the mechanism without dealing with the problems that have been thrown up,' he said. But he made clear that he remained committed to the Maastricht treaty, stressing that many of the things for which it had been attacked actually stemmed from the Treaty of Rome and the Single European Act. In a lengthy package, attacked by one Labour backbencher for failing to address the motion's theme of economic policy, he restated the government's achievements in negotiating concessions in the Maastricht treaty. Pointing up the provisions on subsidiarity - the devolution of powers - he hinted that a clear definition of those provisions could supply the grounds for Denmark to reconsider the treaty in a new referendum. Concluding that only his government offered industry freedom from state control and the low taxation and low inflation that allowed British enterprise to flourish, he commended the motion to the House.</p>

The USA, the PRC, Great Britain, and recently France have  announced about their respect for this status of Mongolia, is  said in the statement of the representative of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation of March 1.    I would like to note that position of the Russian side on  this issue has been reflected in the clause 4 of the treaty on  friendly relations and cooperation, which was signed with  Mongolia in January 20, 1993, as follows: "The Russian  Federation will have a respect for Mongolia's policy banning the  stationing on her territory of foreign troops, nuclear and other  weapons of mass annihilation, letting them through her  territory", is said in the statement, the Ministry for External  Relations of Mongolia informed about this today.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 24 (YONHAP) -- Seoul plans to offer a  draft agreement to Pyongyang at the summit preparatory contact  on June 28, a strategy aimed at minimizing the number of  necessary contacts before the inter-Korean summit actually takes  place, according to officials here.    The draft, tentatively named "the agreement on opening a  South-North Korea top leaders' meeting," must be tabled at the  first preparatory contact on June 28 so that the two sides can  get right down to setting the time and place for the summit and  then sign the agreement at the next contact, the officials say.    The government is said to have already completed the draft,  which is most likely to establish the number of delegates,  accompanying assistants and the size of the press corps.    They would have to cover protocol for both sides, the  itinerary, the actual site and facilities for the summit  meeting, a guarantee of the personal safety of all visitors, and  arrangements for their trips.    The officials say they will not demand that every little  detail be written down on all of the above procedures in the  draft agreement so that the date of the summit can be arranged  as soon as possible.    Instead, they envision separate working-level contacts on  these details after the overall agreement is signed.    At least one week of careful planning is thought to be  required before the summit date.    This gives Seoul approximately two weeks of minimum required  time, one week to work on and sign the agreement on the summit  and another week to settle on the details. Seoul then could  propose the summit date around July 10 or by mid-July at the  latest.    As to where the top leaders will meet, the officials said  they will go ahead and propose the South Korean capital of  Seoul. But as long as North Korea agrees to hold the summit as  soon as possible, the South is willing to meet in the North  Korean capital of Pyongyang, according to officials.    "We will ask for Seoul, but if that doesn't work out, then  Pyongyang is a possibility," said one official.    "There has been talk of a third place, like the case of  Germany, but we have to take into consideration that there are  not many facilities suitable for a summit meeting in North Korea  other than Pyongyang," he said.    But there is one case in which Seoul will not compromise on  -- if North Korea insists on meeting Aug. 15, the anniversary of  Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule and also a date  that North Korea commonly uses for its political propaganda.    In that case, officials said they will demand Seoul as the  meeting site. If Pyongyang refuses, then they will think about  the neutral zone -- the truce village of Panmunjom -- or a third  place in South Korea.    Considering all these factors, South and North Korea will  both probably have to make concessions, one side on the place  and the other side on the time.    As stated before, Seoul officials plan to make  agenda-setting  as general as possible to lessen the chances of bickering over  agenda topics.    The proposed agenda will be very comprehensive, according to  the officials, covering immediate issues confronting South and  North Korea and other matters proposed by the top leaders, or  ways of removing political and military confrontation including  the nuclear problem and implementation of wide-ranging exchanges  and cooperation.    On arrangements for bodyguards, entourages and the press,  Seoul intends to include these terms in the overall agreement if  North Korea does not object but is willing to leave it to  working-level contacts.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Loss of Pounds 1.5m for Drew Scientific Drew Scientific, the medical technology company which was forced to issue a profits warning six months after its stock market launch last year, turned in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.49m for the year to March 31 against a comparable profit of Pounds 151,000. 'The loss for the second half was less than the first but remained substantial,' said Mr Trevor Barker, chairman, who also announced his own retirement through ill-health. He will remain a non-executive director and will be replaced as chairman by Mr Bill Fulton. The problems associated with the Glycomat testing equipment, which led to the product being temporarily suspended and resulted in the profits warning have now been corrected. Sales improved in the second half, but have been particularly disappointing in the US and Japan. Turnover was Pounds 977,000 (Pounds 1.72m). The loss was stated after charging research and development spending of Pounds 503,000. Losses per share came out at 6.1p. The shares closed down 4p at 40p.</p>

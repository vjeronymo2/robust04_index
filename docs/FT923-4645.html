			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Letter: Adverse impact of lottery promotion Sir, 'A national lottery for good causes is entertainment, not gambling', says Richard Ogier of the Lottery Promotion Company (Letters, August 26). Yet buying a lottery ticket means chancing money on an unknown outcome, as good a definition of gambling as any unless our dictionaries are to be re-written. If donating some element of the lottery's turnover to good causes means it is not part of the gambling industry, then the football pools, which give more than Pounds 100m a year to sport and the arts, must similarly benefit from this new interpretation] The Lottery Promotion Company is clearly rattled by arguments that a lottery could have harmful social effects; it therefore attempts to re-write normal definitions of gambling and ignores overseas evidence. Marketing is the key issue. For a British lottery to generate substantial new money for good causes, not to mention an adequate return for its operator, unrestricted advertising and promotion on broadcast media and the widest possible availability of tickets will be necessary. Mr Ogier is right to argue that experienced gamblers will not play the lottery but in so doing he declares his target to be those who currently gamble small amounts weekly or who do not gamble at all. If the government permits the national lottery to be promoted on a scale not presently allowed to any other form of gambling, we will witness the damaging social consequences that are evident overseas, with the Irish Republic as a good, nearby example. Mr Ogier can redefine the lottery as entertainment if he wishes, but it will not alter the adverse impacts deriving from unrestricted promotion.

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Lunch with the FT: The immaculate Lord Parkinson - Is he a cad? Is he a dilettante? Lucy Kellaway tries to find out over the monkfish I am sitting alone at the worst table at The Square, a very expensive, very designer restaurant in St James's, London. For 20 minutes I have been trying to look relaxed about the non-appearance of my guest, filling the time wondering if baked skate wings with lemon-wilted spinach sound nicer than herb-crusted cod on grilled aubergines with couscous. Eventually, I see a white head whisking past the window, and a minute later Lord Parkinson is sitting down opposite me, immaculate and apologetic. Some say Cecil Parkinson is a lightweight, a dilettante. Others, recalling that unfortunate business with Sara Keays and the love child (which cost him the position of foreign secretary), think him a cad, a bounder. But I have always had a sneaking admiration for this man. I remember a lunch with him seven years ago when he had just become energy secretary. We sat in the Savoy River Room, and discussed nuclear privatisation. Instead of the cliches and distracted manner you expect from a secretary of state, Cecil Parkinson seemed to be thinking about the subject, and actually listening to what my colleague and I were saying. On oil rig visits he used to work the same magic, winning round even the most surly offshore workers. I reminded him of our previous acquaintance. He clearly did not remember me, but felt it would be ungentlemanly to say so. We are interrupted by the maitre d' who suggests we would be more comfortable by the window. A delegation of waiters escorts us to the best table in the restaurant. It seems Parkinson has not just charmed everyone from Margaret Thatcher to Financial Times journalists to roughnecks, but also the entire staff of The Square. Yet, so far, the lunch is not going especially well. He seems vague about what we are supposed to be doing and looks blank when I mention the Lunch with the FT series. Nevertheless, he is impeccably polite and still has the knack of appearing to give you his fullest attention. Near our new table is a well-known journalist whom Lord Parkinson has not seen for some time. He comments that the man has lost a little hair, and got a little whiter, adding gratuitously: 'When I first met him your parents were still deciding what secondary school to send you to.' From most people the remark would have been crass, but Lord Parkinson just gets away with it. In spite of myself I am almost flattered when he underestimates my age by eight years, and says: 'At the risk of being personal you are wearing your age a great deal better than I am.' To get the conversation on to a sounder footing, I ask him about the mess the government has got itself into. He complains that the word 'mess' is a bit strong, and says the chief problem is that the public will not give the government any credit for the recovery. 'The public still can't accept the government was right before we left the ERM and right afterwards. There was a total change of policy, but the government still tries to pretend its economic policies are a seamless web.' But surely Conservative problems are more fundamental than that? Reluctantly he admits that Major et al have had a 'poorish run', but proceeds to hand out generous bouquets to them all. 'A lot of it has been unfairly personalised against John Major. I think he has a strong team and is just the man to steer economic policies through. I think Howard is a good home secretary and Hurd is obviously an excellent foreign secretary.' So far, so lacklustre: I had hoped that as a political outsider Cecil Parkinson would be more provocative. I ask him about the reshuffle, and he talks about the importance of the job of party chairman, a position in which he once shone. He bemoans the fact that Michael Heseltine, his chosen candidate for the job, has no interest in it. 'Being party chairman for the next two years is infinitely more important than being president of the Board of Trade,' he says. Suddenly he stops eating his salad of roast monkfish tail to give a big wave. I turn, and outside the window is a smiling woman carrying an armful of lilies. 'Who was that?' I ask. 'She's a sweet girl,' he says warmly, and then pauses. 'You know, I can't remember her name. A very nice girl.' He then proceeds to tell me with evident disapproval about a man who was a 'mysterious figure who got himself quite well ingratiated with Margaret at one point. He was alleged to have played a quite major role in the miners' strike. This girl has been his partner for some years. Everyone thought they had parted, and then suddenly she had his baby.' He interrupts himself to make polite noises about how nice the restaurant is, how good the food is, and how in all the time he and his wife have been coming here they have never had a bad meal. Acquiescing briefly, I persist with the matter in hand, and ask if the man has stuck by her. 'No,' he says, frowning. 'He's a tricky guy.' I can scarcely credit the innocent way in which he is discussing the issue. I start to wonder how best to point out the parallels with his own situation. He solves the problem for me by spotting over my shoulder a newspaper headline screaming: 'ME, WOMEN AND SEX BY ANTONY BUCK.' 'Poor old Antony, he's gone completely off the rails. He became very frustrated and bitter about his career. It really corroded him. He drank rather a lot, and then he got mixed up with this awful woman.' I ask whether, because of his own past, he can sympathise with Sir Antony over this unflattering glare of publicity. Lord Parkinson turns down the invitation to be bitter himself; indeed he is admirably sanguine. 'If you spend time trying to get the public interested in your views, you can't tell them when to stop their interest,' he says. We discuss whether in general he is glad to be out of the public eye, and whether his quieter life in the Lords and pursuing his half a dozen or so business interests suit him. He tells me how he never looks back, never has regrets, how relentless is the job of an MP (especially in a government with a majority of only 15). He tells me about how wonderful it will be if some of his infrastructure projects (he is involved in the Dartford river crossing and the Midland Expressway, as well as the Channel Tunnel Rail link) come off. 'A lot of my contemporaries felt like I did, that they had done quite a stint. It was time to leave while we can still do something else. Having been in cabinet, watching the government from the backbenches is a pretty tame way of passing the time.' He admits that being in the Lords is even tamer. 'It is a very charming place. I pop in once a fortnight.' If he has a political point to make, these days he makes it to the media: 'In a short radio interview you can get to a lot more people than in a long speech in the Commons,' he says. That is all very well, but I am left with my doubts. There is something sadder about him than there was seven years ago, as if in spite of all his protestations, he is longing to be back at the centre of things. To judge by the brevity of the lunch, out of Parliament certainly does not mean idle. He has two swallows of his coffee, and leaves for an afternoon board meeting. Again he tells me how enjoyable the lunch has been. I hold out my hand, and he bends forward to peck me on the cheek. I pay the bill and the maitre d' thanks me for coming and for bringing my guest. In the next post I receive a hand-written note on Lords stationery thanking me for the lunch one last time, and saying how much he is looking forward to reading the article.</p>

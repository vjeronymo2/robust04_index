			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to determine that the Poughkeepsie nonattainment area failed to demonstrate attainment by its attainment date of November 15, 1993. The Poughkeepsie ozone nonattainment area is comprised of Dutchess County, northern Orange County and Putnam County, NY. As discussed in the accompanying technical support document, this determination is based on air quality monitors revealing exceedances of the ozone NAAQS during 1991&hyph;1993. The Poughkeepsie area recorded four exceedances of the NAAQS at a monitoring site in Millbrook, Dutchess County. Therefore, the average expected number of exceedances of the NAAQS over the three-year period is greater than 1.0. The ozone data measured at the Millbrook monitor during the 1991&hyph;1993 period indicates a design value of 0.126 parts per million and an average expected number of exceedances of 1.4. Therefore, the EPA is proposing to reclassify or bump-up the Poughkeepsie ozone nonattainment area from a marginal nonattainment area to a moderate nonattainment area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that on April 21, 1994 in 59 FR 18967, EPA made a final determination that portions of Orange County are included in the Poughkeepsie ozone nonattainment area. An opportunity for public comment on the designation of northern Orange County was given on November 30, 1992 in 57 FR 56762. As a result of this proposal to reclassify the Poughkeepsie nonattainment area, portions of Orange County would become moderate nonattainment along with Dutchess and Putnam Counties. EPA's final decision to include portions of Orange County in the Poughkeepsie ozone nonattainment area is not the subject of this proposal, and EPA is not soliciting comments on its final action in that regard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule fulfills EPA's obligations under Section 181(b)(2) to determine whether the Poughkeepsie area attained the ozone NAAQS by its attainment date, and to publish its determination in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Section 182(i) of the Act, reclassifying this area as moderate means that the State will be required to submit State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions appropriate for a moderate area under Section 182(b). Section 182(i) further provides that the deadlines provided under the requirements of Section 182(b) remain applicable to this area, except that the Administrator (or the Administrator's delegate) ``may adjust any applicable deadlines (other than attainment dates) to the extent such adjustment is necessary or appropriate to assure consistency among the required submissions.'' Accordingly, reclassification to moderate results in an attainment date for this area of November 15, 1996, under Section 181(a)(1) (table 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, EPA is exercising its authority to adjust the SIP submission schedules for the moderate area controls. All SIP submissions required under Section 182(b) must be submitted by November 15, 1995. All required controls and emissions reductions must be implemented or achieved on a schedule that facilitates attainment by November 15, 1996 (the attainment date). This submittal date will assure consistency in SIP submittal schedules and afford the State sufficient time to prepare the submittals, while also assuring that the required controls may be implemented by the attainment date. EPA cautions that because the determination of whether the area attains the NAAQS by the end of 1996 must be based on air quality during the 1994&hyph;1996 period, the sooner the moderate-area controls are implemented, the more likely the area will reach attainment by the end of 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, EPA is proposing a determination that the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, NJ-PA; Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY; Buffalo-Niagara Falls, NY; Essex County, NY; and, Jefferson County, NY marginal nonattainment areas succeeded in demonstrating attainment by their attainment date of November 15, 1993. As discussed in the accompanying technical support document, this determination is based on ozone air quality data measured during the 1991&hyph;1993 period. These five marginal areas recorded none or only one exceedance of the standard at any one monitoring site in the area. Therefore, the average expected number of exceedances of the NAAQS over the three-year period, for these five areas, is less than 1.0.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although EPA is proposing to determine that these areas have attained the ozone NAAQS, they will continue to carry the designation of nonattainment and the classification of marginal. They are eligible to be redesignated to attainment under Section 107(d)(3), if the criteria of that provision are met. A redesignation of an area to attainment must be a formal request by a state to EPA and include, among other things, a public hearing, all Section 110 and Part D requirements and a ten year maintenance plan. EPA must review a redesignation request and follow the usual procedures of a completeness review, a notice of proposed rulemaking and a final action after reviewing public comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

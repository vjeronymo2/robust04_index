			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Technology: The next smart move - The payment card's magnetic stripe will be ousted by the more highly evolved single chip The magnetic stripe on payment cards is moving further up the list of endangered species. Though it will be some years before it finally becomes extinct, progress in developing 'chip' or integrated circuit technology for cards means that its demise is approaching. It may be a couple of years before a single-chip card can operate across borders or at a great number of outlets internationally. But after five to 10 years of parallel technology, cash dispensers and point-of-sale terminals, the natural habitat of payment cards' magnetic stripe, will have changed to suit only the more highly evolved 'smart' card. 'The more complex the card, the more complex the point-of-sale needs to be,' says Jean-Jacques Desbons, president and chief executive of Visa International, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Visa is one of the three leading international payment card organisations which, by the end of this year, are due to have agreed common technical specifications for chip cards. Later this month the three - comprising also Europay International and Mastercard International - should have agreed definitions for how the chip card and point-of-sale terminal will deliver services to the cardholder. That will mark the second stage of three sets of specifications for chip cards. The work is intended to be completed by the end of this year. Two months ago, the first set, dealing with electrical and mechanical specifications for making chip cards and for point-of-sale terminals, was signed off, enabling manufacturers to begin work on microprocessor chips in payment cards. The third stage will cover how a transaction will be completed. But the process of realising the card issuers' aim of more secure cards with a wealth of added-value services is a slow and expensive one: Visa says both it and Mastercard have been working on standards for chip cards for four years. The length of the process is partly determined by the pace of technological developments. There is also diplomacy involved in the delicate task of achieving co-operation without destroying competition. Compatibility and acceptability are key selling points for the product. 'It's about finding a common technical platform which allows for different products,' says Francis van den Bosch, Europay's director of commercial affairs. 'First you have to agree on what you're going to agree about.' The scope for diversity is particularly important for justifying in business terms the investment a move to chip technology will require from thousands of organisations internationally. The pressure to develop chip technology began as an anti-fraud measure, on the basis that it would significantly cut losses from card fraud and make card security cheaper. Van den Bosch says that the chip card is safer and is much more difficult to 'crack'. Its other advantage, of course, is that it enables much more information to be stored. The chip should also be able to deliver cheaper authorisation methods. Authorisation on magnetic stripe cards involves telecommunications costs in a significant proportion of transactions. The chip card cuts costs by allowing more transactions to be authorised off-line. 'Europe is not going to go the same way as the US banks went in authorising on-line almost all transactions,' says Desbons. 'The chip card can identify the cardholder, authenticate the card and authorise the transaction all in an off-line mode.' In spite of these two savings, there is now a broad agreement within the plastic card industry that the billions of US dollars in investment worldwide can be justified only by using the capacity of the chip to deliver new services. 'I don't think using the chip for security reasons will bring enough savings to the table to justify the overall investment,' says Desbons. 'I do think the investment is needed, but to make it happen value-added functions have to be included.' These functions will vary widely. Perhaps one quarter of the chip's capacity would be devoted to common functions, with a further quarter for functions specified by the payment system and another for functions chosen by the issuing bank. Storing information about customers, from their status with their bank manager to the type of hire car they prefer, is envisaged as a way of speeding up procedures at, for example, hotel check-ins and adding value to the cardholder. Such plans are still at an early stage. A more immediate issue is to resolve sensitivity about how the new specifications impinge on chip card systems already in use. The French banks, for example, have introduced chip technology and they are unlikely to be content with specifications requiring them to start again when 20m or so cards are in circulation. At the same time, there is no wish to simply follow the French lead to fit in with their system. The approach of the payment organisations seems to be almost to regard the French system as a giant pilot study: they are ready to learn from the experience while recognising that improvements must be made. In the UK plans are much less advanced, with Apacs, the payment clearing services association, recently approving the start of the first phase of developing a method of authenticating chip cards. Such different rates of progress show the importance of international specifications in this area. Only when they have been agreed will the evolution of the chip card gather pace.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fewer dealers upgrade technology The overall demand for dealing room technology is showing little signs of recovery, according to Kimsey Consulting's annual survey of the UK market. Twenty per cent fewer firms than this year are expected to upgrade or replace their systems in the next 12 months. Despite this, the market for dealer boards will increase substantially to be worth more than Pounds 30m this year. When asked to rate information vendors, dealing room managers placed Reuters at the top of the list, displacing Quick which has held the top position for the past four years.

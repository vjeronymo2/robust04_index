			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Brussels signal to car spares makers EC MANUFACTURERS of vehicle spare parts risk punishment for unfair competition if their links with car-makers put independent parts distributors at a disadvantage, the European Commission indicated yesterday. An independent French distributor complained to the Commission that Magneti Marelli, the parts subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, was operating a system which allowed car-makers to buy replacement carburettors at preferential prices, for resale through their distribution networks. Brussels said yesterday it had decided not to go ahead with an investigation because Magneti Marelli had changed its system to make it less discriminatory. But at the same time, the Commission sent a strong signal to all spare parts manufacturers that discrimination against independent distributors was unacceptable. ''Partnerships' between car-makers and spare parts manufacturers must not call into question the survival of distributors of replacement parts which are independent of car distribution networks.' Magneti Marelli dominates the French market for replacement parts, with a 63 per cent share. Distributors which were not part of a car-maker's distribution network were only able to buy replacement carburettors through an intermediary, at higher prices and on less advantageous terms. A Commission spokesman said: 'Big car companies buy the carburettors they install in new cars in bulk, and those are always cheaper. 'But they also get concessionary rates on the parts they use for the spares market. That's separate, and there are other people who compete only in that market.'</p>

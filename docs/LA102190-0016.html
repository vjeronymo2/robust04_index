			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> LIVING LARGE: Speaking of dwarfs, Tin Pan Apple Records (who brought us the Fat  Boys) has put together a group of all-dwarf rappers. (Would we lie? See photo  on Page 78.)  </P> <P> The first single by the trio Little Posse (Giz-Mo-C, B-Ill and M.C. Science)  will be a rap version of Spencer Davis' "Gimme Some Lovin'." . . . Rap's  leading lady, Queen Latifah, is in the spotlight these days. She did a guest  spot on the fall premiere of "In Living Color," plays a waitress named LaShawn  in Spike Lee's upcoming movie "Jungle Fever," and is performing on Motown's  upcoming 30th anniversary TV special (she even has an offer to do a TV pilot of  her own). . . . And H.W.A., female rap's answer to N.W.A. (the initials stand  for 'Hos With Attitude), make their cable-TV debut Nov. 8 on 2 Live Crew's  upcoming pay-per-view TV special. The Chicago-based group's new album, "Living  in a 'Ho House," features such raunchy songs as "Nasty," "1-900-Bitches" and  others far too explicit to be mentioned here. . . . Meanwhile, you have to  wonder how Frank Sinatra will handle the news that a new Scottish pop band,  whose album is titled "Cake," go by the moniker of . . . the Trash Can  Sinatras.  </P></p>

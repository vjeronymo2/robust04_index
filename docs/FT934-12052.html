			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Float for On Demand Information next month OFFICE WORKERS should shake off the shackles of Gutenberg printing and embrace high technology hieroglyphics. This is the principle behind On Demand Information which is coming to the market by way of a placing likely to value the electronic publishing company at more than Pounds 50m when it floats next month. The issue is expected to raise between Pounds 12m and Pounds 15m in new money. The board will hold more than 50 per cent of the equity and none of the directors plans to sell shares. Mr Graham Poulter, chairman, said: 'Since Gutenberg, we have always produced multiple copies of information and distributed that. But in today's environment this is totally inefficient and is often out of date before it is published. If you go back 3,000 years to cave drawings or hieroglyphics things were much more efficient - everyone had access to the right information at the right time at a central point.' ODI has been a division of the privately held Poulter Communications marketing services company since 1988. Poulter, which Mr Poulter started in 1969, incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 703,000 (Pounds 1.16m) on sales of Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 22.8m) in the year to end-July 1992. Bank debt then stood at Pounds 2.3m, some 78 per cent of shareholders' funds. That ratio had since climbed with development costs. ODI produces corporate databases for internal use by companies as well as interactive information systems for specific industries. Information is presented through a combination of computer, telephone and video technology.</p>

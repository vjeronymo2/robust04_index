			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Water quality costs set to rise: Bills may double as estimates to meet directives reach Pounds 60bn WATER companies in the UK may have to spend up to Pounds 60bn this decade to comply with new regulations on water quality - double the level projected at the time of privatisation in December 1989, several water companies said last night . Water bills would more than double - on top of inflation - in the most extreme projections, if all directives were enforced, several companies said. Ofwat, the industry watchdog, is next week due to publish a report assessing how water and sewerage bills might rise in the last five years of the 1990s according to which water quality regulations are implemented. The report by Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director general, is expected to emphasise the need for debate on whether customers would prefer lower bills or higher standards. It will also comment on the water charges to be made in 1994. The Ofwat report is likely to be controversial as estimates of investment and possible impact on customers' bills are now much higher than those made when the 10 large water companies in England and Wales were privatised. It was estimated then that water companies needed to spend Pounds 28bn during the 1990s, and the effect would be to raise customers' bills by an average of 60 per cent on top of inflation. The greatest rise in spending plans since then is the result of the recent European Community directive on Urban Waste Water. Several water companies estimated last night that this could add an extra Pounds 10bn nationally to spending plans. Implementation of EC directives on discharge of sludge at sea could add another Pounds 2bn, as could full implementation of existing directives on pesticides in drinking water. One of the biggest remaining uncertainties is whether the World Health Organisation will recommend late this year that standards on the level of lead in water should be raised. Replacement of lead pipes 'could easily add another few billion', one water company finance director said last night. Further costs could come from the need to improve water distribution systems or to build more reservoirs because of the water shortage in the south-east. Water companies emphasised last night that the relationship between spending plans and customers' bills was complex, and was very sensitive to the cost of capital, levels of debt taken on to finance the spending, and the time over which the investment was made. A doubling in spending did not have to mean a doubling in the size of bills, one finance director said. The Water Services Association, representing the large water companies, has frequently argued that some EC directives on drinking water could be modified, leading to lower bills without risk to health.</p>

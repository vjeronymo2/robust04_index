			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL CALLS CHILD ABUSE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY;  </P> <P> HEALTH: CONGRESSIONAL ADVISERS CALL FOR MORE FUNDING AND AN OVERHAUL OF THE  PROTECTION SYSTEM. THE RISE IN REPORTED CASES IS TERMED "ASTRONOMICAL."  </P> <P> Child abuse and neglect in the United States constitute a national emergency  "so compelling that it dictates an immediate response," a federal advisory  panel declared in a report released Tuesday to Congress and the Department of  Health and Human Services.  </P> <P> The U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, using unusually strong  language, condemned the current system in the United States as failing to  protect the nation's children.  </P> <P> "Each year, hundreds of thousands of children are being starved and abandoned,  burned and severely beaten, raped and sodomized, berated and belittled," stated  the panel, composed of experts on children's concerns.  </P> <P> "All Americans should be outraged by child maltreatment," it continued. "Not  only are child abuse and neglect wrong, but the nation's lack of an effective  response to them is also wrong. Neither can be tolerated. Together, they  constitute a moral disaster."  </P> <P> The panel was established by Congress in 1988 to evaluate the scope of child  abuse in the United States and to develop recommendations to correct it. The  panel's report, the first in a series of required annual overviews, is  scheduled to be released officially today.  </P> <P> "All Americans share an ethical duty to ensure the safety of children," the  report said. "Protection of children from harm is not just an ethical duty --  it is a matter of national survival."  </P> <P> The United States "spends billions of dollars on programs that deal with the  results of the nation's failure to prevent and treat child abuse and neglect,"  the report said.  </P> <P> The number of reported cases of child abuse has soared to 2.4 million annually  from about 60,000 in 1974, according to the report, which called the increase  "astronomical."  </P> <P> The board said that the child protection system "has not expanded to meet the  challenges posed by the huge increase in cases," which has affected the whole  spectrum of agencies dealing with child abuse, including law enforcement, the  courts and mental health services.  </P> <P> Child protection agencies have suffered "the greatest impact" and "have not  been given the resources necessary to cope," the report said.  </P> <P> "This is serious business," said Deanne E. Tilton-Durfee, executive director of  the Los Angeles County Interagency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect and a  member of the panel.  </P> <P> "There is no segment of society who can't do something about it or who won't be  affected by it if something isn't done," she said in an interview. "We can't  afford not to deal with the problem."  </P> <P> Although child abuse occurs among all socioeconomic and cultural groups, the  reported noted that poverty makes child maltreatment much more likely.  </P> <P> "Child maltreatment is especially likely to occur when families under stress  lack support from their neighbors," the report said. "Child maltreatment occurs  much more frequently among socially isolated families."  </P> <P> It is exacerbated also by parents' mental health problems and substance abuse,  the report said. Child abuse associated with substance abuse has experienced  "an extraordinary increase," it stated, adding: "The severity of the problem  has caught all parts of the child protection system unprepared."  </P> <P> The board said that its members decided to devote their first report "to  alerting the nation to the existence of the emergency" and to recommending a  series of "first steps" to provide a framework for changing the system during  the next decade.  </P> <P> Ultimately, the nation should replace the existing system with "a new national  child-centered, neighborhood-based child protection strategy," the board said,  adding that designing such a plan "will preoccupy the board during the next  several years."  </P> <P> Joy Byers, coordinator of public awareness activities for the Chicago-based  National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse, said it is "very  encouraging to hear that a government-sponsored report is calling for a public  outcry as a first step. The next step for the public is to find out how to get  involved and become part of the solution."  </P> <P> In the first of 31 recommendations designed to encourage the public to become  actively involved in preventing child abuse, the panel urged all citizens "to  recognize that a serious emergency . . . exists within American society" and to  join with other citizens "in resolving that its continued existence is  intolerable."  </P> <P> "The board urges each American to understand that he or she is personally  responsible for preventing harm to all the maltreated children of the nation,"  the report said.  </P> <P> Further, the board said, citizens should demand that their elected public  officials publicly acknowledge that an emergency exists and "take whatever  steps are necessary," including finding new sources of funding "to rehabilitate  the nation's child protection system."  </P> <P> In addition, the panel called on public officials to view the prevention of  child abuse and neglect "as a matter of national security."  </P> <P> These officials should increase support for housing, child care, education and  prenatal care for low-income families, "the absence of which has been linked to  child abuse and neglect," the report said.  </P> <P> Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), chairman of the House Select Committee on  Children, Youth and Families, praised the report.  </P> <P> "The consequences of child abuse are devastating, not only for the long-term  stability of the individual child, but the explosion in child abuse cases has  been a key factor in overwhelming the child welfare system," he said. "The  report is a substantive call to action on behalf of our children."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RADIO AND REVENUE  </P> <P> A reaction to the letters about KROQ: All right, enough is enough. The  supposedly hip radio audience of Los Angeles has only itself to blame for the  homogenization of KROQ's programming.  </P> <P> Reeb's changes are a result of what the masses want to listen to. Profitability  of a radio station is a function of how the station performs in the quarterly  Arbitron ratings book. Fewer listeners yield lower ratings, which equal lower  ad revenues.  </P> <P> For letter writer Cheryl Wadeson to lable Mr. Reeb a "ratings-hungry, sell-out  station manager" is ludicrous. The problem is that the majority of L.A. radio  listeners happen to like the mainstream, accessible, safe pop song.  </P> <P> RICHARD A. LOHR  </P> <P> Corona Del Mar  </P></p>

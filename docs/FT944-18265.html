			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (3): Fertile ground for conflict - Fast-expanding South Korea has joined Japan as a source of worry for western carmakers The automotive industry is already providing fertile ground for trade conflict between Japan on the one hand and the US and the European Union on the other. Now, however, South Korea has become a new source of concern for western carmakers. The US trade deficit in automobiles and automotive parts with Japan remains high and rose to a record Dollars 33.4bn last year accounting for 56 per cent of the total US trade deficit with Japan. The EU's trade deficit with Japan in motor vehicles - Ecu5.12bn (Pounds 4.02bn)  - accounted last year for 20.4 per cent of the its total trade deficit with Japan. This was almost offset, however, by a Ecu4.3bn surplus on vehicle trade last year with the US. While recent developments such as the strong increase in sales of imported cars in Japan this year, increasing purchases of US auto parts by Japanese vehicle makers - both for their US and domestic assembly plants - and the continuing fall in the volume of Japanese vehicle exports, suggest that the trade imbalance between the US and Japan could be reduced, in practice the problems remain intractable. During the eight years that the US Commerce Department has been keeping records on trade in vehicles and parts, the US automotive deficit with Japan has proved resistant to all efforts to reduce the imbalance. The deficit, which totalled Dollars 32.6bn in 1986 fell slightly to Dollars 30.8bn in 1990 but by last year it had risen again to Dollars 33.4bn. The inclusion 15 months ago of automotive components in the framework trade talks between the US and Japan has yielded little other than increased tension between the two sides. The US deficit in automotive components trade with Japan rose to Dollars 11.2bn last year, a tenfold increase from the 1981 level. Japanese carmakers warned recently that they would urge the Japanese government to pursue Gatt actions including rights to compensation and sanctioned retaliation, if the US were to impose sanctions under the Super 301 trade law in the case of a breakdown in the framework trade negotiations. William Duncan, general director of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) in Washington, said that the short-term consequences of an auto trade conflict would mean 'economic disruption, loss of employment and ultimately slower growth and higher consumer costs'. The US auto industry on the other hand has called on Washington to take whatever steps it deems necessary to prod Japan to open its market, but it has recently stopped short of calling for sanctions. 'We would like to see an open market in Japan, and we want the consumers in Japan to have the same opportunities consumers in America have,' said Andrew Card, president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, last month. Japanese carmakers have resisted calls for the setting of numerical targets in trade between the US and Japan. 'I feel there is no need for targets, because I have no doubt that if the US auto parts are of high enough quality, reasonably priced and with good delivery records, then Japanese automakers will buy them,' said Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota and chairman of JAMA in a recent interview. The US believes that Japan gave a commitment during the visit by former President George Bush to Tokyo in January 1992 to buy Dollars 19bn worth of automotive components - Dollars 4bn for imports and Dollars 15bn for purchases by Japanese vehicle plants in the US - in the year to the end of March 1995. JAMA maintains, however, that the figure of Dollars 19bn was based on the voluntary plans of individual carmakers and was not a government target. Total purchases rose last year to Dollars 15.5bn and have doubled in the past four years from Dollars 7.12bn in the year to March 1990. In Europe, meanwhile, Japan is seeking to raise its quota for car and light commercial vehicle exports to the EU as a result of higher than expected demand in Europe. In March, Tokyo and Brussels set a guideline under the joint monitoring scheme allowing Japanese vehicle exports to the EU to rise by 0.4 per cent to 984,000 in 1994. In the first eight months, however, new car sales in west Europe have risen by 6 per cent, and Tokyo now wants to raise the level of its shipments. Direct Japanese vehicle exports to the EU fell last year by 18.4 per cent to 980,000 under the impact of the deep recession in the new vehicle market. Concerns are also being voiced in Brussels and Washington over growing imbalances in vehicle trade with South Korea, which is increasing greatly its domestic production capacity. Last year imports accounted for only 0.19 per cent of Korea's car market. Hyundai, the leading Korean carmaker, alone plans nearly to double its European sales from less than 100,000 last year to 189,000 by the end of the decade.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD'S TOP 10 VEHICLE MAKERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank   Manufacturer               Passenger cars    Total vehicles  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1     General Motors - US             4,989,938         6,865,828  2     Ford - US                       3,685,415         5,744,294  3     Toyota - Japan                  3,649,640         4,487,891  4     Volkswagen - Germany            3,119,997         3,285,696  5     Nissan - Japan                  2,222,985         2,898,185  6     PSA - France                    2,252,121         2,437,726  7     Renault - France                1,929,858         2,264,331  8     Chrysler - US                     727,928         1,982,676  9     Fiat - Italy                    1,557,556         1,800,400 10     Honda - Japan                   1,629,666         1,762,197  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: American Automobile Manufacturers Association  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US AUTO INDUSTRY JANUARY-DECEMBER 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Volume      Volume     Share (%)     Share (%)                        (Units)   Change(%)    Jan-Dec 93    Jan-Dec 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CAR SALES            8,518,000        +3.7         100.0         100.0 Imports              1,844,000        -7.5          21.7          24.3 Japanese makes       2,481,000        +0.4          29.1          30.1  -of which US-built  1,265,000        +9.0          14.9          14.1 Japanese derived*    2,889,000        +0.2          34.0          35.2 European makes         308,000        -6.9           3.6           4.0 CAR PRODUCTION       5,962,000        +5.4         100.0         100.0  -of which Japanese   US-built***        1,516,000        +7.0          25.4          25.0 CAR SALES BY MANUFACTURER: General Motors**     2,909,000        +2.3          34.2          34.6 Ford**               1,878,000        +5.7          22.1          21.6 Chrysler               834,000       +22.7           9.8           8.3 Toyota/Lexus           742,000        -2.4           8.7           9.3 Honda/Acura            716,000        -6.8           8.4           9.4 Nissan/Infiniti        482,000       +16.5           5.6           5.0 Mazda                  260,000        +4.7           3.1           3.0 Mitsubishi             168,000        +7.8           2.0           1.9 Hyundai                109,000        +0.2           1.3           1.3 BMW                     78,000       +18.8           0.9           0.8 Volvo                   73,000        +7.4           0.9           0.8 Mercedes-Benz           62,000        -2.2           0.7           0.8 Volkswagen/Audi         56,000       -35.8           0.7           1.1 Saab (GM)               19,000       -29.0           0.2           0.3 Jaguar (Ford)           13,000       +46.7           0.1           0.1 Porsche                  3,700        -9.4           0.0           0.0 Alfa Romeo (Fiat)        1,300       -53.1           0.0           0.0 LIGHT TRUCK SALES                5,398,000       +15.5         100.0         100.0 Imports                389,000        -2.9           7.2           8.6 TOTAL CAR &amp; LIGHT TRUCK SALES         13,917,000        +8.0         100.0         100.0 General Motors**     4,667,000        +6.1          33.5          34.1 Ford**               3,562,000       +11.6          25.6          24.8 Chrysler             2,048,000       +19.5          14.7          13.3 Japanese makes       3,212,000        +2.4          23.1          24.3 Toyota/Lexus         1,033,000        +0.9           7.4           7.9 Nissan/Infiniti        688,000       +17.2           4.9           4.5 NORTH AMERICAN CAR &amp; TRUCK PRODUCTION****      13,095,000       +11.5         100.0         100.0  -of which US       10,854,000       +11.1          82.9          83.1  -of which Canada    2,241,000       +13.2          17.1          16.9  -of which Japanese   Nth.

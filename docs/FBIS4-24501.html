Meanwhile, an official from the British Foreign Ministry  will  join the British Trade and Cultural Office in Taipei in June.    Nigel Standen, 32, will be leaving here for Taipei Saturday  [28 May] with his Taiwan-born wife Saturday. Standen will be  responsible for technological exchanges between the two  countries.    With a knowledge of Mandarin Chinese, Standen will be  helpful  in promoting relations between Taiwan and Britain, sources said.    Bilateral trade between Taipei and London totaled US$3.358  billion in 1993, with Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus of US$975  million.</p>

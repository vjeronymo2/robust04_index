Such food as sweet potato, boiled corn, boiled peanuts and  roasted chestnut are very popular there with the price of baked  sweet potato increasing to up to 2.5 yuan per jin from several  fens for each jin while that of rice is mere 1 yuan per jin.  The profits earned from roasted chestnuts has risen by as much  as 60 percent, much higher than that earned from rice.    An official from the Bureau of Agriculture in the region  told  this agency that in order to meet the needs in the market, the  structure of grain production had changed there with the area  for rice cultivation reducing while that for sugarcane growing  increasing and totalling 1.45 million mu. The area under  cultivation of soya bean, peanut and corn now exceeds 24 million  mu with the total output increasing by more than 15 percent over  last year.</p>

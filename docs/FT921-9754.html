			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / (CORRECTED) Big credit repayments cast gloom on recovery prospects Correction (published 12th February 1992) appended to this article. CAUTIOUS BRITISH consumers made the biggest monthly net repayment of debt since 1976 in December, a further sign that they are not yet ready to lead the economy out of recession. Consumers paid back more than they borrowed for the fifth successive month, making a Pounds 196m net repayment. This followed November's net repayment of Pounds 34m. At the end of the year, outstanding consumer credit from finance houses, building societies and on bank credit cards that are part of the Visa or Mastercard system stood at only Pounds 370m compared with Pounds 2.9bn in 1989 and more than Pounds 3bn in 1990. A broader measure of outstanding consumer-type debt, which includes credit agreements granted to mainly small businesses, showed borrowers paying back a net Pounds 486m over the year compared with net borrowings of Pounds 4.5bn in 1989 and Pounds 3bn in 1990. According to the seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office, the amount of new credit advanced to consumers in December was Pounds 4.1bn, an increase on November when the amount was Pounds 3.7bn. However, the total declined by 2 per cent to Pounds 11.8bn in the last quarter of 1991 compared with the previous three-month period. The figures suggest that most consumers, chastened by rising unemployment and high interest rates, are behaving prudently and paying off expensive debts accrued in the 1980s. Others, however, are beginning to borrow again to take advantage of low inflation and discounting by retailers. Mr Simon Briscoe, senior UK economist at Midland Montagu, said: 'There are a lot of people who are suffering but within that overall total there are some who are not doing too badly and I think that is what is revealed in that Pounds 4.1bn.' The last quarter of 1991 saw a net repayment of Pounds 303m by consumers. This compares with average quarterly net borrowings of Pounds 762.5m in 1990. The last monthly increase in outstanding credit was in July when consumers added Pounds 165m to their overall debts. The consumer credit figures, contributed to a softer tone on the UK domestic money markets where the three-month inter-bank rate closed around 10.5 per cent. This fuelled market speculation that base rates might be cut from their current 10.5 per cent by the time of the Budget on March 10, but analysts underlined that this would be possible only if conditions in the European Monetary System permitted. Revised figures for retail sales in December, seasonally adjusted, showed a 0.9 per cent fall on November, giving a year-on-year fall of 0.4 per cent, according to the CSO. Correction (published 12th February 1992). OUTSTANDING consumer credit from finance houses, building societies and on bank credit cards that are part of the Visa or Mastercard system grew by Pounds 370m in 1991, compared with Pounds 2.9bn in 1989, and more than Pounds 3bn in 1990. In yesterday's FT it was incorrectly stated that the amount outstanding at the end of the year was Pounds 370m. Money markets, Page 29</p>

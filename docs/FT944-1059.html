			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Such insight could re-write history Sir, The standing advisory committee on trunk road assessment (Sactra) offers us a valuable insight in suggesting that new roads generate new traffic ('Government to reassess plans for new roads', December 20). It is a pity that the railway builders a century and a half ago did not refrain from laying down new railway lines for fear that they might generate new economic activity. Or, indeed, the canal builders in the 18th century. Come to think of it, it is a pity that the same insight was not shared by electronic engineers, chemists, pharmaceutical scientists, steel makers, oil prospectors, or indeed the explorers of the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.

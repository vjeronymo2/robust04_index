			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Krayukhin report: "Modernized Pulkovo-2 Airport Up </F> to International Standards"]    [Text] St. Petersburg -- The modernization of Pulkovo-2,  Russia's second airport in terms of importance and size, is  complete.    The cost of the work, which began four years ago, has been  estimated at $14 million. The modernization of the airport and  its terminal was paid for by the "Pulkovo" aviation enterprise,  which did not take a single kopek from the city budget. The  modernization of Pulkovo-2 will make it possible not only to  improve the quality of passenger services but also considerably  to increase the airport's handling capacity. St. Petersburg now  has direct flights to 27 cities in Europe and can cope with a  maximum of 5 million passengers a year. Meanwhile the airport's  increased capacity will be sufficient for three years. The  construction of Pulkovo-3, a major new airport on the banks of  the Neva, will begin in 1997.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Markets: Sweating in the Crucible - The Bottom Line TO REPORT profits bang in line with forecasts and then watch your share price tumble 20 per cent must be a chief executive's recurring nightmare. But this has happened at Morgan Crucible, the materials technology group. Its Pounds 61.3m profits, reported last week, triggered a 66p fall to 279p at the close yesterday. Hurt and chastened, chief executive Bruce Farmer, whose acquisitive approach has built Morgan Crucible, continued with a walking holiday in Scotland while the company and its advisers prepared for a hard round of presentations to institutional investors. Their main concern is Morgan's apparent inability to generate cash. Implicit in this is the fear that Pounds 174m raised in two rights issues in 1990 and 1991 might not have been spent wisely. But the catalyst for the sell-off last week was concern about the group's red-blooded use of acquisition provisions. The habit has been losing favour rapidly since the Accounting Standards Board proposed that most such provisions should be taken as expense items through the profits and loss account. Morgan Crucible greeted the share price fall by pleading it was no worse than other acquisitive companies like Hanson - which set up more in provisions last year than it made in profit. But what distinguishes Morgan - with 'only' Pounds 17m of provisions - from Hanson is that gearing at the Anglo-US conglomerate is modest. Morgan has gearing of 67 per cent and will really have to battle to generate the cash to keep this under control. Herein lies the rub. Morgan Crucible's plight is the result of several factors, none of which on its own is particularly new but which, together, were too much for the markets. First, City analysts looked at what profits would have been had the ASB's rule changes been in place and the provision items been expensed to the P&amp;L. Answer: Morgan Crucible would have had a dividend barely covered by earnings. Could the company sustain this over time? the market asked. What, if not the yield, was there to support the stock? Then there was the poor cash flow. At operating margins of 10 per cent, the group is self-funding only if it makes no further acquisitions and cuts back capital spending in line with depreciation. Had past provisioning led to a sharp increase in profitability and cash generation, the markets might well have been more forgiving. Finally, there was debt. Some of the jump in gearing was a result of translating dollar-denominated debt, and interest cover remains high. But even by selling Holt Lloyd, the car care products company, and some other lower margin companies for about Pounds 60m, debt might not fall dramatically. Investors are going to need some convincing that they are not going to be asked to stump up more cash in the near future. Morgan Crucible recognises a cash call would not wash for some time. 'Before we can breath a word about any sort of fund-raising exercise, shareholders have a right to see an improvement in performance,' says Graham Swetman, finance director. The market's short sharp shock might, therefore, have a good effect if Morgan does indeed focus on raising margins, squeezing cash from working capital and resisting the acquisition trail. And there are other things going for it. It has cyclical recovery potential; the sale of Holt Lloyd would not only raise cash but increase the overall group operating margin; in the long term, the carbon and thermal ceramics business should be cash-generative, if not growth businesses; while technical ceramics and speciality materials - after some pruning - should be profitable growth businesses. So, the prescription for Morgan seems clear. The greatest problem could be Farmer's sometimes overwhelming enthusiasm for technology, which might not always be good for profitability. No doubt he will return, rejuvenated, from springing across the Scottish heather. He could find this energy being channelled firmly - by advisers, investors and some not too far from his own board - towards sweating the businesses he owns already.</p>

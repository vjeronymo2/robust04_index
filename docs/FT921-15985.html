			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Aero-engine makers rev up for new era - The pressures which may force three traditional rivals to collaborate A BIG sign greets the visitor in the modern Cincinnati office block where General Electric is developing its Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 820m) GE90 large commercial jet engine. 'We are truly launched with British Airways. Congratulations GE90 team,' it says of the controversial deal the US company won last summer against Rolls-Royce to supply its new engines for BA's fleet of Boeing 777 airliners. The engine order, coupled with BA's simultaneous decision to sell its Cardiff engine overhaul plant for Pounds 272m to the American company, was seen by many as GE's revenge on Rolls-Royce for withdrawing seven years ago from a commercial aero-engine partnership with GE. However, Mr Brian Rowe, the head of GE's aircraft engine operations, was not exultant. If anything, he felt depressed. 'You've come on a bad day. We are laying off 1,500 of our people,' he said. Even by its own cut-throat standards, the aero-engine industry has been going through a particularly rough patch during the past few months. The decline of military sales in the post-cold-war defence market and the lingering recession in civil aviation have had devastating effects on all engine manufacturers. GE, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce have all been forced to undertake sweeping restructuring programmes. To win new engine orders in the current depressed market, the three rival companies have had to make hefty concessions and offer enlightened terms to attract customers. 'We must stop killing ourselves with our crazy pricing structure,' Mr Rowe said. 'We are not only having to give away new engines but we are now having to make deals with airlines on spare parts. That's how tough it is.' Commercial engine manufacturers have traditionally relied on spare parts to produce a significant portion of their revenues and profits. During the past few months, even small orders have provoked big battles. Some have ended in court. When Malev, the Hungarian airline, cancelled a Pratt &amp; Whitney engine order for GE engines to power two Boeing aircraft, Pratt took legal action. But BA's decision to buy GE, rather than Rolls-Royce engines, and select Boeing rather than European Airbus airliners provoked the biggest storm of all. Although an engine alone has never sold an airliner, an engine deal can tip the scales in an aircraft competition. Engine manufacturers work closely with airframe makers to develop power plants for new aircraft. But it is difficult for them to remain neutral when they are offering engines on rival airframes. The combined pressures of the market and Airbus's frustrations over its repeated failure to win an order from BA prompted Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chairman, to attack the BA deal with Boeing and GE. Alleging BA had favoured the American companies over its European competitors, Mr Pierson asked the European Commission to investigate possible breaches in EC competition rules. But after discussions with the Commission, Airbus last month decided not to file a formal complaint. BA, Boeing and GE all rejected allegations of foul play. Mr Rowe said recent engine orders, including the BA fracas, showed there were no captive markets for manufacturers. 'After the BA order we thought we would get the GE90 on the new Boeing 777s of All Nippon Airways, one of our good customers. But we are still trying to understand why they chose Pratt instead,' he said. Rolls-Royce also struck back against GE last month when it clinched a Dollars 500m order from Emirates for Trent engines. Powering the new generation of wide-body aircraft has now become the focus of a three-cornered battle between GE, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce. To reduce the financial risks of developing new heavy-thrust engines, all three engine makother companies as risk-sharing partners or subcontractors. But the pressures facing the three leading players are now expected to force even broader collaboration. Some industry experts have suggested that three big engine makers were too many for the market to sustain. Mr Rowe disagreed. 'There's got to be competition but I don't see why anybody should die. It's stupid to believe the British are going to give up on Rolls-Royce. There are various ways of working together and we will have to work out some solution to stop shooting ourselves,' he said. At the end of the day, the industry could not continue pricing itself out of business. It would have to find a new 'modus vivendi' if it was to remain viable, Mr Rowe argued. There was no need for any of the big companies to disappear, but there was also no need for more than two engines in any given thrust size to compete on any aircraft, instead of three as is the case on many airliners today. Mr Rowe felt co-operation between companies would have to increase, although this was likely to lead to changes in the existing pattern of alliances in the industry. This could eventually lead to renewed co-operation between GE and Rolls-Royce. 'The door remains open for Rolls,' Mr Rowe said. Rolls-Royce will offer its Tay 670 engine to power the new McDonnell Douglas MD-95 twin engine airliner. This follows an agreement between the UK engine maker and the US aerospace group, writes Paul Betts. The new Tay 18,000lb thrust engine is expected to be certified in 1994 while the new 105 seater MD-95 is due to enter service in early 1996. McDonnell Douglas announced last year that the MD-95 would be assembled in China in conjunction with MD-90 co-production for the Chinese Trunkliner aircraft. China is currently in negotiations with the US aircraft manufacturer on the Trunkliner programme. Rolls-Royce also said yesterday it had reached agreement with Textron Lycoming, the US engine company, to take part in the Tay 670 programme as a sub-contractor. The recently established BMW/Rolls-Royce joint venture as well as Volvo of Sweden are also partners in the Tay 670 programme.</p>

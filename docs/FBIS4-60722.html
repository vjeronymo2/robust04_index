			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Preserving Legitimacy and Unity First"] </F>   [Text] Days after the eruption of the civil war in sisterly  Yemen, it became very clear that the secessionist tendency was  the cause of the deaths and disaster that the Yemeni people have  suffered, as well as the destruction inflicted on the state  establishments and vital economic facilities and services.    The war has destroyed achievements and costly projects set  up  by the fraternal Yemeni people with their efforts and sacrifices.    Therefore, a decision to stop the war, return to legitimacy,  and to protect the unity of the Yemeni homeland and people is  the solution for this dangerous crisis, which, if it continues,  will be very costly to both sides.    There are reports of Arab mediation, including Saudi  efforts,  after the failure of the Arab league's mediation. We hope that  any and all mediation efforts will target the preservation of  unity for the Yemeni homeland and people, the curbing of  secessionist tendencies, and the return of legitimacy.  Otherwise, mediation will be a sort of outside interference  that encourages the southern leaders to secede, and this  conflicts with the aspirations and hopes of the Yemeni people  and the whole Arab nation.    The continuation of the civil war will not realize a victory  for any party, and the victim will be the Yemeni people and  their infrastructure.    The failure of Yemeni unity will undermine the unionist  spirit within the Arab nation and drive it to frustration and  despair about the possibility of forging unity between any two  Arab states.    We urge the Yemeni leadership in the north and the south to  expedite an end to this war, to return to legitimacy, and to  adhere to the unity for which the Yemeni people have offered  great sacrifices.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Georgi Pirinski, deputy of the Bulgarian </F> Socialist Party, by unidentified television correspondent in  Sofia on 15 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Studio announcer] The Alliance for Social  Democracy [OSD] in the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] has  decided to withdraw its members from the BSP Executive Bureau  and from the leadership of the BSP parliamentary group.    Georgi Pirinski, a member of the OSD Political Council, who  until yesterday was the deputy of Nora Ananieva [leader of the  BSP parliamentary group], has withdrawn from this post. Here is  what he said to our reporter about his motives.    [Correspondent] Mr. Pirinski, was your decision to withdraw  from the leaderships of the BSP and the BSP parliamentary group  a personal one or one made by the OSD, and what made this step  necessary?    [Pirinski] It was my own personal decision. It is not  connected with personal motives, but with the issue of what kind  of policy the party will follow in practice during the coming  months. As you know, since the autumn of last year a discussion  has been in progress within the BSP on whether the party should  actively commit itself to the market reforms or whether it  should adopt a more rigid and closed position in defense of  social rights and social demands. The recent BSP congress  correctly concluded that commitment to the reforms put the BSP  in a very good light in the eyes of society as a factor for  stabilizing the state and making some attempt to move forward.  However, seeing how the accents were placed at the plenum  following the congress, what is in store for us? In my view,  the very composition of the Executive Bureau and the commissions  lends weight to the opposite viewpoint -- the rigid or closed  position. I do not find this position well-founded, and this  viewpoint is not in the interests of either the BSP or society.</p>

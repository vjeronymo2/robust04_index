			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Right road for spending The British government has been deservedly hoist on the low taxation petard with which it undermined the Labour party at the general election. Yet the debate, however entertaining, is not illuminating. If taxes are to be significantly lower, public spending must also be reduced. But such a reduction would require radicalism, something that looks unlikely from the government and almost inconceivable from the opposition. The government's rhetoric about the need to control public spending has not prevented the share of general government spending in gross domestic product from returning to where it was when Mrs Thatcher took office. At 45 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 the ratio is, in fact, one percentage point higher than in 1978-79. This does not mean that British governments have had no success in controlling spending: at comparable periods of the economic cycle the ratio was still higher, at 49 1/4 per cent in 1975-76 and 47 1/2 per cent in 1982-93. It does mean its success has been limited. Success has been particularly limited in recent years. Between 1988-89 and 1993-94, general government spending will have grown by 16.1 per cent in real terms, while GDP will have risen by a mere 1.3 per cent. Against that background, the only alternative to higher taxes would have been still higher borrowing, which would mean yet higher taxes in future. The government was right to prevent that outcome, however painful the consequences. Higher ratio Against the international background, the government's achievement is not even that poor. Last December's Economic Outlook showed that every OECD member state had a higher ratio of government spending to GDP in 1993 than in 1979. The UK's ratio is even below the unweighted average, which stood at 51.2 per cent in 1993. Only three OECD countries - Switzerland, Japan and the United States - have ratios below 40 per cent. Two countries - Denmark and Sweden - have ratios above 60 per cent, with Sweden teetering on 73.5 per cent. In between lie the great majority. Most European countries have ratios above 50 per cent, the exceptions being Ireland, Spain and the UK. Germany (50.8 per cent), France (54.2 per cent) and Italy (54.8 per cent) all bear a somewhat higher burden than the UK (47 per cent in these figures). The OECD also shows where the differences arise. Compared with the UK, for example, the US spends far less of its GDP on publicly provided health and housing. Compared with the UK, Japan spends far less on defence and income transfers. Again compared with the UK, Germany spends far more on income transfers, which is still truer of other northern European welfare states. Core function Income transfers have, in fact, become the core function of the European state, accounting for 26.8 per cent of GDP in Sweden in 1990, 23 per cent in Denmark, 18.5 per cent in Germany, but 13.4 per cent in the UK, 11.9 per cent in the US and only 7.8 per cent in Japan. In European welfare states, provision of public goods and economic services, the classic functions of the public sector, accounts for a far smaller share of GDP than transfers. In the UK, by comparison, the two elements are equivalent in size. Nevertheless, the UK's situation is not so different from that of other European states. What the Department of Social Security in a recent pamphlet calls 'social protection' (which includes health), accounted for 26 per cent of GDP in the European Union in 1990. At 23 per cent, the UK's ratio is again below the European average, but not wildly so. The world's top 10 spenders on social protection are European states and all face spiralling costs. The European states are on a treadmill. High public spending necessitates high taxes which undermine incentives and exacerbate poverty traps. These, in turn, lead to still higher unemployment and yet higher public spending. If they are to get off the treadmill, they will have to be radical. But radicalism is politically risky. The alternatives include more precisely drawn priorities, greater reliance on private provision and more extensive use of charges. Failing such radicalism from their governments, all European electorates will continue to grumble about worsening services and, of course, higher taxes.</p>

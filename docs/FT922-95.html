			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Protest by 100,000 in Belgrade A crowd of some 100,000 people gathered in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, yesterday to protest against the government of President Slobodan Milosevic, Reuter reports from Belgrade. Mr Milosevic yesterday agreed to round-table talks with his political opponents, but a delegation representing the protesters gathered outside the Yugoslav parliament indicated after talks with the president that they may not accept anything short of his resignation, 'The president of Serbia accepted round-table talks and a test of his presidential mandate in elections or a referendum,' the five-man delegation told the crowd in a brief statement after the one-hour meeting. The president, a nationalist and former communist, has stubbornly ignored pressure to resign, and his opponents' demands for more democracy, peace and a change of policy to escape from almost total international isolation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 22 Jun -- The Iranian Foreign Minister Dr.  'Ali Akbar Velayati has sent a letter to Ukraine's Foreign  Minister Anatoliy Zlenko concerning the developments in Crimea  following a decision by the autonomy's Supreme Council to  restore the Crimean Republic's Constitution of 1992.    "The Islamic Republic of Iran is convinced," the letter  stresses, "that this problem must be solved on the basis of full  adherence to the principles of international law: Respect of  sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of borders,  nonviolent conflict resolution, and noninterference in the  states' internal affairs." The author of the letter noted that  the "Crimean issue" was Ukraine's internal problem and could be  resolved peacefully. Dr. Velayati stressed that Iran strived to  achieve the above goal by means of mutual trust and peaceful  coexistence.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> NATION'S BANKS ENJOY RECORD NET IN QUARTER  </P> <P> U.S. banks earned a record $7.3 billion in the first quarter, but an  information service compiling the report said Monday that the industry must  come to terms with some short-term challenges.  </P> <P> Alex Sheshunoff &amp; Co. said that of the nation's 12,994 banks, 91% were  profitable with total earnings of $7.8 billion in the period. But those profits  were marginally offset by losses of $500 million at the unprofitable banks.  </P> <P> Comparatively, the savings and loan industry lost $3.4 billion in the first  quarter. Of the 2,946 institutions, 2,163, or 73%, were profitable in the first  quarter with earnings of $1.4 billion. But the gains were erased by losses of  $4.8 billion at the 783 unprofitable institutions.  </P> <P> Although bank profits were exceptionally strong, company President Alex  Sheshunoff said the industry must take note of the increasing probability of a  recession, declining real estate values because of excessive growth in some  regions, and the need of some banks to deal with the value of loans to lesser  developed nations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Limited Loan Growth  </P> <P> He said that with both businesses and consumers pulling back, there is clear  indication the economy is slowing down.  </P> <P> "In the first quarter, real estate loans remained the only major source of loan  growth, increasing by $18 billion, or 2.83%, to $654 billion," Sheshunoff said.  "Commercial and industrial loans rose only $3 billion, or 0.6%, to $500  billion. And loans to individuals actually declined by $5.3 billion, or 1.47%,  to $356 billion."  </P> <P> In real estate, while the California market showed continued growth, the  Southwestern market was burdened by tens of billions of dollars in repossessed  real estate assets held by S&amp;Ls and regulators.  </P> <P> "A soft landing in a highly leveraged industry such as real estate can mean a  hard landing for the financial institutions involved," Sheshunoff said.  </P> <P> In terms of overall strength, profitability and growth, the Southeast was the  strong region with first-quarter loan growth of 1.8%, a 1.03% return on assets,  and only 1.24% of non-performing loans.  </P> <P> South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia led the nation in loan growth with  first-quarter increases of 4.73%, 4.01% and 2.92% respectively.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Super-Regional' Banks  </P> <P> Alaska with 6.85% had the highest percentage of non-performing assets to gross  loans. Arizona with 6.45% and Texas with 6.42% were next.  </P> <P> "The bankers in the Southeast still remember the major problems they dealt with  in the mid-1970s," Sheshunoff said. "Combining this respect for history with  excellent bank management, the base has been built for a number of major  'super-regional' banking organizations. Over the next few years the Southeast  'super-regional' banks will become major, nationwide banking organizations."  </P> <P> Home equity loans grew significantly from last year, especially in the  Northeast and California, the report said.  </P> <P> Wells Fargo was the leading lender with $1.7 billion, up 14%; followed by  Citibank $1.43 billion, up 15%; Bank of America $1.27 billion, up 135%;  Security Pacific with $835 million, up 122%, and Connecticut National Bank with  $632 million, up 106%.  </P> <P> Foreign loans increased only slightly from the previous year at the three  largest banks that make foreign loans. Citibank held the largest amount of  foreign loans with $52.8 billion, up 4.3%. Chase Manhattan had $29 billion, up  1.2% and Bank of America $22.1 billion, up 0.6%.  </P></p>

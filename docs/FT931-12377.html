			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: MFI shows 33% fall as sales slip NEWS OF a disappointing start to the post-Christmas sales at MFI Furniture Group yesterday marred its first results to be announced since last July's flotation. Mr Derek Hunt, chairman and chief executive, gave a downbeat assessment of current trading alongside the announcement of a 33 per cent fall in pro forma pre-tax profit, from Pounds 19m to Pounds 12.7m, in the 28 weeks to November 7. 'I'm disappointed with these results, but they should be viewed in the context of hostile economic conditions, in particular in the housing market,' he said. Turnover slipped from Pounds 321.6m to Pounds 303.6m. Pro forma operating profit was 20 per cent down at Pounds 19.4m, before a Pounds 1.9m charge for closing some dealerships. The figures were at the bottom end of expectations. Profit forecasts for the year to April, which had been pushing Pounds 80m at the time of flotation, were downgraded again yesterday to about Pounds 45m. One analyst said this marked the difference between earlier hopes of a 5 per cent rise in sales this year and the latest projection of a 5 per cent decline. Mr Hunt said turnover was down in the first five weeks of the 10-week sale period, which accounted for about 30 per cent of the annual total. The outcome was, however, being compared with a strong January sale last year. He also pointed out that slower sales of the large-ticket kitchen and bedroom furniture, which tended to be made in-house, meant that margins had been depressed. Beds, upholstery and cheaper goods had shown some growth. Like other retailers, MFI experienced an immediate drop in sales after the mid-September sterling crisis. The flotation enabled most of the Pounds 500m debt left over from the 1987 management buy-out to be repaid. Net debt stood at about Pounds 83m in November for gearing of 78 per cent. This greatly reduced interest payments. In the first half of last year they amounted to Pounds 35.9m, the actual amount paid this time was Pounds 18.3m and the pro forma figure - assuming the flotation had happened before the period - was Pounds 5.4m. Actual pre-tax loss was Pounds 12m. Interest costs, an Pounds 11m flotation-related management bonus and Pounds 2.2m bank fees accounted for the near Pounds 25m difference between the actual loss and pro forma profit. Mr Hunt said that with no sign of recovery, the emphasis remained on cost-cutting. The abandonment of regular Sunday opening and the shedding of nearly 400 jobs would cut payroll costs. The group, which has 175 stores in the UK, was also letting out surplus retail space and shrinking its warehousing. Progress had been made in France where the plan was to increase the number of stores from 32 to 50. MFI's share price shed 7p yesterday to close at 128p, compared with the flotation price of 115p, when the market was much softer. Its present Pounds 744m market value compares with Pounds 718m for the buy-out. An interim of 1.25p is being paid. Pro forma earnings were 1.4p (2.1p). Actual loss was cut from 97.1p to 4.3p.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by B.M.: "KRRiT Resolution; 45 Minutes for </F> Political Parties"]    [Text] Yesterday, after five months' work, the National  Council of Radio and Television [KRRiT] adopted a resolution on  access of political parties to public radio and television. A  decision on access of state organs to Polish Television will be  made by KRRiT this morning.    Every week the most numerous political parties will be able  to present themselves on Polish Television in a program that  will be prepared jointly by television journalists and the  parties' representatives. According to unofficial information  that we learned from KRRiT, Polish Television President Wieslaw  Walendziak is not really delighted with this solution; he  believes, however, that this kind of the parties' "windows," in  the form of a magazine program, will make it easier for  political parties to get access to television. Cooperation in  the creation of a model of such a program was declared by KRRiT,  which is going to invite the parties and the public broadcaster  to work out a set of rules for the appearances of the parties on  television.    Along with the resolution, KRRiT prepared a statement in  which it draws attention to the general mannerism of  broadcasters, who violate the integrity of statements by  shortening them or by lowering the volume of the voices of  politicians who are talking with journalists. According to  KRRiT, it is proof of nonprofessionalism, which is not found in  the West. Some KRRiT members note that people are presented  with the danger of the council's censorship, whereas the worst  type of censorship is employed by journalists, who cut out two  out of four spoken sentences as they wish.    The KRRiT statement also mentions a dangerous blurring of  responsibility: The Polish Television president, the head of the  Television Information Agency (there is an autonomy in  information programs), and the directors of the individual  programs are not really responsible for mistakes in information  programs. The most important decisions here are made by the  editor of a particular program, who is often only an associate  member of television. It is necessary to make this  responsibility clear, says the KRRiT statement.</p>

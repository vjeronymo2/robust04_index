			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- Japan's economy contracted  in the last quarter of 1993 but unexpected firmness in personal  consumption curbed the decline, the Economic Planning Agency  said Tuesday [22 March]. The long-slumping economy is still  expected to start recovering in the fiscal year starting next  month, but the timing remains uncertain, said Tsutomu Tanaka,  the agency's vice minister.    Real gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 0.6 percent in the  October-December period from the previous quarter, or an annual  rate of 2.2 percent, the agency said in a quarterly report.    That performance beat an average 4.2 percent contraction  predicted by economists at 25 institutions in a recent KYODO  NEWS SERVICE survey that found forecasts of shrinkage ranging  from 1.0 to 5.9 percent.    Japan's real GDP, the value of all goods and services  produced in the country, grew 0.1 percent in calendar 1993, the  agency said. Gross national product, which also includes net  income from abroad, expanded 0.1 percent in 1993.    To meet the government's estimate of 0.2 percent real GDP  growth for fiscal 1993 ending this month, Tanaka said real GDP  must grow 1.26 percent in the current quarter, or at an annual  rate of 5.1 percent. He said such growth was "not impossible."    But despite such growing bright spots as personal  consumption, which was up 0.7 percent for the quarter, he said  it is too early to confirm whether the economy has hit bottom.  Data for the current quarter could confirm a low point, he  added.    "The economy remains broadly sluggish," Tanaka said of the  report, which adjusts the GDP figures for inflation. But he  noted "partial brightness," especially within the personal  consumption category.    "As for judging if that was the bottom, we cannot make that  determination yet," Tanaka said.    For the economy to break even for fiscal 1993, GDP must grow  a real 0.65 percent this quarter, he said. Such a pickup in the  January-March quarter could be helped by typical fiscal year-end  factors as companies prepare to close their books.    Housing investment rose 1.8 percent after the previous  quarter's impressive 9.0 percent growth. Personal consumption  added 0.4 point to GDP, with strength in such housing-related  areas as large appliances and other durable goods, as well as  spending on travel, Tanaka said.    But overall, domestic demand was flat, he said, with the  report showing no boosting or retarding effect by domestic  demand on the economy.    Corporate capital spending continued to slump in the  quarter,  and the net export of goods and services -- hurt by the strong  yen -- was a 0.6 percentage point drag on GDP, the report said.    With capital spending expected to remain on the decline,  Japan will be able to muster only the gentlest of recoveries  late in fiscal 1994, said Nobuyuki Saji, chief economist at  Nikko Research Center.    Fiscal year-end factors may boost the economy this quarter,  but their absence will probably pull GDP back into minus  territory in the following three months, he said. "It's one  step forward and one step back," Saji said.    The fiscal second half, which starts in October, will  probably witness 1.5 percent growth from the same period a year  earlier, he said. But Tuesday's reported healthy gain in  personal spending, which comprises the bulk of domestic demand,  indicates that the "risk of another decline has largely  subsided," Saji said.    The personal consumption gain, boosted by home appliance  sales, was a bit more than expected, said chief economist Masaru  Takagi at Fuji Research Institute.    But the continued slump in spending on plants and equipment  was a prime drag that kept the economy from expanding in the  quarter, he said. A shrinkage of exports due to the high yen  will probably continue to weigh on the economy, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Elections To Be Held in Aruba </F> After one Year"]    [Excerpt] New elections are to be held in Aruba. Last  month saw the fall of the cabinet of Prime Minister Nelson  Oduber of the socialist MEP [People's Electoral Movement].  Since then, he has not been able to reach agreement with  opposition leader Hennie Eman of the liberal AVP [Aruban  People's Party].    The shaky MEP coalition (the party had 9 of the 21  parliamentary seats) with the ADN [National Democratic Action]  and PPA [Aruban Patriotic Party] splinter parties (one seat  each) suddenly collapsed because Oduber was more than tired of  the favoritism policies of his partners. The two political  dwarfs repeatedly succeeded in pushing things through as they  wanted because the MEP could not govern without them.    Oduber tried to avoid holding new elections by offering to  form a cabinet comprising the AVP, which also has 9 seats, for  the remaining three years of the government's term. Eman  immediately said he was against the suggestion. "That would  mean that the AVP approved the policies of the last year and was  also jointly responsible for them. I am ready to form a crisis  government with the MEP as long as elections are organized  within a year," he said.    That was going too far for Oduber. After removing the ADN  and PPA ministers, he remained with an outgoing cabinet of five  MEP ministers. He preferred new elections and withdrew his  instructions to the two negotiators he had appointed to examine  the possibility of forming a cabinet.    Aruba's eight political parties are to present their lists  of  candidates by 8 June. Six parties are advocating maintenance of  the separate status [from the Netherlands] as the most important  point on their programs. The elections will be held on 29 July,  which does not suit the AVP.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Observer: Write on The revanchist Independent newspaper, now under the helm of the FT's former deputy editor, can anticipate some big UK political scoops, if its new deputy editor, Martin Jacques, can work on his tennis game with his regular partner - Labour's Tony Blair. Jacques has never shied away from experimenting with his political game. Former editor of Marxism Today - RIP 1991 - he teamed up with Rupert Murdoch's Sunday Times because he liked the paper's anti-establishment attitude; the enemy of my enemy is my friend being a familiar motto to communists since Lenin onwards. Aficionado of formula one motor racing, Jacques left the British Communist party in 1991, when the party was anyway all but dead. These days, Jacques is chairman of his own seeker after the Holy Grail, a think-tank called Demos, launched in 1993. He says Demos is 'neither left nor right in any traditional sense . . . radical, not centrist'. Its forte is the generation of ideas obviously headed for the filing cabinet labelled 'ignore', such as establishing 'juries' of 20 randomly chosen people to debate national childcare provisions.</p>

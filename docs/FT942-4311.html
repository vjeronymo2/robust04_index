			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Arts: A 'Jenufa' ill served by production - Opera Janacek's fine, morally penetrating opera is proof against almost anything, and it easily survives Lucy Bailey's amateurish new production at the Coliseum. Jenufa is the first of his mature operas, but the last now to enter the English National Opera repertoire, after David Pountney's often inspired versions of the other six. Luckily it boasts an excellent cast, though they have been given precious little help; it will undoubtedly run better, or at least limp less painfully, when it has been run in. Two years ago Miss Bailey devised a beautiful, dream-like staging for Giorgio Battistelli's Teorema (after Pasolini's film and novel) which was universally admired. Not so her production of Paisiello's Barbiere at Wexford last year; and now Jenufa - inescapably naturalistic, village-domestic, red-blooded - catches her without the elementary skill of animating her performers. They stand, or sit, awkwardly about. Their exchanges are lame, under-defined. There is nothing for it but to Emote on the spot, which they all do to their hopeful best. Even Josephine Barstow's Kostelnicka seems to be trapped in a neck-brace throughout, and at her great crises she is reduced to repetitive arm-twitches. Can this be Janacek's formidable matriarch, whose model - as we learn from the ENO programme-book, excellent as usual - was a notable singer and dancer with 'a vital energy, a harmony of movement and an elevated bearing'? The Kostelnicka is not the crabbed, hypocritical Kabanicha of Katya. When she sings, Miss Barstow's intensity of understanding is marvellous, but the voice has to do all the work. Susan Bullock's sweet, touchingly gawky Jenufa is in a similar fix, rescued by her transparent honesty. David Maxwell Anderson's natural assets make him an admirably flash, flamboyant, feckless Steva, with a big, handsome voice to match. Best of all is Kim Begley as his half-brother Laca. Miss Bailey hobbles him, too - but he is visibly, sympathetically choked with his frustrated love and his strange private anger, and delivers his music with seething passion and an unyielding grip on its expressive sense. Shelagh Squires' Grandmother Burya wears a gentle dignity that makes its own mark, and Arwel Huw Morgan's warm, kindly Foreman is faultless. The boy Jano is almost completely unintelligible, even in his crucial report of the discovery of the dead baby. Nicholas Folwell's nice study of the Mayor is not parodied; he is more fortunate than his wife and daughter, whose costumes make them instant travesties. In fact Simon Vincenzi's costumes reach their ghastly nadir in that final act. From the random dress of the villagers at the start, one supposed that he was eschewing anything recognisably Czech; but for the wedding he descends into queasy, milk-and-water ethnic caricature. Likewise, the choreographer Leah Hausman follows her lively, plausible dances for the first act with an excessively twee little number for the wedding, too mimsy to be ironical. Otherwise, Miss Bailey's handling of the village crowds is pure village-hall theatre, stiff and limp at once. The whole production might be regarded as a piece of 'conceptual art', in the sense that it doesn't look very good, nor interesting, but is more or less 'explained' by her remarks printed in the programme-book. A large, blank screen overhangs the stage, lit in various colours at different times: that must be the 'crushing' sky which symbolises Jenufa's 'confined' life. I was less sure about the swelling sea of hip-high yellow flowers that is the sole ornament of Act 1. The expansion of the bleak little cottage room of Act 2 into an Act 3 space, so as to accommodate the wedding guests, looks like crude makeshift. Young Sian Edwards conducts. She is not, of course, Charles Mackerras or Bernard Haitink or Mark Elder; she brings her own eager rush to the score, but one misses Janacek's serene warmth and breadth (and any intimate rapport with the singers). All of this noble music amounts to a kind of ethical commentary on the action, wise, elevated and tender; it is always more than mere reflection of the characters' transient feelings. So far, Miss Edwards makes distinctly less of it than that: the glorious transforming close sounds like no more than strenuous jubilation.</p>

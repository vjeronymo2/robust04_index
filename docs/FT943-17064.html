			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Alliance's architect: Yohei Kono Mr Yohei Kono, Japan's new deputy prime minister and foreign minister, was the principal architect of the incongruous alliance of socialists and Liberal Democrats now ruling Japan, writes Gerard Baker in Tokyo. Elected to lead the LDP following its defeat last summer, he has spent most of the past year attempting to unseat the governments of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa and Mr Tsutomu Hata, finally patching together a deal with the socialists minutes before Wednesday night's vote in the lower house of the Diet. Mr Kono, a 57-year-old former cabinet secretary in the last LDP government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, has a reputation as a firm supporter of Japan's pacifist constitution. He moves to the Foreign Ministry as a lively debate is under way about Japan's international role. Some in the ministry favour giving the country a stronger presence in the international arena, but Mr Kono has said that Japan should be a 'soft power', developing its political and economic role rather than a military one. He has tried to distance the LDP from its scandal-ridden past, building on a reputation earned in the 1970s as an early member of the party's reformist wing. Mr Kono left the party in 1976 to form a breakaway group, the New Liberal Club, following the Lockheed payoff scandal. But his reputation was not enhanced by a decision to rejoin the LDP in 1986, even though the party had changed little.</p>

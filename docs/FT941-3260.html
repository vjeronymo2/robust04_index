			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Australia puts on 4% growth The Australian economy grew 4 per cent in 1993, the strongest annual growth seen for five years. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, gross domestic product grew 1.7 per cent in seasonally-adjusted terms during the final three months of the year, pushing the rate for the 12 months to end-December to 4 per cent. Market forecasts ahead of the data's publication had been bullish, and the result for the final quarter was at the lower end of predictions. Some analysts, for example, had suggested an advance of 2 per cent-plus could be recorded in the final period. Australia now has the third highest annual growth rate in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, behind Turkey, where growth is running above 7 per cent, and New Zealand, with 4.2 per cent. The latest figures mean the government will again revise its official growth target during the 1993-94 fiscal year in the May 10 budget. 'In the light of these figures, we will be revising our estimate up again,' Mr Ralph Willis, the treasurer, said yesterday. 'What precisely that number will be, will be revealed in the budget.' Mr Willis had said he expected growth in the 12 months to end-June 1994 to be about 3.5 per cent. The government's original forecast, made in the budget last August, was 2.75 per cent. Yesterday, the treasurer also confirmed that growth in the next fiscal year, 1994-95, was likely to exceed 4 per cent. Australia's strong growth in the latter half of 1993 was driven by private consumption, which rose 1.8 per cent in the final quarter, and 3.2 per cent for the year, and by exports, which rose by 2.7 per cent and 6.6 per cent for the same respective periods. However, business investment was flat in the final quarter and showed a 12.5 per cent decline over the year. This was immediately attacked by Mr Alexander Downer, opposition spokesman on economic issues. 'It is a matter of great concern that business investment remains flat. . . If recovery is to be sustainable, business investment must pick up strongly and underpin economic growth.' Prime Minister Paul Keating used the business investment figures as an opportunity to sound a reassuring note on interest rates. There was 'a way to go' before business investment picked up, he declared. 'We're not about to choke that off with any misplaced sort of caution.' Speculation has been rife recently that Australian interest rates might have to rise, although Mr Willis has played down the possibility, at least in the short term.</p>

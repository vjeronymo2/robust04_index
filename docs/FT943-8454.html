			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Fed's firm hand Yesterday's increase in US interest rates is welcome. It is evidence that the Federal Reserve is prepared to act early to damp inflationary pressures. With the US economy poised to grow nearly 4 per cent this year and the recovery in its fourth year, capacity constraints cannot be far away. There must also be a limit to how long industry can shoulder higher raw material prices without these feeding through into retail price inflation. The bitter history is that once inflation is clearly visible, it is already too late for central banks to act. The Fed's strong line on inflation, though widely expected, should underpin US bond markets. Interest rates will have to rise again towards the end of the year but the half-point increase in official interest rates means there should be a respite for at least a few months. The dollar should also be less vulnerable. The Fed's move is good news for European bond and equity markets, which tend to take their lead from US bond markets. A more important factor, though, will be how the Bundesbank acts in the coming days and weeks. Markets are still divided over whether German interest rates have hit their bottom. A further downward tick in the repurchase rate following tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting is a possibility. That would probably give short-term relief to other European markets, which are struggling to maintain their attraction in the face of a strong D'Mark. But with signs that the German economy is motoring ahead, the Bundesbank would be wise to hold rates steady for now and prepare markets for an upward move in the New Year.</p>

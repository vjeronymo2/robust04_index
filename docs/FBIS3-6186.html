			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea-U.S.  high-level dialogue has been delayed indefinitely due to  insufficient International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspection results, a government official here said Tuesday [15  March].    IAEA Director-General Hans Blix is highly likely to convene  a  special Board of Governors meeting within the week to brief the  members on the inspection results, the official said.    The IAEA inspection team was to leave Pyongyang and head  back to the Agency's headquarters in Vienna on Tuesday morning.    The inspectors leave without having secured the promised  access to one or two critical sites at the radiochemical  laboratory, an installation the IAEA has said would be a nuclear  reprocessing plant when completely built.    "North Korea has not met either of the two preconditions for  the Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks. The talks are now  suspended indefinitely," said the official.    Seoul and Washington earlier made conditional promises to  call off the annual joint military drill "Team Spirit" and to  hold the high-level meeting on March 21 in Geneva.    The pledges were made on the condition that North Korea  allow  unlimited IAEA inspections and exchange special envoys with  South Korea.    "North Korea is apparently trying to acquire more  negotiating  cards with its nuclear facilities," said the government  official. "It remains up to the IAEA to determine whether the  just-concluded inspection proved that North Korea did not divert  nuclear material for non-peaceful uses."    The IAEA inspectors need two to three weeks to produce a  conclusive report on North Korea, but the official said Blix is  unlikely to wait until the report comes out to convene a special  board meeting.    "It's very probable that the special board session will be  convened within this week," he said.    Blix is expected to make some sort of announcement by  Wednesday or Thursday on the IAEA's evaluation of the North  Korean inspection, he said.</p>

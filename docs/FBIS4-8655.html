			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>   [Text] Sofia, April 15 (BTA) -- Last night's heated  debates in the National Assembly on allowing passage through  Bulgaria of UN military equipment and property for UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] is a central topic of the press today.    According to DUMA, the daily of the Bulgarian Socialist  Party  (BSP), parliament is expected to announce today its final  decision on the draft resolution which the cabinet worked out  and moved for debate at an extraordinary meeting held last  night. TRUD, the daily of one of the major trade unions, says  that MP's of both the former communist BSP and the  anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) yesterday  accused the government of violating the Constitution and of high  treason. The private STANDART NEWS brings forward the fact that  the government adopted its decision behind the back of  parliament. "Parliament and government did not come to terms,"  BULGARSKA ARMIYA says.    The press reports that Deputy Prime Minister Valentin  Karabashev and Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said in  parliament that the decision for transshipment of equipment  across Bulgaria for UNPROFOR in Macedonia was adopted, while  Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev said it was not. A  commentary in DUMA, headlined "Corridor -- Yes! But It Depends  for What Purposes," says that "the Americans cannot understand  our sensitivity and justified fear of Turkish troops deployment  in the Balkans." According to the daily with the largest  circulation, 24 CHASA, the government's decision of yesterday  has shaken its positions. "Government Discredited Bulgaria  Again, This Time at the United Nations," reads a front-page  report in DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the oppositional SDS.  According to KONTINENT, the scandal in parliament predicts the  fall of the cabinet. KONTINENT quotes MP's of the SDS as saying  that the Union will most probably move a vote of no confidence  in the Government. A signed commentary in KONTINENT says that  the continued agony of Bulgaria could only end if Prime Minister  Lyuben Berov resigns.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Rioters have stabbed, stoned or clubbed to death at least 40 people and wounded  nearly 700 in two days of attacks against Senegalese living in the Mauritanian  capital of Nouakchott, hospital sources said. Troops were on patrol in the city  and in Dakar, capital of neighboring Senegal, where Mauritanian traders and  shops have been attacked. There was no reliable word on the number of  casualties outside Nouakchott. Both governments appealed for calm and began  repatriating victims who wanted to leave. The violence in the two countries on  the edge of the Sahara was sparked by competing claims to farming areas on an  island in the Senegal River, which forms the border between the two western  Africa nations. The dispute flared into violence on April 9.  </P></p>

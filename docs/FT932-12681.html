			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Falling metals prices push Asarco to loss ASARCO, the integrated US copper producer, reported a first-quarter loss of Dollars 30.9m, or 74 cents a share. A slide in metals prices and damage from heavy rain at its biggest Arizona copper mine contributed to the loss. The company reported a profit of Dollars 6.4m, or 16 cents, excluding special accounting charges. Sales were Dollars 457.1m, down from Dollars 458.9m last time. Asarco's average realised copper price fell to 99 cents a pound in the first three months of the year, from Dollars 1.01 a year ago. Lead prices dropped to 20 cents, from 25 cents; zinc prices to 47 cents, from 53 cents; and Asarco's average realised price for gold sank to Dollars 334.86 an ounce, from Dollars 373.06. Since the quarter's end, copper prices have continued to slide, and this would affect second-quarter results, the company said. Lower metals prices accounted for an after-tax operating earnings decline of Dollars 6m in the first quarter. A scheduled 30-day maintenance shutdown of Asarco's smelter in Hayden, Arizona, cost the company about Dollars 7m in first-quarter earnings, while effects of heavy rains, which continued through late February, cost about Dollars 20m after-tax in damage and production losses. During the quarter, Asarco opened a new copper smelter in El Paso, Texas, which is expected to reach full capacity of 110,000 tons of copper concentrates later this year. Phillips Petroleum reported a first-quarter profit, compared with a loss a year ago, higher oil and natural gas prices, Reuter reports. Excluding special items, it had first-quarter earnings of Dollars 57m, compared with loss of Dollars 29m a year earlier. This year's profit included a Dollars 22m workforce reduction charge, part of continued efforts to control costs. Last year's first-quarter loss included a Dollars 62m charge relating to job cuts. In the latest quarter, upstream operations recorded higher earnings, while refining, marketing and chemicals remained under pressure.</p>

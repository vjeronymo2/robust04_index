			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Oil pipeline ruptures also represent a potential source of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groundwater contamination. Three oil pipelines run roughly parallel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to each other across the Barton Springs segment and its contributing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zone and cross Barton Creek near the Hays/Travis county line. Two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these lines ruptured within the recharge zone during the 1980's,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about 13 kilometers (8 miles) south of Barton Springs. These two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spills constitute the largest spills reported from Hays and Travis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counties between 1986 and 1992 (TWC, unpubl. data). The first major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spill occurred in 1986, about 270 meters (300 yards) from Slaughter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Creek, when an oil pipeline was severed during a construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation and released about 366,000 liters (96,600 gallons) of oil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The equipment necessary to contain the spill was on-site at the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the spill occurred (Russell 1987), and about 91 percent of the spill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was recovered (Rose 1986). The second pipeline break occurred in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1987 near the first spill site and released over 185,000 liters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (49,000 gallons) of oil. According to the TWC database, more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 97 percent of this spill was recovered (TWC, unpubl. data).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the effects of these two spills on the Barton Springs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salamander are unknown, similar spills that are not immediately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remediated could adversely impact the salamander and its habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Peter Rose (1986), a geologist who has studied the effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pipeline oil spills on the Edwards Aquifer, has estimated that oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spills of 160,000 liters (42,000 gallons) or more pose a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``reasonable danger'' of entering and contaminating the Edwards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aquifer. ``Free oil entering an unconfined aquifer would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to spread and travel in the direction of water flow,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emerging eventually at springs *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Rose 1986). Oil is highly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxic to aquatic life (Pyastolova and Danilova 1987). A study of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effects of oil on the sharp-snouted frog ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rana arvalis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) showed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that ``the presence of crude oil in an aquatic environment, even in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small amounts (0.05 ml/l) exerts an unfavorable influence on both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> embryonic and larval development'' of the frog, including increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mortality and appearance of deformities (Pyastolova and Danilova  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1987). Because of physiological similarities among amphibian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> larvae, the Barton Springs salamander may exhibit similar or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibly more severe reactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The conveyance and treatment of sewage in the watershed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly in the recharge zone, may also result in the impairment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of local water quality and negative effects to the Barton Springs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salamander. In 1982, high levels of fecal coliform bacteria at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barton Springs were attributed to a sewerline leak upstream from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barton Springs Pool. While fecal coliform bacteria are believed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be harmless, they may indicate the presence of other organisms that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are pathogenic to aquatic life (Slade  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1986), some of which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may pose a threat to salamanders and/or their prey base. The USGS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has stated that because ``there are many sewerlines near the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> springs, fecal coliform contamination of the springs may be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recurring problem'' (Slade  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1986). There are over 145  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kilometers (90 miles) of wastewater lines in the recharge zone of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Barton Springs segment (Maureen McReynolds, City of Austin Water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Wastewater Utility, pers. comm., 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once an aquifer is contaminated, it can be very difficult to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remediate. TDA (1987) maintains that ``contaminated groundwater can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be extremely difficult and expensive, and in some cases even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impossible, to clean up. The only way to maintain groundwater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality is to prevent contamination in the first place.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the effects of oil pipeline spills on the Edwards Aquifer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``*&blank;*&blank;* for all practical purposes, once spilled oil has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduced into a cavernous carbonate aquifer, only time and nature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can take care of the cleanup job'' (Rose 1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major contaminant spills that are not quickly remediated could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enter the aquifer and contaminate the waters feeding Barton Springs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response times to hazardous materials spills vary, depending on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several factors, including detection capability, location and size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the spill, weather conditions, whether or not the spill is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported, and the party performing the cleanup. Generally, cleanup  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is initiated within several hours following detection of a spill,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but many weeks may be necessary to complete the effort. In some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases in Travis County, cleanup of leaking storage tanks was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiated until two months following leak detection (Philip  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Winsborough, TWC, pers. comm., 1993). In other cases, such as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oil pipeline ruptures that occurred within the recharge zone,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleanup was initiated the same day the spill was detected and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed the following day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chronic water quality degradation of the aquifer resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from increasing urban activities (including roadway, residential,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial, and industrial development) may also lead to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination of the waters feeding Barton Springs (see also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion under Factor D). Because of the characteristics of karst  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aquifers discussed in the Background section, Barton Springs is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed to be ``heavily influenced by the quality and quantity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> runoff,'' particularly in the recharge zone (City of Austin 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A report by USGS (Veenhuis and Slade 1990) on the relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between urbanization and surface water quality in several streams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout the Austin area (10 of 18 sample sites were along streams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Barton Springs segment and its contributing zone)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrates that increases in impervious cover can lead to large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases in pollutant runoff. This is indicated in several streams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with increased levels of suspended solids, biochemical oxygen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demand, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fecal-group bacteria, inorganic trace elements, and synthetic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds. A preliminary review of water quality data for 15 wells  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Barton Springs segment also suggests that increasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impervious cover has resulted in increased concentrations of certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water quality constituents in the groundwater, including total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nitrogen and total phosphorus (USGS 1992). These changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groundwater quality may indicate future water quality changes at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barton Springs as development increases across the recharge and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributing zones.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

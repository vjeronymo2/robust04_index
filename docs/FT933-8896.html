			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Rexrodt plans measures to speed privatisation NEW laws to accelerate privatisation by Germany's 16 state governments, and local authorities, were promised yesterday by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister. He criticised sharply the growth of creeping public ownership through the powerful state banks, singling out especially WestLB, the public sector bank in North Rhine-Westphalia. Clearly intending to step up public pressure for more privatisation at state and local government level, he warned that he would introduce 'instruments of torture' to get the process moving. The spread of public ownership through state banks was in complete contradiction to the federal government's privatisation policies. Mr Rexrodt was not precise on the measures he intends, but said his ministry was working on the legislation. He proposed legal budgetary 'guidelines' as one measure, and compelling all public authorities to investigate private solutions to tasks currently conducted by publicly-owned bodies. His attack on North Rhine-Westphalia, and WestLB in particular, will certainly be warmly greeted by the private banking sector, which has been very critical of the growth of the state banks. WestLB is 43 per cent owned by the state government. Mr Rexrodt listed shareholdings of more than 10 per cent in nine separate public companies, including Preussag (32 per cent), the Horten retail chain (26 per cent) and VEW, the electricity generator (11 per cent), with a total value of more than DM3bn (Pounds 1.2bn). The bank also has unlisted shareholdings in the travel groups LTU, TUI and Thomas Cook, and other companies. He also called for Germany's powerful savings banks to be privatised 'as far as possible', in order to remove competition distortions in banking. As far as the federal government was concerned, he said, early privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the state telecommunications concern, had top priority. Plans for selling off service areas, such as airports and ports, should be accelerated.</p>

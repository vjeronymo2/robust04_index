			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Co-operation on training recommended by minister INDUSTRY training organ-isations (ITOs), recognised by governments as the voice of training for particular industries, were yesterday urged to act with companies in their sectors to promote more effective training. Mr Robert Jackson, a junior employment minister, made the appeal in his endorsement of an action plan which was the result of a study of 10 ITOs by Manpower Research on behalf of the Department of Employment and the National Council of Industry Training Organisations. The study showed how ITOs could improve their effectiveness, particularly through links with employers. It also said ITOs should set out their roles; identify their sectors' changing skill needs; and demonstrate that 'training pays'. The study was part of a wider review of ITOs, the results of which will be available in mid-1991. There are more than 100 ITOs, varying in size, resources, membership and activity.

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CARVING A LIFE;  </P> <P> AFTER LONG STRUGGLE, DEAF TUSTIN MAN DOING WHAT HE DOES BEST: INTRICATE  HANDWORK  </P> <P> You notice the eyes first, then the hands. The eyes are wonderfully expressive;  they have to be. They provide Julian Posada his only means of communication  with people who don't know sign language.  </P> <P> The hands communicate too. Julian's firm, strong, calloused grip speaks of a  life spent working with hands -- rough work that tore and scarred and once took  a finger. But when you see that work, you know those eyes reflect creativity,  and the rough-hewn hands are capable of the finest and gentlest and most  delicate artistry.  </P> <P> It took a leap of imagination for Steve Shedd and Tom Silk to see this -- or  even suspect it. Shedd and Silk are partners who own and operate Steven-Thomas  Antiques on Dyer Road in Santa Ana. Four years ago, they advertised for a  warehouseman. Julian Posada answered that ad. Or rather Julian and his family  did. Julian had been commuting from Tustin to a job in Los Angeles. Because he  can't drive, that meant spending the week with a friend in Los Angeles and  taking a bus to Tustin for weekends. The Posada family wanted a better life for  him.  </P> <P> So when a friend pointed out the Steven-Thomas ad, Julian, his wife, Ana Rosa,  and their daughter, Rosalind, came to interview for the job. Ana Rosa, like  Julian, has neither speech nor hearing. Rosalind -- a dark-haired, willowy,  animated teen-ager who is a freshman at Tustin High School -- is their voice,  their opening to a speaking world.  </P> <P> "She was 10 when they came in that first time," Shedd recalls. "A very  self-possessed young woman. She was dickering with us on behalf of her father,  and I never knew how much of it was getting back to him."  </P> <P> It was clear from the beginning that Julian was not a candidate for the  warehouse job. He was too old, for starters, but he was also too skilled. He  brought with him some pictures of furniture he had designed and built. The  pictures gave no real clue to his woodcarving skills, but they intrigued the  partners.  </P> <P> "The pictures," Shedd says, "gave him a whole new dimension, but Tom and I were  fascinated from the beginning with the fact that he was deaf, and we got  emotionally involved. That isn't always wise, but with Julian, it turned out  that we got a lot out of it too."  </P> <P> That likelihood became clear the first day Julian was on the job. "We needed to  duplicate a leg for a cabinet," Shedd says, "and the pictures Julian showed us  didn't indicate he knew woodcarving. But I asked him to do it anyway, and the  finished job was so perfect I couldn't tell the original legs from Julian's  carving."  </P> <P> Since that first test, Julian has carved his own place in the Steven-Thomas  operation. As the partners explained, antique furniture is sometimes damaged in  shipment from its source to the Santa Ana store. Delicately carved pieces are  broken or missing. So it became Julian's job to replicate those missing or  damaged pieces so perfectly that the repair work could never be seen. And that  he has done with consummate skill.  </P> <P> He proudly showed some of the jobs he has completed and the projects on which  he is now working -- mostly fine, intricate carving that he does with hand  tools. Then he sat at a table outside his workshop with Ana Rosa, Rosalind and  a friend named Luis Londono, who lives with the family, and talked about the  route he has traveled from Colombia to Orange County.  </P> <P> He talked with his hands and Rosalind translated. Ana Rosa and Luis -- reading  the sign language -- would frequently interrupt, and there would be a spirited  -- and silent -- argument among the three about the facts while Rosalind  patiently tried to get a consensus to report.  </P> <P> The basic biographical facts are undisputed. Julian and Ana Rosa, both deaf  from birth, grew up in Bogota, Colombia. Julian was one of six children whose  father struggled constantly to feed and clothe them on a carpenter's wage.  Julian began working with wood when he was 7, and by the time he reached  adulthood, Julian had his own woodcarving and cabinetmaking shop. He was mostly  self-taught, working from books he learned to read during two years of study at  a school for the deaf in Bogota. He met Ana Rosa at a party and was almost 40  when they were married in 1970.  </P> <P> He and his wife migrated to Florida three years later. Colombians could not  afford Julian's fine work and he hoped to find customers for his skills in  wealthy America. But it didn't work that way. He was unable to demonstrate his  skills in Miami -- mostly because he couldn't communicate -- and spent six  months as a dishwasher before he and Ana Rosa moved to Fresno to join a cousin.  Again, Julian couldn't find satisfactory work, so the couple moved to Houston,  where he found a job as a carpenter. But the wages were low and the birth of  Rosalind made Julian want to seek a better life.  </P> <P> That's when he wanted to give up the American Dream and move back to Colombia,  but Ana Rosa resisted. Hard. And into this standoff stepped an American friend  named Laura Valbuena, who had met and befriended Ana Rosa during a long stay in  Colombia a few years earlier. Valbuena, who is also deaf, lives in Orange  County and came to Houston to persuade Julian to get a green card and move back  to California. She helped him find work as a carpenter in Los Angeles and was  later instrumental in persuading the family to move to a much more attractive  home in Tustin. And this, in turn, precipitated the commuting problem that  brought about Julian's appearance at Steven-Thomas.  </P> <P> In the decade after his departure from Colombia, Julian's woodcarving skills  had lain dormant. And his carpenter work had cost him a finger in Texas, where  he accidentally cut off half the middle finger of his left hand with a power  tool while standing on a ladder. So at the age of 53, Julian went back to the  craft he had learned in his father's workshop almost five decades earlier.  </P> <P> Speaking through his daughter, Julian said: "This is the best job I've ever  had. I'm comfortable here. I have more chance to do design work here than I had  in Colombia. I mostly do what Steve tells me he wants, but I give him  suggestions too. I can be creative."  </P> <P> Communicating with Julian has been less of a problem than his employers or  co-workers anticipated. An artisan's hands can shape images as well as wield  tools, and Julian does this very eloquently. He also reads lips moderately well  if spoken to in Spanish, which most of his foremen have been able to do. And  usually his employers can show him a sample of what they want.  </P> <P> But mostly communication takes place in the exchange of creative minds that  have come more and more into sync every year. As Shedd points out: "Julian has  spent a lifetime learning to adapt quickly in a speaking, hearing world. His  senses of sight and feel are more developed than a hearing person's."  </P> <P> And Julian also has a priceless asset in his daughter, who hears normally and  has grown up in two quite different worlds. Her mother taught her sign language  in both Spanish and English when she was very small, and she learned spoken  language at the same time. Today, she moves easily between her own hearing  world and her parents' close friends, most of whom are deaf.  </P> <P> So in Orange County in 1989, the Posada family has at last tapped into that  elusive American Dream that seduced them in Colombia 16 years ago. Ana Rosa has  found a job as an assembler at a nearby factory, Rosalind is doing well in high  school, and Julian rides his bicycle to and from a job that finally is making  use of the talents he honed for the first four decades of his life.  </P> <P> As Steve Shedd wrote in a recent issue of the company newsletter: "Watching  Julian work wood is like watching Horowitz play the piano or Ozzie Smith  release a throw to first base -- the motion pure, confident and dignified."  </P> <P> There's another feeling that comes through profoundly in observing the Posada  family interact and Julian at work: a great sense of respect. Respect for  Julian's craft, respect for one another, respect for life. In that context,  it's hard to see Julian's deafness as an infirmity and a limitation. Or,  finally, to notice it at all.  </P></p>

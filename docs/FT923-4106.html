			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Great resigner raises banner of nationalism - David Buchan in Paris talks to maverick Socialist politician Jean-Pierre Chevenement 'IF the Noes win, the political landscape will change considerably in France,' says Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement hopefully. And the French Socialist party's leading maverick is already positioning himself to take advantage of any such change. He has now raised the banner of left-wing nationalism in that part of the political spectrum vacated by the mainstream of the Socialist party. Mr Chevenement is one of France's great resigners. He quit as industry minister in 1983 in protest at his party's rightward economic lurch, abandoned the Defence Ministry in early 1990 rather than lead France into combat against Iraq, and in July resigned from the Socialist party executive to be free to wage war against Maastricht. Since then, he has founded the Mouvement des Citoyens, dedicated to overthrowing the European union pact. Will he try to turn this movement into a proper political party, taking on the Socialists themselves? At this point Mr Chevenement, interviewed yesterday in his office in Paris' 16th arrondissement, hesitates with uncharacteristic caution. 'We will see what happens on September 20,' he says, hinting that the turning point could come at a second convention scheduled for his Mouvement des Citoyens later this year. He has few supporters in the parliamentary Socialist party; seven deputies in the national assembly and two senators joined him in voting against altering France's constitution to accommodate Maastricht. 'But in the electorate, there are thousands and thousands of voters who have been disinherited,' he says. 'Among the broad left, from the extreme left to centre-left, there is perhaps one third, and according to some opinion polls as much as 40 per cent, who are ready to vote against Maastricht.' Some of these come from communist supporters of Mr Philippe Herzog and of Mr Charles Fiterman, with whom Mr Chevenement was in government in the early 1980s. 'But the Mouvement des Citoyens has also attracted left-wing Gaullists, while most of its supporters have no fixed political commitment,' Mr Chevenement claims. One would have thought Maastricht's defence provisions would have attracted this nationalist ex-defence minister, precisely because they have aroused such suspicion across the Atlantic. Not a bit. 'In the Maastricht treaty, there is the part - economic and monetary union (Emu) - which is written in ink, and the rest, including defence, is written in pencil and is destined to disappear'. 'One cannot have a strong European defence with feeble policies to put it into practice,' says Mr Chevenement, citing the general decline in European defence spending and the apparent crumbling of European collaborative defence projects to the probable gain of US military contractors. The key to Maastricht is 'monetary union, and the deflationary criteria for it, which will force a number of EC countries to pursue austerity at one and the same time. Italy, the UK, Spain, even the Netherlands and Germany will have to submit to a totally unreasonable degree of discipline'. There is, Mr Chevenement says, 'a certain masochism in this treaty'. If Maastricht-style austerity closes French export markets in the rest of the EC, 'the only motor which keeps the French economy going these days will stop'. The former minister denounces the outdated vision of l'Europe des retroviseurs (Europe through the rear mirror) enshrined in Maastricht and urges a new 'pan-European initiative for growth' encompassing newly-liberated but unstable eastern Europe. This region needs open markets in western Europe. But with Maastricht, low growth in the EC will make that impossible. Like almost all French politicians, Mr Chevenement believes the EC should open up to industrial rather than agricultural goods from the east. Does not part of his political opposition to Maastricht lie in the economic difficulties of his own region around Belfort, near the Swiss border? He does not deny the impact of steady local job losses in the car and computer factories of Peugeot and Bull, and his frustration in trying to remedy this. Last year he pleaded for EC approval to get a French investment premium for the Belfort region. 'We were told we couldn't have this, because our GDP per capita was above the EC average. Of course it is. We produce high-value goods. Who made up this rule? Not any parliament, but just a bunch of bureaucrats.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Finnish Press Agency (FNB) report: "Sasi: Coalition Party </F> Needs To Debate Issues"]    [Text] Kimmo Sasi, vice chairman of the National Coalition  (Conservative) Party's parliamentary group, is calling for a  party debate on issues instead of personal matters. It is a  disturbing sign, according to Sasi, that the new ideas are  originating outside the party.    On Saturday [19 February] Sasi called for an internal party  debate on values and the future of the kind that has been  started by the young Finns under the leadership of Dr. Risto E.  J. Penttila, who in fact also belongs to the Coalition Party.    Speaker Riitta Uosukainen (Coalition Party) warned Saturday  against damaging the working possibilities for "a unified  Coalition Party that does real work" and demanded that the party  gather its strength for the election effort next year.    A debate on the state of the party has flared up in the  Coalition Party, and there has been criticism of party chairman  Pertti Salolainen in particular.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Contested call for a patient with patience (1) Sir, After the prominence given to a long-winded whinge about the hours GPs work ('What's up doc?', January 29/30) can we look forward to an uninspiring series of moans from other professionals? Surveyors spend hours out of doors in all weathers; lawyers may have to associate with the wrong sort; academics spend holidays marking exam scripts. Doctors who opt for general practice contract to provide 24-hour cover for their patients. They know their hours will be stretched, but generous pay levels reflect the inconvenience of occasional disrupted sleep. If a doctor finds being on call too demanding, he or she has the wherewithal to purchase cover from a deputising service. I G Stockman, 13 Albany Court, Stantonbury, Milton Keynes MK14 6DN</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / World Trade News: African leaders sign treaty LEADERS of 10 southern African states signed a treaty yesterday creating a development community to defuse the threat of economic competition from a powerful post-apartheid South Africa, Reuter reports from Windhoek. The Treaty of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) was signed at the University of Namibia by leaders from Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The new community with a population of 80m replaces the South African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC), formed in 1980 to reduce the dependence of South Africa's neighbours on its white-controlled economy. At the time, the black countries accused the South Africans of waging a regional campaign of military and economic destabilisation to bolster apartheid. 'It is time to reduce the areas of conflict and maximise the areas of co-operation,' Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi said before signing the treaty yesterday. Officials said they hoped SADC would develop into a common market with a regional parliament. The leaders urged Pretoria to speed the transition from white rule to democracy, which they set as the condition for South Africa's membership of their community. But Mr Charles Hove, SADC chief economist, said the community hoped to establish mechanisms for co-operation and integration before then.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Georgian forces 'agree to ceasefire': Ousted president is reported to have again fled the republic SUPPORTERS of ousted Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia yesterday agreed a truce with representatives of the new military government, according to the mayor of the Black Sea port of Poti, a pro-Gamsakhurdia stronghold. Mr Tengiz Baramidze said negotiations yesterday evening succeeded in agreeing a ceasefire between the two sides, thus averting the threat of an all-engulfing civil war in the 5m-strong republic. 'We decided we must stop this war. It is enough. On the other side of the barricades are Georgians. They are our sons,' Mr Baramidze said. Mr Gamsakhurdia, who fled to neighbouring Armenia after the collapse of resistance to a siege by rebel militia, returned to western Georgia last week. He is now said to have again left the republic. The ceasefire agreement followed a breakthrough by government forces at a key bridge that opened the way to Poti from the east. Four government soldiers were killed in the battle, outside the rail centre of Samtredia, and six were wounded. Mr Gamsakhurdia, who won a landslide election victory last May, was accused by the opposition of governing like a dictator. He was forced from office on January 6 after the siege in the now-gutted Georgian parliament in Tbilisi. The release of an SS19 intercontinental ballistic missile from a base in the republic of Kazakhstan on December 20 was carried out on orders of the central nuclear command, without the knowledge of the Kazakhstan government, General Yuri Gusev, commander of central space weapons, said. Although the Kazakh government was not informed of the launch, Washington was, he told the daily newspaper Izvestia. The launch, revealed over the weekend by the Washington Post newspaper, had been scheduled for two months. It calls into question both the control of nuclear weapons in the Commonwealth of Independent States, and the strength of agreements between them on nuclear issues. General Gusev said the launch programme had been approved in July 1991 by the Union's military-industrial commission, now disbanded. The states of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus, all possessing strategic as well as tactical nuclear weaponry, had agreed to a central control over nuclear weapons, but with close consultation between them on the use and deployment of missiles. Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakh president, told Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, during his visit to Alma Ata on Saturday that nuclear weapons presented no threat. Mr Hurd later said he was 'reasonably satisfied' with these and other assurances.</p>

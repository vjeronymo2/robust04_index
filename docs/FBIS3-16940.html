MSF which is responsible for space communications and  satellite intelligence gathering plans a rebuilding of the first  of the 60 silos left after the destruction of SS-11 ICBMs for  launches of a new generation booster developed on the basis of  an SS-19 missile by 1996. As many as five such silos will be  rebuilt, said the spokesman.    Russia's SS-19 two-stage missiles with a payload of 105.6  tons each are to be destroyed by the year 2003 as envisaged by  the START-2 agreement between Moscow and Washington.    It is also known that MSF plans an environmentally safe  general purpose launch pad for a new generation heavy duty  Angara-24 missile.    An MSF official said that since the new booster "can be  transformed depending on a payload and altitude", the new launch  pad would operate on the principle of "a changeable circus  arena".    The new booster is to undergo trial tests during 1998-1999  before being fired into outer space a year or two later.</p>

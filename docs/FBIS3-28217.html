			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- Pollack fishing and supply  countries will meet in Washington from Feb. 7-11 for the 10th  multilateral conference on conserving and using pollack  resources in the Bering Sea, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.    Concerned countries in fishing are South Korea, Japan and  China, and in supply, the United States and Russia. They are  signatories of a two-year moratorium on pollack fishing in the  Bering Sea that is due to be lifted this year if resource  conditions improve. They have been meeting regularly to discuss  ways of conserving pollack resources in the sea since February  1991.    They agreed on the difficult question of setting catch  quotas  at the previous meeting in November last year and are expected  to touch on drawing up the agreement text and other disputed  issues.</p>

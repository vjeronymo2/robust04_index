			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Funeral services  for former U.S. President Richard Nixon were held at 04:00 p.m.  local time (23:00 GMT) today at the Nixon Library and birthplace  in Yorba Linda, Orange County, California.    Nixon died in a New York hospital last Friday [22 April]  night at the age of 81 after suffering a major stroke last  Friday night. [sentence as received]    U.S. President Bill Clinton and four former U.S. presidents,  Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, along  with U.S. congressional leaders and senior government officials  were among the more than 2,000 guests at the service presided  over by Nixon's life-long friend the Rev. Billy Graham.    Among foreign guests from some 88 countries were Chinese  Vice- Premier Zou Jiahua, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Liu  Huaqiu and Chinese ambassador to the United States Li Daoyu  representing the Chinese Government. They paid tribute to the  late U.S. statesman, who opened the door to Sino-U.S. relations  and made important contributions to the improvement and  development of relations between the two countries.    As the service began under cloudy skies, Nixon's mahogany  casket, draped with two U.S. national flags, was moved to the  front of the library by ten U.S. soldiers in dress uniforms,  while the mourners stood to pay tribute.    The mourners were then addressed by Nixon's secretary of  state Henry Kissinger, U.S. Senate Republican leader Bob Dole,  California Governor Pete Wilson and U.S. President Bill Clinton.    In their eulogies, they all recollected Nixon's triumphs and  crises, and hailed him as a great leader.    Dole said that Nixon will be remembered as a great statesman  of the second half of the 20th century.    President Clinton praised Nixon as a leader with a sharp and  vigilant mind and expressed his gratitude once again for Nixon's  special counsel on Russia.    Following the eulogies, four jet planes flew over the  library  where the service was being held.    At the end of the 85-minute service, which was the first  funeral of a former president since Lyndon Johnson in January  1973, Nixon was laid to rest beside his wife pat, who died of  lung cancer last June. They are buried in a rose garden a few  steps from the black tile and whitewall house where Nixon was  born 81 years ago.    The garden was fashioned after the White House Rose Garden  and his wife of 53 years held it dear; it has more than 100  varieties of flowers -- pink, red and white. Fittingly,  burgundy roses named for the former first lady are now in full  bloom. And one of the roses came from China.    Finally, a 21-gun salute was fired to pay tribute to the  37th  president, and the two U.S. national flags that had draped the  casket were folded into triangles and presented to Nixon's two  daughters.    Earlier, funeral service officials said, about 42,000 people  filed past Nixon's casket in 21 hours as it lay in the Nixon  Library yesterday afternoon.    Mourners waited in a line three miles long and some waited  for as long as eight hours in chilly and damp weather to glimpse  the flag- draped casket in the library lobby.    In the lobby, mourners were greeted by a large color photo  of  a grinning Nixon giving a thumbs-up gesture. There was also a  picture taken by Nixon and his wife on China's Great Wall during  one of their visits to China.    Wreaths from China, Russia and Poland, and many more  flowers,  adorned the casket, which stood on a pedestal under the gaze of  a military honor guard.    Clinton declared today as a mourning day throughout the  United States and federal government offices closed out of  respect for the late U.S. president.    The U.S. Postal Service suspended regular mail delivery and  offices were closed for the day. The U.S. Congress, the Supreme  Court, and all U.S. stock, bond and commodities markets also  closed today.</p>

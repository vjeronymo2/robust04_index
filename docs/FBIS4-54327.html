			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 26 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government on Thursday reaffirmed the importance of abiding by  the inter-Korean declaration of the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula.    The government also resolved to continue to cooperate  closely  with the United States and the rest of the world community in  the effort to rectify North Korea's violation of the  denuclearization declaration.    At a unification and national security policy coordination  meeting presided over by Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku, the  government decided to continue to maintain the existing policy  of linking inter-Korean economic cooperation to the resolution  of the North Korean nuclear question.    A Unification Board official said that the meeting, however,  decided to make flexible conditions for such linkage depending  on the attitude of North Korea.    He said attendees shared the view that it is not proper to  discuss the issue of reconsidering the denuclearization  declaration at the present stage.    Regarding North Korea's demand for the replacement of the  existing military armistice agreement, the meeting reaffirmed  the government policy that such a replacement should be  discussed between the two Koreas once confience-building is  fostered in the areas of politics and military between the two  sides.    "Attending officials affirmed that the linkage of economic  cooperation to the nuclear issue cannot be withdrawn," said Kim  Hyong-ki, spokesman for the National Unification Board.    The attendees also expressed concern about a situation in  which North Korea may refuse to provide nuclear transparency,  challenging South Korea's efforts to abide by the  denuclearization declaration, Kim added.</p>

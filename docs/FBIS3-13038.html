They said his act was a mitzvah meant to save the people of  Israel, the Land of Israel, and Jewish settlements in Judaea,  Samaria, and Gaza.    The massacre in Hebron was not for the sake of Eretz Yisrael  or the settlers. But it was against them, against all that is  sacred and precious to us, that 118 bullets were fired by Barukh  Goldstein.    This Purim "gift" -- our vocabulary does not have a more  sarcastic term to apply to the massacre -- was delivered not  just to the dead, the wounded, and their families. Goldstein  sent his gift to the Jewish residents of Judaea, Samaria, and  Gaza, as well as Israel proper. Here are some of the components:    -- This "mitzvah" will bring a bloodbath in its wake, whose  main victims will likely be pure and innocent civilians like  those on the Brooklyn Bridge yesterday, and those of Qiryat  Arba' and other settlements and in the rest of Eretz Yisrael who  will be murdered in revenge. And in the current atmosphere of  incitement and breastbeating at the massacre, the general public  has been conditioned to show understanding for future murderers.  As a result, the settlers, not the killers, will be held  responsible for the casualties.    -- The government, forced to redouble its efforts "to save"  the collapsing Oslo agreement, will make further concessions.  These could eventually lead to the attainment of a long-held  goal of Yasir 'Arafat and Meretz adherents: the dismantling of  the settlements in stages, with Jewish Hebron, over which so  much blood was spilled, likely to be the first victim.    -- The release of some 1,000 Palestinian terrorists, which  is like handing them and potential murderers a license to  continue slaying Jews.    -- The Oslo process, in all its gravity, succeeded in easing  pressure from foreign countries, especially the U.S. Now, to  accelerate the peace process, the Americans have summoned the  Arabs and Israel to Washington and will present their  longstanding plan: retreat to the 1949 borders, including  Jerusalem.    -- Resentment is felt toward Qiryat Arba' and the other  settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza by a not insignificant  portion of Israeli society, including many whose basic instinct  is national but whose Jewish soul absolutely cannot acquiesce in  such massacres.    This public tells itself that if this is the price we must  pay occasionally for maintaining settlements (and the memory of  the Jewish underground also comes to mind) then the inescpable  conclusion is that the two peoples must be separated. That  includes the evacuation of Qiryat Arba' and Hebron of their  Jews, which enjoys the support of a majority in the government.    -- Before Israel's establishment, when the disturbances ran  riots in the land, Jews were forced to travel in convoys; now,  60 years later, we are being forced to return to the travel  procedures of a besieged society -- and to do so in Qiryat  Arba', which bears the flag of Israeli pride and fought  faithfully through the years for Israel's honor.    For years, those hating the settlements, including champions  of law and justice, sought to impose emergency regulations on  the Jewish residents of these strongholds, thus equating their  standing with that of the Arabs.    Now, in addition to all the moral, security, settlement, and  political "achievements" of the massacre, emergency regulations  have been imposed. For it is not difficult to mobilize support  from a conformist attorney-general, the self-righteous media,  and academia's legalists. That backing is provided with relish.    And those are just some of the political, security,  psychological, and existential results to be visited on us  because of this ghastly massacre.    "He was a righteous man," assert those who knew him well;  perhaps, but the moment he trained his gun at the backs of the  men kneeling in prayer in the Cave of the Patriarchs, he ceased  being righteous and became a mass murderer. There should be no  mourning for him.    Several people, including some halakhic authorities, saw the  killing as a mitzvah. If that's the case, I have no part of  such mitzvot. To the best of my understanding and knowledge,  the thrust of Judaism and the great majority of the observant  settlers in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza reject this interpretation.    In a deed which aroused passions almost 26 years ago, Rabbi  Moshe Levinger and a group of pioneers laid the foundation for  the renewal of Jewish settlement in Hebron and subsequently in  the rest of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza.    In the same period, a child was growing up in New York named  Baruch Goldstein who probably didn't know about the historic act  of Rabbi Levinger. He later chose to become a lethal agent in  demolishing the foundations of the Jewish community in Hebron  and elsewhere in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza.    And the founding father of the settlement movement does not  see that his handiwork is sinking in the sea. In a trance of  self-destruction, and in the name of Israel's honor, he refuses  to draw the necessary conclusions from the terrible act and  continues to preach his message.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Man in the news: Tough test for the nation's headmaster - John Patten Mr John Patten waited nearly 13 years to get his big job. Perhaps he was promoted too soon. For more than a decade the man who today revels in the title of secretary of state for education sat fretting as the under-secretary for this and the minister of state for that while others of his generation or thereabouts whizzed past him. They entered the cabinet room of No 10 Downing Street. He waited outside. The list of those who scaled the heights before his own elevation is lengthy: William Waldegrave, Chris Patten, John Major, Michael Howard, Peter Lilley, David Mellor. There is no evidence that John Patten regarded any of them as his intellectual superior. At long last, after the April 1992 election, he was made what he likes to call, only half in jest, 'the nation's headmaster'. One year later he seems about to preside over a period of chaos in the nation's schools. He has painted himself into a corner. Everyone seems to be against him - teachers, their trade unions, some parents and school governors, even the Thatcherites and right-wing think-tankers who provided the original motivating force for setting up a national curriculum and a system of testing. By no means all of this is Mr Patten's fault. The unwieldiness of the national curriculum and its associated assessments of pupil progress were built-in by his predecessors. The original framework, set out in Mr Kenneth Baker's seminal 1988 Education Act, was worked upon by civil servants and educationists and made so complicated as to contain the seeds of its own possible self-destruction. Yet it has been Mr Patten's job to persuade teachers of the merits of the government's education reforms. From the start he appeared to shrink from that task, preferring to rest on the authority of the law, the dignity of his office, and his commendable decision to send his daughter to a state school. Immediately after his appointment he went into hiding. He emerged to visit schools, but he resisted meetings with the teachers' powerful trade unions. He huddled with his civil servants, but hoarded the time available to outside advisers. A colleague of his, a close friend, explains that the secretary for education is rather shy. Perhaps he is. To outsiders who see him on television he seems affected, sometimes pompous. In close-up, in private, he is affable, witty, a healthily ambitious minister of unproven ability in a cabinet in which few are outstanding and most are grey. Yet the bedding-down of the Baker reforms is one of the most important tasks on the government's agenda. It can only be accomplished by a minister of outstanding ability. Mr Patten's qualifications for this historic post remain unproven. He belongs to neither of the two tribes associated in the popular mind with Conservative politicians. He is not an aristocrat; nor is he one of the self-made newly-rich. The son of a gardener, he became a lecturer at Oxford, a piece of personal history that he likes to cite as evidence of his suitability for his present position. He regards himself as an intellectual, although his musings and writings on the British constitution suggest that on that topic at least he does not have an original thought in his head. A devout Roman Catholic and family man, he is, as he cheerfully confesses, able to live decently enough on the combined earnings of himself and his wife, a successful management consultant. To his credit, he believes in the application of moral principles to public affairs. When he was minister of state at the Home Office he was able to go to his nearby flat for lunch. Perhaps he should have stayed at his desk, nibbled at a sandwich, and sought to refine the clauses in the criminal justice bill that are now under attack by both the police and the judiciary. Political life is unfair: a junior minister (as he then was) should not be held responsible for an important piece of legislation, but Mr Patten's detractors are now reminding us that he piloted the bill through the House of Commons. The resulting legislation has been widely criticised for its laxity towards persistent young offenders. This weekend his mettle is being tested as never before. Other ministers before him have wrestled public sector interest-groups to the ground: Mr Kenneth Clarke roughed up both the teachers and the medical profession and got away with it; when Mr Baker came to office the teachers were on strike. He saw them off. Mr Waldegrave was the subject of much public ridicule during his period as secretary for health, but the National Health Service reforms went ahead. The difference in Mr Patten's case is that the government itself is held in uniquely low esteem, the Conservatives' majority in parliament is slim, and the minister appears to have no allies. That could change. On Wednesday the previously inflexible secretary for education promised a thorough review of both the curriculum and the tests, bowing to the general demand for simplification. He did, however, insist that this year's tests go ahead: the review comes in 1994. It was as near to a complete roll-over as could be expected from any minister, yet the unions are saying it is not enough. Mr Patten therefore appears to be in a trap. He can make further concessions, and scrap the 1993 tests. That would put paid to his credibility as a minister. Alternatively, he can stand firm and risk a chaotic summer in the schools. He may play for time, awaiting the outcome of an appeal by Wandsworth council against last week's court ruling that the boycott of tests proposed by one of the teaching unions is lawful. A higher court could rescue him. Failing that, he might try a rushed change in the law to declare boycotts illegal. The trouble is that he could not be certain of getting that through an unpredictable House of Commons. There is one other possibility. The teachers' unions may well overreach themselves. A public opinion that was broadly sympathetic when Mr Patten was clearly inflexible might turn around when he is seen to be the reasonable one and the union leaders are plainly going too far. His offer of a complete review partly based on the experience gained in this year's tests makes sense. They should therefore go ahead. If he proves able enough, and lucky enough, to turn the public against the unions he will save the curriculum, testing, and his own reputation.</p>

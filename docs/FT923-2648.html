			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Steel urges broader powers for UN DEVELOPING the United Nations as a supranational authority able to intervene in countries' internal affairs was the way to tackle the global problems that had arisen since the end of the Cold War, Sir David Steel, the party's former leader, said yesterday, Alison Smith writes. Had the party's proposal for a permanent UN peacekeeping force been adopted, he said, the organisation could have been more effective in its efforts in the former Yugoslavia. 'We need less firefighting and more fire prevention,' he said, referring to yesterday's announcement of an additional troop deployment for Bosnia. Sir David said the UN should be able to levy richer nations to put resources into achieving a sustainable environment. It should also be able to intervene in governments' affairs when it found brutality and gross violations of the human rights of minorities. Sir David said: 'International statesmen must come to their senses and recognise that our only hope is to use all our expertise in new technology and communications to create a healthier world, for it is now a practical possibility to achieve that - given the necessary political will.' He contrasted the Liberal Democrats' readiness to consider such international moves with 'the parochialism of both Labour and the Tories'. He accused Mr John Major of relinquishing his responsibilities as leader of the EC council of ministers in refusing to take part in a French television debate on the Maastricht treaty.</p>

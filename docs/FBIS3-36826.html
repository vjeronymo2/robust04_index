			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Today's World" program] </F>   [Text] The DPRK thinks that it cannot reach agreement with  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] at present.  DPRK's senior representative at the IAEA made public a  statement to this effect.    Although a statement of this nature is made adding to the  skeptic atmosphere for the solution of the nuclear problem on  the Korean peninsula, there are also statements which add to an  optimistic mood for it, says station commentator (Aleksey  Kondrachev).    For instance, in his verbal message to U.S. President Bill  Clinton, DPRK President Kim Il-song noted that the DPRK does not  intend to develop nuclear weapons. However, the world community  cannot dispel suspicion of Pyongyang's nuclear program. The  suspicion of the nuclear program remains unresolved because the  North does not permit international inspection of its nuclear  sites.    Although the DPRK is holding talks with the IAEA, the talks  are falling into a stalemate again. The talks are coming to a  blind alley which could bring a disadvantageous result to  Pyongyang, because in 12 days the IAEA is supposed to disclose a  report on the result of its talks with the DPRK. If no progress  is made in the talks, the United Nations could take sanctions on  the DPRK.    The delegates of some countries, including Russia, think  that  the countries should not put enormous pressure on Pyongyang,  thus driving it into a corner. The economic and political  sanctions will not be able to change the Pyongyang position  easily. If sanctions are taken, followed by such steps as  (?economic embargo), it could further stiffen the DPRK stance on  the nuclear issue.    Suggestion is, therefore, made that dialogue be carried on  between the DPRK and the United States, between the DPRK and the  IAEA, and between the North and the South. This is the best  way, as noted by delegates from many countries. The ROK  president also called for a peaceful settlement of the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula. The issue of denuclearizing the  Korean peninsula should, in the first place, be a task to be  resolved by the people of the North and the South themselves.  Hence, inter-Korean dialogue should be resumed as soon as  possible.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Customs change and beer wars begin to greet the single market IT STARTS as soon as you drive off the ferry. A youth in combat fatigues standing only feet from French customs stuffs leaflets through the open car windows. Beer Wars, the leaflets say, advertising Eastenders, a 'beer and wine cash and carry. Open 24 hours. All English staff'. Calais is bracing itself for la vague anglaise, the invasion of Britons in search of cheap alcohol expected from January, when the single European market ends current limits on duty-free im-ports for personal use. Customs has set 10 litres of spirits, 90 litres of wine, 110 litres of beer, 200 cigars and 800 cigarettes as 'indicative levels' for each adult.  Larger amounts will be regarded as for commercial purposes unless it can be proved they are for personal use - a family wedding, say. Many Britons in Calais will avoid the town centre and head straight for hypermarkets such as Mammouth, Continent and PG. Mammouth, a mecca for UK visitors, is on the road to Boulogne, next to an ancient fort which was probably designed to keep the British out. Mr Serge Loucheux, the manager, hopes to increase sales of goods popular with the British by between 10 and 30 per cent next year. The store's distribution centre has researched a list of the most popular goods and will hold extra stocks. Mammouth has printed leaflets to distribute at the ferry port, inviting visitors to 'make good bargains' on what Mr Loucheux says most Brits come to buy: wines like Liebfraumilch and Lambrusco, sherry, gin and beer - lots of it. The aisles have been widened and Mr Loucheux expects an initial vague as visitors take advantage of their new rights before numbers stabilise. 'It's a bit symbolic. People enjoy the feeling that they have more liberty. It's a psychological barrier that is coming down.' While other supermarkets will also bombard the port with publicity, the Calais chamber of commerce is advertising its shops in UK newspapers. One trader it will not be promoting is Eastenders. In a bleak corner of a Calais industrial estate, Eastenders looks more like a gypsy camp than a cash and carry. Crates of beer and wine are covered by a tarpaulin at the roadside, a brazier burns and an alsatian whines outside a dilapidated caravan. Cars draw up, crates of beer are loaded straight into the boot and wads of notes change hands. Mr Dave West, the owner, says he will turn over Pounds 3m this year, buying goods direct from several European breweries. Mr West, who gave up his job as a market trader in Essex four years ago, adds: 'They don't like the Brits here. They want their money and they want them out of here.' He is in no doubt what January 1 will mean. 'It will be a mad free-for-all for the first couple of months. Visitors could increase by 200 or 300 per cent.' He is determined to be there to meet them, in spite of the efforts of the French authorities. 'I'll fight back just like my old man did at Dunkirk.' Duty-free-for-all, Page 8</p>

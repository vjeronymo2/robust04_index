			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (4): Some progress in the provinces - Laurie Morse looks at moves to dismantle internal trade barriers Canada's federal government has sealed historic international trade agreements this year, but is still without a solution to the pervasive inter-provincial non-tariff trade barriers that stifle growth and the free flow of goods, services and capital within its own borders. Intense negotiations between provincial ministers, the territories, and the federal government may finally produce a solution to these internal trade blockades this summer. A certified accountant in New Brunswick, for example, is not allowed to practise in neighbouring Prince Edward Island because professional licensing requirements differ. Manitoba procurement agencies, in charge of the province's liquor stores, will not purchase regional beers brewed elsewhere in Canada. A forest products company in Ontario must buy electric power from Ontario Hydro, even though electricity produced by neighbouring Manitoba Hydro may be one-third the cost. The lack of uniform trucking codes between provinces often forces Canadian freight companies to make coast-to-coast deliveries via the US. Until recently, a cable manufacturer wishing to sell wire to a provincial utility had to have a factory in that province. These are just a few examples of how protectionist attitudes in Canada's 10 provinces disrupt the free flow of internal trade. The problems these barriers cause, long a festering issue at the federal level, have been exacerbated recently by new international trade agreements like Nafta. 'With the Free Trade Agreement (with the US) it is sometimes easier for people to trade north-south than east-west,' says Mr Robert Knox, executive director of Canada's Internal Trade Secretariat in Ottawa. 'Canada's problem is that we're a relatively small domestic market. We want to thrive in a global economy, but government practices have kept many businesses from growing a strong domestic base. We've got to a point where we can't afford it any more,' says Mr Knox. Canada exported about Dollars 200bn in goods and services last year, and its internal trade, while more difficult to measure, is nearly the same size, economists say. A study by the Canadian Manufacturers' Association in 1991 found that provincial constraints in just two areas - government procurements and agricultural marketing practices - cost Canadian taxpayers some Dollars 7bn a year. However, Mr Jason Meyers, economist for the CMA, says that if one could quantify the dynamic effects of lost trade, the figure would be much higher. As Canadian companies struggle to be internationally competitive, there is a growing realisation in government and business circles that the benefits of liberalised domestic trade could be higher than those offered by protectionism. But the process of achieving a common market is more difficult than issuing a federal edict from Ottawa. Internal trade talks, initiated in 1987 when Canada's federal government appointed a Committee of Ministers for Internal Trade, have proved as difficult as those undertaken to cement international trade compacts. When the provinces and the federal government last seriously tried to solve internal trade issues at constitutional talks two years ago, the effort fell flat. Interest groups were so effective that the pact, had it passed, would merely have preserved the status quo. Since then, a persistent recession and objections to liberalised trade by the NDP governments of Ontario and British Columbia - two of Canada's largest commercial provinces - have further stalled talks. However, the CMIT persisted and last year set a deadline of this month for concluding a comprehensive agreement on internal trade, to be implemented in June 1995. With the deadline looming, the ministers agreed two months ago to refine a draft of a new internal trade agreement that addresses non-tariff trade barriers in 11 industry sectors and contains a mechanism to arbitrate on internal trade disputes. Although the talks are not public, negotiators say that ministers from nine of the 10 provinces have endorsed a draft agreement. Whatever the final form, analysts agree that the CMIT's efforts will produce progress in certain areas, if not a comprehensive free trade zone. An agreement that would open up provincial procurement - a huge area that encompasses everything from liquor to road, school and hospital construction  -is under consideration, but may be difficult to ratify. However, analysts say that at the very least Canada will get an agreement that provides for uniform standards and regulations for professional services, trucking and other industries, bringing the country a step closer to an open market.</p>

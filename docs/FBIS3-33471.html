After meeting the labor leader, the minister said the average  value will be the minimum value for workers, who will negotiate  their final salary values in URV's with businesses. Workers  earning higher-than-average salaries, like those with a  collective agreement renewal date in February, will have their  salaries converted into URV's at the nominal value, Medeiros  said.    According to Medeiros, the Finance Ministry is determined to  set the minimum salary at a figure that will be equivalent, in  URV's, to slightly more than $60 -- $63 or $64. Medeiros, who  said on 21 February that he would not agree to negotiating the  average value, said after the meeting that he was satisfied.    "It is a good beginning for the negotiation," he said.    Cardoso said that "in this transition phase we do not want  the purchasing power of workers to drop," adding that he intends  to talk with other labor leaders, like CUT [Sole Workers Center]  President Jair Meneguelli and Vicente Paulo da Silva Campo, aka  Vicentinho -- the president of the metalworkers' union of Sao  Bernardo do Campo. The minister said the government has not made  a decision yet on the salary conversion proposal.    The method for compulsory indexation of private sector  salaries by the average value is ready. According to Finance  Ministry sources, all workers, except for B Group workers -- for  whom salaries will be converted to URV's in March -- will  benefit more than under the existing salary policy. This will  happen because the URV will adjust real salaries on a monthly  basis, while the existing salary policy guarantees partial  adjustment only of salaries equivalent to up to six minimum  salaries.    The finance minister said that, apparently, the "minimum  salary" equivalent to the average of the last four months is the  formula that will best preserve salaries, despite the fact that  other alternatives also are being considered.    According to the minister, salaries will not be increased  and  the URV will serve as a safeguard, giving them daily protection  against inflation.  <H5>  The Position of Team Members in the Balance of Power </H5> <H5>  The Winners </H5>   Edmar Bacha -- The special Finance Ministry adviser  advocated  adoption of a fixed rule for converting salaries by the average  value, on the grounds that free negotiations between workers and  employers still must be approved by Congress.    Sergio Cutolo -- The Social Security minister, who like  Bacha  has experience in previous stabilization plans, claimed that the  time required for free negotiations would be longer than the  period expected for the transition from the URV to the new  currency.    Winston Fritsch -- The economic policy secretary, who in the  beginning was for freedom of the market, finally was convinced  by Bacha's claim that the government needs to establish salary  conversion rules.  <H5>  The Losers </H5>   Persio Arida -- One of the designers of the stabilization  plan, Arida is against any type of government intervention in  the private sector. He has always advocated that conversion to  the URV should be voluntary and not compulsory.    Walter Barelli -- Since the beginning of the talks, he has  upheld the thesis that the government should adopt a single  criteria for converting prices and salaries into URV's. His  position was defeated on 21 February.    Pedro Malan -- Identified as a neoliberal, the Central Bank  president also has advocated the URV's voluntary adoption by  society. He was defeated by Bacha's arguments.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian government allowed the Chukchi  Autonomous Area administration to trade in oil products with  European countries so as to use the hard-currency proceeds for  purchasing oil products in the Asian-Pacific Region, a source  close to the government told the Petroleum Information Agency.    The government ordinance of June 15 instructs numerous large  refineries in the Russian West to earmark quotas of oil products  for the Chukchi peninsula.    Experts believe that the decision to allow the Chukchi  administration to sell oil products to Western Europe and to buy  them abroad was made because it is cheaper to import fuel to  Chukchi from abroad than from other regions of Russia.    The funds the Russian Finance Ministry raises from  collecting  export and import customs duties, levied on export and import of  oil products earmarked for the Chukchi Autonomous Area, will be  used to pay for import of these fuels into the area.</p>

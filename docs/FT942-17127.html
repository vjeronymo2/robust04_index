			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Bonds lead Dow into solid rebound Wall Street US stocks surged yesterday when a rally in bonds encouraged investors to hunt for bargains among depressed blue chip and technology issues, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 82.06 higher at 3,675.41, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 9.37 ahead at 448.29. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite gained 6.86 at 440.99, while the Nasdaq composite forged ahead 23.54 to 750.95 for its second-largest one-day gain ever. Volume on the New York SE, at 366.9m shares, was heavy. Advances led declines by 2,152 to 324 in a mirror image of the ratio in Monday's sell-off. The US Treasury market, which has led stocks into a steep decline over the past fortnight, was the catalyst for yesterday's solid rebound. Equity investors were relieved that bond prices finally appeared to have touched bottom after a precipitous drop which intensified over the previous two sessions. Steady activity overseas, as European investors returned from the Easter holiday, contributed to a calmer atmosphere. Late in the session, the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond had receded nearly 13 basis points to about 7.27 per cent, easing concern over the upward spiral in long-term rates. With buyers again wading into the fixed-income markets, equity investors were more willing to take a chance, even though there was no fresh economic news to shape sentiment. The Commerce Department released its February index of leading indicators. But the data, showing a 0.1 per cent decline, was close to the consensus forecast of a 0.2 per cent fall. Still, investors snapped up a wide range of stocks, with automobile issues showing particular strength. General Motors jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 57 3/8 after Furman Selz added the stock to its recommended list. Caterpillar led the way as many of the cyclical stocks, hammered in recent sessions, staged a comeback. After a delayed opening because of an order imbalance, the stock ended Dollars 3 up at Dollars 116 1/4 . Deere gained Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 86 3/8 and United Technologies climbed Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 65 5/8 . Cummins Engine jumped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 51 3/4 after announcing that it expected first-quarter earnings to meet or exceed fourth-quarter results. On the Nasdaq, technology stocks made a strong recovery after seven straight losing sessions. Among the biggest gainers, Microsoft was Dollars 3 1/4 ahead at Dollars 87 3/4 . Canada Toronto stocks rebounded in relatively light trading after Monday's sharp decline. The TSE 300 composite index gained 43.2, or 1.02 per cent, at 4,273.3 and rises outpaced falls by 544 to 271. Volume was 62.5m shares valued at CDollars 896m. Industrial products put on 2.7 per cent and consumer products 1.8 per cent. Brazil Equities in Sao Paulo recovered 5.4 per cent in light trading as bargain hunting was seen following a fall of some 11 per cent in the Bovespa index on Monday. The index finished 730 better at 14,280. Brokers noted that most of the activity came from domestic investors.</p>

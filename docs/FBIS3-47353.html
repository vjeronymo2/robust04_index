			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Television Network in  Japanese at 0109 GMT on 9 January, as part of its 105-minute  talk show "Sunday Project" which begins at 0100 GMT, carries a  35-minute live interview with Yohei Kono, president of the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), by economic commentator Soichiro  Tawara at the Asahi Television studio in Tokyo.    At 0111 GMT, Tawara begins the interview by discussing  censure motions submitted by the LDP in the House of Councillors  against the foreign minister and the farm minister over the  decision to partially open the rice market. He says that some  people believe the LDP's plan is to delay deliberations on  political reform. Denying the allegation, Kono says: "We  submitted censure motions in the upper house because the  ministers' agreement on the decision apparently runs counter to  upper house resolutions calling for maintaining self-sufficiency  in rice." He stresses that the LDP has no intention of delaying  deliberations on political reform.    Tawara says that the LDP acts like an unmanageable child  when  negotiating with the ruling coalition. Refuting Tawara, Kono  says: "The ruling coalition acts high-handedly and does not  listen to what the LDP has to say. Opposing such an attitude,  we have called for dialogue." Kono then explains the efforts  made by the LDP following the adoption of political reform bills  in the lower house in mid- November to promote discussions on  political reform and a supplementary budget for economic  recovery, stressing: "People must clearly understand these  efforts." Moreover, he criticizes the ruling coalition for  rejecting LDP demands for promoting deliberations both on  political reform and economic recovery.    Returning to the rice issue, Tawara asks Kono whether he  opposes the partial opening of the rice market. Kono, without  answering the question directly, notes that rice farmers in such  countries as Australia and the United States are growing rice  for export to Japan, while Japanese farmers produce rice for  domestic consumption. He expresses apprehension over the impact  on Japanese farmers of the decision to partially open the rice  market.    After citing news reports saying that the LDP has changed  its  attitude and has become flexible in debate on political reform,  Tawara asks for Kono's comments on the reports. Kono says: "I  have asserted from the beginning that the political reform issue  should be concluded in the current Diet session" and notes that  because of a lack of concessions on the part of the ruling  coalition in the lower house, the issue is now being discussed  in the upper house. He adds: "The debate in the upper house is  aimed at narrowing differences between government-proposed  political reform bills and the reform plan put forward by the  LDP."    Tawara and Kono then discuss three key issues in political  reform on which the LDP and the ruling coalition have not yet  reached an agreement: electoral district units for proportional  representation; the reapportionment of seats for the lower  house; and the handling of political donations by corporations  and other organizations. Kono notes that the ruling coalition is  split over the issue of whether to compromise with the LDP on  these issues. When asked if he rejected compromise measures  proposed by Prime Minister Morhiro Hosokawa during the  Hosokawa-Kono summit talks last year, Kono says: "No. We both  refused to accept each other's compromise plans. I presented my  opinions and Mr. Hosokawa rejected them."    Tawara next asks Kono whether the LDP will accept the  proposal, which has surfaced within the ruling coalition as a  compromise measure, to divide the nation into electoral blocs  for voting on the basis of proportional representation. Kono  says: "Since we want votes for seats involving proportional  representation to be cast on a prefectural basis, discussions  will be necessary."    Concerning Tawara's question about whether there is one  issue  among the three key issues on which the LDP can compromise, Kono  stresses the need for further discussion. Tawara then says that  the LDP needs to make compromises in talks with the ruling  coalition. Kono responds: "It is necessary to make concessions  to enact the political reform bills. That is why I am asking  Mr. Hosokawa to compromise." Asked whether he would accept an  offer to hold summit talks with Hosokawa again to narrow  differences, Kono gives a negative view, noting the importance  of respecting political reform debate in the upper house.  Finally, Tawara asks whether the LDP is determined not to  boycott deliberations on political reform in the upper house.  Kono answers: "Our party will never do such a thing."    The interview ends at 0146 GMT.</p>

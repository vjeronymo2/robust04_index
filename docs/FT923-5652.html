			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Pennies from heaven for the Met Office: Michael Cassell predicts a period of increased expansion for the organisation WITH the start of the August bank holiday the armchair weather experts are studying the swallows and watching their warts to see what lies in store for the last long weekend of summer. Everyone fancies their chances when it comes to predicting the weather. But, unlike the 2,500 men and women from the Meteorological Office, not everyone's livelihood depends on getting it right. While the Met Office may have failed to spot the odd hurricane in the past 140 years and will never to be allowed to forget it, it says new investment is producing improved levels of forecasting accuracy. It claims that more than 80 per cent of forecasts for the general public are now deemed to be correct. Commercial customers report a 90 per cent-plus satisfaction rate. Mr Bernard Herdan, Met Office director of commercial services, said: 'We are not in the business of selling certainties. But our three-day forecasts are now more accurate than a one-day forecast 15 years ago.' Reputation is important for an organisation intent on converting its expertise into hard cash by offering an expanding range of services to a private sector increasingly using weather intelligence as a business tool. Traditionally a servant of the state, the Met Office is now setting out to exploit the commercial freedom handed to it when it became a government executive agency in 1990. Mr Herdan has a pivotal role in coaxing the organisation into the marketplace and out from the shadow of the Ministry of Defence, which remains both its boss and its largest customer. It still employs most of its resources in serving the armed forces and the Civil Aviation Authority and in providing weather information for dissemination via newspapers and television. But it is now also as likely to be selling its information to farmers, oil-rig operators and builders. Supermarket chains pay for advance notice of good weather so they can stock up with salads and barbecue coals. Conversely, the prospect of prematurely arctic conditions will enable garage chains to order the anti-freeze early. Landfill site operators can be told when to expect exceptional methane discharges activated by low atmospheric pressure, and the Channel tunnel operators may decide to ask the Met Office to advise them if pressure differences at each end ever threaten howling gales in the middle. The list of less prosaic services for commercial customers, backed up by a network of reporting stations and two powerful Cray computers - 'the Cray twins' - at the organisation's base in Bracknell, Berkshire, is lengthening. Private fliers and mariners can get weather information by fax and, as a result of collaboration with British Aerospace, Met Office information will soon be available via computer to private-sector customers worldwide. On the domestic forecasting front, while regional forecasts now extend to five days, there is fresh emphasis on the provision of very short-term weather information. Within a year or so private subscribers will be able to establish what is going to happen in their town in the next couple of hours. Speech-recognition technology might soon enable a computer to give a detailed response to individual telephone inquiries. Much of the effort to win new domestic customers will be focused on developing, in co-operation with partners, services which underpin the Met Office's ambition to become the primary environmental agency in the UK. Joint ventures with a range of partners are planned so that its meteorological expertise can be twinned with the technical knowledge required to relay information. The Met Office also wants to build a bigger presence in continental Europe and is participating in proposals to create with other comparable organisations a commercial operation offering meteorological services on a European scale. It sees significant income flowing from offering consultancy services to other national weather organisations and from the sale of intellectual property. Mr Herdan said: 'At present we have about 8.5 per cent of the world weather-information business and want to get to 10 per cent within the next five years.' The Met Office's most recent results suggest the process of commercialisation is well under way. Revenue from business customers rose to nearly Pounds 14m in the year to March, compared with Pounds 8m before agency status. The figure, which is believed to be higher than that achieved by any equivalent operation overseas, is planned to reach Pounds 20m in the next five years. Even so, the organisation still cost the taxpayer Pounds 71m last year, a figure which the government wants to see steadily reducing. Nobody is yet prepared to chance their arm by publicly forecasting when the Met Office will be profitable. Weather, Page 22</p>

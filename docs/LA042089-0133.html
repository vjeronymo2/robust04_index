			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUSH VISIT CONFIRMED; DUE AT ANTI-DRUG EVENT  </P> <P> President Bush will stop in Orange County on Wednesday for an anti-drug event  at Rancho del Rio, the remote and scenic headquarters of a former notorious  drug smuggler, sources have confirmed.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, an advance team from the White House toured the 213-acre ranch,  which includes vineyards, a wine press and eight houses made of hand-laid  stone, imported logs and tile. The ranch, which has a view of Santa Catalina  Island, is accessible only by a treacherous 4-mile dirt road and an unpaved  runway that was used by the smugglers.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the visit was confirmed. Sources said Bush will present Sheriff  Brad Gates and other law enforcement officials with a check for $4.39 million  -- their share of a heroin bust made by the Orange County Regional Narcotics  Suppression Task Force on Feb. 10, 1988.  </P> <P> Law enforcement sources said it may be the largest check ever given to a single  police agency since a 1984 federal law allowed local police to use property and  cash seized from drug traffickers to pay for drug enforcement efforts.  </P> <P> Rancho del Rio was deeded to Orange County after the Sheriff's Department  seized it during a separate drug investigation on March 1, 1985. The ranch is  at the juncture of Orange, San Diego and San Bernardino counties.  </P> <P> Bush is also scheduled to visit Los Angeles Tuesday and Wednesday, officials  said.  </P></p>

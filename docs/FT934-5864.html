			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Profits are taken in Commerzbank Trading was generally muted in reflection of Wall Street's half session, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT mulled over Thursday's company news, and looked ahead to next week as the market flattened out in advance of monthly settlement day. The DAX index eased 0.47 to 2,047.24, down 1.5 per cent on the week, as turnover fell from DM8.5bn to DM7.8bn. Dealers took profits after the progress report from Commerzbank, were less decisive over Volkswagen's four-day week, and continued to dislike Metallgesellschaft after results which, said James Capel, showed how desperately the group needs a substantial cut in its cost base. Commerzbank fell DM3.50 to DM359.50 after Thursday's 52 per cent jump in 10-month profits, while Berliner Bank and Bayernhypo put on DM12 at DM443.50 and DM4.20 at DM468.20 ahead of next week's figures. VW stumbled over details of the four-day week, and fell DM6 to DM406 after a DM9.50 gain the day before; Metallgesellschaft fell DM6 to DM379 for a loss of DM40 this week. PARIS was little changed on the day but moderately higher on the week, the CAC-40 index adding 2.22 to 2,120.62, and 1.2 per cent respectively. Turnover was moderate at FFr3.4bn. Rhone-Poulenc saw a delayed opening and then rose 2 per cent in reaction to news after hours on Thursday that institutional investors would be offered shares at FFr146 each, compared with the public offering at FFr135. However, the shares soon slipped back, closing off FFr3.80 at FFr150.10. After a volatile week's trading, Euro Disney closed up FFr1.50 at FFr30.90, a week's decline of 16 per cent. AMSTERDAM was lifted by a strong performance from Nedlloyd, the shipping group, which advanced by Fl 2.80 to Fl 55.40 following better than expected third quarter results. The CBS Tendency index put on 1.1 to 136.8, marginally firmer on the week. KLM put on another 90 cents to Fl 39.90, picking up some ground lost after the failure of the Alcazar talks was announced at the start of the week. Royal Dutch lost another Fl 1.90 to Fl 193.70 on the weaker oil price. MILAN finished firmer on strong demand by domestic institutions, particularly for shares which had fallen earlier in the week. The Comit index rose 5.46 to 541.52, an 0.5 per cent fall over the week, but a strong come back after the cumulative 5.9 per cent fall on Monday and Tuesday. 'The market will be in the hands of the politicians until the end of the year,' said Mr Guiseppe Bonini of Intersim in Milan. Mediobanca returned to favour with a L670 or 5.9 per cent rise to L12,100. Benetton added L720 to L23,010 for a two day advance of 8.8 per cent as the clothing group forecast a 10 per cent rise in 1993 turnover. Fiat edged L59 ahead to L3,861 as Thursday's rumours subsided. ZURICH finished firm, with the week's inflation news giving heart to optimists for lower interest rates. The SMI index added 15.1 to 2,741.9 for a 0.3 per cent rise on the week. Banks were supported by brokers' recommendations, CS Holdings rising SFr85 to SFr3,540. Electrowatt, also finding favour with analysts, added SFr150 to SFr3,590. MADRID was boosted by another rally in electrical utilities, offsetting weakness in banks as the general index closed 1.13 higher at 297.91, 2.2 per cent lower on the week in turnover of Pta20.65bn. Endesa was one of the biggest gainers, rising Pta100 to Pta6,480, with Iberdrola up Pta22 at Pta918 and Fenosa by Pta11 to Pta545. Dividends are due to be paid out soon in the sector, and the recent downtrend in interest rates should lift profit margins. STOCKHOLM saw a SKr13 fall to SKr395 in Atlas Copco as the compressor maker announced nine month figures. The Affarsvarlden index shed 1.4 to 1312.6, 3.5 per cent lower on the week. OSLO was dragged lower by a sharp fall for Hafslund Nycomed, the pharmaceutical company, and the all share index fell 4.19 to 578.85. Hasfslund A shares closed NKr8.5 weaker at NKr111 after the company forecast that 1993 pre-tax profits would only match 1992 results. BRUSSELS reflected drifted to a lower close, with a 24-hour general strike in protest at government austerity measures, the keeping foreign investors cautious and trading volumes low. The Bel-20 index closing 3.72 lower at 1,392.17, 0.9 per cent down on the week. ISTANBUL rose to another record high in spite of some moderate profit-taking towards the close. The composite index gained 231.0 to 17.426.1, a week's rise of 5.4 per cent.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Paraguayan] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy arrived  in Buenos Aires this morning. He will probably propose an  association of Southern Cone governments, in what could be  called the resurgence of the "Condor Operation," to fight  eventual subversive outbursts similar to that provoked by the  Zapatist movement in Chiapas, Mexico.    Argentine media sources commented on a meeting between  [Argentine President] Carlos Menem, [Uruguayan President] Luis  Alberto Lacalle, and Wasmosy in Punta del Este last weekend,  during which the presidents reportedly expressed concern for the  possible entry, through the Bolivian and Paraguayan borders, of  alleged guerrillas who would attempt to destabilize local  governments.    Asked about the subject shortly before leaving for Buenos  Aires, Wasmosy denied that the issue had been discussed during  the Punta del Este meeting. He said, however, that the matter  could possibly be raised this time around, adding that if this  were the case he would propose the association of the three  countries' armies and intelligence services. Asked about his  government's proposal if the issue of guerrilla activities were  discussed at the mini-summit, Wasmosy said: "An association.  Let us hope all countries will join efforts -- armies as well  -- to fight drug trafficking, money laundering, and crime in  general. That is the objective. We had a meeting of general  staff chiefs to discuss the matter recently. I think we have  made progress."</p>

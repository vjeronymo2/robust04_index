			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Astra ahead on recovery hopes in the sector STRONG buying interest in Astra was seen yesterday as the stock reacted to a growing belief that the pharmaceuticals sector may have reached the bottom of the cycle, writes Our Markets Staff. Susan Haylock, European pharmaceuticals analyst at NatWest Securities in London, noted that there had been a revival of interest in the sector over the last few days. Some better than expected first quarter results from US groups and expectations that the Clinton healthcare reform proposals would be outlined by the end of next month had contributed to a change in sentiment, she said. The mood among senior bourses generally, however, was much less enthusiastic as hopes dimmed that the Bundesbank would cut interest rates further at today's regular meeting. STOCKHOLM was driven by Astra with strong US and European buying seen as the stock put on 3.6 per cent in the B shares, closing SKr24 higher at SKr668. However, as one trader noted, the stock still has a long way to go before it passes the all time high of SKr751 reached in January. The Affarsvarlden index gained 15.50 or 1.5 per cent to 1,026.0 in turnover of some SKr1.2bn. Another gainer was Ericcson which saw the B's close at a year's high, up SKr9 at SKr283 FRANKFURT fell for the second consecutive day, as disappointment over earnings prompted profit-taking. The DAX index fell 20.24 to 1,666.87 in volume estimated to have been considerably less than Tuesday's DM5.1bn. All sectors declined on the day. Steel and machinery makers lost ground on Tuesday's lower profit warnings by leading companies at the Hanover trade fair. Thyssen, the steel maker, lost DM4.30 to DM174.20, while Mannesmann eased DM3.70 to DM261.70. Construction companies, which lost ground on Tuesday after announcing a rights issues, continued their descent. Mr Glen Liddy at Kleinwort Benson Securities said that liquidity in the market was being absorbed by the increasing number of rights issues. Holzmann fell DM65 to DM1,010, while Hochtief retreated DM37 to DM1,090. In post-bourse trading, the market weakened as hopes of lower interest rates receded after the release of money supply figures. The M3 for February grew by 3.2 per cent, against forecasts of around 1 per cent. PARIS dipped again with a loss in the CAC-40 index of 17.44 to 1,931.89. However, turnover was stronger than in recent days at FFr3.4bn. Some analysts commented that sentiment had been affected by a feeling that France was unable to act unilaterally on reducing domestic interest rates further until some movement emerged from Germany. In the corporate sector UAP slipped another FFr12 to FFr541 as some investors continued to digest its 1992 results published on Tuesday. Reports of US selling and a downgrade hit L'Oreal which closed down FFr14 at FFr1,061 while Peugeot, which reports 1992 figures today, was down another FFr9 at FFr537, although some observers believe that expectations of poor results has largely been discounted. ZURICH saw demand for industrial stocks more than offset weaker banks and insurances, as the likelihood of a German interest rate cut today faded, and the SMI index rose 7.3 to 2,178.1. Bearer shares in Ascom, the telecommunications equipment maker, rose SFr90 or 6.6 per cent to SFr1,450 on reports of heavy buy orders by a private, Geneva-based bank which has recommended the share recently. Roche certificates were also actively traded, rising SFr30 to SFr6,720 as positions were built up ahead of today's annual news conference. Sandoz bearers rose SFr80 to SFr3,040 and Ciba-Geigy registered shares dipped SFr5 to SFr592 amid reports of share switching in the sector. Profit-taking left Sulzer SFr19 lower at SFr724 after the group said that it expected this year's group profits at least to match the 1992 level. AMSTERDAM was puzzled by the good performance from Nedlloyd, up Fl 1.30 at Fl 30.30, after the transport group announced disappointing 1992 results. The only positive sign in the report was a suggestion that there had been a slight pick-up in trading activity in March. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.4 higher at 110.7. BRUSSELS was pulled down by the fall in Petrofina which lost BFr150 to BFr9,250 on profit-taking by institutions. The Bel-20 index fell 4.7 to 1,247.21. MILAN remained overhung by the uncertain political situation as efforts began to decide the composition of a new government. The Comit index eased 4.55 to 518.17. Privatisation stocks recouped some of Tuesday's losses on hopes that Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, would head an interim government until general elections in the autumn. Credito Italiano rose L90 to L2,863 while SME ended L153 higher at L6,202. OSLO rose on speculative buying with a gain in the all-share index of 4.04 to 450.31 in turnover of NKr469.7m. MADRID fell steadily in line with other markets with the general index losing 1.11 to 242.51 in turnover of a low Pta5.36bn. ISTANBUL continued to recover strongly after Monday's plunge and the market index rose 312.24 or 4.7 per cent to 6,921.49.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- April 21                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30        11.00        12.00  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1159.84      1158.17      1157.43      1158.36 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1225.58      1223.96      1224.12      1224.52  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00        14.00        15.00        Close  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1159.38      1157.28      1157.54      1157.71 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1226.86      1224.42      1223.57      1225.84  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Apr 20    Apr 19    Apr 16    Apr 15    Apr 14  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1158.12   1164.59   1159.61   1156.40   1160.63 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1220.73   1221.99   1217.23   1220.62   1223.50  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1159.84; 200 - 1226.86 Low/day: 100 - 1156.69  200 - 1222.65.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 20 19 KYODO -- New Zealand Deputy Prime  Minister Don McKinnon reiterated his country's support for  Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the United Nations  Security Council [UNSC], Japanese Foreign Ministry officials  said Wednesday [20 April].    McKinnon, concurrently minister of foreign affairs and  trade,  who arrived in Japan on Tuesday for a three-day stay, voiced the  support in a meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, the  officials said.    He told Hata that New Zealand thinks it important for Japan  to become a permanent member of the Security Council because  Japan's international role is increasing not only in the  economic sphere but also in the political field, they said.    Hata was quoted as replying that Japan wants to actively  contribute to the international community.    Also in the 75-minute meeting at the Foreign Ministry,  McKinnon said New Zealand, which currently chairs the Security  Council, wants to cooperate with the international community to  prevent North Korea from becoming a country with nuclear  weapons, according to the officials.    Hata told McKinnon it is important for the world to unite to  urge North Korea not to change its position on the nuclear  problem [as received], the officials said.    McKinnon also said New Zealand is placing importance on Asia  and has hammered out an "Asia 2000" plan to promote its ties  with the region.    Hata and McKinnon agreed that the upcoming Association of  Southeast Asian Nations regional forum should seek boosting the  openness of military power in the region to promote stability  and security in Asia, the officials said.    Touching on the just-signed Uruguay Round trade pact, they  agreed on the importance of settling disputes on a multilateral  basis, not by taking unilateral steps, the officials said.    On the bilateral front, McKinnon expressed New Zealand's  opposition to whaling, while Hata pointed out cultural  differences, the officials said.</p>

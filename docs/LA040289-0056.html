			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GINGRICH: DON'T EXPECT 'KINDER, GENTLER' POLITICS  </P> <P> It's time for a good word about partisanship. True, tough political sparring  does not jibe with the trendy "kinder, gentler" Washington. In this world,  where divided party control of government forces accommodation to get nearly  anything done, smart politics have been considered "no politics."  </P> <P> But things may have changed with the recent choice by House Republicans of Newt  Gingrich (R-Ga.) as their new minority whip. He rose to power drawing  ideological lines and charging Democrats with ethical misdeeds. His slashing  political style has made him an object of vitriol, ridicule and fear -- which  helps explain the unusual interest in the new occupant of the once-obscure  House leadership post. His selection prompted a Democratic leader to predict  "an escalation in partisan political warfare at the expense of the national  interest." A Washington Post profile of the Georgia lawmaker was headlined "The  Great Divider."  </P> <P> Contrary to the skeptics' views, Gingrich's election to the No. 2 post in the  House Republican leadership poses challenges to both parties. Gingrich says  that his aggressive political style can aid Republicans and the Bush  Administration by helping them develop more appealing and better-defined  policies (which have been in short supply since January); the conflict  resulting from sharpened partisan lines, in turn, can help promote truly  bipartisan and more effective solutions to national problems.  </P> <P> Take, for example, the recent Democratic initiative to raise the minimum hourly  wage from $3.35 to $4.55. Many critics, including liberal economists, contend  that the minimum wage has become increasingly irrelevant in many parts of the  nation as middle-class teen-agers who flip hamburgers are being offered twice  the current minimum. They argue that a more effective way to help low-income  wage earners would be to expand the federal earned-income tax credit, which  puts more money into the pockets of poor families without the inflationary  risks of a minimum-wage increase.  </P> <P> In his handling of the issue, Bush has not sought to draw political lines, as  Gingrich advocates. Instead, he has gone roughly two-thirds of the way toward  the Democrats' goal. The Democrats, in turn, say that is not enough, raising  the prospect that Bush will veto the politically popular measure. Would it not  have made more sense, some Republicans ask, for Bush to press for the  earned-income tax credit and force Democrats to choose between the interests of  the poor and those of organized labor?  </P> <P> Gingrich has argued that the Republicans should do a better job in defining how  they differ from the Democrats on a range of issues, including education,  environment and child-care. For the most part, his proposals envision a  government-sanctioned choice of expanded opportunities in the private sector.  He has often pushed for more use of federal tax credits as an incentive.  </P> <P> In lengthy interviews with me, he has contrasted his approach to the Democrats'  preference for bigger government. Gingrich has called the opposite party an  unwieldy coalition of the "loony left," big labor and big city machines. The  result, as exemplified by the 1988 candidacy of Michael S. Dukakis, is out of  touch with mainstream America, he contends.  </P> <P> His frequent description of the Democratic coalition as "corrupt" has allowed  Gingrich to link ideology to his long-advocated interest in ethics. A  continuing and often-overlooked preoccupation of his political career has been  the need to restore public confidence in government. In fact, he began his  career as one of the few Republican "Watergate babies."  </P> <P> His first run for the House was in 1974 against Democrat John Flynt, a crusty  conservative who was chairman of the House Ethics Committee. The previously  unknown Gingrich won 49% in a disastrous year for Republicans, largely by  running against Flynt's weak handling of ethics problems. In an early sign of  his persistence, Gingrich won 48% in a second run against Flynt in 1976, when  Flynt was helped by having Jimmy Carter as Democratic nominee. Finally, in  1978, after Flynt announced his retirement, Gingrich was elected to the seat  serving south and west Atlanta suburbs. Since then, he has easily turned back  several active opponents with national Democratic backing.  </P> <P> Gingrich quickly became a gnat in the nest of House Democrats. Then-Speaker  Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) was thrown by Gingrich's use of House C-SPAN  telecasts as a form of guerrilla theater to spotlight perceived Democratic  outrages. His efforts did little to increase GOP strength but Gingrich began to  sensitize many Republicans to the frustrations and inequities of their record  back to 1955 as the House minority party.  </P> <P> His two-vote win (87-85) last month over Edward R. Madigan of Illinois as  minority whip was based partly on Madigan's ability to do business with  Democrats. Gingrich calls the less-partisan style "getting the crumbs"; other  members defend the old approach as helping them serve favored interests in home  districts and elsewhere.  </P> <P> Gingrich won national notice last year when he began hammering House Speaker  Jim Wright (D-Texas) for ethical lapses, chiefly in personal finances.  Initially, the crusade was regarded as little more than a collection of dated  rumors and newspaper stories and Gingrich was widely dismissed. Even many  Republicans told Gingrich he was wasting his time. Minority Leader Robert H.  Michel (R-Ill.) asked two other House Republicans to examine Gingrich's case  against Wright. After an extensive review, they advised Gingrich to drop the  matter.  </P> <P> But Gingrich's persistence eventually led to a formal complaint, plus a  separate, crucial filing by Common Cause. They prompted the unprecedented  inquiry by the ethics committee, whose report on Wright is expected soon.  </P> <P> Many of the same Democrats who a few months ago dismissed Gingrich's complaints  lately have been waiting uneasily for what many expect to be a tough report  that will raise serious questions about Wright's tenure as Speaker. "Members  are dreading what will happen," said a House Democratic source. "No one has any  stomach for it but they may not be able to avoid it. Especially for those who  were elected because of Watergate, it's their worst nightmare."  </P> <P> Whether the Wright report becomes a dream come true for Gingrich and the  Republicans remains to be seen. The GOP was reminded last week of the long,  uphill road it faces to a Republican majority in the House when it lost a  special election for a vacant seat in a conservative Indiana district once  represented by Vice President Dan Quayle. From Gingrich's perspective, the  largely issue-less campaign run by the Republican contender is further evidence  that Republicans need to draw an ideological line.  </P> <P> The Indiana setback led some House Republicans to suggest that, because of his  limited experience on the House floor, it would have made more sense for  Gingrich to have taken charge of their campaign committee rather than the more  legislative-oriented whip post. But in the House's increasingly partisan mood  -- sparked by the Wright inquiry and the Gingrich leadership election -- the  would-be centrists may be missing the point: The gloves are off and media-savvy  warriors like Gingrich are calling the shots.  </P></p>

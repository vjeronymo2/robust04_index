			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Components side behind rise at Electron House Electron House, the electronic components distributor, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 579,000 to Pounds 1.61m for the six months to November 30. Mr Robert Leigh, chairman, said group sales in the components market had risen by 50 per cent, compared with an overall market improvement of 25 per cent. Turnover from continuing operations rose by 29 per cent, from Pounds 35.9m to Pounds 46.2m. Electronic component sales in the UK rose from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 25.8m. Sales in Australia moved ahead from Pounds 4.47m to Pounds 6.54m and in New Zealand from Pounds 2.23m to Pounds 3.2m. Operating profits from components sales were Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 1.44m). However the group's two remaining systems businesses, which accounted for 23 per cent of turnover, fell into the red to the tune of Pounds 296,000, compared with a previous profit of Pounds 268,000. Sales were down from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 10.7m. Mr Leigh said that CEM Computers, the systems division in Northern Ireland, was building a substantial service and support business. But Bytech Systems, where staff had been reduced by 10 per cent, would take time to return to profitability, and would probably remain in the red in the second half. Net interest payable fell from Pounds 732,000 to Pounds 383,000. Net borrowings were down from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 4.5m, cutting gearing from 80 per cent to 35 per cent. In 1994, when the components market is estimated to increase by a further 9 per cent, Electron expects to raise its market share further, said Mr Leigh. This was in part because customers were cutting down the number of their suppliers, to the benefit of the major distributors. He believed Electron to be the fourth or fifth biggest in the UK. Earnings per share rose from 1.1p to 3.74p. The interim dividend has been lifted to 1.2p (1.05p).</p>

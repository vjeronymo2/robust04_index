			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> WOMEN'S RYDER CUP PLANNED  </P> <P> Tentative plans were announced today for a women's Ryder Cup match between  Europe and the United States, with the inaugural series probably taking place  at the end of next year.  </P> <P> Although details have yet to emerge, Joe Flanagan, executive director of the  Womens Professional European Tour, said it was almost certain that a women's  version of the Ryder Cup would begin in 1990.  </P> <P> "I am confident the match will take place next year, probably in November in  America," he said.  </P> <P> The men's Ryder Cup takes place every two years, alternating between the two  continents. In September, Europe retained the cup after tying with the  Americans at Belfry, England.  </P> <P> Flanagan said the Europeans would like the women's competition to include eight  golfers per team instead of 12 per team, the men's format.  </P></p>

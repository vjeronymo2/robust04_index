			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--The vanguards of the  Palestinian police and security forces left 'Ayn Jalut  Palestinian forces' camp in Cairo for Rafah this morning as they  prepare to enter the Gaza Strip within the next 48 hours. The  forces will take charge of their tasks within the framework of  the Palestinian National Authority.    These vanguards include some 1,000 people, mostly young men  between 16 and 26 years old who live in Egypt and Sudan,  although their families still reside in Gaza.    The Palestinian troops boarded buses bearing the picture of  Palestinian Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. They waved their  Palestinian flags and chanted patriotic Palestinian songs.    Major General Yusuf Nasr, commander of the Palestinian  security forces in Gaza and Jericho, stated that the troops are  expected to enter the Gaza Strip on Sunday or Monday.    Major General Yusuf Nasr affirmed that the Palestinian  forces will complete their deployment in Gaza and the area of  Jericho within 14 days, in accordance with the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement signed in Cairo. The agreement  provides for completing the Israeli troop withdrawal and their  replacement with Palestinian troops within 14 days of 4 May.    He added that Palestinian security and police forces  arriving  from Iraq and Jordan will head for Jericho tomorrow via the  Allenby Bridge over the Jordan River to take over their tasks as  soon as possible. He added that the security and police forces  will be equipped with personal weapons, automatic rifles and  pistols, in addition to light- and medium-machine guns.    Maj. Gen. Nasr pointed out that much of the assistance  promised by various states has not arrived. Only 25 vehicles  donated by the United States have arrived, he said, adding that  an additional 175 vehicles will arrive on 15 May. He also said  that a shipment of police uniforms has arrived from Sweden.    He noted that the troops going to Gaza today are  self-equipped and are not reliant on foreign assistance. He  added that a number of police stations in Gaza can absorb the  first batch of Palestinian forces. We will need more centers  and stations in coming days, he said.    Maj. Gen. Nasr pointed out that the Gaza Strip and Jericho  area will need stability, reconstruction, and security in the  future and there is no time for disputes among citizens of  different political backgrounds. We believe in democracy and in  every citizen's right to express himself, and we will cooperate  with everyone, he said.    He added that the Palestinian security forces have developed  a specific program to handle the problem of collecting arms from  Gaza's citizens, but he refrained from revealing it.    Marwan Kanafani, adviser to Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat, has told MENA that the Palestinian troops will enter  the Gaza Strip and Jericho as soon as they are allowed to. He  explained that the Palestinians want to complete this task  quietly and safely.    He noted that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin had  stated  that the Palestinian troops were not prepared to enter Gaza and  Jericho. This is not true, he said, because the 9,000 troops  will complete their entry in just 14 days.    He noted that the majority of these troops have never seen  the Palestinian land, but that the homeland is in their hearts.    He affirmed that the Palestinian side is prepared to put  forward new working papers and ideas when the Palestinian and  Israeli negotiators get together to find a solution to a number  of issues, such as the area of Jericho, the crossing points,  Gaza's coastline, and others. He pointed out that the  Palestinians base their work on ending the occupation.  Therefore, he said, ideas will be put forward to achieve this  goal.    Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Hayy 'Abd-al-Wahid, commander of  the Palestinian 'Ayn Jalut forces in Egypt, gave a speech to the  Palestinian police and security forces in which he said that  this is the moment Palestinians have been awaiting for over 27  years. You have to carry out the tasks you have been entrusted  with in order to build our state and safeguard the homeland's  security, he said, noting that the Palestinians have made great  sacrifices for this moment.    He thanked the Egyptian Armed Forces for training these  troops and the Egyptian people and President Mubarak for their  support for the Palestinian people and cause. [passage omitted]</p>

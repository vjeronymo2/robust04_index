			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Technology: Europe's green seal - Recycling toner cartridges The latest vending machine to appear in the office blocks of New York will not be selling cups of coffee or chocolate bars but replacement toner cartridges for the offices' laser printers. Most importantly, the machine will only release a replacement cartridge if a used one is inserted into the appropriate slot so that it can be recycled. In the US the recycling of used toner cartridges is already a Dollars 500m (Pounds 335m) business, with some 5,000 companies involved in the recycling. That said, only 32 per cent of replacement cartridges are recycled. In Europe even fewer cartridges are recycled. More than 90 per cent of replacement cartridges bought contain no recycled parts. But with estimates that by 1994-5 there will be more replacement cartridges sold in Europe than in the US - 37m as opposed to 36m - European companies are beginning to take a growing interest. As many European business consumers know to their cost, the potentially huge growth in the market has encouraged those wanting to make a fast buck - with little heed for quality - to leap into the market. With that in mind, a group of European cartridge recyclers will be getting together this month to set up the Federation of European Cartridge Recyclers and Suppliers (FECRS). The aim of the FECRS is to test and monitor the quality of recycled cartridges and to give those companies passing the rigorous screening procedures the right to stamp the FECRS logo on their packaging. Recycling involves replacing both the used toner and any other parts which are worn. Steve Weedon, founding president of the FECRS, believes this stamp of approval will give businesses the confidence to buy recycled cartridges. With recycled cartridges costing 30 per cent less than new ones - typically Pounds 45 rather than Pounds 70 in the UK - and the added bonus that the recycled products are 'green', Weedon believes that quality assurance will give the final fillip. 'It's an easy decision for companies to take. They've got a good product at a good price and it's 'green'.'</p>

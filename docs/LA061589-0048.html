			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A wildcat strike by an estimated 10,000 West Virginia coal miners spread into  Virginia as the United Mine Workers members ignored a federal judge's  back-to-work orders, officials said. State police reported minor violence at  mines in Raleigh County in West Virginia but no arrests as roving bands of  pickets continued to shut down mines. About 650 Westmoreland Coal Co. employees  at three mines in Virginia joined the walkout that began Monday. It was the  first major expansion of the miners' show of support for 1,600 union members  striking against the Pittston Coal Group.  </P></p>

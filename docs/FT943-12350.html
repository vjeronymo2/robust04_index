			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / PAYE may face radical overhaul The pay-as-you-earn tax system could be subject to the first significant restructuring since its creation 50 years ago, under radical plans being considered by the Inland Revenue. Taxpayers may face the prospect of speedier and more accurate calculation of their liabilities but with the focus shifting to adjustments of any errors at the end of each tax year, rather than during the year when their tax is deducted from payroll. The restructuring would follow sweeping changes being carried out to the two other most important elements in the tax system: the shift to 'pay and file' for companies, and to 'self-assessment' for self-employed taxpayers and those with complex tax affairs. These initiatives are designed to shorten the time between the receipt of income and the payment of tax, and to place the onus for the first time on individuals and companies to calculate for themselves how much tax they owe, rather than relying on Revenue inspectors to do the work. Senior Revenue officials are considering changes to PAYE as part of efforts to fulfil the department's commitment to get tax assessments 'right first time'. The most radical reforms would involve simplification of the tax system, which would require a commitment by ministers. But officials believe they could also achieve considerable improvements through internal management changes. These changes would be likely to take place over a number of years, but could include greater use of computer support, more accurate collection of staff information from employers, and closer integration of tax and benefits data. They could also involve the concentration of efforts on accuracy in tax coding either during or - more likely - at the end of the tax year, rather than at both times. One official said yesterday: 'A lot of people from 1944 would still recognise the PAYE system in use today. We have a Rolls-Royce system and there is something of an inconsistency in the way we use our resources.' PAYE - or 'schedule E' - was introduced partly as an attempt to smooth the payment of tax and ensure no large adjustments were required at the end of the year. With 23m people taxed under the system, it covers the vast majority of taxpayers and last year netted nearly Pounds 51bn. The Revenue said last night: 'We are always keeping PAYE under review and looking at deregulation and efficiency. We cannot say anything more specific at this stage.'</p>

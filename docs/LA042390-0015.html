			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD NIXON LOOKS BACK ON HIS FINAL HOURS IN THE WHITE HOUSE  </P> <P> Nixon's analysis of our options for lasting strength and peace as the Cold War  winds down was brilliant, if cold-hearted and realistic. It was the missing  link in comprehending some of Gorbachev's real options.  </P> <P> Thankfully, Nixon did not dredge up the inflammatory language of the Cold War  that has forced the U.S. into inflexible strategies with peace as a peripheral  consideration.  </P> <P> Yet, like the memory of the thief who picked Nixon's pocket in the Times Square  celebration after World War II, the memory of a single phrase from his analysis  nags at me. Nixon talked of Gorbachev's popularity being greater than that of  our President in Europe and "among Americans with graduate degrees" -- a nice  back-handed slap that gives us non-graduate-degree Americans someone to hate.  </P> <P> You can always count on that from Dick Nixon. In the midst of his most  brilliant evaluation of foreign realities, he will insert his gross insecurity  and petty contempt like knives into his own country, which is crying for  leadership that will unify its people. To this day, he doesn't understand that  his biggest crime against this country was that he took the presidency -- one  of the few unifying institutions we had left in America -- and squandered the  investment of trust we had placed in it.  </P> <P> Maybe that's why we need Nixon's voice on our Opinion pages, so we can lay  aside our naivete and play tough-minded geopolitical hardball. But here in  America, we're still waiting for someone who can heal our wounds.  </P> <P> JONI HALPERN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

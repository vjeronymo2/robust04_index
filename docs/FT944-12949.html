			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Cutting the corners like boundary hedges - are a common problem between neighbours. Would it be feasible to pay a neighbour to restrict the height or density of a hedge to some agreed level, and to get that agreement to be binding on subsequent owners? It would certainly be possible to execute a restrictive covenant preventing boundary hedges or trees being allowed to grow beyond a certain height. In order to be binding, the covenant should be registered at the Land Registry as a burden on the property on which the trees go and, if possible, as a benefit on the neighbouring property. We suggest you contact a local solicitor. (Murray Johnstone). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

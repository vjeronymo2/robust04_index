			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion by Noboru Takeshita, former prime minister, and </F> Hirotaka Akamatsu, former Social Democratic Party of Japan  secretary general, entitled: "An Admonishment to Messrs. Ozawa  and Hosokawa;" moderated by unidentified BUNGEI SHUNJU staff  member; date and place not given]    [Excerpts] [Takeshita] Many politicians are graduates of  Waseda University, but it is rare to find an alumnus of Waseda  under the old system, the Higher Institute [college] of Waseda  University, like you. [passage omitted]    [Akamatsu] Around 1955 I was still going to primary school.  [passage omitted] It must be admitted, however, that at that  time the Socialist Party was high-spirited at the least in its  determination to take the reins of government. But after a  while, it became natural for the Socialist Party to be one half  of the LDP in its strength, thus creating a 1.5 order rather  than the two big parties.    [Takeshita] One merit of the order of 1955 was, to put it in  good terms, the sharing of diplomatic roles -- the LDP toward  the nations siding with the West and the Socialist Party toward  those of the Eastern camp. That kind of diplomacy was not  backed up by force of arms, but in an active sense it could be  interpreted that Japan since the period of the occupation by the  allied powers has made crafty, in a sense, use of two parties.  For example, the Socialist Party used to tell the Eastern camp,  "We want to be on good terms with you, but it is difficult to do  so because we are at loggerheads with the stubborn LDP." On the  other hand, the Western nations made demands on Japan to bear  more burdens as it gained economic power little by little. Then  the LDP used to make such excuses as, "We fully understand, but  in view of the opinions represented by the Socialist Party we  are not at liberty to go along with you." In the field of  trade, Japan utilized the friendly-firms method to do business  with all areas of the world. Thanks to such methods and to the  advantages of free trade in both the East and West camps, Japan  has become the world's biggest economic power.    In addition, with the expression "Siding With the Working  People," the Socialist Party contributed to preventing society  as a whole from suffering a gap between the rich and the poor  and becoming one governed by the law of the jungle in a free  economy where originally the rule of competition is at work. By  incorporating the "principle of equality" -- the roots of  socialism -- into the establishment, Japan succeeded in  maintaining a balance with "liberalism" and the "rule of  competition." The existence of the Socialist Party contributed  to full institutionalization of such social security systems and  welfare policies as the world's leading medical insurance and  pension systems. I have a strong conviction that the existence  of the Socialist Party contributed to the maintenance of  so-called equality by mitigating the gap between the rich and  the poor and by preventing the strong from eating the weak,  which is permitted under the rule of competition.  <H5>  Having Become A "Yu" Party </H5>   [Takeshita] What I like to add is the inevitability of  realignment in the political world. It is due to the fact that  the double-faced diplomacy is no longer needed because one side  of the East-West camps has disappeared and that Japan, with more  than 100 billion dollars in ordinary surplus, has come to a  point where a distinct diplomacy with an identity has to be  carried out. Political realignment was long due domestically,  because the Cold-War structure itself went through fundamental  changes and partly because we [the LDP] lost the trust of the  people.    [Akamatsu] Our Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is no  longer allowed to carry on in the 1.5 order. We labelled  ourselves the "party of the working people," but now we have to  ask ourselves whether we are earnestly pursuing policies fit to  represent the "party of the working people." "Rengo," which  boasts 8 million in membership has almost become a dualistic  structure, and owners of medium and small enterprises are  casting votes in favor of the LDP.    The order of 1955 has lost its meaning as a reflection of  the times, and I am afraid that we cannot create our own regime  nor system unless that order of 1955 is smashed. Simply  speaking, we were pursuing the idea of how to surpass the  opponent LDP under the order of 1955, but now we have to take  the idea of creating an entirely new political structure by  finishing off the old order itself.    My father was a Diet member when I was born. So it seems  that I came into the world with the Socialist Party tatooed on  my body. [laughter] I had such a thorough education in  socialism that I made rounds distributing Socialist handbills  from primary school days and became a Socialist Party member at  18. But now that Socialist Party itself [the SDPJ] has changed.    The present coalition government does not need to maintain  its present shape, and it probably will not. Pairings may  change in accordance with various alliances and unions, and the  LDP may even come back to power. In the future, various  situations may take place, and that is in accordance with a  democracy. Looking at it from a different angle, it is more  than natural for the government to change hands. "The  government would change hands if it were in power for 10 years"  will become common sense. In the meantime, Japan's political  society will mature. I do not know whether it will be a  multiparty system or a two-big-party system, but it never will  happen that one political force will continue to rule for 10 or  20 years. And that is how it should be in the first place.    [Takeshita] The coalition government came into being simply  because we were under criticism, for which I was one of the  responsible persons. The LDP is the leading political party in  the Diet by holding the largest number of Diet members, but as  it did not win a majority under criticism, it is natural for  somebody else, whether it be a coalition or something else, to  take over the reins of government from the LDP. In principle,  the LDP must exert efforts to take the political initiative as  the leading political party, but I myself had a clear-cut view  that the LDP had to step down.    When the LDP became an opposition party, a certain man made  an interesting comment that "the LDP now has become a `yu'  party, Mr. Takeshita. By order of the Japanese syllabary in the  line starting with `ya,' it is gruelling for `yo-to' [ruling  party] to become 'ya-to' [opposition party] but you are  somewhere around `yu' [in between the ruling and opposition  parties]."    [Akamatsu] Ha, ha, ha...    [Takeshita] I groaned when I heard him say that. Modesty  aside, I did so because I had been well aware of the importance  of a government.    It is no use only howling "the ruling parties are  unpardonable." Thus, the LDP cannot quite become an opposition  party to the bone. Therefore, it remains a "yu" party with a  strong desire not to shake the foundation of the state, to put  it in clean expression. I myself am not quite used to being  completely on the opposition side.    When the idea of a national welfare tax was brought up for  the first time, for example, I recalled the time when a  Socialist Party member had pointed out, "Hey, Take-san, make it  a special-purpose tax," when the consumption tax was introduced  in 1988. Cause and effect were not distinct enough to make it a  special-purpose tax, as in the case of the gasoline tax, and as  rudiments of public finance tell you, a special-purpose tax will  lead to financial rigidity. So, I replied that it will be used  for various welfare purposes.    Asked about the basis of the 7 percent tax rate of the  national welfare tax concept, Prime Minister Hosokawa replied  that "it was a rough estimate," and I did not wonder. It cannot  be helped that he has less accumulation of knowledge than I and  others who have been engaged in tax affairs for scores of years.  Because this government was created following the LDP's loss of  confidence and the people are allowing it to exist,  inconsistencies such as not knowing answers to abrupt questions  or taking some time to work out policies should be generously  tolerated, in my opinion.    [Akamatsu] It is contradictory for me to criticize it, but  it is certain that the SDPJ will be laughed at if it insists om  making the tax an objective one. Even "democrats" within the  SDPJ are saying stop it. If the tax were classified a  special-purpose tax, approximately 10 trillion yen out of about  a 70-trillion-yen budget would be fixed, leading to financial  rigidity, and the tax rate should be raised automatically when  the pension fund dries up. Is it not more fundamental to  consider changing the character or the mechanism of the budget  as a whole to a welfare-style budget? I think it is wrong to  think that welfare will advance if the tax is made a  special-purpose tax to be used only for specified purposes.    However, the idea came out all of sudden, and the SDPJ was  compelled to say "it is going to be a special-purpose tax for  welfare" in an emergency. As the situation developed, Mr.  Ichikawa of Komeito and Mr. Ozawa of Shinseito could not help  but acknowledge "it is all right with us to make it a  special-purpose tax." Both sponsors and those who accepted the  idea are to blame. I was worried what would become of it if the  proposal were accepted.    [Takeshita] In the coming gray-haired society, it is too  heavy a burden for the income tax to take care of welfare of the  aged. I had explained, therefore, that the tax burden should be  spread out thinly and evenly at the stage of consumption, and I  also made clear that "it has a character of something like a  special-purpose tax." So I feel I am a little responsible.    By saying that a discussion of a pseudo-special-purpose tax  reflects a kind of opinion, I maneuvered the debate on the  consumption tax to, or pulled it into the arena of the Diet.    [Akamatsu] Because you are a crafty politician. [laughter]  It is the opposition party's way of thinking to make tax revenue  the source of funds for specific purposes while responsible men  in the government cannot say such things. Regrettably, the SDPJ  has a long way to go to be a genuine ruling party. At any rate,  the recent Hosokawa concept was very reckless.    [Takeshita] His government is young and the idea could be  termed rough and ready.  <H5>  Popularity Rates of Takeshita and Hosokawa </H5>   [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Wednesday, 9 February marked exactly half a  year since the Hosokawa regime was established. Despite being  called glassware, it has successfully managed to deal with  various important problems. Although premature, what are your  evaluations of the half year of the Hosokawa regime?    [Akamatsu] Generally speaking, it has a 70 percent rating in  popular support, although it went down to 50 percent when the  idea of a national welfare tax was revealed. This reflects the  underlying sense among the people that the government has made  politics something close to them, rather than what it has  achieved. It is worthy of high evaluation. It has dealt with  various problems such as deregulation of controls, redeeming the  margin gained by high yen rates, rice problems, political  reform, and measures to give impetus to a stagnating economy.  It may take some time before an evaluation is made on their  effects.    It has been said time and again that the SDPJ is standing in  the way, but a close watch will reveal that a kind of tug-of-war  like that between the LDP and the Socialist Party during the  order of 1955 is being waged among the ruling coalition because  the SDPJ is in it. Thus, the course of policies is settled in  an agreeable direction.    [Takeshita] The popularity rate is astonishingly high. But,  it does not reflect the actual evaluation of achievements, and  as Mr. Akamatsu pointed out, the rate incorporates expectation  and encouragement. On the contrary, the LDP was in power for a  long time and it was judged by its actual record. And that rate  fell to a single-digit figure in my case when the consumption  tax was finally enforced. Somebody encouraged me, "Come on Mr.  Take. Stand firm until it drops to 3 percent."    [Akamatsu] That is the consumption tax rate. [laughter]    [Takeshita] Still, the sense of expectation is going on and  time is too short for actual evaluation of achievements. In  such a problem as rice, a negative legacy left over by the LDP  was dealt with successfully. During my cabinet days, beef and  oranges were liberalized and the rice problem could have been  settled within the Uruguay Round if it had been treated in the  same manner.    It was said that Japan gained the most in the GATT system.  The biggest future problem lies in domestic measures. As to  recoupling [measures to compensate income], Germany and France  have a traditional consciousness that agriculture is an  important tourist resource, plays a role of preserving the land,  and provides a resting place for urban inhabitants and therefore  those in rural districts are encouraged to preserve the pastoral  scenery as it is. And this consciousness serves to support the  recoupling measures. In Japan's case, a change of consciousness  is also necessary. Compensation should not continue to take the  form of farmers wearing headbands clamoring for rice price  hikes, but urban dwellers should also support the farmers as  preservers of the land and natural scenery. If the problem is  dealt with smartly in such a manner, I think the Uruguay Round  agreement will lead to a more advantageous direction for Japan  and the whole world.  <H5>  `A Muffler Does Not Become Me' </H5>   [Takeshita] If you would allow me to use a rough expression,  I think it is all right for political reform to go through many  trials and errors; defects are corrected if there are any.  [passage omitted]    Roughly speaking, there are only single member constituency  systems and proportional representation systems as methods of  conducting elections. However, elections are held in many  countries in a way suitable to their national conditions and no  absolute way exists to conduct them. In Japan's case, I do not  mind changing the system, if Japan is not confident that the  multiple-member constituency system is the best.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] By the way, how do you evaluate Mr.  Hosokawa as a person?    [Akamatsu] When I asked my supporters "why" they "like Mr.  Hosokawa," the largest number of them answered he has a  refreshing air, followed by a "clean" image. And that  impression leads to his very high popularity. In the case of  contributions from the Sagawa trucking company, Mr. Hosokawa  disposed of the money the same way as Mr. Ozawa did, dividing it  into separate accounts of one million yen each. While Mr. Ozawa  was exhaustively criticized for that matter, Mr. Hosokawa  received mild criticism. I think he is a very lucky man.    Apart from his appearance, he has political skill for having  managed to maintain the coalition of eight different groups for  the past half a year, by making compromises where necessary. It  is questionable, however, whether his way of handling matters  will be successful in the future, now that such measures as  political reform and the pump-priming measure of reducing taxes  beforehand have passed. With an eye on the forthcoming  elections, every political party is trying to display  outstanding characteristics in its political stance. In  particular, Mr. Ozawa is decisively on bad terms with Mr.  Takemura and I am afraid that the combination of Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] and Sakigake [Harbinger Party] is actually  impossible in the next elections.    It depends entirely on Mr. Hosokawa's leadership whether the  two big questions of cooperation in the elections and the  formation of a new political party are successfully solved. In  retrospect of the process that led to the formation of the  current coalition, none other than Mr. Hosokawa is able to do  it. And the maintenance of the coalition depends on whether he  succeeds in settling the matter.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Mr. Takeshita, you have known Mr. Hosokawa  from his youth, did you ever think of his becoming prime  minister one day?    [Takeshita] Well, he has given me an impression of a  so-called new leader. He is gentle characteristically, and I  have associated with him for a long time, including our personal  relationship. When he was governor of Kumamoto Prefecture, he  seemed to have a comparatively high evaluation of his  achievements backed by overwhelming support from prefectural  inhabitants.    I experienced going to international meetings with him. When  we were attending a meeting in Davos, Switzerland, a skiing  resort, he went skiing after meetings. I did not ski because I  was afraid of breaking a bone. He is for sure a skiing star.    [Akamatsu] As a matter of fact, he represented his  prefecture as a skier at a national athletic meet.    [Takeshita] He has something we old ones do not. He is  taller than we and a neck scarf fits him perfectly. If I wear a  scarf, people might think that I caught cold. [laughter]    From my old-fashioned sensibility, you will really feel the  heavy responsibility once you take charge of the government. I  was prime minister for one year and seven months and served  under Prime Minister Eisaku Sato for seven years and eight  months. During that time I had felt like I was climbing up  stairs step by step with a heavy load on my back, with eventual  relief upon completing the reversion of Okinawa in the end.    Mr. Hosokawa was reported to have done quite a bit of  redecorating of the official residence of the prime minister,  but he must be feeling that grueling load of the knapsack of his  administration biting into his shoulder.  <H5>  Artificial Image of Mr. Ozawa </H5>   [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Mr. Ozawa seems to have quite an influence  over the Hosokawa coalition government. In the case of Mr.  Takeshita, you are one of the foster parents by having had him  as deputy chief cabinet secretary and raising him to important  positions from the time of the Sosei-kai. Meanwhile, Mr.  Akamatsu has experienced big debates with him at  representatives' meeting of the ruling coalition parties and  worked together to form the Hosokawa regime. Now, please tell  us your opinions of Ozawa.    [Takeshita] It is a difficult subject for me to speak on.  He served as minister of home affairs and chairman of the  National Public Safety Commission, both posts of an attestation  official, but later when I formed a cabinet I asked him to  become deputy chief cabinet secretary, one rank below the  attestation official. I certainly acknowledge his ability,  because he managed to settle the problems of U.S. participation  in Japanese construction projects and Motorola car phones once  he had been given full authority. He settled the construction  issues and solved problems before economic friction flared up.  The Motorola issue is pending, but he is a tough negotiator, I  am sure. I do not think he is well versed in English, but I  highly appreciate his ability for settling problems, not quite  in a smart manner but by holding fast and getting to the point.    Characteristically he is well described as "hito-mishiri"  -- shy with strangers. In other words, he is shy. These days I  have had no contact by phone neither have I had a serious talk  with him, but I am compelled to think that it is an artificial  image to make Mr. Ozawa responsible for everything that is done  forcibly. He was born in 1942 and is six years senior Mr.  Akamatsu, but certainly he is a politician of the future. He is  not a man of the past like us, and his artificial image should  be cast off and he must work in that direction.    [Akamatsu] I agree that his image, good or bad, has  certainly been inflated too much and has become artificial.    From the initiation of the coalition government to working  out the political reform bill, he has not dashed through  everything. I think he is a kind of politician who knows very  well when to withdraw and where to make a compromise, because he  has gained political experience under the guidance of Mr.  Takeshita. Aside from being good or bad, Shinseito and the SDPJ  in the coalition are far apart in their policies and eventually  they have to decide on matters by compromise. The same thing  can be applied to SDPJ Chairman Kubota, and in that sense Mr.  Ozawa is a more subtle man of compromise than the public thinks.    By the same token, Mr. Ichiro Ozawa is nothing more nor less  than Mr. Ichiro Ozawa himself. So, I think he deserves a better  appraisal of his real image. I do not know who is responsible  for the artificial image. If he is judged by a wrong image, the  political situation may well be misjudged.    [Takeshita] In view of the present relationship between the  ruling and opposition parties, the problem of reducing taxes  before taking measures to make up for them cannot be settled  without "confidence" and "a relationship of mutual trust." By  confidence, I mean the determination that this policy must be  carried out or the support of a majority. The relationship of  mutual trust means such a relationship that both ruling and  opposition parties mutually understand what the intentions of  the other side are, something like that kind of cooperation is  needed to prevent bills from being passed at the last moment  with a natural understanding that the SDPJ takes an opposing  action. When such a confidence and relationship of mutual trust  exist, most issues are settled well by the method of  consultation between the ruling and opposition parties.    The other day, somebody complained that "at present both  confidence and a relationship of trust do not exist" and I  admonished him "not to say such things."    [Akamatsu] At present, such a relationship of trust does  exist within the ruling parties as firm as it can be, but not  between the ruling and opposition parties. When the political  reform bill was finally worked out, I told Mr. Ichikawa, "You  have not sided with the SDPJ even once while drafting the bill,  despite your repeated reference to "sha-ko-min" [collaboration  among the SDPJ, Komeito and DSP (Democratic Socialist Party)].  He replied, "I intentionally took such an attitude only to work  out the bill. So do not hold a grudge against me." By the same  token, I tell him what I have in mind without hesitation and he  talks back instantly upon hearing a view he cannot agree with.  I think it is better to associate with each other in such a way  without caring too much for coming into harmony with the other  party.  <H5>  Two Big Parties Or Tripartite Structure? </H5>   [BUNGEI SHUNJU] At long last, political reorganization has  become a matter of reality. Mr. Masayoshi Takemura mentioned  three points as fundamentals of forming a new political party in  relation to the political reorganization: its basic policy plus  its views on the times and methods it will employ and its  constitution. What will be the axis which future political  reorganization will concentrate on? Please expound on your  opinion of this.    [Akamatsu] In my opinion, the next election at the least  should be dealt with in the coalition framework. It is better,  however, to think separately about the matter of forming a new  political party and how to deal with the election. In this  connection, the basic policies should be identical, even if they  are rough and general.    Then, what are the guidelines for deciding on the new  framework after all? Messrs. Takemura and Ozawa have already  made their guidelines clear, but they are ambiguous about what  to do with the international contribution and the problem  related to amendments to the Constitution. They have to make it  clear where they are going to take the nation, to be an ordinary  country or a brightly shining nation. They have yet to  distinguish themselves not with ideology, but with ideals of  justice or freedom. Even the LDP is divided through various  opinions, and our side has not yet clearly defined our  framework. But one thing is clear, our side is destined to  split among itself.    In my personal opinion, the coalition cannot win in the  forthcoming election unless the seven coalition parties are  firmly united against the powerful LDP. And when the coalition  wins a landslide it will become something like the Imperial Rule  Assistance Association [before World War II]. Then, the  coalition will have to split into two in accordance with  aforementioned ideals or fundamental policies, and I think it  would work better for Japan's politics to have three parties,  including the LDP.    But the leftist group of the present SDPJ will not run on  the ticket of the coalition because other political parties  would not support it. I have told Mr. Sukio Iwatare: "You and  members of your group think that the new election system is  designed to destroy minority parties, but that is a  misunderstanding." "In a proportional-representation  constituency, one can be elected by winning 250,000 votes.  Although winning more than 250,000 votes has become necessary  because votes are counted by blocks, in principle you will be  elected by mustering 250,000 votes. Therefore, you had better  organize a political party, something like a "goken-shinto" [New  Party for Safeguarding the Constitution] in accordance with your  political ideals and beliefs."    The SDPJ should not remain an entity by forcing people to  change their beliefs but rather should negotiate a divorce by  consent to make full use of its members beliefs and political  principles by forming a new political party. That will become a  matter of course as such matters as the demarcation of  constituencies, the selection of candidates, and actions by the  reformist group in the LDP make progress.    The point is that we will side with the line of "from Mr.  Gotoda to Mr. Yokomichi," as Mr. Takemura said, by letting  obstinate people within the SDPJ go. Official policy study  meetings with the Japan New Party have been held many times  already, and I think that our policies are the closest. If I  may borrow the expression by Mr. Yamagishi of Rengo [Japanese  Trade Union Federation], my basic idea is that we should support  the B group of the conservatives and bring it together with the  liberals of the SDPJ and the DSP.    [Takeshita] I said that a political realignment is  inevitable, and I think that "freedom" and "equality" are the  two nuclei of ideals when a political reorganization is under  way. Therefore, something like two big political parties are  good for Japan eventually in that the spirit of justice and  equality and the principle of competition which respects freedom  coexist.    With respect to the Constitution, there once was such a  difference in positions, which can be simplified in terms of  safeguarding the Constitution and proposing amendments to the  Constitution. My way of interpreting the Constitution is that  the obligation of observing the Constitution includes Article 96  of Chapter IX, which provides for constitutional amendments.  And those who advocate safeguarding the Constitution are  interpreted as observing the spirit of the preamble of the  Constitution-- internationalism, pacifism, and fundamental human  rights or to protect the sovereignty residing with the people  and democracy. And those in the LDP who advocate constitutional  amendments are also believed to be observing what is said in the  preamble.    Such a simplified classification of either safeguarding the  Constitution or advocating constitutional amendments is no  longer so clear-cut, and today versatile views are held on the  Constitution, and debates are maturing. I think that the trend  is in transition in the direction of having two big political  parties. With respect to the political realignment, we have the  wrong question because we are in the past perfect tense.    [Akamatsu] No, not in the past perfect tense. (laughter)    [Takeshita] I did not mean to be discourteous. From now on,  politics is in the hands of the new generation such as Mr.  Akamatsu. I think that men like myself deserve to exist to  fulfill the duty of storytellers at the most. The "Kojiki"  [Record of Ancient Matters] was compiled in accordance with what  Hieda-no-Are told from memory, so storytellers should exist. I  will discipline myself to be a storyteller, not to lead in  politics. It is said, "Wise men learn from history while fools  learn from experience." I have a little experience (laughter),  and also a little knowledge about history.  <H5>  Where Is the LDP Heading? </H5>   [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Mr. Takeshita, where do you place the LDP in  what you said about the inevitable future political realignment?    [Takeshita] It will rid itself of the obstinacy and bigotry  of reactionary conservatives. It may not be an appropriate  expression, but I think the LDP will survive self-reformation,  just as the SDPJ has "democrats" within the party. The LDP is  expected to undergo various movements while the demarcation of  single-seat election constituencies is carried out. Through  such movements, the LDP will continue to play the role of  carrying on the accumulated knowledge of having maintained  government for a long time after the war in a series of trials  and errors, despite mistakes. Conservatives are to maintain and  safeguard the so-called universal values, and the LDP should  continue to exist as a political party that can immediately  respond to the needs of the times.    [Akamatsu] Because Mr. Takeshita may feel awkward in saying  things about the LDP, let me say what I think from my  standpoint. Basically, the conservatives will continue to  survive among the Japanese people in the future. I do not think  that they will unite in one organization. As Mr. Ozawa and his  supporters have said, there will certainly be "new  conservatives" and conservatives opposing them.    Whatever shapes they take, it is most probable that they  will  be divided into "old conservatives" and "new conservatives." It  may be impossible for us "Democrats" to be incorporated into  their camps. Then it will be realistic to anticipate a  combination of two conservative groups and one liberal group. I  think it is most probable that such a system will come into  being, irrespective of the shapes of their combinations.    Although I am not critical, Mr. Ozawa's idea of having two  conservative parties is based on a simple premise that his party  is overwhelmingly powerful and therefore "it is all right to  have one more party."    Mr. Ozawa's basic strategy seems to be that his party  should have overwhelming power; otherwise, Japan cannot fulfill  its role in the world to the fullest extent; or the rate of the  consumption tax cannot be raised to 10 percent; or it cannot  fulfill with responsibility what it has proposed in spite of  people's repugnance. And that is how Mr. Ozawa is decisively  different from us.    [Takeshita] Unlike the new political parties, the LDP should  explore the way to make the best use of its wisdom of policies  and accumulated knowledge by working hard together within the  party.    For example, Japan's explanation of its planned tax cuts was  insufficient in the recent Japanese-U.S. economic framework  talks for a new economic partnership. The United States was  critical of the Japanese plan because it perceived mistakenly  that the tax cut was intended for only one year, which was not  the case. It was not explained that the consultative meeting on  the tax system planned a further examination of more tax cuts in  its later full-scale discussions. In this respect, I doubt  whether Mr. Clinton, who is two years Mr. Akamatsu's senior,  possessed that much information.    The report of the aforementioned consultative meeting on the  tax system merely indicated what the tax system should be but  was not intended to recommend pump-priming measures. Therefore,  I would rather think that a tax cut should have been carried out  first as a pump-priming measure. Its pump-priming effects will  be mitigated when the tax cut is implemented from this January,  and the rate of the consumption tax is to be raised in April  1995, as everybody knows. This is where the LDP should be  consulted to provide its wisdom.    [Akamatsu] It is not good to be reckless.    [Takeshita] So, with confidence and trust, the matter should  have been referred to a consultative body composed of both  ruling and opposition parties, and it should have agreed to cut  the tax by 20 percent this year with ceiling of the cut for an  individual set at 2 million yen. Then the real tax cut could  have taken place during the current Diet session. Criticism  could have been avoided if such an explanation were made to the  United States.    [Akamatsu] The tax cut cannot actually be felt if a direct  refund is not made to the people.  <H5>  Wisdom Is Required To Deal With Numerical Targets </H5>   [Takeshita] As an old saying goes, "The mind rules the  body,"  and illness and business conditions are at the mercy of the  thinking of the people. Japanese consumers' thinking currently  is to postpone buying new cars although the time has come to  replace old ones. Therefore, they have to be shown concrete  figures of how much of a tax cut they can expect. Then they  will spend money.    In setting numerical targets, I think that both sides had  room for compromise. For instance, at the Japanese-U.S.  structural impediments initiative talks, I succeeded in working  out a 430-trillion-yen public investment program for the ensuing  10 years with the talks with U.S. Secretary of State Baker  serving as its basis. The amount of 415 trillion yen was  compiled by multiplying by 1.5 the past 10 years of investment  in public projects, and a reserve fund of 15 trillion yen was  added to it.    Therefore, the issue of setting numerical targets in the  recent framework talks could have been discussed by presenting  whatever our side could have decided on and having the two sides  discuss this, thus being devoid of policies leading to managed  trade.    [Akamatsu] That is a good idea.    [Takeshita] The remaining problem of government procurement  can be dealt with independently to a certain degree, such as  introducing U.S. medical equipment to hospitals at national  universities, and talks will progress about the problems of  Motorola and those of a financial nature [insurance].    [Akamatsu] Actually, Japanese insurance policies and the  like  are superior quality-wise, and the United States is urging  stronger controls to prevent Japanese insurance companies from  entering the U.S. market. Contrary to what it urges on  deregulation, the United States is moving in the other direction.    [Takeshita] Yes, it is. Because U.S. insurance companies  cannot form such organizations as "Nissei's sales ladies."  (laughter)    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Looking at the coalition, we find that a  political realignment will not proceed if the coalition is to be  maintained, while the political foundation will become unstable  because the coalition will split when a political realignment is  pursued. Despite such a contradiction, do you still intend to  maintain such a front until the next election?    [Akamatsu] If the coalition cannot be maintained, the  election will follow. Because of demarcation [of  constituencies] problems, the new system will require about six  months to allow voters to familiarize themselves with it, thus  restricting the prime minister's ability to dissolve the Diet.    [Takeshita] That is right. From now on is the crucial  period. And I keenly feel that the new era has come. Today I  personally experienced the difference between the new and old  alumni.    [Akamatsu] The evaluation of Mr. Takeshita will have to be  entrusted to a future generation, as you said you wished would  be the case. (laughter) I would like you, as a senior figure  in politics, to guide and teach me, especially in how to grasp  the thinking of people. The coalition is very poor in handling  and maneuvering the elite group of several thousand bureaucrats,  and I hope that you will give us guidance in the future for the  benefit of Japanese politics and the administration.    [Takeshita] I am much obliged to you.</p>

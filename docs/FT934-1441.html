			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Markets: The three-dimensional cheque - At a glance The Guinness Mahon private banking group is issuing its customers with cheques incorporating a hologram as a security feature, the first bank in Europe to do so. Holograms prevent the cheques being copied on colour photocopiers, a tool increasingly used by fraudsters. Other security features, including tamper-proof inks, will help prevent alteration of payees and amounts.

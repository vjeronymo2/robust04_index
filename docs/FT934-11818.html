			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Arts: Love's labour in Navarre on the Fens - Theatre Who would have thought that Love's Labour's Lost would be the RSC's favourite play in the 1990s? Here is the company's second new production of Shakespeare's early comedy within the last three years and there are still new ways of doing it. Ian Judge's direction switches the location from the park of the King of Navarre to a Cambridge College somewhere around the 1920s. This is the best opening interpretation of the play I have seen. For what else is the King of Navarre doing but acting like a precocious undergraduate of an Oxbridge college before the admission of women? He demands from his fellow students three years of study and a ban on girls. For a while, the interpretation works wonders. The golden young men, otherwise the lords of the King of Navarre, stroll about in boating clothes, happy enough in the boathouse with its display of oars and familiar photographs of college eights. Anthony Dull, the constable, enters on a bicycle like a policeman in an old Ealing comedy. Costard, whom he brings with him under semi-arrest, behaves throughout like an old-fashioned college servant, utterly loyal to the place but slightly lost when it comes to four-syllable words. The problem with trying to impose a single idea, however brilliant, on a Shakespeare play is how to sustain it all the way through. Judge just about pulls it off. He does so by changing some of the stranger characters in the piece into college dons. That goes for Armado, the 'fantastical Spaniard' in the original, his page Moth, the curate Sir Nathaniel and the pedant and schoolmaster, Holofernes. They represent the over-academic side of the college, swapping latinisms while watching cricket. If the production flags, it is not entirely the fault of the RSC. Love's Labour's Lost does have the odd, obscure longueur for a modern audience. The answer is probably to apply the scissors. Yet the mainstream is full of delights. The college quad in moonlight is a marvellous site for the select band of students in the tryst to watch each other composing sonnets to the ladies they are pledged to eschew. Jeremy Northam as Berowne has the best part, but do not overlook the rest. This is a team performance by the men, like rowing in a four. Then Shakespeare and the women take over. It no longer matters where the setting is, for parts of the play, especially the elegiac ending, are powerful and some, like the performance of the Nine Worthies, are both touching and funny. Never forget the final words of Holofernes as he is pushed off the stage: 'this is not generous, not gentle, not humble'. The female playing is magnificent, almost a superior intelligence throughout. It is the reverse of Lysistrata. Here the men vow to be celibate. The ladies of the French court know they will never stick to it, but tease them throughout and finally tell them to hold off for another year. One special tribute should go to Paul Greenwood as Boyet, the lord who accompanies the French ladies. Greenwood performs as if he is above the whole lot of them: not a eunuch, not an academic, not an idealist, but just genially detached. There should be a special medal for those who develop the smaller parts in Shakespeare. The sets are designed by John Gunter, the lighting by Alan Burrett. They are absolutely right for Navarre on the Fens. Love's Labour's Lost is in repertory at Stratford until January. Telephone: 0789-295623</p>

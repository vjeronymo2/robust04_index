At the end of last  year, the Main Medical Administration in Moscow decided to bring  order to the capital's medical institutions. Those institutions  that had previously had the status of all-union institutions  became the stumbling block. The Russian Ministry of Health  sheltered some of them. It was proposed that the others become  Moscow polyclinics.    The unique Center for the Rehabilitation of Invalids and  Patients With Spinal Trauma, which is headed by living legend  Valentin Dikul and which is the only one of its kind not only in  Russia but in the entire former USSR as well, fell among these  ``others.'' The ``Retsept'' wrote about it in detail in the past  once. I will therefore recall just one fact: For its well-known  services, Dikul's center was listed in the World Register of  Medical Institutions.    Moscow's central medical board dealt with this unique  institution as follows: It decided to reshape it into an  ordinary Moscow polyclinic with its associates given a rank 5  salary.    What did this mean? First, specialists who knew a rare  method  incurred a big salary loss. Second, the polyclinic had to accept  primarily Moscow residents and had to refuse to help patients  from other regions. And third, the center's director V. Dikul  found himself thrown overboard: The polyclinic's staff roster  did not contain the post of director, and a medical education  was required for the chief physician (Dikul never finished his).    The stand-off between the center and Moscow's medical board  continued for more than half a year. The public sided with Dikul  and his associates. Such prestigious individuals as Yu. Nikulin,  M. Zakharov, Y. Yevtushenko, and many others wrote to Moscow's  mayoralty and the federal government. The stand-off could not  but affect the rehabilitation center's activity: It had to cut  back the number of Russian patients accepted to only the most  critical, and even those Moscow patients who did not fit the  center's profile -- those with radiculitis, osteochondrosis,  etc., had to be accepted.    The public was not pressured, and the mayoralty to whom it  appealed and medical officials made concessions. They proposed  that Dikul write a letter in which he would ask to be under the  ``wing'' of the central medical board but as the Moscow  rehabilitation center. In other words, the version that  Dikulev's supporters proposed half a year ago was revived.    Who needed all this idle fuss? I cannot document it, but  perhaps something will clarify this curious information.  ``Buyers'' who are not hiding their intentions came to the  rehabilitation center. While examining the ``goods'' (the  building), they said that they find it entirely suitable as a  commercial health improvement center: Luckily, there is a pool  and rooms for training equipment, and a magnificent park with an  athletic field in the neighborhood. To the question of their  ``aims,'' the ``buyers'' answered significantly: The land, they  say, is full of rumors...    This time the public, with the help of the capital's  mayoralty, uncovered the source of the rumors. This time. But  there is no guarantee that a similar situation will not be  repeated with other commercial-type medical institutions. To  sell is not to build.</p>

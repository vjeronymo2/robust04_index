			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Greycoat loan refinanced GREYCOAT, the UK property company, has completed the refinancing of Embankment Place, a central London office development, with a Pounds 125m fixed-rate syndicated loan secured on the property. The loan was arranged by Hypo-Bank and has been syndicated among German, Dutch and Swiss banks. Earlier this year, Greycoat tried to refinance its Pounds 110m loan, arranged in 1987 to finance the construction of the development, through a Pounds 125m issue of 10-year discounted bonds. But the market was unreceptive and the issue was cancelled. Mr Richard Guignard, managing director (finance), said that when a refinancing was first considered last year, rental income from the property was not sufficient to service a bank loan. But, with lower interest rates, annual net rental income of Pounds 15.3m now comfortably covers the annual Pounds 13.7m refinancing cost.</p>

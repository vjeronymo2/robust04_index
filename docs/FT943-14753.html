			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (10): Prosperity is dwindling - The Provinces Few of Argentina's 23 provinces have benefitted from the past three years of vigorous growth. The backward northern region, bordering Bolivia and Paraguay is suffering as its traditional economies, based on sugar cane and tobacco, decline. To the south, vast but sparsely populated Patagonia is seeing its population dwindle further as the oil industry sheds jobs, as it restructures and central government subsidies are cut off. Even on the Pampas, Argentina's agricultural heartland, times are hard. Agronomists reckon that only one in five farms in the province of Buenos Aires are economically viable. Santa Fe, once one of Argentina's most vigorous industrial provinces, has become a rust bowl of obsolete industry and rising unemployment where labour unrest is rising. Only a few parts of the country are prospering. The industrial belt surrounding Buenos Aires concentrates one-third of Argentina's population and much of its industry. Cordoba is the cradle of the car industry. Mendoza to the west has bucked the trend of weak regional economies. It has sound government, a relatively vibrant local industry and has become a focus of investment from neighbouring Chile. However, none of the provinces has emulated economy minister Domingo Cavallo's sweeping reforms of the federal public sector. Their aggregate budget deficit may reach Dollars 2bn-3bn this year - about 1 per cent of GDP and more than five times larger than expected at the beginning of the year. Unreconstructed public sectors raise local industry's operating costs by burdening it with high taxes and expensive but inefficient infrastructure and utilities, making it hard to create jobs or raise investment. The government is keenly aware of the dangers of allowing large regions of the country to fall further behind the few prosperous provinces. Already, the overcrowded slums surrounding Buenos Aires are swelling with migrants from the interior. Last December, rioters seized the northern city of Santiago del Estero for a day, looting and burning as they went. It was Argentina's worst outbreak of violence since hyperinflation four years earlier. Public employees demanding unpaid wages led the rioting. Unrest continues to simmer, with public employees protesting almost weekly in cities throughout the interior. Comparisons with the new year's day guerrilla uprising in Mexico's state of Chiapas are far-fetched, but Mr Menem's failure to deal adequately with the provinces' troubles is emerging as one of his greatest shortcomings. On the one hand Mr Menem needs the powerful provincial governors' backing for his re-election campaign. Yet at the same time Mr Cavallo is demanding deeply resented public sector reforms. Unsurprisingly, Mr Cavallo's reforms are on hold. The governors - led by members of Mr Menem's own Peronist party - are demanding that the assembly which is rewriting the country's constitution should insert a clause ordering the federal government to hand over half national tax revenues to the provinces. The federal government has budgeted tax revenues of Dollars 47.46bn for 1994, Dollars 16.09bn of which it must transfer by law to the provinces. Giving way would open the door to an avalanche of demands for more concessions. In June, Mr Menem bluntly told the governors to 'be quiet and try to contribute to reforming the constitution, and not introduce destabilising elements'. He attacked them for 'demagogic, absurd populism'. Meanwhile, Mr Cavallo and Juan Antonio Zapata, his secretary overseeing provincial reform, are struggling on as they can. Even Mr Zapata admits he is facing an uphill struggle. He says: 'We need a gradual policy. We are pushing through some policies to reform the provincial public sector, but until the private sector (shows) strong demand (for labour), it is difficult to carry out. It will have to be done simultaneously. Each province reforms as it can.' In many provinces, notably the north-west, local governments are the largest employers. No governor can afford to throw thousands of employees out of work when unemployment is already high. Furthermore, distribution of government jobs is a cornerstone of a clientelistic political system that has kept some ruling families in power for generations. Neither can the governors afford to reform their highly inefficient and anti-business tax systems for fear of losing revenues. In the past, the federal government showered subsidies and investment incentives on the regions, even though corrupt businessmen and officials often stole these resources. In one celebrated case, Koner SA, a now bankrupt conglomerate, is accused of misappropriating Dollars 100m in government subsidies over a five-year period in the 1980s. Mr Cavallo has a different approach. He has cut federal taxes for companies in the interior. He has given the provinces more money in exchange for promised tax reform and privatisations. He has offered to take over deficit-ridden provincial retirement funds. Mr Cavallo is also targeting Dollars 300m of federal spending on infrastructure in the provinces this year as part of a planned Dollars 2bn, five-year program. Furthermore, privatised telephone, rail, port and highway operators are also investing heavily in the interior. More efficient and cheaper infrastructure is reducing companies' costs as well as pumping money into the regions. However, the provinces have stubbornly resisted privatising their utilities and banks. Governors complain that Mr Cavallo's largesse hardly compensates for the transfer to the provinces of responsibility for education and health that used to be handled by the federal government. But most of the governors are taking the extra money without keeping their side of the bargain and beginning reform. Provincial governments' spending rose to Dollars 25.70bn last year from Dollars 16.24bn in 1991, when Mr Cavallo took office. Spending on wages hit a record Dollars 13.76bn in 1993 - two-thirds more than in 1991. An exasperated Mr Menem said the governors were 'not administering as they should. They are not lowering public spending. They have not carried out public sector reform'. Yet his home province of La Rioja - which Mr Menem governed from 1983-89 in the time-honoured tradition of padding the public payroll - has done little in the way of reform. Even the local finance minister admitted La Rioja receives more than its fair share of federal transfers. Until the provinces' backward political structures are reformed, it is hard to see how Argentina can achieve balanced and sustainable growth.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Shulman] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- An Azerbaijani delegation,  led by Parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev, criticised a draft  Russian peace plan for Karabakh during a meeting with Vladimir  Lukin, chairman of the State Duma Committee for International  Affairs.    The delegation's opinion is that this "starting document"  infringes the national interests of Azerbaijan. If this plan is  adopted as a basis, they argue, the republic would lose control  over some more of its territories.    The Azerbaijani side expressed bewilderment over the  suggested establishment of a number of checkpoints in now  non-occupied lands and the zone of combat operations. Similar  unacceptable proposals, they assert, are also envisaged for  railway sections linking Azerbaijan with Armenia and located far  away from the conflict zone.    The Azerbaijani parliamentarians are particularly concerned  over issues related to the return of tens of thousands of  Azerbaijani refugees to Nagorno-Karabakh, which did not find  reflection in the new Russian initiatives.    While coming out in favour of an immediate cessation of fire  and hostilities, they nevertheless believe that talks on a  settlement of the conflict should be equal and fair.    Lukin's opinion is that the problem is that it is essential  to cease fire to resolve the conflict but this does not at all  mean that thereby someone demands the Azerbaijani side's  recognition that the Russia-suggested plan is ideal and fair in  every respect. There are no ideal documents in the world except  the holy scriptures and the Koran, Lukin remarked.    The State Duma committee chairman is convinced that  following  a ceasefire it is necessary to sit down at the negotiating table  to discuss all contenctions aspects to reflected in the Russian  plan concerning in particular the delimitaiton of the  conflicting forces and the forthcoming signing of an agreement  on the cessation of hostilities.    As far as occupied Azerbaijani territories are concerned,  they are to be vacated within 40 days in accordance with the  suggested time-table, it was stated during the meeting.    Lukin said the Russian proposals are of benefit to the  Azerbaijani side. These are not just Russian initiatives. They  have been elaborated in conjunction with the conference on  security and cooperation in Europe. It is difficult to resolve  otherwise the problems that have piled up over the years, Lukin  emphasised.    The development and deepening of economic departments  between  Russia and Azerbaijan depend in many respects on the cessation  of military operations in the region, speakers said during the  meeting.    On Tuesday the Azerbaijani MPs also met with representatives  from various factions of deputies in Russia's State Duma. They  are expected to meet with Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev  on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SIFTING THROUGH YEAR'S OPINIONS  </P> <P> During 1988, various Orange County residents wrote about their feelings and  thoughts in articles submitted to our Sunday commentary columns. As we look  back, some of those thoughts are recalled:  </P> <P> Jeff Fister on high-priced housing:  </P> <P> I recently made my first trip back to Southern California after moving from  Orange County. I opened up the newspaper and read, among other things, that the  average Orange County home price is $175,000, highest in the nation. It is no  wonder that the middle-class dream of owning a home is now out of reach for  most young Orange County families. I'm a case in point. Before moving we lived  in a two-bedroom apartment in Westminster for $610 a month. I accepted a job in  Denver. We moved into a brand new three-bedroom, two-story home. It includes a  yard, a full basement and a view of the mountains. We bought the house for  $110,000 at a 7.8% fixed, 30-year mortgage rate. A staffing manager who  recruits professional workers for my new company told me that the richest pool  of engineers is in Southern California -- it's easy to lure them away because  of the high cost of housing.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xin Huaishi (6580 2037 2514)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- At a meeting with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher at Zhongnanhai this  afternoon, State Council Premier Li Peng said: Sino-U.S.  relations have been established only on the basis of common  interests instead of on the basis of ideology and concept of  values.    Li Peng pointed out: The existence of disputes between China  and the United States is a reality. We believe that the  disputes between the two countries must be settled properly  through consultation on an equal footing in the spirit of mutual  respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences.  The problems can only be complicated by exerting pressures  unilaterally.    Li Peng said: China attaches great importance to the current  visit by Secretary of State Christopher, hoping that candid  talks may help enhance mutual understanding and facilitate the  improvement and expansion of Sino-U.S. relations.    Recalling Christopher's visit to China a decade ago, Li Peng  said: Great changes have taken place in the world over the past  decade and so has China's appearance taken on an entirely new  look. However, the changing international situation have not in  any way changed the importance of Sino-U.S. relations. On the  contrary, the changing international situation has called for  the enhancement of Sino-U.S. cooperation in various fields.  China has always approached Sino-U.S. relations from the global  perceptive and from the fundamental interests of the two  peoples. The Chinese Government attaches great importance to  relations with the United States, and has made tremendous  efforts toward improving and developing such relations. In my  government work report two days ago, I reiterated the Chinese  Government's positive desire for improving and developing  Sino-U.S. relations.    Discussing Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations, Li Peng  said: The Chinese and U.S. economies are strongly complementary  to each other. Bilateral trade and economic relations have  developed rapidly in recent years, with the trade volume  reaching $27.65 billion, increasing more than 10 times over the  figure for 1979. Chinese economy is developing in a sustained,  rapid, and steady manner [chi xu kuai su ping wen 2170 4958 1816  6643 1627 4489] and the market has kept expanding. China's  imports are expected to reach $1,000 billion over the next seven  years. At present, the transport, energy, and  telecommunications industries, in which the United States is a  strong power, constitute the priority sectors for China's  development. If Sino-U.S. relations are improved [gao hao le  2269 1170 0055], with the man-made obstacles in bilateral trade  and economic cooperation removed, U.S. economic circles will  find in China a historic opportunity for expanding Sino-U.S.  economic and trade relations.    Touching on human rights issue, Li Peng said: China and the  United States have different concepts regarding human rights.  China is a developing country. The population of the  developing world makes up four-fifths of the world's total. It  is not fair to impose the human rights concepts of a developed  country on a developing country. China will never accept the  human rights concepts of the United States. For a developing  country, human rights are, first and foremost, the rights to  survival and development. He said: "Human rights, human rights!  A person must first survive before talking about rights. The  disputes between China and the United States concerning human  rights can be discussed on the basis of equality so as to  enhance mutual understanding, but there should be no application  of pressure."    Turning to the most-favored-nation [MFN] issue, Li Peng: It  is a mutually beneficial arrangement for the two countries to  maintain normal trade and economic relations. To speak frankly,  if China's MFN status is canceled, the losses incurred to the  United States will be no smaller than those to China. China  mainly relies on its internal market and has a strong capability  of self-reliance. What the United States will lose is a vast  market. We hope the U.S. side will handle this issue properly.    Christopher expressed agreement with Premier Li Peng's  remarks on the great importance of Sino-U.S. relations. He  said: President Clinton regards U.S. relations with China as  conforming to the national interests of the United States. The  United States can cooperate with China on a wide range of  issues, both global and regional, both bilateral and  multilateral, and both in the peace, security, and economic  areas. The United States and China are both permanent members  of the UN Security Council, and the U.S. side is very much  willing [shi fen yuan yi 0577 0433 1959 1942] to improve its  relations with China.    Christopher also briefed Li Peng on U.S. views on human  rights and MFN.    Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and concurrently foreign  ministers; Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei; U.S. Ambassador  to China Stapleton Roy; Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis; and  Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wiser were present at the  meeting.</p>

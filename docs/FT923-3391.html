			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: United Biscuits Even after yesterday's 24p bounce in the shares it is worth recalling that UB has lost 40 per cent of its stock market value since mid April. Investors were understandably relieved that the wilder rumours about first-half trading were wide of the mark, and justifiably impressed by a performance - Keebler aside - which saw margins in the UK and continental Europe maintained. As the recent re-rating implies, though, strategic problems in the US will not be easily resolved, and competition can only intensify in other recession-hit markets. To be fair, there is no air of complacency about Keebler. Costs have already been cut and there may be more to come; sales are running 8 per cent ahead of last year thanks to better promotion; and new products will help the second half. That said, UB is up against powerful rivals in Nabisco and Pepsico, whose margins are three or four times greater. They will not presumably stand idly by while Keebler attempts to win back market share. The question of whether UB is of sufficient size to be a national player in the US may worry investors for some time. Its dominance at home, by contrast, is demonstrated by McVitie's ability to achieve good biscuit profits without chasing volume. The pressure is on, though, from the likes of Burton's (ABF) so there is unlikely to be any substantial improvement in the second half. Not so long ago an 8 per cent yield would have seemed a slight for one of the sector's quality players - but given the thinnish dividend cover the market is right to be cautious.</p>

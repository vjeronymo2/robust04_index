The industrial survey, conducted February 15  on 162 firms in 20 sectors, said 21 percent observed  deterioration in business conditions, an improvement from 29  percent in the November survey.    On the other hand, 4 percent reported an upswing in business  conditions, a minor increase from 3 percent in November.  Seventeen percent forecast that business will worsen in the  coming six months, compared with 28 percent previously.    Those who predicted a business pickup came to 19 percent, up  from 12 percent, the survey showed.    On the course of Japan's economy, 19 percent forecast a  recovery in six months, up from 15 percent, while 9 percent  expect it to worsen, a change from the previous 24 percent. Of  those polled, 95 percent replied their business conditions will  not recover until the second half of 1994, while 98 percent said  the domestic economy will not pick up until after the second  half.    The survey found 17 percent optimistic about the likelihood  of a rise in shipments in the coming six months, up from 14  percent in the previous poll. Conversely, 18 percent forecast a  drop in shipments in an improvement from 26 percent.    On the state of corporate inventory, 38 percent felt  inventory to be in excess, down from 43 percent.    The poll revealed 25 percent expected their earnings to  improve in the six-month period, up from 20 percent, while 21  percent had a pessimistic outlook, down from 28 percent.    The survey said the nation's labor situation has worsened,  with 27 percent feeling a manpower surplus against 22 percent in  November. A MITI official said labor conditions serve as a  lagging indicator for the economy.    The latest MITI survey contained a question regarding  possible effects on the business mind of the yen's rapid gain in  the middle of February.    Of 98 firms polled, 59 percent cited the Japanese currency's  appreciation against the dollar as a factor eroding their  earnings. The yen surged by a combined 6 yen-plus to the dollar  on February 14 and 15, when the survey was conducted.</p>

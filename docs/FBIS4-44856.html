New concept: Significantly higher efficiency.    "With this concept the ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB) AG [ASEA --  Swedish General Electric Co] becomes undoubtedly the global  leader in gas turbine technology," hopes Dr Manfred Simon,  member of the ABB board of directors in Mannheim: "The  innovation can, without exaggeration, be described as a  sensational one."    The new generation of gas turbines has remarkable  characteristics: their thermal efficiency (ratio of engine  output power to fuel input power) is almost 38 percent in the  solo operation mode and the overall thermal efficiency of gas  turbine + steam turbine set reaches 58 percent. When moreover  heat is extracted for heating purposes, then the fuel  utilization may be even 90-percent higher. With such a  performance, then the two first engines of the new GT 26 series  (for the 50 Hz market Europe and Asia) and GT 24 series (for  American 60 Hz networks) are setting standards.    The new gas turbine concept has been developed by an  international group of scientists and engineers from various ABB  companies. Both new gas turbines, 240 kW and 165 kW  respectively, convert energy with not only less fuel and at a  lower but also with lower NO[.sub]x[/] emission (below 25  ppm) and an excellent light-load performance. This technological  leap was based on skillful selection of the process parameters  for two-stage combustion. The result is a high specific power  and a compact construction.    The key component of each gas turbine is the staged  combustion chamber. The concept is both simple and efficient:  such a combustion chamber utilizes the compressed air from the  turbine not once but twice. Intermediate superheating is ensured  by two premixer burners includes, one behind the other.    The annular first combustion chamber works with an unusually  lean fuel-air mixture, the oxygen content being very high. About  60 percent of the incoming fuel is burnt here. Prior to  combustion the air is compressed to a 30:1 ratio in a compressor  consisting of 22 optimally streamlined stages. In the burner,  prior to ignition, the thus compressed air mixes with an exact  fuel dose in an intense vortex stream.    The whirling of the fuel-air mixture through staggered  conical burner half-shells is particularly intense. After  ignition has taken place, the gaseous combustion products flow  through a single-stage high-pressure turbine into the  low-pressure combustion compartment. There, in the premixer  burner, these still oxygen-rich gases mix thoroughly with the  remaining 40 percent of the incoming fuel.    Owing to the simple construction of the annular combustion  chamber, only a few of its parts are exposed to high  temperatures. The uniform flame distribution prevents buildup of  thermal stresses. A new heating power plant in Berlin-Center is  to prove this.    <FIG ID=JPRS-EST-014-19A>        Staged combustion chamber: high performance, low fuel consumption, low emission levels </FIG></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic  made a special statement about the dramatic situation in Gorazde  for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and Television.    [Begin Silajdzic recording] The problem lies in the fact  that  they wished they knew how to impose an embargo, but do not know  and are refusing to defend us. In other words -- neither will  you defend yourselves nor will you be able to because we will  not let you. This is the death sentence pronounced over  Bosnia-Herzegovina by the international community. We shall  adamantly insist on this issue these days. Why? Why is  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] here? UNPROFOR means the UN  Protection Forces, that is what UNPROFOR stands for. Therefore,  a protection force. And who are they protecting? That is an  entirely different question. They are not protecting the safe  havens, they are not even protecting themselves. They are not  capable of protecting anybody or of bringing order to this part  of the world. The question arises -- Why are they here?    Furthermore, we have heard that there were many casualties  today, that Gorazde is exposed to heavy artillery and tank  attacks. We hold the top-ranking UN officials directly  responsible for the deaths of not only these people in Gorazde  but for the deaths of 200,000 people. The Security Council had  voted for an embargo on arms sales to Bosnia-Herzegovina yet  does not know how to protect it. We are asking ourselves why  the chetnik offensive on Gorazde -- which has been going on for  more than two weeks now -- was not checked by air strikes as  prescribed by Resolutions 824 and 836. What was done was done in  such a way to in fact encourage those beasts up there on those  hills, they were encouraged more than impressed after losing one  or two tanks. We have fighters who destroyed 10 or 12 tanks  each. Therefore, neither were our fighters impressed nor those  beasts. All that was to no avail.    Unfortunately, the situation is such that UN Envoy Yasushi  Akashi is expected to arrive any moment from Pale. I really do  not know why he went there -- everything is clear. What more do  they have to do to be treated the way they should be treated --  as beasts and not as some side in the conflict. They killed  200,000 innocent people, they destroyed a country, they violated  every human law imaginable -- not only UN laws but human laws --  what else should they do? They attacked UNPROFOR, they attacked  them in Tuzla. After their generals said they would collect  children in coffins, what else are they supposed to do so  someone would react? Unfortunately, I must tell you that I  received a letter from Mr. Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary,  in which -- believe it or not -- he calls on the sides in Bosnia  to refrain from any actions. I have this letter here in my  pocket. He is in fact calling on us to refrain from any kind of  action. And this at a moment when Gorazde is bleeding, when  Brcko is bleeding, when Bihac is bleeding. Incredible but true  -- our people should know who we are dealing with. [end  recording]</p>

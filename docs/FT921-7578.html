			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / MEPs to debate row over Irish abortion THE EUROPEAN Parliament's legal affairs committee is to debate the Irish court decision to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim having an abortion in the UK, as pressure grows for the ban to be challenged under EC law. Mr Willy Rothley, German Socialist MEP and vice-chairman of the committee, described the ban - which has reopened the fierce debate on abortion in Ireland - as 'an act of barbarism'. The legal affairs committee will discuss the ruling next week to find out whether it can be overturned by the European Court of Justice. The girl's parents yesterday appealed to the Irish Supreme Court against the ban. A hearing is likely next week. MEPs are concerned that the judgment might contravene EC treaty obligations on the free movement of people and services in the Community. 'The free movement of citizens is a fundamental principle of the Community and must be safeguarded,' said Mr Rothley yesterday. The Irish High Court said in its ruling that the treaty obligations could be overruled in this case because of 'public policy' considerations. A spokesman for the European Commission said yesterday that the case did not appear to fall under EC jurisdiction, but added that the Commission was awaiting a definitive legal opinion. Concerns have also been voiced that Irish liberals may vote against ratification of the Maastricht treaty on political and economic union. The text includes a special protocol promising that EC law will not affect the application of Ireland's constitutional 'right-to-life' amendment.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Fullemploy training group collapses FULLEMPLOY, Britain's only national training organisation for ethnic minorities, has gone into liquidation after a long struggle for additional funds. Buchler Phillips, the financial consultants, have been appointed liquidators and will hold meetings with creditors in the next fortnight. The collapse which will embarrass the government, was caused mainly by a decision by the Home Office last year to withhold its Pounds 250,000 annual grant following an investigation by the Charity Commissioners into unsuccessful Fullemploy expansion schemes. Ethnic-minority unemployment remains higher than in the majority community, and the charity's efforts to tackle the problem have been supported by many leading organisations in the private and public sectors. Mr David Buchler, a partner in Buchler Phillips, said last night that Fullemploy would continue in business to allow time for talks with potential purchasers. Grand Metropolitan Community Services Trust has offered to indemnify him against trading losses during the next few weeks. A total of Pounds 446,000 has been raised recently from the private sector through cash, loans written off and new guarantees. This came from a group of leading companies and organisations including the Bank of England, BP, International Business Machines, Prudential, Marks and Spencer, Commercial Union, Boots, Lloyds Bank, WH Smith and Rosehaugh. These funds will now be returned.</p>

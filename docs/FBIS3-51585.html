			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enelcys Rodriguez Calderon] </F>   [Text] The fact that the United States is announcing the  name of the candidate it will support for OAS secretary general  so far in advance is significant, because it shows that the  North Americans' view of the OAS is somewhat different from the  way Latin American countries visualize it.    This was surmised from remarks by Deputy Foreign Minister  Fernando Gerbasi, who, during talks with EL GLOBO, has said this  is the first time the United States has disclosed the name of  the candidate for the OAS position.    According to Gerbasi, the North Americans "are looking at an  OAS that is economy-oriented with emphasis on the idea of a free  market, and thus they think integration can be thoroughly  achieved through it."    He feels this stand is respectable, "but it undermines the  importance and significance of the OAS, an organization that  should have its own political criteria, because any group of  governments cannot hope to become something technical or have a  partial vision of society. Society must be viewed as a whole,  because, basically, any action within a society is a political  action."    Asked about the importance of support of the United States,  as a world power, to determine the victory of the new secretary  general, Garbasi has said: "We are not in a bipolar world, but  it is not a unipolar world either. Perhaps this is true in the  military but not in the political or economic spheres."</p>

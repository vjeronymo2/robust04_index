			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei slips amid turmoil as fiscal package delayed Investors were inactive as the turmoil within the coalition government over the economic fiscal package, including the tax changes, blocked its scheduled announcement, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 75.21 at 20,174.82 as caution prevailed, due to the prolonged negotiations within the coalition. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 14.93 to 1,612.73. The 225-issue Nikkei fluctuated between 20,433.04 and 19,935.19. It was higher in the morning, with overseas investors and arbitrageurs encouraged by Wednesday's rise in the Nikkei futures contract in Chicago; but profit-taking by domestic corporations and financial institutions held sway later, even though some investors, looking to increase their exposure, sought bargains at lower levels. Social Democratic Party opposition to the increase in sales taxes, designed to finance an income tax cut, prevented the announcement of the economic support package. The SDP threatened to pull out of the coalition if Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, pushed forward with the Finance Ministry's plan. Traders said a compromise was expected, as in earlier political issues such as rice and political reform, and that the effects of the political infighting were limited. Volume totalled 550m shares, against 669m. A bulk of the activity consisted of cross trading, or selling and buying back of long term holdings to realise profits. Declines led gains by 808 to 257, with 123 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.39 firmer at 1,333.66. Profit-taking by corporate investors hurt banks, Industrial Bank of Japan retreating Y110 to Y3,200. Brokers were also lower, with Nomura Securities down Y10 to Y2,320. Honda Motor continued to lose ground due to the lingering effects of the BMW/Rover deal, dropping Y90 to Y1,530; but Nissan Motor, the most active issue of the day, rose Y14 to Y855 on foreign buying. High-tech issues were easier on the higher yen. Fujitsu receded Y20 to Y1,020 and NEC Y20 to Y1,040. In Osaka, the OSE average shed 246.13 to 21,711.81 in volume of 134.1m shares. Ono Pharmaceutical fell Y110 to Y5,190 on profit-taking. Roundup The region remained active yesterday, with foreign buying evident in several markets. AUSTRALIA rose on overseas buying of major issues and strength in News Corp, up 52 cents at ADollars 10.56, after the group reported a bigger than expected increase in interim profits. The All Ordinaries index climbed 28.5 to a record 2,340.6 in turnover of ADollars 972.5m. BHP finished 28 cents stronger at ADollars 19.50, but off an intraday high of ADollars 19.60. HONG KONG posted moderate net gains after profit-taking brought prices down from their best levels. The Hang Seng index was finally ahead 65.30 at 11,851.13 after reaching 11,947.28. HSBC Holdings forged ahead HKDollars 4, or 3.3 per cent, to HKDollars 124 as investors were encouraged by the strong results of the group's US and Australian units. MANILA continued to advance, encouraged by news that GNP grew by 2.3 per cent in 1993, although some profit-taking trimmed the day's best levels as investors remained cautious after this week's bombings and street protests over fuel price increases. The composite index put on 16.85 at 2,922.99. Manila Electric 'B' led gains, adding 15 pesos at 445 pesos, and PLDT firmed 10 pesos to 2,140 pesos. SINGAPORE was boosted by selective institutional buying, taking the Straits Times Industrial index 22.45 higher to 2,360.53. F&amp;N, which bottles Coca-Cola, rose SDollars 1.10 to SDollars 18.70 on hopes that Vietnamese trading agreements signed last year might go ahead on expectations that the US will lift a trade embargo with that country. KUALA LUMPUR closed off highs on profit-taking which left the composite index 2.17 ahead at 1,150.21, after a day's peak of 1,158.13. Construction and Supplies House surged MDollars 2.85, or 52 per cent, to MDollars 8.35 in heavy volume after the company announced a MDollars 900m timber deal. KARACHI was propelled higher by blue chips, which posted gains ahead of the Friday-Saturday weekend. The KSE 100-share index moved forward 36.40 to 2,290.42. TAIWAN was lifted by financial stocks, which were actively traded in the last half-hour of the session. The weighted index rose 102.87 to 6,362.08 in turnover of TDollars 122.9bn, its highest level in nearly a month. NEW ZEALAND overcame weakness at the opening to close 20.96 points higher in the NZSE-40 capital index at 2,439.64. Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey, in the forestry sector, both gained 8 cents at NZDollars 3.71 and NZDollars 4.16. BOMBAY recovered some of its earlier losses in kerb deals before prices again fell after a special court ordered firms not to accept for transfer shares linked to the Mehtra securities scandal. The BSE 30-share index shed 35.68 to 4,000.96.</p>

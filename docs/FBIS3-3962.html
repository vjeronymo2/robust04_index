			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>   [Text] Beijing, March 23 (AFP)--An official report has  painted an alarming picture of the social challenges facing the  government this year, warning of a potentially explosive mix of  inflation, unrest in the fields and factories, and ethnic  discord. "The authorities are going to have to face very  serious social tests," the 300-page report by the Chinese  Academy of Social Sciences, acquired by AFP, says. The document  starkly illustrates the worries exercising the communist  leadership as it grapples with ambitious reforms to transform  the economy.    President Jiang Zemin rammed home the dual message on  Tuesday, instructing officials to "protect reforms while  preserving stability" in everything they do.    The report, entitled "The Social Situation in China, 1993-4:  Analyses and Forecasts," looks back on a year of growing  fragility in Chinese society, as it struggled to cope with  double-digit economic growth.    It confirmed independent reports of unrest in  Moslem-minority  regions in western China, the scenes of "the bloodiest unrest"  in the country in 1993. In May, riots broke out in Kashgar, in  the autonomous region of Xinjiang, where "separatists carried  out terrorist acts, causing explosions, and put up reactionary  posters," it said. In late August and early September,  "hundreds of thousands of Muslims demonstrated" in western  China, the academics said.    On the industrial front, "strikes and demonstrations  increased," it said, disclosing that there had been 30 "serious  incidents" at plants in the eastern city of Ningbo in May alone.    As for the cause of the discontent, the report pinned the  blame on the strains experienced by state firms as they  struggled with the adjustment to capitalist economics. "More  and more workers cannot have a normal live because of the  financial difficulties of state firms," it said, estimating that  seven million working-class families were living in hardship,  equal to around 20 million people in all.    Turning to 1994, the Academy said that inflation --  currently  running at around 20 percent in the cities -- was "already more  than alarming. Elements of social instability will increase  further as economic reforms deepen," it predicted. "The  possibility of serious unrest in regions experiencing economic  difficulties cannot be ruled out," the report said, predicting  an ever-widening rift between the rich eastern coastal provinces  and the backward regions of the west.    Factories would experience greater tension, as there is  bound  to be "more unemployed workers, strikes and violence against  plant officials." The document added that "friction is  inevitable" between the central government and the regional  authorities, which would fuel regionalism. A Chinese think-tank  last year also cited this as a potential cause of a breakup  after the death of 89-year-old leader Deng Xiaoping.    "Numerous acts of sabotage by hostile forces, inside and  outside the country" could be feared, the report said, making an  implicit reference to Islamic fundamentalists and Tibetans.    Crime, which surged last year, would continue to rise.    It called on the government to apply "social measures as  well  as economic reforms" not only by attacking basic problems but  also by stepping up police efficiency and the campaign against  corruption.    But it notably also made a public call on the country's top  leaders to show greater transparency in their lifestyle and also  to "listen to public opinion."</p>

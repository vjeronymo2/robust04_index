			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DOWNZONING FEVER RISES IN SAN PEDRO;  </P> <P> INCREASED APARTMENT CONSTRUCTION CONCERNS 2 GROUPS OF RESIDENTS  </P> <P> It was billed as a "town meeting" -- an open forum for the residents of San  Pedro -- and it was held on a sunny Saturday afternoon when most people might  be otherwise occupied. Shanaz Ardehali-Kordich, the anti-growth activist who  planned the event, feared turnout would be low.  </P> <P> She was clearly wrong.  </P> <P> Nearly 400 residents packed the Peck Park auditorium March 18 to discuss what  has become the hottest issue in San Pedro: downzoning.  </P> <P> Nearly 10 years after ethnically diverse San Pedro became the first community  in Los Angeles to place strict curbs on its potential growth, many residents  are saying they did not go far enough.  </P> <P> Residents complain that shoe box-shaped apartments are scarring the  single-family complexion of their seaside community. And the debate is taking  on intensely emotional tones as people argue about how best to preserve the  community for their children and their children's children.  </P> <P> "This is like the last undeveloped beach city," said Ardehali-Kordich,  chairwoman of the San Pedro Downzoning Committee, a grass-roots group that  advocates a ban on all apartment construction, with the exception of duplexes.  "We have to save it."  </P> <P> The debate, however, will not be one-sided.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cost Concerns  </P> <P> Some builders and business people argue that a ban on new apartment  construction would cause rents and home prices to skyrocket in San Pedro, which  is already becoming unaffordable for people who grew up there.  </P> <P> "This is going to be a very emotional issue," said Leron Gubler, executive  director of the San Pedro Peninsula Chamber of Commerce. "People do not want to  lose the character and flavor of the community. The question is, 'How do we  achieve that?' "  </P> <P> Gubler noted that banning apartments could squeeze low-income people out of San  Pedro. In an interview, he predicted opposition to downzoning on the part of  some "old San Pedro families" who bought property with the intent of building  apartments to provide retirement income.  </P> <P> A member of one such family is real estate agent Bob Bradarich, who said his  in-laws have property they had intended to develop. Bradarich said he is  against blanket downzoning, saying he believes there are some parts of San  Pedro where growth should be curtailed and others where it should be allowed.  </P> <P> "It's my opinion," he said in an interview, "that these people that are  adamantly wanting the downzoning are not really thinking in the best interests  of the community. . . . There's going to be another 20,000 people in San Pedro  in the next 10 years, and this is not going to accomplish what these people  want."  </P> <P> Last week, a 25-member citizens committee, appointed by Los Angeles  Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, began what promises to be a lengthy examination  of the zoning laws that govern development in San Pedro. Ardehali-Kordich,  Gubler and Bradarich all were named to the committee, which is to make  recommendations for change to Flores.  </P> <P> The committee is limited to San Pedro residents, and it is weighted more  heavily toward neighborhood representatives than business people. Only 10 of  the 25 members do business in San Pedro and none are developers. The chairman,  Noah Modisett, is president of the San Pedro &amp; Peninsula Homeowners  Coalition, while the vice chairman, Bill Lusby, is a local architect.  </P> <P> The committee's first order of business will likely be whether to recommend an  "interim control ordinance" -- a temporary measure that would forestall new  developments while the panel conducts its review.  </P> <P> Flores said she limited the committee to residents because she wanted its  recommendations to reflect a vested interest in San Pedro, and excluded  developers because she feels it is difficult to "look at this unselfishly when  all of your future earnings are tied up with the decisions that are being  made."  </P> <P> She said some developers were appointed to -- but eventually quit -- the  committee that drew up the current San Pedro Community Plan. That plan, adopted  in 1980 by the Los Angeles City Council, cut San Pedro's potential growth from  a maximum population of 240,000 to 103,000. The community has about 70,000  residents now.  </P> <P> Anti-growth activists say that one of the problems with the current plan, and  the zoning that goes along with it, is that it allows apartments to be built in  single-family neighborhoods under the RD1.5 zone.  </P> <P> RD1.5 permits one apartment for every 1,500 square feet of lot. On a standard  5,000-square-foot lot, three apartments are allowed. Developers have taken  advantage of that zone to tear down single-family homes and replace them with  apartments.  </P> <P> In addition, the RD1.5 zone allows developers to string lots together to  squeeze in more apartments. Other zones -- such as R2, which permits duplexes  -- do not allow developers to put lots together for bigger projects.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of apprehension right now about the RD1.5 loophole," said Jerry  Gaines, a member of Flores' committee. "There's a lot of emotion right now, and  it comes from example after example of old houses being removed quickly,  overnight, and large boxes being put in their place."  </P> <P> Flores asked the committee, which has no timetable to meet, to study the RD1.5  matter and also to consider such issues as parking, landscaping and views when  they look at the zoning code.  </P> <P> The committee also is expected to look at apartment development along Pacific  Avenue, which once was San Pedro's main commercial thoroughfare but has  declined in recent years with the rise of business activities on Gaffey Street  and Western Avenue.  </P> <P> At the committee's first meeting Thursday, Flores urged the panel to be open to  compromise and to come up with "creative, pointed" solutions.  </P> <P> The councilwoman also marveled at the changes in San Pedro since the current  plan was adopted. Many said then that the new development blueprint would hurt  San Pedro's economy by scaring builders away.  </P> <P> "It was revolutionary," Flores said. "At that time, people thought it was so  restrictive that it would never work. Who would have suspected that, eight  years later, that plan would be out of date?"  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Spies Have Gotten To Like Nizhniy"] </F>   [Text] Western special services are continuing to display  a special interest in Nizhniy Novgorod, which in the past was  one of the most tightly closed of Soviet cities. In 1993 alone,  according to the information of the Federal Counterintelligence  Service Directorate for Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, 37 trained  spies were discovered among the numerous guests from abroad who  regularly came to the "cradle" of Russian capitalism, as well as  125 people involved in the special services. The  "cloak-and-dagger knights" are attracted to military-industrial  complex installations, research by scientists, and the leaders  of political parties. But the most important thing is the  Arzamas-16 Federal Nuclear Center.</p>

The new objectives for  these two steps were recently stated by the Northeast Electric  Power Group's director general Huang Jinkai [7806 6855 0418]  during a meeting with reporters.    The Northeast China Electric Power Group will build 10 power  plants distributed through the Heilongjiang coal-fired power  base, the Eastern Nei Monggol coal-fired power base, and the  railroad center and port power bases in Liaoning and Jilin,  giving these three areas newly installed capacities of 12  million, 36 million, and 17 million kW, respectively. In  addition, it will use the water resources of the region to build  large and medium-size hydroelectric stations, including the  Songjiang River cascade and the Lianhua power plant, and will  carry on vigorous, safe development of the hydropower resources  of the main channel of the Heilongjiang River, which forms the  Sino-Russian border. This extraordinary scale of electric power  construction will also include nuclear power plants with  capacities of 10 and 8 million kW and a pumped-storage power  plant. In addition, extensive refitting of existing  high-coal-consumption older generator sets will be carried out,  and as an adjunct to electric power construction, a 500-kV power  grid covering the entire region will be built.    Huang Jinkai stated that in order to carry out the above  conceptions, the Northeast China Electric Power Group will  follow the general principles of "a world orientation, extensive  cooperation, mutual benefit, and joint development," and will  engage in various types of economic and technical cooperation  and exchange with domestic and foreign friends in an extensive  range of activities in order to expand the influx of funds,  technology, equipment, and management experience into China and  to strengthen its electric power capabilities.    The Northeast China Electric Power Group, an electric power  consortium, has a fixed capital of 26.7 billion yuan; its  subordinate organizations include the Jilin Province Electric  Power Corporation, the Heilongjiang Province Electric Power  Corporation, 48 generating plants and 33 power delivery  companies. At the end of 1992, the total installed power  generating capacity in the Northeast China power grid, which the  group operates, was 25 million kW.  <H5>  North China Electric Power Corporation </H5>   By the year 2000, it is expected that the North China region  will need an output of between 251 and 278 billion kWh of  electricity each year, which presupposes an installed generating  capacity of between 45 and 50 million kW. To meet this need, the  North China Electric Power Group has decided to add to its  existing 25 million kW of capacity an additional 17 fossil-fired  plants with a combined capacity of 35.5 million kW, several  hydroelectric plants with a combined capacity of up to 1.08  million kW, and a pumped-storage power plant with a generating  capacity of 1.4 million kW.    This grand program was revealed at a recent meeting by the  North China Electric Power Group's director general Jiao Yian  [3542 2011 1344]. In the near term the North China Electric  Power Group plans to carry out construction projects  representing a total of more than 600,000 kW of capacity,  including: stage 2 of the Shalingzi power plant, stage 2 of the  Ji Xian power plant, the Dou He No 2 power plant, and the Handan  power plant in Hebei; stage 2 of the Datong No 2 power plant in  Shanxi; and the Daqi and Daihai power plants in Nei Monggol.    Jiao Yian stated that North China's electric power industry  still falls somewhat short of the world state of the art in its  technical and management standards and that in order to  implement its grand development objectives, it will have to  engage in extensive mutually beneficial economic and technical  cooperation with many organizations in China and abroad. As a  consequence, the North China Electric Power Group will  enthusiastically welcome domestic and foreign friends who wish  to build power plants in the North China region on a  single-proprietorship basis or to initiate power industry  development with sharing of benefits on a joint-capital or  cooperative basis or by providing loans; the group will also  engage in cooperation and exchange in the technical sphere and  in various types of technological and labor cooperation on  various projects abroad.    The North China Electric Power Group is one of the five  large  electric power groups that were created in China at the  beginning of 1993. It is a large enterprise consortium that  unites electric power production, design, construction,  adjustment and testing, equipment manufacture and repair,  research, and education and training organizations, along with  diversified organizations. It has 250,000 employees, 63 power  plants, 4 site surveying and design institutes, 19 electric  power construction companies, 5 electric power research  organizations, 11 electric power equipment manufacturing or  repair enterprises, and 12 schools of various types. The North  China Power Grid, which it operates, supplies electric power to  Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, and Nei Monggol, covering a  total area of 1.47 million square kilometers and serving 120  million persons.  <H5>  Central China Power Corporation </H5>   In the wake of the world-renowned Three Gorges project,  during the next seven years the Central China power system will  also build close to 10 hydroelectric power stations and more  than 30 other generating plants in Hubei, Henan, Hunan and  Jiangxi, so that by the end of the century the system's  installed capacity will have doubled to about 50 million kW.    This prospect was revealed by Liu Jinlong [0491 6855 7893],  director general of the Central China Electric Power Group,  during a recent interview in Beijing.    The Central China Electric Power Group, a large consortium  composed of more than 180 power generation, power delivery,  construction, equipment manufacture and repair, design,  research, and educational organizations in Hubei, Henan, Hunan  and Jiangxi, operates the Central China electric power grid,  which supplies electric power to these four provinces; its  coverage is 730,000 square kilometers. By the end of 1992, the  system's total installed capacity was 24 million kW, and the  annual output of electricity reached 113.5 million kWh.    In order to achieve these goals by the year 2000, Liu  Jinlong  stated that the Central China Electric Power Group will warmly  welcome friends in all fields, both from China and from abroad,  who wish to invest in the Central China region or to engage in  technical and economic cooperation.    In addition, a nuclear power plant program for the region  covering the period through 2020 was announced at a recent  Central China power system long-range planning meeting.    According to the development program for the entire Central  China power system, nuclear power development will begin in  Jiangxi before the year 2000 and a 1.2-million-kW nuclear power  plant will be built by 2010. Subsequently, two 3-million-kW  nuclear power plants will be built in Jiangxi and Hunan by 2020.  The installed nuclear power generating capacity in the Central  China system will then be 7.2 million kW; but this figure will  still represent less than 5 percent of the total generating  capacity in the grid.    The Central China power system, one of China's major power  systems, covers the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Henan, and  Jiangxi, with a total area of 730 million square kilometers. Its  current generating capacity is 25.45 million kW and its annual  output of electricity is 116.1 billion kWh.</p>

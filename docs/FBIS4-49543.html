			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (AFP)--Chinese police arrested three  more dissidents in Shanghai last week, including a painter, Lin  Muchen, who was about to board a plane for the United States, a  spokesman said.    Yang Zhou, who is spokesman of the Chinese Association for  Human Rights, said Lin was detained at the airport on Friday.    "We understand that he was stopped by border police as he  was  about to board a flight to Seoul, where he was going to change  planes for the U.S.," a spokeswoman at the U.S. consulate in  Shanghai said. "He had been issued with a student visa for the  U.S."    The other two were Li Guotao, the association's president,  who was detained on May 2, and Dai Xuezhong, another association  member, who was arrested the following day. The association's  secretary-general, Wang Fucheng, has been in custody since April  14.    The detentions come in the runup to the fifth anniversary of  the Tiananmen Square killings, when the People's Liberation Army  crushed a pro-democracy movement in the heart of Beijing in  1989. "The June 4 commemoration is approaching, and (Chinese  leader) Deng Xiaoping is in poor health," Yang said. "Party  conservatives want to show that they have the situation under  control." Several dissidents have been told to quit Shanghai by  the end of May, diplomats there added.    In another development, Yan Huili, the wife of the  well-known  Shanghai dissident Zhang Xianliang, who was sentenced last  August to three years' labour in a re-education camp, said she  had been unable to visit her husband for three months.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Decision denies chance to pioneer superhighways Sir, The government's announcement that it will not lift the ban on BT and allow it to broadcast entertainment services to homes on a national basis is an unwelcome and inopportune decision at a time when the UK's European and international competitors are surging ahead in the telecommunications revolution ('Government offers telecoms groups wider superhighway role', November 23). What this means for the country and economy is that we will fall behind the world leaders in the development of a superhighway, and our citizens will be denied the tremendous opportunities which would be the immediate spin-off from a superhighway. The government has given a clear and concise No to BT's and Mercury's establishment of an information superhighway before at least 2001. Whereas BT and Mercury can compete in European markets they are prevented from doing so in the UK. Not only that, but they are also denied the certainty of knowing when they will be able to enter the market here. What was hoped for from the government was a clear indication as to when BT and Mercury would be able to start their promised Pounds 15bn investment. To wait until 2001 provides them with no incentive whatsoever to take up the offer of servicing areas not yet bid for by the cable companies. All the government has succeeded in doing is to ensure that Britain essentially leaves the race and comes in only when the rest of the world has developed fully and is on to the next revolution. We will still be trying to catch up and be falling behind in new developments and technologies. The economy suffers and the people suffer. The government has denied to the UK the opportunity to pioneer new development for the good of the ordinary citizen. Graham Allen, shadow spokesperson on media and superhighways, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

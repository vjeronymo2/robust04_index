			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of European finance and investment, Overview (6): Vision of a grand strategy fades - Talk about a single stock market continues, but .. A YEAR ago, the European Community's stock exchanges were at each others' throats in a thinly disguised squabble over whether or not to co-operate on developing a single European stock market. That venture - known as Euroquote  -came to nothing, just as a similar project had been scrapped several years before. This year, the diplomats of the Euro-financial world are going about things rather differently. There have been no grand visionary pronouncements about the shape of the European market to come, and no public tiffs. But the talking is going on just the same. Three things are different this time around. The first results from the fall-out over the Euroquote debacle. This established that there was no point in the various exchanges getting together to build a new price-dissemination system for Europe when plenty of existing systems could either already do the job, or be developed to do it. Re-inventing the wheel was not something that the UK and Germany, in particular, wanted to do. As a result, discussions are unlikely to return to the subject of how to build a common market infrastructure - at least not until there is agreement on what the common market should be. That gives any discussions that take place a more sensible grounding. The second change has been an apparent cooling of hostilities over the EC's proposed Investment Services Directive. Initially conceived as a step to give non-bank investment firms a 'single passport' to operate across the Community, the ISD had dissolved by last year into a fight over rival market structures. One side was driven by the belief that investors are best protected if trading is centralised on to national exchanges, and trade publication rules tightened: the other, by the view that free-wheeling, cross-border professional markets (such as that for Eurobonds) thrive if left to take care of themselves. That ideological divide (some say it was fuelled by competitive pressures) now seems less stark than it did. This is partly because cultural differences between national investment practices are being eroded. For instance, many continental stockbrokers are looking forward to the time when they have home-grown pension funds similar to those in the UK or US. As investment patterns converge, regulations and market structure will follow. Another reason is that competition is driving market practice closer, as national markets copy and (where possible) improve upon the most successful practices of other European centres. Take France, which has officially been in the vanguard of the fight to re-regulate markets: its stockbrokers have recently been agitating for greater deregulation. already has a thriving deregulated international share market, conducted by telephone in London and supported by the SEAQ International price quotation system. Its success seems to indicate that, whatever the regulators rule, there will always be a demand for a professional market relatively free of externally-imposed regulations. If the EC outlaws it, then financial centres such as London say the market will simply move offshore and the EC will be the loser. The future of the Investment Services Directive has yet to be resolved. But the forces at work behind the scenes suggest that tensions over this issue could gradually ease. The third change lying behind this year's discussions between European exchanges is the fact that individual national markets in the EC have moved ahead with their own market reforms. These have taken two broad forms: deregulation and automation. Germany, for instance, has achieved some modest success with its new version of the Ibis screen-based dealing system. As more business is done on Ibis, so more banks are prepared to use it. One leading London house reports that it now does around a quarter of its German share business on Ibis, compared with 10 per cent a year ago. That reduces the need for Seaq International. The more developed continental markets become, the more willing their national market authorities will be to discuss co-operation. This is because, until now, their relative lack of development has left them feeling vulnerable to London: none has felt confident negotiating from a position of weakness. Discussions about co-operation between national exchanges are already under way on a number of fronts. Work is in train to bring national listings requirements closer together to make it easier for companies to be listed across European markets, for instance. The national markets already pool statistics. These developments could be the low-key forerunner to further co-operation. As Mr Rudiger von Rosen, vice-chairman of the Federation of German Stock Exchanges, says: 'They might not look as spectacular as Euroquote, but everyone is glad they are going ahead.' Reviving Euroquote is 'definitely not a topic that will come up in 1992', he adds. But if market participants demand extra services, the exchanges say they are ready and willing to act. That could happen either through bilateral arrangements (such as the sharing of prices, which already happens between Paris and Frankfurt) or multilaterally, says Mr von Rosen. Demand from investors and European companies may yet bring the exchanges back to the table to discuss a grander strategy. At present, though, it has yet to happen.  ------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL STOCK MARKET COMPARISONS: turnover 1991 (Pounds m)  ------------------------------------------------------- Exchange                   Jan-Sep  ------------------------------------------------------- Amsterdam*                  17,083 Athens*                      1,206 Brussels                     3,143 Copenhagen                   4,513 Dublin*                      1,203 Fed German exchanges*      181,181 Lisbon                         476 London*                    244,441 Luxembourg                      82 Madrid                      17,517 Milan                       12,253 Paris                       48,063  ------------------------------------------------------- * Turnover has been halved for comparison purposes  ------------------------------------------------------- Source: Federation of EC Stock Exchanges  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Credit data signal patchy recovery Gillian Tett, Economics Staff The patchy nature of the recovery in consumer sentiment in the aftermath of April's tax increases was highlighted yesterday. New credit data showed lending in the retail and new-car loans sector weaker than expected in July, while home loans fell sharply compared with a year ago. Lending in finance houses remained relatively strong, suggesting that consumers took advantage of heavy discounting in the summer sales. The report, by Infolink, the independent credit group, shows credit in the retail sector 6.7 per cent higher in July than in July last year. This annual growth rate was lower than in June, when lending was 13.1 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. Infolink said yesterday that some of this fall might reflect high street sales, which might have encouraged consumers to use cash rather than credit for smaller items. Lending by the finance house sector - which covers 'in-store' credit schemes for the purchase of expensive goods such as like televisions - performed well in the month. Lending in this sector was 18.1 per cent higher - the biggest annual growth rate seen in this sector this year, Infolink said. A fall in the annual growth rate of new-car loans suggested that consumer confidence might be faltering in other sectors. Lending in the new-car loans sector was 3.8 per cent higher in July, compared with the same period a year ago. In June annual growth was 7.5 per cent. Lending in the home-loans sector, which represents specialist home-loan companies and centralised lenders, was 14 per cent lower than in the same period last year.</p>

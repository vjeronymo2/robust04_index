			<p>BFN     [Text] Lhasa, May 18 (XINHUA) -- The goal of the central  government's substantial investment in the Tibet autonomous  region over the past 40 years has been to lay a solid economic  foundation and accumulate more strength for Tibet's future  development, a senior Tibetan official said here today.    In an exclusive interview with XINHUA, Gyaincain Norbu,  chairman of the regional people's government, said the state  financial input is aimed at developing land resources instead of  merely providing financial assistance to an underdeveloped area.    He admitted that Tibet is the most economically  underdeveloped region in China. However, he said, the central  government and people all across the country have shown special  concern and support for Tibet.    The central government has stipulated a series of  preferential policies towards Tibet and earmarked an enormous  amount of money to help Tibet step up its economic development.    In return, people of various nationalities in Tibet have  also  made great contributions toward safeguarding and building up  this remote southwestern part of the country.    According to Gyaincain Norbu, who was elected chairman in  1990, the central government has invested some 20 billion yuan  (2.3 billion U.S. dollars) in Tibet over the past 40 years.  This has helped the region achieve sustained economic growth,  national unity, and social progress.    In 1993, Tibet produced 3.65 billion yuan (400 million U.S.  dollars) in GNP, an increase of 8.1 percent over the previous  year. The region registered fast development in agriculture,  animal husbandry, industry, infrastructure construction and  foreign trade.    Gyaincain Norbu has stressed the importance of reform and  social stability. "Tibet has no way out without further reforms  or establishment of a socialist market economy," he said, adding  that this is the key topic at the current session of the  regional people's congress.    He said Tibet's development depends on agriculture and  animal  husbandry, and the broad efforts of farmers and herdsmen. Only  by developing these sectors and increasing the income of farmers  and herdsmen, which make up 80 percent of Tibet's population,  can reform, development and stability be guaranteed.    The regional government will carry out the contract  responsibility system, which enables farmers to make their own  decisions in farm production and develop a diversified economy  as well as township industries.    Over the past few years, Tibet has invested over one billion  yuan (110 million U.S. dollars) to carry out comprehensive  agriculture development projects in the region's major valleys,  such as the Yarlung Zangbo, Lhasa and Nianchu river valleys so  as to build these areas into the region's bread baskets.    The regional people's government has also planned a number  of  new construction projects, among which infrastructure will be  the top priority. Hydroelectricity is the region's major power  source and it has great potential for geothermal, solar and wind  power development. Tibet is busy building such key construction  projects as the Yamzhog Yumco power station and is renovating  highways from Qinghai to Tibet and from Sichuan to Tibet, as  well as the Bangda airport, he said.</p>

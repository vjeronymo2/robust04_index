			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Japanese wages rise kept at lowest for 34 years JAPAN'S image as a high-wage society received a dent yesterday with publication of an official 1.9 per cent rise in average private sector wages for last year, the lowest growth rate in 34 years. Some companies might even have to cut wages next year to ensure full employment if the downturn continues into the tax period starting April 1994, warned Mr Takeshi Nagano, the chairman of the Nikk-eiren employers' federation. One leading car group has been reported to be considering a cut in bonuses, while holidays on low pay are said to be under study in the electronics and steel industries. The companies involved have not confirmed their plans. In real terms, disposable income for the average family of four rose by a mere 0.1 per cent, the smallest increase since 1982, when average income stagnated, according to the wage report, by the national tax administration agency. Last year's average private sector annual wage was Y4.55m (Pounds 28,400) before tax, said the agency. Last year's 1.9 per cent average wage rise compares with 5 per cent in the previous year and is the third smallest since the records started in 1949. Mr Nagano called for a Y10,000bn income tax cut by the end of this year to stimulate the economy. It had until yesterday been asking for a Y2,000bn tax cut.</p>

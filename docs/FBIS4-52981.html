			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- The Japanese authorities  are under the legal obligations to fully ensure the activities  of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan  (Chongnyon) and the democratic national rights of Koreans in  Japan, stresses NODONG SINMUN today.    A by-lined article of the paper says:    It is a principled requirement of international law and  usage  that overseas citizens of a sovereign state lead a free life,  enjoying legal protection and treatment as foreigners under the  protection of their motherland, wherever they may reside.    The Japanese authorities must provide the Koreans in Japan  with all lawful rights and treatment as foreigners and fully  ensure their human rights in accordance with the publicly  accepted principles of international law and usage.    The Japanese authorities are also under historical and moral  obligations to fully ensure the activities of Chongnyon and the  democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan.    They must properly repent of and apologize for the crimes  committed by Japanese imperialism against history and they must  know that they are under the heavy obligation to ensure the  democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan in order to atone  for the crimes.    The Japanese authorities must provide them with all rights  including the right to learn, work and lead a dignified life and  the freedom of political activity, speech, the press,  association, assembly and demonstration in Japan.    The Japanese authorities must fully guarantee the human  rights of Koreans in Japan to respect at least the basic spirit  of the world declaration on human rights and the international  statutes of human rights they signed and to abide by the  "principle of equality between natives and foreigners" to which  they are committed.    We who regard the dignity of the country and the nation as  our life and soul will sternly counter any persecution and  repression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, considering them  to be an infringement on the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK.    The Japanese authorities must immediately stop and apologize  for their hostile policy toward the DPRK and the anti-Chongnyon  campaign, mindful of grave consequences arising from their  reckless action, and must take responsible measures lest  repression of Chongnyon and violations of human rights of  Koreans in Japan should recur.</p>

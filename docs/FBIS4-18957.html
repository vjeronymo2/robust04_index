			<p>BFN     [Text] Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho has described his  visit to China as extraordinarily successful. Aho, who returned  home this afternoon, said before leaving Beijing that Finland  and China had a good chance to increase their cooperation,  particularly in the forestry industry, in the energy sector, and  in environmental protection. Aho said that during the visit  Finland did not want to make an issue of China's human rights  policy.    [Begin Aho recording] These individual cases, which have  received quite extensive publicity, were not raised in the talks  we conducted, and it has not been part of our tradition to  discuss them in political talks either. We concentrated on a  more general level on discussing human rights and political  rights and voiced our views on that. In other words, this issue  was not discussed.    Our basic attitude to human rights issues is similar to that  of France and other West European countries. Our attitude to  human rights issues is, in principle, similar, but it must be  admitted that there have been and are differences in the  approach between Finland and many West European countries. [end  recording]    The high-level visits between Finland and China will resume  as early as this spring. Chairman of the Chinese People's  Congress Li Ruihuan [title as heard] will pay a visit to Finland  in May.</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Base metals prices extend rally  -Market report Base metals prices continued last week's rally at the London Metal Exchange yesterday before settling back under pressure from profit-taking. As speculative activity remained predominant the three months COPPER price hit a four-month high of Dollars 1,860 a tonne at one point and finished at Dollars 1,845, still up Dollars 19 from Friday's kerb close. In the ALUMINIUM market traders jockeyed for position ahead of today's crucial multilateral talks in Brussels on curbing the present glut. The three months price hit a 5 1/2 -month high of Dollars 1,231 a tonne as talk circulated that other producers might follow the output cut announced by Alcan of Canada last Thursday. But the price sagged to end the kerb session at Dollars 1,215.50 a tonne, up Dollars 10.50 from Friday. Among the other metals NICKEL prices hit 8 1/2 -month highs but failed to break resistance at Dollars 6,000 a tonne and the LEAD market proved unable to extend its gains beyond the 14 1/2 -month highs seen in the morning. ZINC absorbed a bout of profit-taking to finish Dollars 8 up at Dollars 1,033 a tonne in the three months position. At the London bullion market SILVER continued to set the pace with an early rise to a 5-month high of 534 cents a troy ounce. It edged back to close 13 cents up on balance at 531.5 cents. London's cocoa and coffee futures markets both ended the day quietly firm, but traders said the limited interest meant prices remained within existing ranges. At the London Commodity Exchange the May COCOA position closed at Pounds 937 a tonne, up Pounds 7, while March COFFEE gained Dollars 10 at 1,199 a tonne. Traders said continuing concern over Ivory Coast shipments was underpinning the cocoa market but noted that the marketing board and shippers were expected to meet this week to sort out problems resulting from last week's devaluation of the CFA franc. Coffee's rise lacked any real momentum, traders said, and light Far East producer selling was again capping the March price at around Dollars 1,200 a tonne, the top end of its recent range. 'I can't see it breaking through just yet,' one said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

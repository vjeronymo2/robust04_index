			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKE THE MASK OF DEMOCRACY REAL;  </P> <P> PEACE BIDS FROM CENTRAL AMERICAN EXTREMES NEED REWARDING  </P> <P> Central America has attracted the world's attention, but its politics remain  those of small, dependent nations with rigid classes, competing families,  dominating caudillos and a reliance on force to settle disputes. Impatient  outsiders tend to ignore these complexities and interpret Central American  politics in terms of two wings and a prayer. In Guatemala and El Salvador,  right-wing military forces fight left-wing guerrillas; in Nicaragua, a  left-wing government fights right-wing guerrillas. It is only by prayer and the  good dollar that the groups in the middle survive.  </P> <P> Since the United States is most comfortable with the groups in the middle, we  are often frustrated or easily fatigued by the region's battles. A decade ago,  when I worked on the National Security Council, my nightmare was that Jose  Napoleon Duarte, the courageous Salvadoran Christian Democrat, would be  assassinated by one extreme or the other. He represented peaceful, moderate  reform -- favorite words for Americans but anathema to the extremes, which  viewed reform and Duarte as a threat to either revolution or privilege. Both  wings aimed to eliminate the middle as a first step in defeating the other.  </P> <P> To some, it appears that their wish has come true. Arena, the Salvadoran  right-wing party, won the presidential election on March 19 by an overwhelming  vote. As the election approached, the guerrillas stepped up their violence.  Some leftists said that they wanted Arena to win, as this would polarize the  country and increase their prospects for a successful revolution.  </P> <P> Whether the left succeeds will depend on who Alfredo Cristiani, the winner, is:  a conservative democrat, who, like Richard Nixon, could negotiate peace with  Marxists, or just a clean-looking mask for Maj. Roberto D'Aubussion's death  squads?  </P> <P> The question is the mirror image of the one that is asked of the Nicaraguan  Sandinistas or the Salvadoran Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. Are  the Sandinistas sincere when they profess to want the opposition to compete  openly and equally in a free election next February? Was the FMLN's proposal to  participate in the presidential election if it was postponed for six months  serious or merely a ploy?  </P> <P> The only people who know the answers are the people who sit at the political  extremes. To those on the left, Cristiani is a death mask, the guerrillas are  serious about elections, and the Sandinistas are pluralists; to the right,  Cristiani is a democrat and the promises of the Sandinistas and the FMLN are a  ruse. These answers, however, may say more about the speakers than they do  about the region's actors. They are both more certain and more ambivalent, and  that is both their problem and their opportunity. Hard-liners on the right and  left have been reluctant to acknowledge the legitimacy of their adversaries,  but a decade of war has eroded their certainty, and that has made peace  possible.  </P> <P> Since 1979, Central America's economies have slipped two or three decades. In  retrospect, it is clear that impressive, albeit uneven, economic development  from 1960-78 gave rise to revolutions that in turn led to more poverty. Both  wings now understand that only peace can bring development, and only political  compromise will make peace possible. This is the reason for the very real,  though hesitant steps by both sides toward peace since the five Central  American presidents signed their accord in August, 1987.  </P> <P> The recent Sandinista decision to release the National Guardsmen, the FMLN  recognition of the ballot box as the basis of legitimacy, and Arena's  willingness to accept land reform and negotiations with the FMLN -- all are  serious steps, but they are also half-hearted. The decisions were courageous in  that they divided their movements at a time of weakness. At the same time, the  extremes are nervous about fulfilling their democratic promises for fear of  losing the chance to gain or maintain power. Their peace and democracy  initiatives are serious, but unless those steps are encouraged and rewarded in  some manner, the groups will be compelled for reasons of internal unity to take  steps backwards.  </P> <P> The same pattern applies to Arena (as the National Republican Alliance is  known) if it pursues talks with the FMLN and implements its "privatized" land  reform. Because of Arena's militarism and its hatred of the left, these steps  will divide the party. If the talks fail, the party membership will reunite and  breathe a collective sigh of relief. This does not mean that Arena is insincere  about negotiations or that agreement is impossible, only that it will be  difficult and needs outside help.  </P> <P> The acceptance by both wings of the validity of elections and the imperative of  outside verification provides the crucial framework to achieve peace. The  United States and other governments must devise an incentive package to  encourage the wings -- Arena and the Contras on the right, the FMLN and the  Sandinistas on the left -- to compromise and make peaceful change a reality.  </P> <P> The bipartisan accord reached between President Bush and Congress on Friday  represents a positive and necessary first step for the United States to play an  effective role in Central America. But the Administration should not confuse  talks on Capitol Hill with negotiations in Central America. The real bargaining  will be with Latin America, and it has not yet begun.  </P> <P> After the Sandinistas took power, some argued that the United States should try  to rip the "mask of democracy" from their face and show the world that they  were really communists. A wise Venezuelan leader proposed a more sophisticated  strategy: Instead of taking the mask off the Sandinistas, he suggested, the  democracies might try pasting the mask on them. We should pursue that strategy  in El Salvador as well as in Nicaragua.  </P></p>

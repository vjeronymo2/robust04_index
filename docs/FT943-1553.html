			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Guinness fills gap at Utd Distillers after flat results Guinness, the spirits and brewing group, disappointed the City with its interim results yesterday - then surprised it by choosing the head of a Swedish building company to lead United Distillers, its spirits division. The shares closed down 13p at 448p after the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 320m for the six months to June 30, up from Pounds 305m, reflecting sharply lower interest payments. Profits from continuing operations eased from Pounds 369m to Pounds 366m on sales slightly lower at Pounds 1.96bn (Pounds 1.98bn). Mr Tony Greener, chairman, described the results as 'sound in the difficult circumstances'. The new managing director at United Distillers is Mr Finn Johnsson, chief executive of Euroc, Sweden's largest building products group. He replaces Mr Crispin Davis. Mr Greener said that after an extensive search Mr Johnsson was 'clearly the best candidate', with substantial experience running international businesses in competitive industries. Operating profits at United Distillers, accounting for more than two thirds of the total, fell by Pounds 12m to Pounds 258m, while sales slipped from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 1.05bn. The first quarter was particularly tough in two important markets - the UK and the US. The UK suffered from destocking after Christmas, the absence of the Budget in March while bad weather adversely affected trade in the US. The group said it had performed well in its emerging markets, with the exception of Japan in Asia and Venezuela in south America. Guinness Worldwide Brewing profits rose by 9 per cent from Pounds 99m to Pounds 108m on sales ahead from Pounds 867m to Pounds 916m. The group is increasing marketing of Guinness stout, which benefitted from 'a publicity bonanza' after sponsoring the Irish football team in the World Cup. Included in the latest result is a Pounds 23m contribution from the investment in Moet Hennessy following the reorganisation last April of the relationship with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. The transaction reduced borrowings by Pounds 400m to Pounds 1.5bn; an interest credit from the deal helped to cut interest payable from Pounds 98m to Pounds 69m. The deal also diluted the earnings per share, which were 11.1p (11p). The interim dividend is increased from 3.62p to 3.90p. After payment of dividends the free cash flow was Pounds 23m - down from a previous Pounds 116m. Lex, Page 22; People, Page 12; LVMH net up 36%, Page 31</p>

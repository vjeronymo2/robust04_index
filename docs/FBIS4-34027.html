			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Felix Carbonell from the "Doing Radio" program] </F>   [Text] A total of 400 people nationwide have been charged  with illegal vehicle sales so far. In Havana, there are  approximately 3,000 cases of automobiles and motorcycles  involved in transactions through powers of attorney, one of the  most frequently used ways to give vehicle sales violations a  legal face. Investigations are underway to determine whether  transactions that involved a number of vehicles that have  changed hands were legal.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I.3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter wanted to know the relationship between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Standardized NUHOMS and the NUHOMS MP187 now applying for a Certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance. Is the MP187 transportable? Will the canister of all models fit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the transport overpack? Wouldn't a utility be better off waiting for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportable cask rather than choosing a storage only cask that may have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compatibility problems with an MPC system?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The MP&hyph;187 transportation overpack uses a canister  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to the Standardized NUHOMS. However, it is the subject of a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC review as part of a site-specific licensing application. Both the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS and the MP&hyph;187 share many common design features.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, they are separate applications, and the NRC has not been asked by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cask vendor to review whether the Standardized NUHOMS can be transported in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NUHOMS MP187 transportation overpack.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The issue of whether a utility should consider the transportability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dry storage casks is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I.4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter cited a report given at the HLW Conference at Las Vegas, in 1990, ``Integrated Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Systems using NUHOMS,'' by PNFSI (page 671): ``While subsequent transfer of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intact DSC from a NUHOMS on-site transfer cask directly to an OCRWM rail/barge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is feasible, this method of transfer is not preferred since the assemblies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be oriented top down and the DSC bottom shield plug and grapple ring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assembly would be orientated top up, thus complicating the canister opening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and fuel handling process at the MRS or geologic repository following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipment.'' Has NRC evaluated this situation? Has it been rectified?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because the cask vendor applied for certification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Standardized NUHOMS only as a storage cask under 10 CFR Part 72,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation of this cask is not a subject of this rulemaking. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NRC review of the standardized NUHOMS did not consider the particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation problem described in the comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> J. Several commenters supported the rule stating that it is beneficial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the NRC and licensees, and it is consistent with NRC's direction to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary site-specific licensing reviews. Others disagreed and asked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific questions about NRC's approval and oversight process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> J.1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the NRC statement, ``The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule will not have adverse effect on public health and safety,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be guaranteed and, therefore, even though it may be convenient for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nuclear industry and the NRC to avoid site-specific approvals, in this case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these are essential for maintaining public safety. Another commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following the same theme questioned how the following determination was made:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``this cask, when used in accordance with the conditions specified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certificate of Compliance and NRC regulations, will meet the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR Part 72; thus, adequate protection of the public health and safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be ensured.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Dry storage casks approved by the NRC for use under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general license are of a robust design that relies on generic cask features to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure protection of the public health and safety. Additional NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site-specific approvals are unnecessary. NRC oversight and inspections are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient to ensure that general licensees implement NRC conditions on cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use. If specific concerns are raised, the NRC also has the authority to look  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into them and respond as necessary to protect public health and safety. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC has established specific requirements in 10 CFR Part 72 that must be met  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order to obtain a Certificate of Compliance for a cask. The details of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review and the bases for the NRC concluding that the cask meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of 10 CFR Part 72 are provided in the SER. The goal of dry cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage technology is to store spent fuel safely. That goal, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness of the technology, have been demonstrated empirically and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experimentally. Different cask designs may require different types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis to demonstrate their safety. Therefore, different review methods may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be appropriate to reach that conclusion. In each case, the level of review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed is that needed to provide assurance of adequate protection of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> J.2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters expressed concern over the exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 10 CFR 72.234(c) granted to VECTRA to begin transfer cask fabrication (but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not use) ``to have the necessary equipment available for use by Davis-Besse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) in mid-1995, and thus enable DBNPS to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete full-core off-load capability in its spent fuel pool following the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refueling outage scheduled for early 1996.'' One commenter said that seeking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment and providing comments is an exercise in futility because cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval seems to be a fait accompli. Another commenter wants no exemptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for fabrication before certification to be allowed, stating that problems have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed when all these exemptions are allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

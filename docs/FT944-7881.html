			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US agrees to accept Australian beef tests The US yesterday agreed to release for sale Australian beef exported after October 25 but said it required further testing of beef exported before that date because of possible contamination from a chemical used in the growing of cotton. Recent decisions by the US and Japan to temporarily ban the sale of Australian beef have clouded the industry, which earns around ADollars 3bn (Dollars 2.2bn) of overseas revenue annually, making it the nation's third largest export sector. The US and Japan account for about three-quarters of those sales. The Cattle Council of Australia, representing Australian cattle farmers, expressed relief that the US had agreed to accept the testing procedures which Australia now has in place. Samples of beef exported to the US before October 25 and still in the export pipeline are due to be returned to Australia where the tests will be conducted later this week. Despite progress on the US front, Australia has yet to allay Japanese concerns. Moreover, a number of smaller buyers of Australian beef - including Canada, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico - are understood to have joined the temporary ban. According to federal officials, more than 12,000 tonnes of Australian beef is being held at storage or customs facilities in these countries, while around 30,000 tonnes is in the Japanese pipeline. Senator Bob Collins, federal primary industries minister, yesterday acknowledged that the problem was not over 'by a long shot', although he added that Australia was 'hopeful' that other countries would follow the US lead. Beef shipments made before October 25 and still in the export process are estimated to be worth between ADollars 200m and ADollars 250m. The problem occured when some farmers fed cotton waste to cattle after normal grain supplies were affected by a severe drought on the east coast. The CCA has said that the chemical is non-toxic and that only a very small proportion of Australian cattle - those fed cotton waste from irrigated cotton - have any chance of being affected. All livestock from affected areas, predominantly in New South Wales, were being tested. However, the beef industry has acknowledged that the adverse publicity from the contamination issue could be damaging in the longer term.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Bosnian Serbs will quit talks: Anger over tighter sanctions  -UN begins evacuation of Srebrenica wounded THE BOSNIAN Serbs intend to walk out of the international peace talks chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen following the United Nations Security Council's decision at the weekend to impose tighter sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia. This was made clear yesterday as UN helicopters began evacuating seriously wounded civilians from Srebrenica, the encircled eastern Bosnian Moslem town, under a ceasefire agreement negotiated between the military chiefs of the Serb attacking forces and the Moslem defenders early yesterday. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, told Belgrade Radio that the self-styled Bosnian Serb 'parliament' would decide whether the Bosnian Serb delegation would leave the talks before April 26 or after. That is the deadline set by the Security Council for the implementation of the new sanctions, unless the Bosnian Serbs sign the Vance-Owen plan, dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. The sanctions are intended to put pressure on Serbia to force the Bosnian Serbs to endorse the peace plan. Under the sanctions, all countries would be banned from transporting goods across Serbia and Montenegro, monitors would be placed on Danube river ships, financial assets would be frozen, a maritime exclusion zone would be set up in the Adriatic and Yugoslav aircraft and trucks abroad would be impounded. For the moment, however, sanctions appear to be having the opposite effect from that intended, with Mr Karadzic angrily describing them as a 'diktat and imposition'. Lord Owen, who has been advocating air strikes against strategic bridges and roads in Bosnia as part of the effort to deprive the Bosnian Serbs of vital supplies, is flying to Belgrade on Wednesday for talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. His mission is widely seen as a desperate and possibly final attempt to persuade Mr Milosevic to make the Bosnian Serbs accept the peace plan. In the UK, Mr John Major, the prime minister, under growing pressure at Westminster for greater military involvement by Britain to help the Bosnian Moslems, discussed possible options with President Clinton in a 50-minute telephone conversation yesterday. These almost certainly included air strikes. The two leaders agreed that the tougher sanctions against Serbia should be imposed 'effectively and rapidly' and that loopholes should be closed. In Srebrenica, French Puma and British Sea King helicopters flew out 133 casualties to the Moslem-held northern Bosnian town of Tuzla. They were aided by 145 UN Canadian troops who entered the town to monitor the ceasefire and start disarming the Moslem defenders. Evacuations by air of some 500 badly wounded or sick people are due to continue for several days, barring delays by Serbian inspections. A UN spokesman said Srebrenica, which is surrounded by Serb troops within rifle-fire range, was calm while the evacuation took place. Claims by the Moslem-controlled Sarajevo radio that theSerbs shelled Moslem defensive lines around the town after the ceasefire came into effect at 2am local time, could not be confirmed by independent sources. The Canadian UN soldiers have orders to secure the demilitarisation of Srebrenica, a town with a population of some 30,000 and one of the last Moslem-held strongholds of eastern Bosnia, within 72 hours of their arrival. The UN-brokered agreement, signed by General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb army commander, and Mr Sefir Halilovic, the Moslem-led Bosnian army chief, demands that all Moslem troops should submit their weapons and ammunition to the UN forces by 11am on Wednesday. While it guarantees 'correct treatment' for any personnel who hand over their arms to the UN, it does not provide for the disarming of the besieging Serb forces. Although UN spokesmen denied that the deal was tantamount to a Moslem surrender and Bosnian Serb leaders continued to protest that they did not aim to take the town, it seems that Srebrenica's survival as a Moslem community is unlikely. The decision by the UN Security Council to strengthen sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro was taken late on Saturday, with 13 members voting in favour and two - Russia and China - abstaining.

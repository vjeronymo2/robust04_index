			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Companies criticised over use of standard on leasing COMPANIES ARE failing to follow the spirit of the accounting standard dealing with leasing, according to the latest edition of Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monthly monitoring service of annual accounts. 'While most companies have complied with the standard, in some cases the spirit of the standard has not been maintained,' says the October edition. SAAP 21, the leasing standard introduced in 1984, allows certain leases to be excluded from the balance sheets in companies' accounts. These include 'operating leases' by which the company is not expected to be exposed to the risks and rewards of ownership. The standard has been criticised by bodies including the financial reporting and auditing group of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Company Reporting says many companies have found a number of ways of structuring transactions to avoid placing leases on the balance sheet. It says some companies have interpreted as a strict rule the guideline suggesting that leases can be excluded if minimum lease payments amount to 90 per cent or more of the fair value of the asset. An analysis of 280 published company accounts shows that 88 per cent of companies show evidence of operating leases. If these were placed on balance sheet, the gearing - or ratio of debt to equity - would increase sharply. Company Reporting says the majority of companies with operating leases satisfy the minimum disclosure requirements of the standard, and some go beyond the minimum requirement. All but 6 per cent of companies with operating leases disclose commitments payable in the following year. Three per cent provide no analysis of lease expiry dates for those payable in the following year, and 3 per cent offer no disclosure of future commitments at all. However, from a sample of 570 companies only 1.4 per cent disclose evidence of having engaged in sale and leaseback transactions in the previous year. A sale and leaseback occurs when the original owner of an asset sells it and immediately leases it back. This allows companies to remove the assets from the balance sheet.

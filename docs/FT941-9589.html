			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Alfred McAlpine - Other companies The first of the larger building contractors will announce annual results on Thursday, for the year to October 31. The big question is by how much new chief executive Mr Oliver Whitehead, ex-Babcock International, will write down McAlpine's assets following the departure of Mr Graeme Odgers, who took over as chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Pre-tax profits should have benefited from the recovery in the UK and the US, and are expected to be about Pounds 6m before write downs, against Pounds 3.6m.</p>

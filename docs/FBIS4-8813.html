			<p>BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, has sent a letter to U.S. President Bill  Clinton in which he asks him to find a way of helping the  population of Gorazde.    The lives of many people and also the reputation of the  United States are at stake. If force and deceit triumph, this  will not only be a defeat for Bosnia, but also for many  important institutions in which we have acted together. We must  prevent this defeat, the letter from President Izetbegovic says.    President Izetbegovic sent this letter to the heads of state  or government of Russia, France, Great Britain, Germany, Turkey,  and Saudi Arabia.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / FTC fails to reach anti-trust decision on Microsoft THE US Federal Trade Commission failed for a second time yesterday to reach a conclusive decision on whether to bring an anti-trust action against Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software company. The FTC's three-year anti-trust inquiry remains open, although the commission yesterday voted down a staff recommendation to file a complaint against Microsoft. This follows an earlier vote in February, when the commission was deadlocked over whether to take action. The case stems from a battle between Microsoft and its competitors in the software industry, who allege that Microsoft has used anti-competitive tactics to achieve its dominant role in the market. Microsoft holds a 98 per cent share of the world market for personal computer operating systems that run on IBM-compatible PCs, and is the market leader in several other segments of the PC software market. The FTC, which conducts proceedings in private, concluded its meeting in Washington without comment. Microsoft, however, said the company had been informed the FTC had voted not to issue an administrative complaint, although it added it was given 'no further indication from the FTC as to the status of the non-public investigation of the company'. However, Novell, Microsoft's largest competitor in the PC software market, disputed Microsoft's statement. 'The commission deadlocked (with two vote for and two against) on whether to file suit against Microsoft, and in a second vote deadlocked on whether to close the case,' said Mr David Bradford, senior vice-president and general counsel for Novell. 'The commission voted on whether to issue a complaint against Microsoft and the motion failed,' countered Mr William Neukom , Microsoft vice-president of law. 'That is an important and positive development for Microsoft.' The company has been under investigation by the FTC since June 1990. Throughout, it has denied any wrongdoing and said that it was continuing to co-operate with the commission. It is conceivable, Mr Neukom said, that the FTC staff could bring the case before the commission again. 'But they have already had two bites at us. It would be highly unusual for them to try again.' Novell, however, called on the US Justice Department to take up the case. Such a transfer would be unusual, but not unprecedented, said Ms Wendy Goldman Rohm, author of a soon-to-be-published book on the Microsoft anti-trust investigation. 'The two agencies have procedures in place to exchange documents for law enforcement purposes. I expect the FTC to receive a request from the Justice Department for key documents from the Microsoft case within 30 days.' Mr Neukom said Microsoft had maintained from the beginning 'that it competes in an honest and ethical manner and has not violated the anti-trust laws.'</p>

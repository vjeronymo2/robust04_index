			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CARB's 50,000 and 100,000 mile LDV NMOG standards for LEVs are 0.075 and 0.09 g/mi, respectively. While CARB's NMOG measurements include the direct measurement of aldehydes, which are undermeasured by 1&hyph;2 percent in the measurement of NMHC by the flame ionization detector (FID), this is balanced by the 0.98 reactivity adjustment factor allowed for CARB Phase II reformulated gasoline. Thus, numerically, for gasoline vehicles at least, NMOG and NMHC emissions will be roughly equivalent. A LDV certified to CARB's LEV standards which just met its exhaust and non-exhaust emission standards in use would exceed the proposed enhanced in-use composite NMHC standards by 0.007  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> g/mi at 50,000 miles and 0.022 g/mi at 100,000 miles. EPA believes that it is extremely unlikely that a vehicle would just meet all 4 of these NMHC emission standards simultaneously during certification with all of its emission controls performing as designed. Manufacturers utilize significant safety margins in certification to avoid the costs of modifying their design and retesting. Therefore, EPA does not expect that emission levels in certification will have to be reduced to meet the enhanced in-use standards relative to those otherwise occurring. The feasibility of meeting these standards in use is discussed in the next section addressing recall standards and testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted earlier in describing the enhanced in-use NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standards, EPA is proposing to allow up to 25 percent of a manufacturer's 1999 model year sales to meet transitional enhanced in-use standards. Comparing EPA's proposed transitional enhanced in-use standards to CARB's individual emission standards for non-exhaust NMHC and CARB's exhaust NMOG emission standards for TLEVs results in essentially the same comparison as that shown above for LEVs. EPA requests comments on the proposed enhanced in-use standards for LDVs and LDTs and on the methodology used to combine exhaust and non-exhaust NMHC emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers will have to demonstrate in their application for certification to EPA that each of their vehicle engine families will comply with the enhanced in-use standards described above, as well as the I/M standards described in Section A.(4) below. As discussed in Section A.(4), the enhanced in-use I/M standards are numerically less stringent than those described above. Also, the I/M 240 test does not include cold start emissions, which form the bulk of FTP NMHC emissions. Thus, EPA expects that the demonstration of compliance with the enhanced in-use standards will focus on those standards described above. For the great majority of post-1998 model year California vehicles, this demonstration will consist of the submission of information already required by CARB along with the calculation of composite NMHC emissions using the equation presented above and a showing that composite NMHC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions comply with the enhanced in-use standards contained in the table ``Proposed Certification and In-Use Standards for Post-1998 Model Year LDVs and LDTs.'' The application would also include such other information as necessary to show that the vehicle engine family will meet these standards under typical in-use conditions (i.e., absent obvious tampering or abuse) over its full useful life, which would be enforced through the enhanced in-use compliance recall program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As mentioned above, these standards apply to vehicles certified to operate on any fuel: Gasoline, diesel fuel or otherwise. This should not be a problem for hydrocarbon fuels such as natural gas or propane, as NMHC is an appropriate measure of their organic emissions vis-a-vis ozone production. However, organic emissions from alcohol fueled vehicles are highly oxygenated and not included in NMHC. EPA proposes that alcohol fueled vehicles have the same numerical standards for organics as shown in Table AI.A&hyph;1, but in terms of organic material hydrocarbon equivalent (OMHCE) emissions. OMHCE consists of the mass of both non-oxygenated and oxygenated HCs, with the mass of oxygen excluded (40 CFR 86.090&hyph;2). Such standards would apply to the same categories of vehicles to which the current EPA OMHCE standards apply (40 CFR 86.090&hyph;8 through &hyph;11 and any versions of these sections which apply to later model year vehicles). EPA requests comments on the use of OMHCE standards and the categories of those vehicles (i.e., fuel types) to which they should apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also proposes to accept, for the purpose of certifying enhanced in-use compliance vehicles, the use of evaporative emissions and running losses measured using CARB's test procedure. For recall testing, however (see Section A.(3) below), due to lower cost, EPA proposes to use its own test procedures with the substitution of CARB's fuel specifications and ambient temperatures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

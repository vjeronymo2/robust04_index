			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SCC LOSES TWO AND SHARE OF FIRST PLACE  </P> <P> Southern California College lost its chance to move into a first-place tie in  the Golden West Athletic Conference when Azusa Pacific won both games of a  doubleheader Saturday at SCC.  </P> <P> SCC was shooting for a sweep of its own, which would have meant a tie with  Azusa Pacific at the top of conference standings going into the last week of  the regular season.  </P> <P> Instead, Azusa Pacific got a complete game from Jose Gallardo to win the first  game, 5-2, and then rallied to win the second, 6-4. And the Vanguards got to  watch as the Cougars (30-10, 15-3 in the conference) rejoiced after clinching  the conference championship.  </P> <P> It was a frustrating celebration for the Vanguards (26-17-1, 11-7) to watch.  Not only did they lose a share of first place but they dropped into third  behind Cal Baptist, which swept a doubleheader from Christ College Irvine.  </P> <P> Still, the Vanguards likely will be one of four teams to qualify for the  National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 playoffs in April and  Azusa Pacific will be the host.  </P> <P> "They can celebrate on our field but if we get into the playoffs, we might get  to celebrate at their field and that hurts just as much," SCC Coach Charlie  Phillips said.  </P> <P> Azusa Pacific took advantage of SCC lapses to win each game. In the first game,  SCC's Jim Dedrick, the district's earned-run-average leader entering the game,  walked a total of four batters in the fourth and sixth and the Cougars scored  two runs in each inning. Dedrick walked six in the game.  </P> <P> SCC took a 3-1 lead in the first inning of the second game when catcher Denny  Berni hit a two-run double and scored on a throwing error. Azusa Pacific  rallied with three runs in the fifth, two of which were unearned.  </P> <P> In another Golden State Athletic Conference game:  </P> <P> Cal Baptist 9-7, Christ College Irvine 4-6 -- Cal Baptist (31-15, 12-6) scored  three runs in the seventh inning of the second game and moved into second place  in the conference.  </P> <P> In a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game:  </P> <P> Chapman 6, Cal State Los Angeles 2 -- Doug Yates had three hits, including two  doubles, and scored two runs and Mike Giuseffi had a two-run home run in the  sixth for Chapman (29-21, 6-8).  </P> <P> Pete Coleman (8-5) pitched a seven-hitter with six strikeouts for Chapman.  Chris Cutliff hit a solo home run and Curt Ledesma had two hits and two RBIs  for Chapman.  </P></p>

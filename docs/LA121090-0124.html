			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DRASTIC FINANCIAL SHIFTS PLANNED  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is preparing to recommend the most far-reaching  overhaul of the nation's financial system since the Great Depression, a  top-to-bottom revamping that could eventually change the way nearly everybody  in the nation handles their money, the Washington Post reported today.  </P> <P> Proposals now being drafted by the Treasury Department would rewrite the laws  that have governed U.S. banks, savings and loans, brokerage houses and  insurance companies for half a century.  </P> <P> The plan, to be made public in January, would impose new limits on federal  deposit insurance that would take it back toward its original purpose of  protecting small savers; would allow banks to become stockbrokers, sell  insurance and underwrite bonds; would let Wall Street firms and other kinds of  companies that are now banned from the banking business buy banks and would  allow banks to buy other banks and open branches anywhere, leading to the  creation of the first nationwide banks.  </P></p>

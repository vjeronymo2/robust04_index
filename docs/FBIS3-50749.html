			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Economic Panorama" column by Miriam Leitao] </F>   [Text] The Central Bank [BC] is behind in its internal debt  renegotiation schedule by $10 billion. This means that titles  representing a third of the total internal debt fell due and  were not sold in the market again.    The past two BBC [Central Bank Bond] auctions failed.  Another  auction failed in November. The BC has not accepted the market  interest rate with the argument that it does not want to appear  to agree with the expectation of a 40-percent inflation rate in  January. Market agents, in turn, argue that they lost  approximately $500 million from September to December for  anticipating rates below the real ones.    Pactual Bank economist Paulo Guedes said the $10 billion  that  was not renegotiated was "pure nitroglycerine. In theory, that  money is loose and can go anywhere."    "The picture is not good at all," said Pablo Haddad of the  Garantia Bank. Haddad, a former BC director himself, thinks the  information available on the economic plan "is not very clear  and not very consistent," increasing economic agents'  uncertainty.    "The market demands high rates for prefixed titles  [certificates that earn interest without monetary corrections]  and looks at post-fixed titles [certificates earning interest  and monetary corrections] with great mistrust because the index  can be changed at any time," Paulo Guedes argued. Today the  Treasury will try to sell NTN's [National Treasury Notes]  indexed to the foreign exchange rate and the TR [referential  interest rate].    Whatever the result of today's auction -- it is expected  that  the Treasury will be luckier than the BC -- the climate of  apprehension with which the market reaches the end of the year  makes us look back with nostalgia to the efforts to extend debt  payments months ago. At that time the BC was selling bonds with  six months to one year maturity with increasingly lower interest  rates. Now debt bonds mature at shorter intervals, interest  rates are higher, and the uncertainty is greater.</p>

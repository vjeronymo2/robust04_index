			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Baxter Will Sell Stake in Biotech Firm: Baxter International has been a  long-time investor in Genetics Institute of Cambridge, Mass., holding 7% of the  shares, but said it will sell all or part of the stake to raise money for debt  reduction. Analysts believe that the stock sale does not reflect any  displeasure on Baxter's part with the smaller company, with whom it has a joint  program to develop and market a drug to treat hemophilia. Baxter stock rose  $1.25 per share to close at $23 on the New York Stock Exchange; on NASDAQ,  Genetics Institute closed down $2 to $27.25.  </P></p>

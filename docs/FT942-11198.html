			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Volkswagen and Skoda agree accounts Volkswagen, the German carmaker, said Skoda, its partially-owned Czech unit, had finally agreed its annual accounts, Reuter reports from Wolfsburg. Problems had existed between VW and Skoda over VW's accounting for 1993 which showed Skoda had made a net loss of DM246m (Dollars 144m) after a DM233m profit in 1992. The loss resulted almost exclusively from adjustments to Skoda's accounts to bring them into line with international standards which include more depreciation and write-downs. Without the adjustments, Skoda would have made an DM8m profit in 1993 after a DM70m profit a year earlier, VW said.</p>

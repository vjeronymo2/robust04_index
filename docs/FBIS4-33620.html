			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The recent arrest of several Shining Path [SL]  leaders has alerted the antiterrorist forces to a new and  powerful organization within the unruly Red Path [Sendero Rojo]  faction of the SL organization which has for some time planned  and directed subversive actions in Lima.    The new SL organ, called Lima-Regional Committee [Comite  Lima-Regional] has become the strongest political-military SL  sector in Lima. The Lima-Regional Committee is the result of the  merging of the Peoples' Aid [Socorro Popular] and the  Metropolitan Committee, both of which are SL groups that  operated in Lima.    The National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) has  announced that the new group is responsible for numerous cases  of murder and terrorist actions in Lima these past few months.    Among them are the recent attacks against City Hall, the Air  Force headquarters, and the U.S. Embassy as well as the murder  of neighborhood leaders and members of the Peruvian National  Police.    Dincote believes the new committee is one of the most  powerful the SL has throughout the country, although it is  unaware of its real operating capacity.    The police know the group is headed by a collegiate  leadership. SL members arrested by Dincote have said the Lima  Regional leadership comprises: Jenny Rodriguez Neyra, aka Rita;  Ostap Morote Barrionuevo, aka Luis; Maritza Infante Yupanqui,  aka Milagros; Abdon Cruzat Cardenas; and two other unidentified  terrorists.    The first information about the group was disclosed by an SL  member arrested by Dincote in May 1993. Until then the police  were unaware of the Lima-Regional Committee's existence.    An SL member identified as Guillermo Pflucker Ruiz, whose  alias is Raul according to his police records, said the Peoples'  Aid and the Lima Metropolitan Committee united their weakened  force following the arrest of Abimael Guzman and several other  SL leaders.    It seems the harsh blows sustained by the SL's military and  political structure forced the merger because the two sectors  had been seriously affected by the police action.    By late 1992, the Peoples' Aid and the Lima Metropolitan  Committee had lost their main leaders and their operation  capacity had been seriously affected.    With the merge the SL has maintained, although at a  significantly lower level, its capacity and presence in Lima  through its criminal actions. [passage omitted]</p>

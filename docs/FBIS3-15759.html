These  are the results of the public opinion poll carried out in  February by Social Research Center of the National Academy of  Armenia, among 600 citizens. Only 13 per cent of respondents  are of the opinion that there is no need of entering the ruble  zone, since Armenia introduced its own national currency -- dram.    Moreover, the head of the Center Gevork Poghosian pointed  out  the fact, that only 4.5 per cent of Yerevan citizens believe in  stability of dram. About the half -- 44.8 per cent -- are  certain the national currency will devaluate, and 29 per cent  think dram will finally yield to Russian ruble.</p>

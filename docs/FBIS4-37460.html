			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel will permit the Palestinian policemen who  are slated to serve on the Allenby Bridge and at the Rafah  border terminals to assume their posts as early as next week if  they are prepared. Major General Dani Rothschild, the  coordinator of activities in the territories, made this  statement this morning during a visit to the Allenby Bridge.  Rothschild's deputy Arye Ramot clarified, however, that  several more weeks are necessary for to complete the technical  arrangements for the joint work with the Palestinian  representatives at the border terminals. Among other things  involved is the installation of sophisticated electronic  equipment to examine travelers' luggage. This work will be  completed in mid-July.    Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el notes that today,  Transportation Minister Yisra'el Qeysar visited the Allenby  Bridge, which will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the  Israel Airports Authority in approximately four months. Qeysar  announced that his ministry will invest approximately 30 million  shekels in the Allenby and Rafah terminals in order to make them  more modern and efficient.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 20 June carries  a report by Avi Lifshitz on Qeysar's visit to the Allenby  Bridge, adding that "Minister Qeysar said Jordan wants Israel to  allow its planes to fly across Israeli airspace to Europe.  Minister Qeysar said that as soon as such an official request  arrives, Israel will give it favorable consideration and will  probably accept it."]</p>

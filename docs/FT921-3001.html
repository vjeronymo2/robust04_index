			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: MMC to probe shoe polish buy MR PETER Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday signalled his interest in Britons' clean shoes by referring last October's acquisition of Reckitt &amp; Colman's shoe polish businesses by Sara Lee to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Through the acquisition, the US-based Sara Lee, which already owns Kiwi shoe polishes, added the Cherry Blossom and Meltonian brands to its portfolio giving it more than half the UK market. The Office of Fair Trading, which investigated the acquisition and recommended the referral, thought it raised fears about excessive concentration in the Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m market, especially given the combined strength of the brand names. If the MMC decides the merger is against the public interest, Mr Lilley may force Sara Lee to sell the Reckitt polishes. The OFT is believed to have intervened in response to several complaints from retailing companies, which feared there had been too great a consolidation of power among their polish suppliers. Many big supermarket groups have developed their own-label shoe polishes and would be strong enough to look after themselves but smaller operators suggested they might prove to be especially vulnerable. Sara Lee rejected the charge yesterday. Mr Euan Venters, marketing director for Sara Lee in the UK, said: 'We continue to believe very strongly that the acquisition is not against the interests of consumers or the trade.' He said he could not state what market share the company possessed. 'The total market is an oddity. We cannot give figures because it is a very fragmented and complicated market,' he said. Sara Lee manufactures its polishes at Honley, West Yorkshire, and has been transferring production of Reckitt's brands to this site. It did not acquire Reckitt's production plant at Hull, which continues to produce the Nugget shoe polish for the UK consumer products group. The assets acquired by Sara Lee were less than Pounds 30m, ensuring that the referral could only be made on the grounds of excessive market share. The MMC will report by June 17.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Economic Freedom Party has expressed readiness  to mediate in organizing talks between Russia and Chechnya.  According to Interfax sources, the party's message to Chechen  President Dzhokhar Dudayev points to the necessity "to resume  the dialogue and restore the ruptured links."    Without mutual understanding with Chechnya, there will be  neither peace nor tranquility in the south of Russia. Neither  can the future of the Chechen people be based on constant  confrontation with Russia or on isolation from the world  community, says the message.</p>

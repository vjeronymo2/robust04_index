			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Flames of The Revolution in Light </F> Industry Ignited by the Party"]    [Text] The hearts of the consumer goods producers  throughout the country--who are effecting a new turn in carrying  out the revolution in the light industry sector, upholding the  historic letter, "On Thoroughly Carrying Out the Revolution in  Light Industry," that Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of  our party and people, sent to participants of the national light  industry meeting at the time when 30 years had passed since he  led party work--are filled with the great dignity and pride of  upholding the great leader [widaehan yongdoja].    In his letter sent to participants of the national light  industry meeting, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  indicated: Cherishing in their hearts the lofty honor and  dignity of working in an important sector in improving the  people's living, all functionaries and working people in the  light industry sector should thoroughly carry out the revolution  of light industry and, thus, should effect a decisive turn for  development.    In the historic letter the dear comrade leader concretely  elucidated the essence and task of the revolution in light  industry and its implementation method and wisely led all  functionaries and working people in the light industry sector to  furiously lift up the flames of the light industry revolution in  order to effect a great turn in the development of light  industry and production of people's consumer goods.    This is a brief statement on a new development of light  industry by Comrade Yi Sang-chun, deputy director of a bureau at  the Committee of Light Industry.    [Begin Yi Sang-chun recording] Four years have passed since  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has been interested in  improving our people's living standards, provided a national  light industry meeting on 2 June 1990 and sent a historic  letter, "On Thoroughly Carrying Out the Light Industry  Revolution," to participants of the meeting.    In retrospect, the dear comrade leader, who is consummating  the chuche revolutionary cause created by the great leader  [suryong] generation after generation, has been dedicating a lot  of work and energy to improving our people's living standards  day and night, without even taking a rest, since he began  leading our party's work 30 years ago. Even after the national  light industry meeting where he provided the occasion for an  epochal turn in the production of people's consumer goods the  dear comrade leader gave a great benevolence to the working  people in developing the country's light industry and, thus,  wisely led them to more furiously lift up the flames of the  light industry revolution.    In particular, the dear comrade leader has constantly taken  measures to smoothly guarantee raw materials and materials for  light industry. He has seen to it that consumer goods producers  concentrate greater efforts on further increasing the kinds,  quantity, and quality of consumer goods. He not only has  provided consumer goods producers with necessary funds, but has  also established measures for supplying the raw materials to  produce people's consumer goods.    Last December, the dear comrade leader specifically decided  even the kinds of consumer goods that the light industry sector  should produce this year. He also paid deep interest to the  problems related to improving the quality of people's consumer  goods and wisely led consumer goods producers to improve their  quality. He also elucidated the direction and method in  accelerating the modernization of light industry by rebuilding  facilities of the existing light industry plants and their  production process into more modernized ones and by building  more new light industry plants equipped with up-to-date  technology.    The dear comrade leader also led the production of 3 August  people's consumer goods to be carried out more vigorously. [end  recording]    Indeed, the dear comrade leader's wise leadership and  benevolent love have provided a guideline which makes it  possible for our light industry to devote itself to improving  the people's living. This is why, along with our people,  people's consumer goods producers are singing in reverence to  him. [music]    The following is a questions-and-answers session between  Comrade Kim Kwang-chu from the Light Industry Committee and a  station reporter at Pyongyang General Textile Plant:    [Begin recording] [Reporter] How are you? I have seen you  many times at this plant. You are working so hard.    [Kim Kwang-chu] Not at all.    [Reporter] Four years have passed since the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il sent a programmatic letter to the  participants of the national light industry meeting on 2 June,  1990. Since then, not only Pyongyang General Textile Plant but  the country's general light industry has shown considerable  development.    [Kim] Yes. Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade  leader, during the four years after the national light industry  meeting, the material and technological basis of our light  industry has peerlessly developed and there have been new  achievements in the production of people's consumer goods.    Above all, the struggle to make light industry chuche-based  has advanced greatly, thus providing a basis for further  increasing the production of people's consumer goods by  thoroughly relying on our own material and resources. In  particular, quite a few scientific and technical problems in  further increasing the production of quality threads and fabric  mainly using vinalon -- the chuche textile -- were solved and  actively applied to practice.    [Reporter] I understand that light industry has been further  modernized in the flame of the light industry revolution kindled  by the dear comrade leader.    [Kim] Yes. In the textile industry sector alone, spinning  and weaving equipment now has higher speed and more precision,  and the production process is more automatized. Pyongyang  General Textile Plant, as well as Kaesong Textile Plant, Kangso  Weaving Plant, Pyongyang Silk Plant, and many other plants and  enterprises have significantly increased production capacity  with modern equipment such as air bearing spinning machines,  highly efficient metal weaving machines, silk looms, and  automatic reeling machines.    [Reporter] I also understand that there has been  considerable achievement in the shoe industry sector, including  the modernization of equipment.    [Kim] Thanks to the benevolent love of the dear comrade  leader, who is deeply concerned about our people's living, the  production capacity has been increased by the newly installed  shoe catapult machines and automatic assembly lines at Pyongyang  Vinyl Chloride Shoe Plant, Sinuiju Shoe Plant, Sunchon Leather  Shoe Plant, and many other plants. In recent years, the models  and quantity have been further increased, and the quality has  also improved remarkably.    [Reporter] In the flame of light industry revolution kindled  by the dear comrade leader, our light industry is provided with  a strong springboard for a higher leap. New achievements are  made in succession in the production of people's consumer goods.  We should have great pride and self-esteem about this. [end  recording] [music]    Producers of consumer goods are filled with confidence and  optimism bearing deep in their hearts the fact that there can  only be innovations and achievements in the construction of a  chuche-based, modern light industry base, and in the production  of people's consumer goods when we follow the leadership of the  dear comrade leader in practical life. [music]    Together with all the producers of people's consumer goods  in the entire country, who received the letter "On Thoroughly  Carrying Out the Light Industry Revolution" by the dear comrade  leader to the participants of the national light industry  meeting, functionaries, workers, and technicians of Sukchon  Foodstuffs Plant are also increasing the production of people's  consumer goods.  <H5>  Engraving his intention in the heart. </H5>   Functionaries, workers, and technicians of Sukchon  Foodstuffs  Plant, who have the dear comrade leader's intention engraved in  their hearts, are actively waging the struggle to increase  foodstuffs production by renewing the production process and  creating more raw material bases. Comrade Yi Chang-yun, chief  of technical preparations of the plant, said:    [Begin Yi Chang-yun recording] Thanks to the love and care  of the dear comrade leader, who is always deeply concerned about  improving our people's living, during the past four years, our  Sukchon Foodstuffs Plant has also shown a significant increase  in production capacity as well as quantity. What we are  particularly proud of is that, as the dear comrade leader has  taught in his letter, we further inflamed the light industry  revolution by expanding the internal raw material bases to tens  of chongbo [one chongbo equals 10,000 square meters], adding  children's foodstuffs production lines and normalizing the  production, and by modifying various production lines, including  the cookie lines, in a modern way.    Compared with the past, the production volume of foodstuffs  increased almost twofold. We will more vigorously wage the  light industry revolution presented by the dear comrade leader  so as to further modernize production lines and actively  increase various foodstuffs production.    In particular, we will further display the spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude to improve the children's foodstuffs  production lines with our own strength and wisdom and thereby  enhance the quality and quantity of the production of highly  nutritious children's foodstuffs, including soybean milk,  soybean milk power, and rice powder, for supply to more  children. [end recording]    It is not easy to normalize production in a relatively small  plant and in the meantime to add new production lines with their  own strength and wisdom, and increase the raw material bases.  However, functionaries, workers, and technicians of Sukchon  Foodstuffs Plant are steadily working with all their wisdom and  zeal bearing deep in their minds that vigorously waging the  light industry revolution is an honorable and rewarding work  which contributes to improving the people's living while loyally  upholding the leadership of the dear comrade leader.    In a short period, the plant renewed the children's  foodstuffs production lines, meat processing lines, and cookie  production lines, and formed more raw material bases to actively  increase the production of various foodstuffs.    Producers of consumer goods in Sukchon Foodstuffs Plant are  vigorously inflaming the light industry revolution to better  implement the task presented in the letter sent by the dear  comrade leader.    In the future, too, these functionaries, workers, and  technicians of the light industry sector in the entire country,  who are displaying the honor of the producers of consumer goods,  on the road of loyally upholding the leadership of the dear  comrade leader, will vigorously run along the single road of  innovation while highly upholding the flame of the light  industry revolution.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Major faces revolt on fish policy Mr John Major's government risks a further defeat in the House of Commons this week, amid signs that Tory Euro-rebels are preparing to challenge the UK's fisheries policy. Several Tory MPs said yesterday that they might vote against the government in a debate over plans to extend fishing rights to Spanish and Portuguese trawlers in the Irish sea. The issue is expected to come up in a general debate tomorrow on the government's agriculture policy. The Labour party has put down an amendment saying that Britain should not give Iberian fishermen access to an area to the west of the UK coastline, called 'the Irish box'. However, the amendment runs counter to the UK's expected negotiating position at a forthcoming European fisheries council. Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, is expected to concede at the meeting that Iberian trawlers should be given access to the area while strengthening the rights and protection of British and Irish trawlers. Two Tory MPs who were deprived of the party whip a fortnight ago admitted yesterday that they could vote with Labour on the issue. Mr Christopher Gill, a member of the Commons agriculture committee, said his 'general feeling' was that the fishermen had a very strong case. He said there was 'a prospect' that he would not support the government on Wednesday. It is also understood that Mrs Teresa Gorman, the Tory MP for Billericay, could vote against the government. In the Commons, Sir Teddy Taylor, the MP for Southend, expressed fears that the Spanish government had won the new rights in 'behind-the-scenes' talks at the European Council meeting in Essen at the weekend. The prime minister gave an assurance that rumours of a victory by the Spanish government on the issue were not true. Mr David Harris, the MP for St Ives in Cornwall and a loyal supporter of the government, has also expressed concern about the impact on fishing fleets in his constituency. He admitted yesterday that there might be little the government could do, as the issue would be decided by a majority vote of EU member states. A government defeat would not be of the same order of magnitude as the one on value added tax on fuel last week because tomorrow's motion has no statutory force.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F> Alessandro Caprettini in Rome on 14 May: "The Confidence Vote?  It Is Not a Problem"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Caprettini] Confidence or  elections. Some people who were members of the fascist team  have said this be a matter of alternatives.    [Fini] No, it is a matter of clearness, as opposed to those  who are dreaming about the existence of other majorities. It is  also the clearest reply to [Italian Popular Party, PPI, member]  De Mita who hopes to be able to get up to his games again.    [Caprettini] Secretary, what do you think of De Mita's idea  of opposing the government just to form another one, considering  that the PPI does not want to hear about an agreement with Forza  Italia and that there are not sufficient numbers for an  alternative?    [Fini] They want to show that they exist. However, they are  continuing to reason with the methods of the First Republic.  They put personal interests before those of the nation. They  are not at all worried about the possibility of losing precious  time to form a new executive body. It is the oldest and most  decrepit Christian Democrat who is coming back to peer in.    [Caprettini] Secretary, there are some points about the  negotiations with the government that are still obscure. Maroni  [Northern League] at the Interior Ministry, for example. You  opposed him, then...perhaps you convinced him to nominate  Gaspari [of the AN] as undersecretary?    [Fini] It would be bad for the government if the  undersecretaries were given mandates to control the ministers.  No, the story is simple. I had expressed political perplexity.  However, on the one hand, I am convinced that either I gave  them a free rein or the government would not have been formed,  and, on the other hand, I obtained clarification from Bossi and  Berlusconi.    [Caprettini] Another little mystery is the veto on  Tremaglia.  Who gave it?    [Fini] I do not know. He has been personally wronged and we  have been the subject of a considerable political wrong. So  much so that I obtained the commitment of the majority to  entrust Tremaglia with the presidency of the Foreign Affairs  Committee in the Chamber of Deputies.    [Caprettini] And will he accept?    [Fini] I think so. He is not one of those gentlemen of  before -- I am talking about the PPI members -- who put personal  interests before those of the country.    [Caprettini] The final unresolved mystery is Di Pietro.  First of all, is it true that you proposed him?    [Fini] No, it is true that I said that I was greatly in  favor  of his participation of the government.    [Caprettini] Who is responsible for his renunciation?    [Fini] This is still a little mysterious for me too. From  what was understood, Di Pietro was not insensitive to the  proposal. Then a veto fell. Who gave it? I do not know,  perhaps [Chief Prosecutor] Borrelli.    [Caprettini] Are you worried about the accusations that  continue to come from abroad about the presence of neofascist  ministers in the Italian Government?    [Fini] Not at all. They will be forgotten in a month. There  are the European elections. You will see that after 12 June  this story of bogies that is being stirred up by the European  politicians of the Left will end. Then there will be other  occasions to show how things stand. There is the G-7 summit.  There are the EC ministerial meetings.    [Caprettini] Are you satisfied with what you have obtained  in  the government? Or do you feel a bit like a spare wheel?    [Fini] I do not have worries of this type, and I am  satisfied  with five important ministries.    [Caprettini] However, there have been some grumbles within  the party. Buontempo says that it is necessary to think about  splitting the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and the AN.    [Fini] Buontempo is an objector by nature. Criticisms? Let  them be made, I have no wish to strangle the internal debate.  However, I think that the press is more interested in these  subjects than my party is.    [Caprettini] What do you think of the government's program?    [Fini] It is good. It is very realistic and therefore  viable.    [Caprettini] Will you manage to obtain the confidence of the  Senate?    [Fini] Yes, we will...also because it is clear that if there  is no majority we will have elections. Wait and see, at the  crucial moment many of our adversaries will leave for coffee!</p>

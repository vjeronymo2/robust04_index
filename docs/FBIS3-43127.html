			<p>SUMMARY                                 On the eve of the 10-11 January NATO summit, Russian President  Boris Yeltsin has strongly reaffirmed his opposition to the  possible expansion of NATO membership, warning of the possible  negative consequences of such expansion.  Yeltsin's statement  comes as the culmination of a campaign by other Russian officials  to forestall any expansion of NATO that excludes Russia.  This  campaign has taken pains to counter Baltic and East European  efforts to press for their countries' early admission to NATO  based on the strong showing of ultranationalist Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party in the 12 December  Russian legislative elections, with some arguing that Russia will  have to respond to any appearance of the continuation of Cold-War  era "bloc politics."                             END SUMMARY     In a final push to forestall moves at the upcoming NATO summit  toward an early expansion of NATO membership, Yeltsin press  secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov issued an "authorized" statement on  5 January warning of the possible negative consequences of such  steps and calling on NATO leaders to "dispel" the "impression of  ambiguity" in their position on the issue.  While the statement  began with a terse disclaimer expressing "respect" for the  "acknowledged right of independent states" to "join international  organizations," it went on to castigate specifically Lithuania's  "official request to join NATO" and more generally the "haste" of  "some countries" to join a "military-political alliance."  Arguing against a "bloc mentality" in an era when the "world's  major powers" are working toward "dismantling the inheritance of  the 'Cold War'" and when the military doctrine of the new  democratic Russia "excludes any kind of aggressive displays," the  statement criticized the "motives and arguments" of those wishing  to join NATO as "unconvincing."  It went on to warn that Yeltsin  is "worried" that NATO expansion will "provoke a negative  reaction" within Russia, "promote . . . undesirable attitudes"  among both civilians and the military, and "ultimately could lead  to military-political destabilization" (ITAR-TASS, 5 January).     Other Russian Critics     Yeltsin's strong statement follows a spate of recent comments by  other Russian officials critical of the Baltic and East European  states for using Zhirinovskiy's election success to argue for  their quick admission to NATO.  Some of the officials, like  Yeltsin, have highlighted the potential negative consequences of  an early expansion of NATO membership to Baltic or East European  states:     --In an interview with the Prague daily Lidove Noviny published  on 15 December, Yeltsin's foreign policy adviser, Dmitriy  Ryurikov, claimed that creation of "new lines dividing Europe"--a  reference to East Europeans joining NATO--would be "insulting to  Russia" which now has "no political, philosophical, or  ideological differences" with East Europe or the West.  He also  noted that Russia "has to react" to any movement by "such a huge  military bloc toward our border."     --An article in the 18 December Izvestiya reported that Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev is "assuming" that the Baltic and East  European countries will "cite Zhirinovskiy's success" in the  recent elections to "demand" both the "immediate withdrawal of  Russian troops" and "rapid acceptance into NATO."  The report  cited Kozyrev as saying that he "will not allow" foreign  countries to "exploit the Zhirinovskiy factor" in this way and as  recommending that the Baltics strive to "deprive Zhirinovskiy of  his social base" by cooperating with Moscow to "improve the  position of the Russian-speaking population."     --In an interview published in the 23 December Rossiyskaya  Gazeta, Kozyrev similarly charged that certain "circles,"  including "those European countries which for some reason want to  join NATO," are "making capital" out of Zhirinovskiy's recent  electoral success "even though they themselves cannot explain  what they will get out of" NATO membership.  He promised that  "Zhirinovskiy's success will not produce any changes" in Russian  foreign policy.     --Defense Minister Pavel Grachev seemed to take a more  conciliatory tack in a 29 December press conference, reportedly  saying that Russia would withdraw its troops from Estonia and  Latvia in 1994 in order to "avoid the Baltics appealing for early  NATO membership" to counter an alleged  "military threat" from  Russia.  Grachev claimed not to understand the efforts of East  European and Baltic countries to "find protection" from a  "mythical threat from Russia" by joining NATO (Tallinn BNS, 29  December 1993).     --Appearing on an Ostankino television program analyzing the  election results broadcast on 18 December, First Deputy Foreign  Minister Anatoliy Adamishin noted that the East European states  and NATO need to "take other interests into account, including  Russia's interests" because positioning a "military-political  bloc" right up against "the borders of Russia" could "bring about  an undesired reaction."  Adamishin also stressed this theme in an  interview published in the Italian daily L'Espresso on 26  December, arguing that if the West "continues [its] policy of  encirclement," it will "risk having to reckon with a  Zhirinovskiy."     Moscow's Previous Opposition     Moscow's strong opposition to any eastward expansion of NATO  predates the Russian elections.  Yeltsin signaled that such a  development could be politically explosive after a joint Russian-  Polish declaration signed by him and Polish President Lech Walesa  in August, which recognized Poland's right to join the alliance,  sparked a controversy within Russia over the issue.  A letter  that Yeltsin sent to Western leaders in September laid out  Moscow's position and reportedly stressed the domestic  ramifications of such a move.  According to a text of the letter  published by the Prague daily Mlada Fronta Dnes (2 December),  Yeltsin noted that, although Moscow recognized that incorporation  of East Europe into NATO would not "automatically lead to the  alliance turning against Russia," the Russian public--"not only  the opposition, but also moderate circles "--would "undoubtedly  view this as a new kind of isolation" that "diametrically  contradicts [Russia's] logical involvement in the Euro-Atlantic  region."  During a 9 December meeting in Brussels with NATO  Secretary-General Manfred Woerner, Yeltsin reiterated that Moscow  "would not like" moves to extend NATO membership to East Europe  (ITAR-TASS, AFP, 9 December 1993).     Throughout the fall, other Russian officials kept up a steady  drumbeat of public criticism of NATO expansion, giving it high  visibility as a foreign policy issue to both foreign and domestic  audiences:     --Kozyrev, addressing the U.S. Foreign Policy Association in New  York, stressed that world stability should not be sought by  expanding NATO but by transforming the bloc and adapting it to  peacekeeping efforts (ITAR-TASS, 30 September 1993  Campaigning  later for election to a single-seat constituency in the military  stronghold of Murmansk, Kozyrev assured the Commander in Chief of  the Northern Fleet Oleg Yerofeyev, who noted that NATO members  were actively operating in the region, that NATO will not  increase its membership (ITAR-TASS, 27 November 1993  After the 3  December meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council  (NACC), Kozyrev claimed that the question of extending NATO  membership in the near-term had been taken off the agenda of the  upcoming NATO summit, characterizing the decision as one of the  most consequential outcomes of the session (ITAR-TASS, 4 December  1993).     --Answering journalists' questions about Moscow's views on the  possibility of the Baltic states joining NATO, Grachev stressed  that "Russia does not approve of any expansion of NATO to other  states, including the Baltics."  Noting that Russia had no right  to interfere in the affairs of a sovereign state and that it was  up to the Baltics "to decide what they want to join and why,"  Grachev nevertheless warned that, if they join NATO, Russia "will  then take the necessary defensive steps" (ITAR-TASS, 22 November  1993).     --Adamishin gave repeated warnings about expanding NATO to the  foreign press, cautioning a Madrid newspaper, for example, that  if the East Europeans joined NATO and Russia was left out to  "feel again like a besieged fortress, isolated behind a cordon  sanitaire," there could be "considerable consequences in Russian  domestic politics" (El Pais, 23 October 1993).     The Primakov Report     The fanfare with which Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS)  director Yevgeniy Primakov used a 25 November press conference to  unveil the FIS report, "Prospects for the Expansion of NATO and  Russia's Interests," which set forth a comprehensive assessment  of the negative impact of NATO expansion, suggests the depth of  Moscow's desire to forestall such expansion.  Although Primakov  acknowledged that "NATO today is not the NATO of the Cold War,"  he stressed that Russia "is far from indifferent to a bloc that  is expanding its area of responsibility to our borders" and is  being called upon to become the "sole guarantor of peace and  stability" for former Warsaw Treaty members.  Drawing from the  13-page unclassified report, Primakov argued that the real risk  to Russia from an expansion of NATO lay in the fact that NATO is  only "slowly" transforming itself from a "political-military  alliance designed to counter external threats" into a mainly  political instrument appropriate to the new tasks of the post  confrontational period."   Contending that the alliance currently  "is geared toward strategic planning of the worst sort," Primakov  added that to change its "persistent stereotypical [bloc]  mentality" will "clearly take a long time" (Radio Rossii, Moscow  radio, 25 November 1993).     Although Primakov dismissed as "speculative" allegations that the  military's influence over political decisions had recently  increased in Russia, he implicitly cautioned the West against  putting Russia in a position where its current relative military  weakness becomes a domestic issue.  He highlighted a conclusion  contained in the FIS report that the Russian Government's  inability to take retaliatory steps if NATO was extended could  "generate discontent" among those "responsible" for Russia's  security (Interfax, 25 November 1993).  According to the text of  the report, such retaliatory measures would be imperative from a  military standpoint and would include fundamental changes in  Russian force structure and posture to offset the "immense  offensive potential" of a NATO expansion to Russian borders.  The  report concluded, however, that such offsetting measures would  "undoubtedly" result in "an excessive strain on the state budget  and ultimately a weakening of Russia's defense capabilities."  The report warned further that, under such circumstances, target  deadlines for military reform and modernization might not be met,  resulting in a "qualitative reduction" of Russia's military  potential in comparison with the "leading military powers"  (Perspektivy Rashireniya NATO i Interesy Rossii, 1993).  While  some newspaper articles suggested that the Foreign Ministry had  some unspecified disagreements with the FIS over the question of  NATO expansion (Komsomolskaya Pravda, 26 November 1993;  Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 30 November 1993), Primakov conceded in  general that "some differences between departments always exist"  but downplayed any disagreements with the Foreign Ministry  (Interfax, 25 November 1993).     Searching for Partnership and Equality     Moscow has signaled its own interest in closer ties to NATO and  has appeared generally receptive to the Partnership for Peace  proposal.  However, it has evinced concern that Russia be  accepted as an equal by the Western powers.     --In his September letter, Yeltsin reportedly suggested that "the  relations between [Russia] and NATO should be several degrees  warmer than relations between the alliance and East Europe,"  adding that "direct cooperation" between Russia and NATO in  "advancing peace" could "progress at a much quicker pace" (Mlada  Fronta Dnes, 2 December 1993).  Summing up the thrust of Yeltsin  and Grachev's December meeting with Secretary General Woerner,  Kozyrev described Moscow's attitude toward NATO as seeking "not  membership, but partnership," and he noted that cooperation  should be as "broad and specific as possible" (ITAR-TASS, 10  December 1993).     --Although he later claimed it was essentially a Russian idea  (ITAR-TASS, 4 December 1993), Kozyrev also expressed reservations  about the Partnership for Peace plan at the NACC session.  Noting  that it was "a complicated issue" and that "we all have to find  the appropriate answers," he stressed that "no one has a magic  solution," and that the scheme must be studied carefully (AFP, 3  December 1993).     --In a 11 November interview with the newspaper Segodnya, Russian  Ambassador to Belgium and representative to NATO Nikolay  Afanasyevskiy said Russia needed to clearly define the content  and political objectives of the partnership and make sure that it  is not a "preparatory class from which 'A' students will be  admitted to NATO" but a "genuinely mutual rapprochement" allowing  "equal cooperation in critical situations."     --Prior to Yeltsin's Belgian visit, the Defense Ministry  newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda cited Russian defense and foreign  ministry officials as saying any security system which included  Russia as an 'equal partner" would be "acceptable" (9 December  1993).     Outlook     Russia will persist in opposing any expansion of NATO that  excludes it or appears not to treat it as an equal partner.  Yeltsin and his team are likely to continue to argue both that  their democratic credentials make Baltic and East European fears  unrealistic and that any NATO expansion will only play into the  hands of Russian ultranationalists like Zhirinovskiy.  Nevertheless, the presence of a substantial nationalistic faction  within the new Russian legislature will undoubtedly complicate  Yeltsin's efforts to assuage the fears of Russia's neighbors who  are seeking shelter under the NATO umbrella.     Box                     Zhirinovskiy' s Views     Zhirinovskiy has made contradictory statements about NATO:     --Commenting on his party's foreign policy priorities immediately  following the elections, he announced "we are not against NATO  being joined by East European or other countries" (Interfax, 14  December 1993).     --At a press conference on 21 December, however, Zhirinovskiy  demanded the breakup of NATO (Asahi Shimbun, 22 December 1993).     --In Vienna Zhirinovskiy expressed both views.  He told an  Austrian television reporter that "we have dissolved the Warsaw  Pact" and therefore "NATO must also be dissolved,"  but told a  radio reporter that "if Poland or Hungary would like to be  included in NATO, okay," it would be "no problem for Russia" (ORF  TV, 21 December 1993; Osterreich Eins radio, 22 December 1993).

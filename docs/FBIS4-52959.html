			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government expressed regret Saturday at reports that North Korea  has begun the discharging process at its nuclear reactor, which  Seoul, Washington and the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) have denounced as an act that would end all dialogue.    "We cannot but lodge our regrets," said one Foreign Ministry  official. But the official said Seoul will wait to make a formal  response until after IAEA inspectors can determine the status of  the reactor and how much of the process has been completed.    "We note the fact that despite North Korea's declaration  that  it has gone ahead with the discharge, it said there is still an  opportunity for random selection and preservation of the fuel  rods, " said the official.    "It would be inappropriate for us to declare a stance before  the IAEA judgement."    North Korea had notified the United States at their  working-level contact Friday and the Vienna-based IAEA that it  could no longer defer removal of the nuclear fuel rods from its  5-megawatt reactor due to technical reasons.    But the letter to the IAEA said Pyongyang has "just begun"  the process and the agency still has time to choose the rods and  place them under inspection for future measurement.    Seoul, Washington and the IAEA have repeatedly warned that  changing the rods without IAEA supervision would end the  dialogue phase and push the North Korean nuclear issue toward  the U.N. Security Council.    But some sources here called North Korea's declaration more  of a "bluff" aimed at dragging Washington to the negotiating  table for further high-level talks.    It is still unclear whether North Korea went ahead with the  core activities of the discharging process, which takes a  considerable amount of time.    "The fact that Pyongyang said there is still an opportunity  for random selection and securing of the rods seems to indicate  the process is in a very rudimentary stage," said one source.    Others believe that North Korea is intent on gaining the  upper hand in negotiations with the United States when  high-level dialogue does resume.</p>

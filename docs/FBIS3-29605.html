			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa expressed resolve Monday [21 February] to work out a  fresh package of market-opening measures as early as possible,  government officials said.    Hosokawa told a meeting of leaders of the government and  ruling parties that Japan urgently needs to adopt market-opening  measures to resolve the trade row with the United States.    Meanwhile, a government source said, "we want to produce a  concluded package at the earliest possible date in March."    The Hosokawa cabinet decided last week to formulate a set of  measures including deregulation and import promotion to improve  foreign access to the Japanese market.    The decision followed a U.S. announcement that it plans to  impose sanctions on imports of Japanese cellular phones.    The government source said, however, that the planned  market-  opening steps are not designed to avert threatened U.S. trade  retaliation but are "voluntary efforts."    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a morning  press conference that the government will hold a  ministerial-level emergency meeting "within this week" to  discuss ways to repair strained trade ties with the U.S.    Ministers of foreign affairs, finance, and international  trade and industry will attend the session, which is likely to  be held after the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993  becomes law, probably Wednesday, government sources said.    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told the ruling parties'  meeting that the focal point now is how Japan and the U.S. can  strike a deal on criteria without using figures to measure the  openness of Japanese markets.    Hosokawa met U.S. President Bill Clinton earlier this month  in Washington but failed to agree on a new framework to slash  Japan's huge surplus in bilateral trade, which last year  amounted to about 60 billion dollars, according to U.S. figures.    The U.S. asked Japan to set numerical targets but Japan  rejected the demand, saying it would lead to managed trade.</p>

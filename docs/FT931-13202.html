			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Westpac recruits executive from US WESTPAC, the troubled Australian bank, yesterday appointed a US banker as chief executive, with a brief to restore the bank to health by cutting costs and reducing risk-bearing assets. Mr John Uhrig, chairman, said Mr Robert Joss, 51, a vice-chairman of Wells Fargo, the Californian investment bank, would take over as managing director next month. He replaces Mr Frank Conroy, who resigned last month after resisting pressure from leading shareholders to speed up a restructuring programme announced in November. Mr Joss was one of two candidates shortlisted by Westpac. Mr Lindsay Pyne, the former managing director of the Bank of New Zealand, was favoured by some executives because of his knowledge of Australian banking. Mr Joss said he wanted Westpac to concentrate on its retail business, which has suffered significant losses as a result of corporate bad debts and falling property values. 'I think one of the problems with Westpac is that it had lost its focus for a while, and I will be aiming to sharpen everyone's view and help build morale,' he said. The bank's problems climaxed in November when it announced a record loss of ADollars 1.5bn (Pounds 670m) for the year, after bad debts of ADollars 2.6bn and an unexpected US tax liability of ADollars 106m. Five directors, including the then chairman, resigned after a ADollars 1.2bn rights issue was largely ignored by shareholders.</p>

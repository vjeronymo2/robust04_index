			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry  said Saturday that any Yulgok military buildup project entailing  an outlay of 1 trillion won will require cabinet and National  Assembly approval from next year. The ministry will make the  minimal number of changes in force requirements but if more are  needed, the Force Requirement Coordination Committee will  conduct an in-depth study.    In addition, the ministry will set up a clear channel of  officials responsible for every Yulgok project while simplifying  the process of acquiring military hardware. These plans were  contained in a report released by the ministry on Saturday. It  was compiled by the National Defense System Improvement  Committee, headed by the superintendent of the Korea Military  Academy, Lt. Gen. Chang Sung. The committee studied the plans  over a period of two months.    The report deals with 30 fields covering the system,  regulations, organization and manpower of the Yulgok program and  military supplies. It recommends 164 improvement tasks, of  which 141 short-term items will be dealt with from this April  through 1995 and 23 medium- and long-term problems will be  handled after 1996.    "The proposal for reform of the Yulgok projects and military  supplies procurement system placed emphasis on efficiency,  rationality, responsibility, speciality and transparency," said  Gen. Chang. "The committee will form a follow-up committee in  order to push the proposed reform continuously for one year," he  added.    Accordingly, the 31-member National Defense System  Improvement Committee formed under special orders by Defense  Minister Yi Pyong-tae last April 10 will be disbanded as of  Tuesday. It will be replaced by a follow-up committee  comprising five to six officials.    The Yulgok project has received its budget from the  government based on overall estimates in the past. But from  1995, the government will decide on each project before making  allocations, except for those requiring secrecy because of  purchase negotiations. If any project costs more than 1 trillion  won, the government will form a special committee of concerned  ministers to study it before seeking cabinet and National  Assembly approval.    When a change in force requirements must be made, a Force  Requirement Adjustment Committee comprising officials from the  Defense Ministry, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the three  branches of the Armed Forces will study it so that the proposed  change does not depend on any one particular official. In order  to make it clear where responsibility lies in every stage of the  decision-making processes, the Joint Chiefs of Staff will decide  on changes to forces requirements and procurement methods, while  the kinds of weapons will be decided by the ministry under the  direction of the second assistant minister. Negotiations and  contracts will be made by the Logistics Center (LOGC) and simple  weapons procurement will be left to each branch of the Armed  Forces.</p>

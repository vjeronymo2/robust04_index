			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Chile and Bolivia wait in the wings Presidents Eduardo Frei of Chile and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of Bolivia are today expected to sign protocol agreements leading to their countries' eventual incorporation as 'associate' members of the four-nation Mercosur free trade area. Negotiations are expected to be conducted with Mercosur as a whole, rather than, as Chile earlier proposed, bilaterally with individual members. Chile's priority, according to Mr Carlos Figueroa, foreign minister, will be to ensure the continuation of preferential tariffs from which Chilean exports to the four Mercosur states - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay - currently benefit. Otherwise, such preferential treatment would end from next January when Mercosur establishes its external tariff barrier. Chile and Bolivia, which until recently had watched nervously as Mercosur took shape, appear to have come to the conclusion that the bloc is too important to ignore. Latin America is Chile's most dynamic trading partner, especially in manufactured goods. Last year, Chilean exports to Mercosur states were worth Dollars 1.1bn, 12 per cent of exports worldwide. Exports to the bloc have risen by two-thirds since 1991, while those to Argentina alone leapt last year by 27.6 per cent to Dollars 589m. Barriers to markets as big as those of Brazil and Argentina, Chile's third and fourth most important trading partners respectively, could harm Chilean manufacturing industry, the sector it is most keen to see expand. Most of Chile's regional investment, especially in the electrical sector, has been in Argentina. 'As a market, Mercosur could not be more important,' said Mr Figueroa.</p>

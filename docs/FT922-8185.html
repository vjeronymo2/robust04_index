			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report MOST BASE metals prices fluctuated in narrow trading ranges at the London Metal Exchange during the afternoon with traders watching the latest round of German metal workers pay talks. The COPPER market was the most nervous - Germany is one of the world's biggest importers of that metal - and the cash position closed Pounds 8.50 down on the day at Pounds 1,218 a tonne, extending the fall on the week to Pounds 22.25 a tonne. The TIN market's recent strength was maintained, although the three months delivery position again failed to break resistance at Dollars 6,100 a tonne. The closing price was Dollars 6,090.50 a tonne, up Dollars 15.50 on the day. Traders suggested a technical correction back to about Dollars 6,000 a tonne might be needed before a renewed challenge of the upside resistance could succeed. COCOA and COFFEE prices were holding on to slim gains at the close but traders were not expecting substantial rallies to develop. 'The real test will be when we start to see further origin-selling but for now, we're just happy to end the day in the plus column,' one cocoa trader said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

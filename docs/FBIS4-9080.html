Davorin Kracun, Slovene deputy prime  minister and minister of economic relations and development,  stressed the two countries' similar interests: Both countries  have suffered heavily from the embargo against Serbia, so  bilateral cooperation and trade between us, under more liberal  conditions, can help to some extent in making up for the lost  markets and the shortages that have been caused.

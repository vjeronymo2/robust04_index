			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UNIAN correspondent Mariya Starozhitskaya, </F> specially for IZVESTIYA: "Trying To Divide Black Sea Fleet for  a Fifth Time"]    [Text] Kiev -- The 10 days set aside by the presidents of  Russia and Ukraine for agreeing the parameters of the division  of the Black Sea Fleet are not over yet, but the first result  has already been achieved. [Ukrainian] President Leonid  Kravchuk has given an assurance that the Ukrainian sailors' pay  will be no less than that of the Russians (although admittedly  it will be no higher) and that the question of coordinating the  term of fixed service must also be resolved: At the moment  people serve for two years in the Ukrainian Navy, 18 months in  the Russian Navy. These innovations should help to achieve an  amicable division of Black Sea Fleet personnel.    Replying to IZVESTIYA's question before flying out to the  Crimea 21 April, [Ukrainian] Defense Minister V. Radetskyy gave  an assurance that officers and warrant officers will choose  their place of service solely according to preference: "There  are no problems at all regarding sailors, soldiers, and petty  officers -- ships and shore subunits are staffed equally by  Ukrainians and Russians and among the officers half will be of  Ukrainian origin. But the human factor must also be taken into  account, these people have families, apartments, and personal  ties. But the principle, I repeat, is the same: Everyone will  serve where they choose."    Radetskyy is inclined toward the rapid and constructive  solution of the problem. In his opinion, this is also true of  [Russian Defense Minister] Grachev -- recently the ministers  have been in regular telephone contact with one another. The  presidents' orders are identical -- matters must be sorted out  in a calm atmosphere. It is proposed that at the talks being  held between the defense ministers an agreement will be  concluded which will envisage the division of the fleet equally  according to its combat status as of December 1991 (the Black  Sea Fleet was worth 34 trillion Russian rubles at that time) and  the sale to Russia -- possibly to the state debt account -- of  the bulk of the Ukrainian half. After the approval of the  document by the presidents, 80 percent of the vessels will raise  the St. Andrew's flag, 20 percent will hoist the Ukrainian flag,  thus marking the transition to stage two -- the division of  bases. Several options are being studied here. The most  popular solution is to lease the Sevastopol base to Russia for  five years with a subsequent extension of the lease. Ukraine is  content with the remaining bases from Izmail to Donuzlav.  Ukrainian Navy headquarters will be transferred to one of them.    The ratios have been observed here -- around 80 percent of  the Black Sea Fleet infrastructure is based at Sevastopol. But  a quick and easy solution cannot be expected -- the "status of  Sevastopol" has to be ratified both in the newly elected  Ukrainian parliament and the State Duma, which has definite  experience of examining this question.    "I see no other possibility of resolving the problem than to  lease Russia a base for the fleet at Sevastopol and withdraw the  Ukrainian fleet," Kravchuk noted, "otherwise there will be no  peace. Right now the fleet, which used to be regarded as a  common asset -- and I do not want to dramatize things -- is not  subordinated to Ukraine. It is necessary to sort things out as  soon as possible so that this becomes Russia's navy under  Russian laws and Ukraine has its own navy corresponding to its  needs."    The present agreement on the division of the navy is the  fifth in the past two years. The previous good intentions --  the agreements at Dagomys, Yalta, Massandra, and Zavidovo --  have not been implemented. Circumstances have changed now, it  is true -- the Odessa incident showed that it is not only  inconvenient but dangerous to live a divided existence in the  same home.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Terese Staniulyte: "There Will Be as Many </F> Soldiers in Lithuania as the State Needs"]    [Excerpt] It is common knowledge that Prime Minister  Adolfas Slezevicius was in Riga yesterday. However, the program  "Radio Pressing Issues" broadcast a traditional interview with  him. The conversation was recorded on Monday [17 January].    "The national defense structures have been assigned 130  million litai from the budget this year, which is 1.6 times more  than last year," said the head of the government. In his  opinion, this sum is insufficient to create good service  conditions for soldiers and to feed them properly. However, one  should not forget that our state national defense system is only  shaping up, and there are shortages in many places. The prime  minister reminded everyone that we received aid from the Swedes  and the Danes. Therefore, the community has developed a feeling  that we are dependents. Without such assistance from our  neighbors, however, the independent emergence of a completely  new structure of our state would be very difficult.    According to A. Slezevicius, after Lithuania has expressed  its desire to become part of the collective security system  (NATO), new demands will also be put on the Armed Forces. The  standards of technology and tactics differ considerably.  Therefore, according to the prime minister, we must think about  the quality of our Army when seeking membership in this  organization. A joint Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian  peacekeeping force that is being formed now will be a certain  test to our Army.    In the opinion of National Defense Minister Linas  Linkevicius, the Army's quality depends on its commanders'  training. That is why dozens of Lithuanian officers are  constantly studying abroad. Recently, 30 young officers left for  a training course in Denmark. Our traditional ties with Sweden,  which L. Linkevicius visited a few days ago, and with other  states of the Baltic region provide experience in forming the  national defense system.    The minister does not rule out the possibility that in the  future the Lithuanian Army will be recruited on a mixed basis --  from professional soldiers and conscripts. Such a system can be  accomplished in stages.    L. Linkevicius claimed that Lithuania's current Army is  depoliticized, while the Riflemen's Union and other structures  are operating outside the national defense system. According to  the minister, the National Defense Ministry maintains relations  with them and believes that it is necessary to have contacts  with the community.    The opinion of the prime minister and the national defense  minister on the notorious story of Army equipment is as follows:  It is too early to make any conclusions. How will the national  defense system spend the money allotted to it this year? The  defense doctrine and its functions define the amount of finances  to be assigned to it. Minister L. Linkevicius assured that the  money would not be wasted.    The defense doctrine will also reply to the question whether  the Lithuanian Army is not too large for a small country. The  defense of borders alone will require a constant number of 5,000  guards. [passage omitted]</p>

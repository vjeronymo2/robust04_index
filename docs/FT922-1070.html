			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Demise of clocking-on winds up Rover staff TIME WAS when British workers viewed the machine which monitored their latenesses and absences as a symbol of managerial oppression. But at Rover, the prospect of an end to clocking-on is winding some workers up. As part of a 'new deal' on working practices and bargaining procedures, the company and unions agreed this spring to the phased abolition of clocking-on. Timekeeping would in future be monitored by production managers and team leaders. Now the company has agreed to keep the mechanisms in place in some parts of its Longbridge plant after protests from workers. 'We are committed to phasing out clocking-on, but we have said that if workers want to clock on, they can do,' the company said. In the areas where the machines remain in place, they will not be used for calculating pay, as they were before. Rover said the clocking-on machines would merely be a registration process which team leaders could use if they wanted. It is more than just attachment to a decades-old tradition that has endeared Rover workers to clocking-on. Mr John Allen, an executive councillor of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said the system provided 'security for an employee and gives proof of attendance'. Mr Allen said he knew of three recent cases where workers questioned by police proved their innocence by producing their clocking-on cards. Other union officials say that workers are concerned about the increased powers the replacement system would give to team leaders. Rover is one of a growing number of companies which wants to end clocking-on for manual workers as part of a move to single-status employment, which also includes communal canteens and harmonised sick pay for all workers. However, some companies have harmonised clocking-on systems for all staff. At the Mars food manufacturing company everyone, including the managing director, clocks on each morning. A good-timekeeping allowance of 10 per cent of daily pay is given to employees.</p>

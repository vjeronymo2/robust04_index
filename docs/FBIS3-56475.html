They are convinced that on January 18 Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin will call these names along with the name of  Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays, who has already been appointed to  this post by a presidential decree, as Chernomyrdin promised at  the meeting with the Federal Assembly deputies - heads of  administrations on previous Friday.    The same sources drew attention of Interfax to the fact that  federal executive bodies, including 23 ministries and 44 state  committees, committees, departments, federal services and  agencies (their list is applied to Yeltsin's decree "On  Structure of Federal Executive Bodies" dated January 10) have  been distributed according to the principle of "five verticals."    According to the sources, "these verticals" will be spread  among functions of vice premiers as follows (according to the  order in which ministries and departments were presented in the  supplement to the presidential decree on corresponding  ministries and departments):    - Oleg Soskovets will be entrusted with monitoring of  federal  bodies' structures by the first of the "verticals" - fuel and  energy complex, transport and communication, construction and  architecture, industrial policy and defense industry, metallurgy  and machine building, chemical and oil-chemical industry, space  agency;    - Yegor Gaydar will be in charge of economics and finances,  foreign economic relations, and cooperation with CIS countries,  antimonopoly policy and support to new economic structures,  management of state property, customs and tax services, currency  and export control, extraction, production, and export of  precious metals and stones;    - the issues of education, science, and culture, labor and  employment, social security, youth's problems, physical culture  and tourism, mass media and cinematography, migration and  archive services will be conferred on Yuriy Yarov;    - along with the issues of the agricultural industrial  complex Aleksandr Zaveryukha will be responsible for the  problems of trade, environmental and natural resources security,  land survey and cartography, hydrometeorology and environmental  monitoring;    - and, finally, President Yeltsin will apparently take  responsibility for the fifth, "power vertical," that is  beginning with defense, foreign and domestic affairs and ending  with nuclear and radiation security, report the same sources in  the governmental circles.    Consequently, the number of deputies of the chairman of the  RF government, including the two first deputies, will not exceed  four, as it was foreseen in the presidential decree "On  Structure of Federal Executive Bodies."    As far as Chubays is concerned, he is not included into the  "big four" determined by this decree but according to one of the  next presidential decrees was appointed additionally to them.  This is "an absolutely logical move," believe the sources in  the Cabinet, "because his major responsibility - privatization  - is a process underway in Russia which is to be concluded  earlier or later."    Sources in the governmental apparatus do not rule out  possibility of slight changes in distribution of duties between  the future vice premiers.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The proposal would harmonize the marketing rules by permitting RF devices, prior to authorization or a determination of compliance with the technical standards, to be announced, advertised, displayed, and, if compliant with any Commission license requirements, operated for compliance testing, demonstrated at trade shows, or evaluated at the manufacturer's facilities. In addition, non-consumer RF devices,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , products employed at business, commercial, industrial, scientific or medical sites, prior to testing or authorization, could be offered for conditional sale or supplied to the user for evaluation or compliance testing. As under the existing rules, no products may be marketed or supplied to the general public prior to testing or authorization. Further, these products must be designed with the intent of complying with all applicable regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. On its own motion, the Commission is also proposing several additional changes to the equipment authorization rules to resolve inconsistencies, to provide clarification, to remove unnecessary restrictions and obsolete regulations, and to incorporate several interpretations. Specifically, the Commission would amend the rules to indicate, explicitly, that, as with any request for authorization, an anti-drug abuse statement is required with requests for permissive changes. In addition, the rules would state that proper labeling of a product is a condition of the grant of equipment authorization and is required prior to marketing. The Commission would also clarify that a product is considered to be ``electrically identical'' if no changes are made to the product or if any changes to the product could be treated as Class I permissive changes. Further, outdated regulations,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , references to type approval which is no longer employed, would be removed, duplicative rules would be removed, and erroneous rule citations would be corrected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. In addition to the above changes, the Commission proposes to require that any party that modifies an authorized RF device becomes responsible for ensuring that the modified product continues to comply with the appropriate standards and must maintain whatever records are required to demonstrate such compliance. In order to facilitate identification, the Commission also proposes that a product modified by someone other than the original responsible party be labeled with the name, address and telephone number of the new responsible party along with a statement that the product has been modified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Finally, the Commission would amend the regulations regarding authorization under the verification procedure to clarify the information required to be retained by the responsible party and to indicate the time period within which requests by the Commission for product samples must be submitted and the party responsible for submitting those samples. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. As required by Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the expected impact on small entities of the proposals suggested in this document. Written public comments are requested on the IRFA. These comments must be filed in accordance with the same filing deadlines as comments on the rest of the Notice, but they must have a separate and distinct heading designating them as responses to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The Secretary shall send a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rule Making, including the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

On our own initiative, we are also proposing amendments to the Part 2 rules to address the responsibility of parties that modify products prior to sale, and to establish a time frame within which samples or records files of verified devices must be submitted to the Commission upon request. In addition, we are proposing to amend the equipment authorization rules to clarify existing regulations, remove outdated regulations, and correct erroneous rule citations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Objectives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The objectives of this proposal are to facilitate the marketing and display of RF devices, to identify the party ultimately responsible for ensuring that a marketed device complies with the standards, to facilitate the retrieval of test records by the Commission, to clarify existing regulations, to remove outdated regulations, and to correct existing errors in the rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Legal Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action is authorized under Sections 4(i), 302, 303(e), 303(f), and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended 47 U.S.C.

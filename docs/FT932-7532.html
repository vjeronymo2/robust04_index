			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Gardening (A Taste of Chelsea): Rhubarb, a wonder drug - Rhubarb has found at its niche at Chelsea this year RHUBARB, laxative of kings and terror of school-children, has a stand to itself at this year's Chelsea Flower Show. 'The Story of Rhubarb' is a display mounted by Harlow Carr Botanical Gardens of Harrogate in Yorkshire, headquarters of the Northern Horticultural Society. You will spot the rhubarbs in the virtuous but dowdy educational section of the Grand Marquee. I like the humble, edible rhubarb, its stature and the way its leaves burst rudely from the earth in spring. I like to eat it, baked in the oven with orange or ginger. But the fascination of the rheum family was only revealed to me by an enthralling book published last year; Rhubarb, The Wondrous Drug by Clifford M. Foust (Princeton University Press; 371 pages,Pounds 27.50). Foust chronicles the west's perplexed efforts to get to the bottom of rhubarb - or perhaps one should say, to let rhubarb get to its bottom. In the 1st century AD Dioscorides, father of pharmacology, prescribed dried rhubarb for all manner of conditions, from flatulence to poisonous animal bites. However, to the Romans and to the middle ages, rhubarb (Rha ponticum or Rhabarbarum) was known only as a costly drug brought from the east. For centuries, European explorers in the Far East and Central Asia sought the True Rhubarb as if it were the holy grail. Only rhubarb was so gently purgative, cleansing the body's evil humours without the violent griping inflicted by senna or hellebore. Elizabethan physicians were so fascinated by rhubarb's properties that they even recommended eating the leaf, which can be highly poisonous. Even once rhubarbs were growing in Britain, problems were rife. None of the several species produced results comparable to the wonder drug from the east, a cause of consternation and much experimenting by apothecaries and botanists. Meanwhile, the imported species hybridised away, producing varieties which a few people discovered was quite palatable - so long as one could afford the sugar. The last chapter of Foust's splendid book describes how a few, highly persistent British market gardeners in the early 19th century managed to stimulate a culinary craze for rhubarb which swept the country and even spread to the US and Australia. In 1815, after workmen digging a ditch at Chelsea Physic Garden accidentally buried some rhubarb, the technique was discovered of forcing it for consumption in early spring. The West Riding of Yorkshire, with its cold winters, high rainfall, the abundant night soil from its cities, and wool shoddy from the mills, became the world's major rhubarb-growing region. It remains so to this day, although nowhere else is particularly interested in disputing the title. The last two decades have seen commercial rhubarb growing decline everywhere. According to Christopher Margrave, curator of Harlow Carr, only a handful of Yorkshire growers still uses the traditional forcing-sheds. Part of the display will be a mock-up of a forcing shed with a grower harvesting thin pink stalks by candlelight. The aim is to evoke the heyday of West Riding's rhubarb, when the 'Rhubarb Special' ran through the dawn to bring Londoners the ingredients for crumbles, tarts and wine. Even a generation ago, a British or American garden without a rhubarb patch would have been unthinkable. But rhubarb is also under something of a cloud with amateur gardeners. The plant is perhaps almost too easy to grow. In the 1990s, the ambitious amateur gardener is more likely to want to produce a few tasteless Kiwi fruit off the garage wall than to consume mountains of rhubarb. And yet, well cooked rhubarb is delicious. Margrave does not share my taste for open-ground rhubarb. However, the slender pink petioles of forced rhubarb sends him into transports of delight. It cleans the palate, he observes, and makes the perfect between-course sorbet for the gourmet's table. Margrave points out that garden-centres have played their part in rhubarb's declining popularity with a new generation of gardeners. An average garden centre is likely not to stock rhubarb at all, and if it does so it will be an unlabelled variety. The one he recommends is Cawood Delight, which will be on the Chelsea stand. Its sticks retain their brilliant red even after they are cooked. Other varieties Margrave says deserve to be widely available are The Sutton, Timperley Early, Prince Albert, and its slightly later partner Victoria. There are also varieties which taste of cherries, greengages, blackcurrants, and apples - or so it is claimed. Sadly, the rhubarb's elephantine leaves mean there will probably be room for only two culinary varieties on the Chelsea stand, and in all only six members of the Rheum family. And yet Harlow Carr holds the national rhubarb collection of over 150 varieties] Still more frustrating, Harlow Carr's Plant Centre does not sell rhubarb - surely this is should be put right? Margrave recommends John Tweedie of Maryfield Road Nursery, Maryfield, Terregles, Dumfriesshire who stocks 15 varieties; send a SAE for a list. The fortunes of rhubarb may yet revive. As the admirable Foust points out, rhubarb is rich in vitamin C and non-fattening (he forgets about the sugar). Rhubarb keeps you more regular than a barrel of breakfast bran. The Mediterranean world, which has never fallen for rhubarb, needs to be introduced to a delicacy as thoroughly British as pork pies and smoked salmon. Just possibly, the rhubarb renaissance may have already started in the US. Since 1983, an annual Festival of Rhubarb has been held at a hamlet in Philadelphia called Intercourse.</p>

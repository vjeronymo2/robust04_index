			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (20): Mind-boggling technology - John Griffiths looks ahead to possible future developments ONE AREA of costs associated with vehicle fleet operation lies largely beyond the control of the fleet manager: the delays, wasted fuel, lost man-hours and other inefficiencies caused by road congestion and often inadequate infrastructure. Near the end of last year, as part of the pan-European Prometheus (an acronym for Programme for European Traffic with Highest Efficiency and Safety) research programme to improve traffic safety and efficiency, Europe's motor industry issued its own estimate of the problem's cost: Ecu75bn (Dollars 96bn) or 15 per cent of the EC's entire transport-related spending. Reducing those costs is a key goal within Prometheus's twin overall aims of improving traffic flow efficiency by at least 20 per cent, and safety by at least 30 per cent, between now and 2010. Five years after the launch of the programme - which involves 18 European vehicle makers, 80 component companies and 124 research institutes, with help from EC governments - the first fruits of its non-competitive research efforts were put on display in Turin a few months ago. It was a mind-boggling array of technology. Some - such as vision enhancement systems allowing drivers to 'see' through fog - is intended to be commercially available by the mid-1990s. Other technology, of closer interest to commercial vehicle fleets expecting to operate throughout the single EC market, is unlikely to be available until near the end of the decade. Included within this are satellite-based fleet management systems and Copdrive, in which the vehicles are permanently exchanging information with each other while driving and manoeuvring. More controversially, there is the prospect of 'convoying' on inter-city highways, with collision-avoidance systems controlling vehicles running in tight formation, thus maximising use of road space. The Turin extravaganza included a vehicle fleet management demonstration system representing the pooled efforts of MAN and Daimler-Benz, the German truck makers; Sweden's Volvo; Iveco, Fiat of Italy's commercial vehicles arm and French state-owned Renault Vehicules. Using a combination of cellular phone networks, a Satcom satellite ground station and satellites, the fleet operator can track the precise movements of all its vehicles, integrate them into route planning and exchange data. The overall concept is even more complex than at first it might appear: Its formally-defined goals are: improving transport planning and scheduling; increased safety and reliability; better use of available cargo space and to avoid empty runs; the creation of pan-European standards for the exchange of information on fleet movements; and improvements in areas such as monitoring the movement of valuable or dangerous cargoes and improved emergency reporting procedures. In spite of the long-term nature of the programme, substantial progress on it is expected to have been made by the end of this year. Before 1993, the partners in the project intend to have evaluated all the likely alternative systems and formulated proposals for standardising the message and data exchange technology. They then expect to conduct large-scale field tests with integrated freight and fleet management systems, in co-operation with some of the existing large international transport chains. However, the Prometheus partners acknowledge that such technology-based approaches to greater efficiencies are unlikely to be wholly effective in the absence of co-ordinated legislative activity at EC and individual government level. As part of the process, they argue, it is essential for pan- European standards to be established for highway networks, traffic information systems and other 'harmonised' infrastructure through which the new technologies would need to work. The Prometheus estimates of the current cost of transport inefficiency appear certain to act as a significant incentive. Judging from the reaction of officials and bureaucrats from the main EC countries and institutions invited to Turin, the response is already strongly sympathetic. However, Prometheus is also likely to be seeking significantly more cash from governmental quarters. So far, the Prometheus projects between them have been swallowing funds at the rate of around Ecu90m a year, with government contributing some Ecu30m annually between them. But, as with the fleet management programme, many of the projects are moving from basic research and small-scale prototype work towards field trials and the need actually to manufacture hardware. In the past few months, the partners have formally committed themselves to extending their activities beyond 1994 and to strengthen Prometheus's management. But from then on, spending will have to rise to several - perhaps many  - times present levels. Without substantial extra government funding, it could fizzle out. Few within the programme, however, expect this to happen, for Prometheus's spending appears puny in comparison with the sums required under DRIVE, the EC programme for improving transport infrastructure with which Prometheus is complementary. The programme, which has already developed an Integrated Road Safety, Information and Navigation System (IRIS) plan, outlines the prospect of having to invest up to Ecu15bn in information technology and transport telecommunications alone, within 70 European cities and along Europe's main highways, for an integrated approach to traffic infrastructure to be successful. That excluded the Ecu50bn worth of equipment that would have to be fitted inside vehicles themselves to make use of it. The consolation, however, is that much of this is likely to be provided by the private sector, investing in both the equipment and the supply of the information services as new market sectors.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: New look for tables Readers of the Weekend FT will notice that the format and content of many statistical tables have been changed substantially. The changes were introduced first in Tuesday's edition. The aim has been to bring the tables up to date, in tune with the needs of readers. The most obvious difference is that the tables have been given a consistent type face. Equities. The London share service pages, which have been revamped in recent years, are largely unaffected by the changes. UK investors will note, however, that we have pulled together a number of statistics under the heading 'Key indicators' (see Inset for example; today's table appears on page 15 in the first section). From Tuesday to Friday, the best-performing sectors appear as in the Inset; on Saturdays, a full list of Leaders and Laggards appears elsewhere on the page. The Saturday paper also includes the FT-SE 100's closing level on each weekday. Substantial changes have also been made to our coverage of international equities (see page 20 of the first section). There is now scope for all shares to show highs, lows, dividend yields and price-earnings ratios. Although we are not yet able to show these figures for all the stocks, we hope to fill in the gaps over the next few months. We have also expanded our range of world stock market indices, including more from emerging markets. Equity options and futures now appear on the World Stock Markets page. Bonds. Coverage of international bonds is now concentrated on one page. On Saturdays, this page is headed Bonds and Commodities; from Tuesday to Friday, it is called International Capital Markets. Our gilts coverage has, therefore, moved from its old position (just before the London share service pages) to that page, which can be found today on page 12 of the first section. The only alteration to the format of the information provided is that details of the income and redemption yield are now shown on the left hand side, rather than on the right as before. Currencies. Because of the space created by moving some of the futures information to other pages, it has been possible to expand our coverage of currencies substantially. The two separate articles, on currencies and money markets, have been combined in a single report. The currency tables have been expanded to include a greater range of countries. The mid-rate is now shown explicitly, rather than being left for the reader to calculate. The table of cross-rates has also been expanded. All these statistics appear on page 13 in today's first section. Derivatives. The general rule is that tables which focus on derivatives will appear on the same page as statistics on the underlying markets. Thus, equity index futures and options will now be found on the World and London stock markets pages. All futures and options contracts will be shown in the same format and will be grouped together by product, rather than by the exchange on which they are traded. It is always disconcerting to find that statistics which are used regularly by readers have changed, or have been moved to a different position in the paper. But we believe the new structure is a considerable improvement and that readers will find the statistics even more useful than before.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State has also provided for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for public hearing, of any category or subcategory of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Final Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this action, the EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Texas for establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Texas has submitted a SIP revision for establishing each of the required PROGRAM elements required by section 507 of the CAA. The EPA has reviewed this revision to the Texas SIP and is approving it as submitted because the State's PROGRAM meets the requirements of section 507 of the CAA. The SIP includes a schedule of implementation, which commits the State to have all three principal PROGRAM elements fully implemented by November 15, 1994. SIP schedule implementation milestones are being tracked and monitored by the Region as part of the State's normal PROGRAM review. Currently, Texas has partially staffed and initiated the SBAP, designated and partially staffed the State Office to serve as Small Business Ombudsman, and created a CAP (and appointed five of its seven members). The CAP's initial meeting will be held by November 15, 1994. The State is implementing a model program with most elements in place well ahead of the EPA deadline of November 15, 1994 to have a fully operational program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, EPA has published a simultaneous proposed rule in this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This direct final action will be effective October 18, 1994, unless adverse or critical comments are received by September 19, 1994. If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn, and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule that is based on the proposed rule (please see the brief proposed rule published in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective October 18, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By this action, the EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved in this action does not impose any new regulatory burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the State. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 18, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUNDS OF SILENCE;  </P> <P> OUTER SPACE: A SMALL GROUP OF SCIENTISTS IS TURNING A TECHNOLOGICAL EAR  HEAVENWARD IN A SEARCH FOR OTHER INTELLIGENT LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE.  </P> <P> It's not easy listening to the universe. For one thing, there's the problem of  office space.  </P> <P> Consider Kent Cullers, for instance.  </P> <P> A big, paper-stuffed box labeled "Ice-Packed Sweet Corn" offers cardboard  evidence of his latest office move at NASA's Ames Research Center here. Still  stored away, too, is a special "camera" that allows Cullers to read on the tip  of a finger -- one letter at a time -- projections of documents, equations and  other data unavailable in Braille or via his talking computer.  </P> <P> Cullers, a blind, 40-year-old radio astronomer, belongs to a small band of  scientists who cling to an idea, even as they wander like bureaucratic nomads,  pushed from one gray office to another at Ames by projects with more money,  more people and more clout in the hierarchies of government.  </P> <P> Existing tenaciously on the fringes of federal funding, these scientists want  to look for intelligent life elsewhere in the galaxy, an exploration  generically tagged the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, or SETI.  </P> <P> As a group they are at the center of a web of hopes, dreams, unfettered  speculation, calculated guesses, philosophy and hard science that has become a  world of its own.  </P> <P> "SETI is a community, especially around here," said Cullers the other day,  sitting in the family heirloom rocker that holds pride of place -- just barely  -- in his office. "There are enough of us to be a community. It's always been  rather like a family enterprise. We're probably the biggest concentration of  SETI scientists right here (at Ames)."  </P> <P> Some 40 scientists work full-time or part-time on SETI at Ames. Another two  dozen spend at least some of their time on the NASA project at the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.  </P> <P> Cullers' colleague Jill Tarter noted, "We've already had a couple of  sociologists who have interviewed us and worked with us and studied us as a  case history of a new science getting started." She paused before adding, "It's  a little weird."  </P> <P> But the network extends wider than just the scientists who are involved, Tarter  said. "There is a SETI culture. We have people who are constantly writing for  information. We give lots of public, general information talks and they're  always jammed. And it's not just in California, it's all over the country."  </P> <P> The basic idea for SETI has been around at least since the turn of the century:  It may be possible to detect radio signals from another civilization.  </P> <P> The argument is that radio signals are by far the easiest method of  interstellar communication and, therefore, the most likely to be used by  advanced alien civilizations, if they exist.  </P> <P> In fact, limited, privately funded radio telescope searches for coded messages  have been carried out in the past. All were unsuccessful or produced puzzling,  indecipherable results. Other such private ventures are planned or being  conducted, including one by the Pasadena-based Planetary Society.  </P> <P> But Cullers and Tarter are part of what would the largest, widest-ranging  search yet, a two-pronged NASA survey that would target about 800 individual  stars within 80 light years or about 480 trillion miles of Earth, plus sweep  portions of the galaxy for the coded signals many believe are out there.  </P> <P> The "targeted" search would be conducted by the scientists at Ames while the  "sky survey" is the work of scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  </P> <P> If all goes as planned -- a very big if at this point, listening would start on  Columbus Day, 1992, the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America, and  continue until the turn of the century.  </P> <P> At the moment, scientists at Ames and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are  building the sensitive signal-processing receivers and computers that will be  hooked to large radio telescopes.  </P> <P> The computers will scan microwave radio frequencies -- a relatively noise-free  part of the radio spectrum -- for signals that might be artificial. Machines  will do most of the work, alerting controllers only when a signal passes tests  that screen out the more obvious forms of random noise.  </P> <P> Even so, the system's operators are likely to be alerted many times before they  may find "the fingerprint of E.T.," said Cullers, whose job title is "signal  detection team leader."  </P> <P> Cullers elaborated on the routine that may be followed if an apparently  legitimate signal is detected.  </P> <P> "If, first of all, something's gotten through the original net and they've  looked it up in the (radio) interference catalogue and it's not any known  source and they've moved the telescope around and they notice that when the  telescope is off source the signal goes away . . . then, all of us will be  brought in to determine what the source is."  </P> <P> Scientists would gather in a room here that is only beginning to fill with the  electronic gadgetry that will help sift the inscrutable noise of the cosmos.  With the dry humor that marks many of the scientists here, the room has been  named the User Operations Facility, a play on a set of ubiquitous and infamous  initials -- UFO.  </P> <P> But no one knows what to expect.  </P> <P> "As to what the signal is going to say, or what the aliens are going to look  like, it could be anything from the 'encyclopedia galactica' to a missionary  message, to a piece of propaganda," said Cullers. "The one thing I am certain  of is that when we get the message I will be surprised."  </P> <P> But everybody will want to be there.  </P> <P> "I've made people around here promise that if they get a signal and I'm alive,  they're going to let me know right away," said Charles Seeger, 77, who devoted  14 years to SETI before going into semi-retirement two years ago.  </P> <P> Seeger is a sort of oral historian of the program, a walking compendium of  successes and setbacks such as the death 10 years ago of a NASA administrator,  Tim Mutch, whose clout and support seemed to guarantee funding for the SETI  project.  </P> <P> "He fell off the side of Mt. Everest," Seeger said. "He broke his leg in fall  and the people with him stashed him in a shelter and went to get more help.  They came back the next day and he wasn't there. Nobody knows what happened. We  had to start from ground zero again. That's one of our legends."  </P> <P> To an outsider, SETI, at least at Ames, is a subculture of blinding contrasts,  a mixture of sublime goals and mundane details, of reaching for the stars and  fighting for the next buck, of staving off the demands of children and jotting  down one more thought at the end of the day.  </P> <P> "After a while, you take it in your stride and it becomes amusing," commented  John Billingham, acting chief of NASA's SETI office, as he ate a sandwich at  his desk. His office was in a much greater state of clutter than was Cullers  from unfinished moving. In fact, Billingham hardly seemed to have unpacked at  all.  </P> <P> "You take these initial wrenching steps," Billingham added, "from dealing with  fine details bureaucratic rules and regulations, to the other side of the coin,  which is appearing at major scientific meetings and giving papers on the  discovery and how to conduct searches, and the significance, the reasons we're  really doing it."  </P> <P> Even the most exotic goals have their routine, it seems.  </P> <P> "Here, I work pretty much a standard eight-hour day except for the fact that I  don't go to lunch," Cullers explained. "Then, typically, I will go home and  work a little bit in the evenings because it's exciting work. I'm always  getting ideas, I've always got to jot down just one more thing. Then I get up  at about 4:30 in the morning, and before my children get up and chaos reigns  supreme, I usually get in three hours or so of work in the morning."  </P> <P> The search for intelligent life in the cosmos is not an idea universally  respected. Detractors have argued, plausibly, that there is little chance life  exists elsewhere. Others maintain that civilizations on different solar systems  have nothing to say to each other.  </P> <P> More concretely, two weeks ago, the House of Representatives voted to kill all  $6.1 million in 1991 funding for the NASA project, a blow overshadowed by the  grounding of the Space Shuttle fleet and the debacle over the Hubble space  telescope.  </P> <P> Compared with the billions spent for the shuttle and the space telescope, SETI  funds are minuscule, supporters say. Over the life of the project, total cost  has been estimated at $100 million. SETI scientists hope that friends in the  Senate such as Jake Garn, the Utah Republican, will restore at least some of  the money to next year's federal budget.  </P> <P> When they voted to kill funding, congressmen seemed to feel the project was  that rare political commodity -- something small and odd enough to be safely  ridiculed.  </P> <P> "The thing that happens is that (SETI) subculture, unfortunately, gets mixed up  in many peoples minds with other subcultures like UFOS and astrology and  spoon-bending," said Billingham. "So we like to maintain a polite distance."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the Congressional Record shows that congressmen had a good time  reading UFO stories from supermarket tabloids into the record, despite the  decades of protestation by Billingham and others.  </P> <P> Moreover, Rep. Ronald Machtley, (R-R.I.) suggested that "if there is such a  super intelligent form of life out there, might it be easier just to listen and  let them call us?"  </P> <P> That is exactly what the SETI scientists want to do.  </P> <P> Radio astronomer Michael J. Klein, manager of the SETI program at the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory, expressed a thought voiced by many other scientists when  he decried the cutoff of funds.  </P> <P> "We don't have a bunch of people here moving money around through savings and  loans trying to make a quick buck," he said, referring to the wheeling and  dealing that have left many of the country's savings institutions bankrupt and  made them the target of massive federal monetary intervention amounting to  hundreds of billions of dollars. "Yet we get treated worse than the people who  have really ripped the public off with this whole savings and loan bailout."  </P> <P> Despite the misunderstandings of their work, SETI scientists have persisted,  they said, because they are driven by an idea that is irresistibly compelling.  </P> <P> While they admit that it may not be the most important scientific work of the  day, it is a concept so riveting that some have been searching -- or trying to  search or thinking about searching -- for decades.  </P> <P> Finding an alien civilization "would be most exciting discovery of all for our  civilization," said Billingham, a British-born physician who once specialized  in space medicine.  </P> <P> He is an old hand among SETI professionals. He began the SETI project at Ames  more than 20 years ago and has been a key person in keeping the sputtering  project alive.  </P> <P> "The basic arguments says that civilizations are widespread in the galaxy and  the universe," he said, describing the underpinnings of his profession. "These  arguments cannot be disproved but they can be proved. There are two ways of  proving them. One is to go after detection of a signal with an active search,  and the other, of course, is by serendipity. It's our opinion that learning it  by accident is a very small possibility."  </P> <P> Klein noted that there is growing evidence -- such as the likelihood of other  planets around other stars -- that at least indirectly support the notion of  life beyond the solar system.  </P> <P> "Earth doesn't seem to be some unique thing which just happened miraculously  out here," he said. "It seems to be something that could happen many times in  the galaxy. We still don't know how life starts and maybe it is miraculous but  I don't believe it is miraculous in one place."  </P> <P> Seeger agreed, saying: "So far every process that we've found working on Earth  that we could test in the rest of the galaxy, the rest of the universe, we've  found to operate there. There's something about our knowledge of the way life  started like a flash after the Earth congealed and the way it developed . . .  it looks like a basic process."  </P> <P> Klein has a hard-nosed attitude about the search that gives short shrift to  mysticism or other less-than-concrete motivations.  </P> <P> "I guess what appeals to me is the actual microwave search -- not all this  stuff about the role of the human in the universe," he said. "I think in  contrast to that we have here in the microwave observing project, at least  technologically, something we do understand. We know how to communicate across  interstellar distances. It may not be the best way. It may not be the correct  way that others might have chosen. But, by God, we know it'll work. . . . Let's  pick up this rock and see if we can hammer something with it."  </P> <P> But even true believers in the arguments that drive the SETI radio search  concede their chances of discovering a signal are small.  </P> <P> "I expect to be successful at that search," Tarter said. "Whether that is  sufficient to produce a signal, that is another question. I think anybody who  is working on this project has a very good concept of just how enormous, how  vast, this search that we're starting really is. We hope to be successful in  our lifetimes but understand that maybe it's going to be our children that  succeed in detecting the signal."  </P> <P> Whatever the chances of locating another civilization, the scientists seem  driven by the chance to do something that has never been done on such a scale  before.  </P> <P> "It will be exciting when we're on the air, oh, my goodness," said Seeger.  "It's a very tough job in the sense that you can't just grab some apparatus,  work for a year and get a yea or nay answer. . . . It's literally fishing with  the best technology we have at hand now in almost infinite space."  </P> <P> Because of its uncertain nature, Seeger believes that the search for other  civilizations is best handled by mature scientists who have had achievements in  other fields.  </P> <P> "No sane person graduating from college should commit himself to this  indefinite future, because what the hell is he going to be able to say he  achieved?" Seeger said.  </P> <P> Beyond the low chances for success, there are other pitfalls the SETI  scientists acknowledge. Perhaps the biggest one is that they may have pursued  their intricate chains of logic and technology to a dead end.  </P> <P> "That's the scary thing. Human beings have an amazing ability to form patterns  and data when there is no pattern or to get answers out of no information at  all," said Cullers. "We are operating in the absence of data. The only data we  have is the single example of us here on Earth and we don't know if we're the  most typical thing in the universe or an absolutely astonishing, nearly  miraculous event. Now my physical intuition says that we're typical and there  are lots of other civilizations out there just like us. Well, that physical  intuition and a dollar might get you a cup of coffee."  </P> <P> It gets even worse the longer the search goes on, Cullers said. "If I turn on  my (radio) telescope, and for years on end see nothing except for random noise,  is that because the search is hard or is that because my methods for looking  are no good?"  </P> <P> But if a signal is detected within the lifetimes of SETI scientists, Tarter  believes the rewards will be enormous. "The detection of another civilization,  a signal from such, would make us have to instantly accept the fact that the  differences among peoples on Earth are trivial compared to the difference with  this other completely alien civilization. We'd have to finally adopt a global  scale as the proper scale for managing of human affairs."  </P> <P> As project scientist at SETI, one of Tarter's recent jobs has been helping  develop a "post-detection protocol" that would take the task of alien detection  from science to diplomacy.  </P> <P> "Literally we spend a lot of time saying to people, 'OK, what if, this is real,  now what?' " Tarter explained. "We're now beginning to think about the next  step -- who will speak for Earth and what will we say? That's something that I  have no training for. It's not what I went to graduate school for."  </P> <P> Despite her lack of preparation for establishing relations with nonhuman  intelligence, Tarter commented, "I have to say, emphatically, that I really do  have the best job in the whole world. . . . There's nobody who has no opinion  at all about extraterrestrial life and that's pretty amazing."  </P> <P> At a guess, Cullers thinks a successful SETI search might take a thousand  years.  </P> <P> With a laugh he launched into his favorite analogy about the search for alien  intelligence. It is, he said, like searching a sandpile for a grain of gold --  a sandpile the size of a football field and 10 stories tall. Previous searches  have explored at most five to 10 grains of sand, he said.  </P> <P> Then he wound up with what seemed to be a well-practiced, rhetorically polished  conclusion, one forged from his decade of living with the uncertainties of the  universe.  </P> <P> "By the time we are finished, we may examine an entire thimbleful of sand," he  said. "Why am I ecstatic about that? Because it will be the first systematic  attempt to look at the frequencies and stars in our galaxy to see what's there.  And if there's one grain of gold in a thousand or even a million, we're likely  to find it. If it's one in a billion, we're going to have to look harder."  </P> <P> </P> <P> PAYING FOR SETI  </P> <P> The House of Representatives voted two weeks ago to kill all $6.1 million in  1991 funding for NASA's SETI project. Compared to the billions spent on the  Space Shuttle and Hubble telescope, the SETI funds are minuscule, supporters  say, adding they hope the Senate will restore at least some SETI aid in next  year's federal budget.  </P></p>

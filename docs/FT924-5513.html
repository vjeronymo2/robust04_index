			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / A testing time for gilts / A look at prospects for the UK government bond market Next year is likely to be an uncertain one for the UK government bond market. After the strong rally in gilt prices over the past two years, the outlook has deteriorated for several reasons: the scope for further interest rate cuts is limited; the gilt market will be flooded with new supply; and many investors, who are nervous about the prospects for sterling and the UK economy, believe they can obtain higher returns - with less risk - elsewhere. Institutional investors have reaped considerable profits from the gilt market over the past two years. Bond markets tend to perform well in a recession, boosted by falling interest rates: with the steady fall in the base rate from 15 per cent in 1989-90 to its current level of 7 per cent, gilts have performed well. However, the scope for further cuts in the base rate appears limited to one or two percentage points in the near term. 'The feeling in the market is 'we've had everything we can get, let's get out',' says one gilt-edged marketmaker. With the fall in bank and building society deposit rates, some private individuals are eager to lock into gilts to achieve a higher return, and gilt-edged marketmakers have reported strong demand from the retail sector in recent weeks. But Mr Richard Royds, managing director of the unit trust arm of Mercury Asset Management, the fund management group, points out that many retail investors are keener to invest in global bond funds than in plain gilt unit trusts. 'Private investors think there is not as much to go for in gilts as in international bonds: given that German interest rates will have to come down soon, there is much more to go for with the international story.' Of greater concern to investors is the heavy funding burden facing the gilt market. The government is forecasting a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) for 1993-94 of 7 per cent of GDP - or an estimated Pounds 44bn. Taking into account the repayment of maturing debt, the Bank of England will have to issue about Pounds 50bn to Pounds 55bn of gilt-edged stock in the next financial year, or roughly Pounds 1bn of gilts a week. 'The numbers just look daunting,' says Mr John Shepperd, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities. 'There's supply as far as the eye can see . . . it's going to be an uphill climb to issue that amount,' says Mr Roger Gray, head of fixed income and currency at Rothschild Asset Management. Admittedly, the forecast PSBR for 1992-93 is large too - Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, predicted Pounds 37bn in his Autumn Statement - and the gilt market has digested the heavy issuance of new stock so far relatively easily. But that was against a rather different backdrop: investors were willing to buy stock while the prospects for lower interest rates and lower inflation were good, and while sterling was a member of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). Next year's funding will be more difficult to achieve. 'The market is not going to be aided by hopes of lower inflation and lower interest rates this time,' says one gilt-edged marketmaker. Sterling's membership of the ERM of the European Monetary System since October 1990 proved a strong lure to investors during 1991 and early 1992. Foreigners - particularly Europeans - felt more comfortable with sterling in the ERM as it reduced the exchange rate risk on their gilt investments. More importantly, membership of the ERM was seen as exerting a much-needed economic discipline, forcing the government to keep inflation under control and allowing it to cut interest rates from their peak levels in 1989-1990. But sterling's ignominious departure from the ERM in September means overseas investors are less likely to invest in gilts because of the exchange rate risk. Foreigners were net sellers of gilts in August and September to the tune of Pounds 1.9bn, mainly because of sterling's battering in the foreign exchange markets. Many are still wary of the gilt market for currency reasons. Mr Herve Langlet, international bond portfolio manager at Indosuez Gartmore Gestions which manages funds on behalf of European and Japanese investors, says: 'The recent floating of sterling makes (foreign) investors very uneasy: a drop in the pound can obliterate any gain in the bond investment, and if there is a further cut in UK interest rates it could lead to a further weakening in the currency.' Added to which, both domestic and overseas investors are starting to worry about the outlook for inflation following sterling's exit from the ERM and the swift base rate cuts which followed its departure. 'We see inflation pulling up at the end of 1993, and gilts will worry about it beforehand,' says Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at Nomura International. Given the combination of worries about sterling, inflation and the heavy funding pressures, fund managers point out that yields on gilts relative to other European bond markets will have to increase in order to attract institutional money and fund the government's borrowing requirement. Fund managers point out that they can achieve more attractive returns from the French government bond market, where the economic outlook in terms of growth and inflation is rosier than for the UK. If the Bundesbank were to lower interest rates that would certainly provide some relief for the gilt market. It would help sterling to stabilise against the D-Mark and would precipitate a round of rate cuts in continental Europe, resulting in lower yields in the European bond markets relative to gilt yields. But failing a cut in German rates, gilt yields will probably have to rise to attract institutional investors. 'At the moment I can see no way the gilt market can achieve the necessary level of funding,' says the fixed income manager for one of the leading fund management groups. 'The government deficit will be financed but the question is: at what price will the money flow into the government's coffers? Yields will simply have to rise in order to increase the attractiveness of gilts.' Mr Gray of Rothschild agrees: 'There is a huge volume of gilts in the pipeline. If it is to find its way into institutional portfolios, yields will have to be sufficient to tempt the portfolio managers to hold stock.'</p>

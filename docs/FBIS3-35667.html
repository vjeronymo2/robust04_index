Georgia was represented at the talks, which lasted 16 hours,  by Aleksandr Kavsadze, chairman of the Stet Committee on Ethnic  Relations and Human Rights, Abkhazia by Andrey Dzhergenia, a  special envoy of the parliamentary chairman. The negotiations  were mediated by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov  and a representative from the U.N. High Commission for Refugees.    Dzhergenia and Kavsadze told Interfax the quadrilateral  agreement had not been signed due to disagreements on one of its  clauses, that on the refugees' safety.    The Abkhazian side insisted that immunity do not apply to  those refugees who had fought against "lawful Abkhazian  authority." Kavsadze, however, said this formula would always  make it difficult for refugees to return home and would legalize  ethnic purges, for it "justifies those who fought against the  Georgians and represents Georgians as criminals."    Dzhergenia said the plan could begin to be carried out after  the agreement was signed, but the date set for it by the  communique on the results of Georgian-Abkhazian talks held in  Geneva on January 11-13 is February 10.    Kavdsadze believes the plan should start to be put into  operation as soon as possible, for he fears the refugees may  start coming back by themselves, which, he said, might lead to  new bloodshed.</p>

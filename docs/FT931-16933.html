			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Tales of two markets It is no small irony that much of Europe hovers in or near recession at the start of 1993. In the minds of consumers and businessmen the much-heralded single market adventure, which was to promote prosperity and trade, has been overshadowed by falling demand and rising unemployment. In part that is due to the world recession, which began in the Anglo-Saxon economies. But high German interest rates are now the main drag on European growth. And while the UK can now pursue an expansionary monetary policy free of its ERM chains, most of continental Europe faces a bleak prospect until German rates fall substantially. By contrast the huge single market on the other side of the Atlantic is faring much better. Low interest rates, a competitive dollar and wholesale rationalisation of industries have finally combined to spark economic growth in the US - much of it coming from increasing industrial investment. This decoupling of economic prospects between the US and Europe suggests that investment performance on either side of the Atlantic is likely to differ widely in 1993.</p>

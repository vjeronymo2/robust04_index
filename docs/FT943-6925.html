			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Taiwan to sell off bank State-owned Farmers Bank of China has been added to a list of Taiwan government-run companies designated for privatisation, Laura Tyson writes from Taipei. In a stock exchange listing set for November, the government will cut its stake in the bank to 61.5 per cent from 92.3 per cent through an offering of 250m shares, a bank spokesman said. Taiwan first announced a privatisation scheme in 1989 in which 22 state-run companies would be sold off to raise Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13bn) for central government coffers. But progress was set back by bureaucratic resistance, workers' protests and a volatile stock market. Just three state companies have been privatised to date - Chung Kuo Insurance, BES Engineering and China Petrochemical Development.</p>

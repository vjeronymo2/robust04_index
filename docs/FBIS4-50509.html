			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- To facilitate the  implementation of the "Interim Regulations Governing State  Public Servants," to supervise and encourage public servants to  fulfill duties honestly and diligently, and to improve office  work efficiency, the Personnel Ministry recently promulgated the  "Interim Provisions for Evaluating State Public Servants," thus  epitomizing the standardization and institutionalization of  evaluation of public servants.    It is understood that the "provisions" clearly define the  principle of fairness in evaluating public servants and require  that they be evaluated both periodically and on a routine basis  and by supervisors as well as the masses. Public servants are  evaluated in four areas: morality, capability, diligence, and  performance, with the focus on actual work performance. The  evaluation criterion should be based on the position, duties,  and work assignments of public servants who are rated as  outstanding, satisfactory, or unsatisfactory. The number of  public servants rated as outstanding should not exceed 15  percent of the public servants in each department.    The "provisions" demand that the evaluation of public  servants should attach importance to actual results and should  be simple, convenient, and easily carried out. The evaluation,  which is to be made by senior department officials, is divided  into routine and annual evaluation. Routine evaluation, to be  carried out at any time, requires a public servant being  evaluated to factually fill in work records; whereas annual  evaluation is to be carried out once a year at yearend or at the  beginning of the next year. The basic procedures of annual  evaluation, which is based on routine evaluation, are as  follows: a public servant being evaluated first makes a summary  of his or her own performance; after listening to opinions of  the masses, the public servant's immediate supervisor writes  comments and recommends an evaluation rating on the basis of  routine evaluation records and the individual's performance  summary; the evaluation committee or group examines the  supervisor's comments and recommendations; and after a senior  department official decides on an evaluation rating, the  evaluation committee or group will send a written notification  to the public servant concerned.    The "provisions" also demand that state administrative  institutions set up ad hoc annual evaluation committees or  groups to take charge of the annual evaluation of public  servants under the supervision of a senior department official.  The ad hoc evaluation committee is made up of senior department  officials and representatives of public servants. The number of  representatives, to be elected through democratic procedures,  should be at least one third of the total number of members of  the committee or group. The responsibilities of evaluation  committees or groups are, in accordance with the relevant  provisions, to formulate procedures for conducting annual  evaluation; to organize, coordinate, and supervise each  department's annual evaluation work; to examine evaluation  comments and recommendations for rating written by the immediate  supervisor; and to examine application for reconsideration by  public servants who are not satisfied with evaluation results.    To make the evaluation more effective, the "provisions"  provide appropriate rewards and penalties for evaluation  results: public servants receiving a satisfactory or above  rating in their annual evaluation will be given a cash award  equivalent to one month's salary; those receiving a satisfactory  or above rating for two consecutive years will be given an  in-grade step increase in salary; those receiving an outstanding  rating for two consecutive years or a satisfactory or above  rating for three consecutive years will be qualified for job  promotions; and those receiving an outstanding rating for three  consecutive years, or a satisfactory or above rating for five  consecutive years, will be promoted to the next higher grade of  the current posts. Public servants whose performance is deemed  unsatisfactory in annual evaluation will be demoted to a lower  position job; and those receiving an unsatisfactory rating for  two consecutive years will be dismissed.    In addition, the "provisions" also provide specific  procedures for public servants to apply for reconsideration of  evaluation results.</p>

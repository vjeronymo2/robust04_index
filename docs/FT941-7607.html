			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Hattersley to quit at next election Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's former deputy leader, is to leave parliament at the next general election after more than 30 years as an MP. His decision, although not unexpected, will deprive Labour of one of its few MPs with ministerial experience. Yesterday's announcement came just two weeks after Mr Bryan Gould, another leading Labour figure of the past decade, said he was quitting politics to return to his native New Zealand. Mr Hattersley, 61, a novelist and accomplished newspaper columnist, told officials in his Birmingham Sparkbrook constituency that in two years he would want to 'concentrate on books not speeches'. He suggested that his successor should come from 'one of the minority communities who have made their home in this constituency'. A Yorkshireman with a fondness for the good life, Mr Hattersley served for three years in the Callaghan cabinet of the late 1970s as secretary of state for prices and consumer protection. He is better remembered as the junior partner to Mr Neil Kinnock on the 'dream ticket' of 1983 that was to lead the party to two straight general election defeats. Mr Hattersley was widely seen as the former leader's rightwing foil, especially in the early days of their partnership. His departmental responsibilities, first as Labour's chief Treasury spokesman and later as spokesman for home affairs, helped him maintain a high profile at Westminster.</p>

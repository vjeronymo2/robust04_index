The  Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan had invited al-'Aryan and  al-Hudaybi to visit Jordan.    AL-SABIL learned that the authorities did not give any  convincing reasons for banning these two figures from entering  the Kingdom. It is known that Counselor al-Hudaybi has visited  Jordan several times, the last time was four months ago.  Al-Hudaybi also led a delegation from the Islamic Movement in  Egypt on a visit to Jordan in 1989 to meet with His Majesty King  Husayn to congratulate him on the parliamentary elections.    Sources in the Islamic Movement in Jordan expressed deep  regret and surprise at this step, which takes place at a time  when our country is boasting about the democratic atmosphere and  the openness prevailing in it. The Islamic sources said that  there is no explanation for banning these two figures from  entering Jordan at this particular time, particularly since such  a measure would tarnish the image of our country whose doors  have always been open for guests from all sisterly and friendly  countries.</p>

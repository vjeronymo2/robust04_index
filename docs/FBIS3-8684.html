Addressing a session of the Moslem government in Sarajevo,  Ljubijankic rejected the idea of granting cantonal status to  western Bosnia, Bosnian Serb military sources say.    Cantonal organization modelled after the one in the Swiss  confederation is envisaged in a Croat-Moslem deal on forming a  federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina which would subsequently enter  into a confederation with neighbouring Croatia. The deal was  signed in Washington on March 1 under strong U.S. pressure.    Radical Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic, who has sent troops  to western Bosnia to force it to abandon the idea of autonomy,  accuses Abdic of breaking up Bosnia.    Ljubijankic urged Bosnian Croat officials to suspend all aid  to Abdic and cut off land routes to western Bosnia, arguing that  this would help win over Abdic's followers for the government in  Sarajevo.    Abdic, who believes that the Bosnian crisis should be  resolved in talks with the local Serbs and Croats, has  repeatedly accused Izetbegovic of continuing the war in an  attempt to create an Islamic state and of sacrificing his own  people to achieve this goal.</p>

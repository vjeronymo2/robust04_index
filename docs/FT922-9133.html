			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Chevron wins deal in Kazakhstan oilfields CHEVRON Corporation, the fourth largest US oil company, has signed a long-awaited agreement with the republic of Kazakhstan that could lead to the multi-billion dollar development of one of the world's largest new oilfields. The deal is the most significant venture agreed between a western oil company and the authorities in the former Soviet Union and offers encouragement to many other companies currently embroiled in negotiations. The company said that after four years of negotiations it had signed a protocol for the creation of a joint venture in the Tengiz area. The Tengiz oilfield near the Caspian Sea is estimated to contain as much as 25bn barrels of oil - equal to the size of Saudi Arabia's entire oil reserves. Chevron said that when work began on the project, it would involve an initial investment of Dollars 1.5bn by the venture partners over the first three years. The company gave no timetable for the project. Reports of the deal in the Russian press say that 80 per cent of the profits from the venture would be allocated to Kazakhstan. A previous deal over Tengiz which Chevron had tentatively agreed two years ago came in for fierce criticism from the Russian press for selling natural resources too cheaply. That deal was believed to involve a 28 per cent profit margin for the US company. Mr Kenneth Derr, Chevron's chairman, said: 'We are pleased that after long discussion we've reached this breakthrough.' The company returned to the negotiating table late last year once the break-up of the former USSR was underway, transferring power over resource deals to the governments of the republics. Mr Derr said the agreement covers the Tengiz field, the Korolev field and an exploration area extending over 4,000 square kilometres. The Tengiz field contains oil at very high pressure with a high sulphur content. For this reason, it will be expensive to exploit and demands sophisticated technology not available in the former USSR. Estimates for the amount of oil that can be recovered from the 25bn barrels of reserves run at 3-4bn barrels. The deal is also believed to include the construction of an oil pipeline to one of the Black Sea ports. Mr Derr said in a recent interview: 'From our standpoint, it's a very high risk deal, but the size of it is unique and it could have a meaningful impact on a company of our size for a long time.' The joint venture is expected to be in place for 40 years and is widely regarded as a showcase deal. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, former Soviet foreign minister, said last year: 'It is no secret that the US will judge our readiness to co-operate by the success or failure of this project.' Wall Street took a positive view of the venture: 'It will have no major impact on earnings for three to four years,' said Mr Paul Mlotok at Morgan Stanley, 'but getting access to 25bn barrels of oil has got to be a big plus.' However, other industry observers sounded a note of caution, pointing out that Chevron has only signed an initial protocol and the project could still be subjected to long delays or even cancellation. The award of a feasibility study for Russia's giant Sakhalin oil project is currently being reviewed. Kazakhstan president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, publicly welcomed Chevron's involvement.</p>

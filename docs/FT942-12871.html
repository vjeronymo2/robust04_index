			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (4): Handling down days - Interview with the chairman of the futures exchange On January 3 of this year, his first full day on the job, Mr Ivers Riley could only watch as the key futures index plunged 1,060 points. As newly-installed chief executive of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange, he could be forgiven for viewing the fall - which prompted three intra-day margin calls - as less than auspicious. But to Mr Riley, a veteran of the derivatives world, the fall proved one thing: the Futures Exchange which he had inherited was not going to crumble in the face of massive volatility or rampaging bears. 'It gave me an absolute validation that I was right; that the mechanism had been fixed. Because of the reput- ation from 1987 (when the effects of the global crash were exacerbated by the closure of the colony's stock and futures exchanges) it was felt that maybe it could not handle big down days: but it worked perfectly,' he says. 'That gave me a base to go and talk to international companies, to say that not only is Hong Kong telling you it has fixed its problems, it has also proven it has fixed them. That allows us to move forward, and so I've gotten more aggressive than I had planned in terms of looking at new things to introduce.' Introducing programmes and contracts is very much Mr Riley's thing. It is he who, in the mid-1970s, was responsible for the introduction and institution of a trading programme for the first listed put options; more recently, he launched a raft of products on the American Stock Exchange, including Hong Kong Index warrants. His plans for the Hong Kong market are still under wraps, though he is certain to bring in China-related contracts and, next year, currency options. There will also be an overhaul of existing contracts, the bulk of which are dormant - the gold contracts trades four a day for pricing purposes; futures contracts on the Hang Seng sub-indices and interest rates are likewise inactive. Mr Riley says: 'I am making it quite clear to other exchanges that we would like to be original. We would like to be first and therefore the concept would be to build contracts down to the very last detail.' But the immediate matters on his agenda are more nuts-and-bolts concerns: growing demand for and interest in derivatives has triggered a rapid increase in the number of traders on the floor. The trading floor population has more than doubled to 300-plus, and - in anticipation of further growth to 400 and a sticky Hong Kong summer - workmen will descend to crank up the air conditioning and other facilities. Although Hong Kong's notorious shortage of space is also hurting the exchange's would-be members (the technology-oriented nature of the business puts heavy demand on office space) neither the problems nor the high costs entailed in resolving it have stemmed the flow of international houses coming to the colony. Mr Riley says many market makers are starting to come in, with two big institutions, including Hull Trading, moving in over the next month. The growth of users and anticipated launch of currency contracts which will be traded across different time zones has spurred the second priority: installation of an electronic trading system Installing systems may all seem a little basic for a man who started his career at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, but Mr Riley has never fought shy of quitting Rolls-Royce set-ups for less-established brands if the scope for development is greater. He raised eyebrows in 1986 when he jumped ship from the New York stock exchange (where he was in charge of derivatives, bonds and market data) to the American stock exchange. 'I believe in accepting offers when there's an opportunity,' he says. His new appointment (which ran counter to the exchange's earlier pledge to have an ethnic Chinese sitting at its head) is directly related to his overseas experience: Hong Kong wants to be known as an international centre. and is eager to be accepted on a global level. Indeed, this is the dominant theme on the long-term agenda. Facilitating Hong Kong's role as an international marketplace are its useful global positioning in terms of time zones and geographic location in the most dynamic part of the world and on the doorstep of China. Mr Riley's view of 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty, is simply that it enhances this position. However, while Hong Kong may still have some catching up to do when it comes to keeping pace with the US, Mr Riley notes a number of common factors between the two markets. 'The institutional side of the market did not develop until there was some confidence in Hong Kong, and that started to happen in 1993 and in late 1993 we saw that not just the mechanism held up but also liquidity was there, so now there is an international institutional customer base mixed with individual money. That is very similar to the US and different to other countries, such as the UK, where there is hardly any public (retail) business. 'Perhaps you get stability and liquidity because of this, because when institutions dry up they tend to do so all at once, but the public may not have the same opinions at the same time so there is no lemming effect,' he says. Also similar is the make-up of the market: 80 per cent of business is carried out by 10 per cent of the players. Of the differences, Hong Kong's links with China perhaps yield the biggest potentials, and Mr Riley has already opened talks with some of the myriad futures exchanges across the border. A string of business relationships and deals is likely to emerge over the coming years, and the exchange already provides a clearing service for Nanjing Petroleum. Mr Riley concedes it is 'unfortunate' not to speak the local language (he told American reporters quizzing him on this deficiency after announcing his departure from the American stock exchange that he was bilingual: 'I speak English and derivatives') but spent a fortnight learning numbers in Cantonese so he could at least work out what was going on on the trading floor. On the personal front the biggest difference, he says, is getting used to space measured in square feet not hectares. But he adds: 'I would never move into New York City, and yet I love living in Hong Kong.'</p>

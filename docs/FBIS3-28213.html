			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chong In-hwa] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that North Korea, which is  facing internal and external adversities, including the nuclear  issue and economic difficulties, is reducing the scale of  celebrations for Kim Chong-il's birthday this year compared to  previous years.    According to the National Unification Board [NUB] on 3  February, North Korea is only holding two events on the occasion  of Kim Chong-il's upcoming 52d birthday, which is 16 February,  compared with over 20 domestic and international events held in  previous years. The source said the scale of the events are  being reduced and noted that the individual competition of the  Fourth 16 February Arts Award, which opened on 18 January, is  being held without the participation of overseas Korean artists.    To create a birthday celebration atmosphere, North Korea  completed a heating system; is carrying out city beautification  works, including the rearrangement of flower beds in cities and  cleaning of waterworks and sewage; and issued commemorative  stamps and postcards.    Regarding domestic events, the 16 February Arts Awards and  the Athletes Games in Mt. Paektu opened on 18 January and 1  February, respectively.    As to international events, a preparatory committee for the  celebration of Kim Chong-il's birthday was formed in Mozambique  on 20 January; film shows were held in Tanzania, Nigeria, and  Ghana during 19 to 21 January; and a study institute of Kim  Chong-il's works, including the "Azalea in Deep Mountain" and  "The Seeds," was formed in Japan early January.    The NUB analyzes that such a scale of events is considerably  reduced compared with the 50th birthday in 1992 and the 51st  birthday last year.    In 1992, a "relay of loyalty letter," which had only been  held on Kim Il-song's birthday, was held for the first time, and  another relay of similar scale was held in 1993 in connection  with the Eighth Congress of the League of Socialist Working  Youth of Korea.    Celebration events for Kim Chong-il's birthday began in  February 1974 and the day was designated a holiday in 1975. The  celebrations expanded remarkably after Kim Chong-il was elected  member of the Party's Standing Committee during the Sixth Party  Congress in October of 1980.    On the 40th birthday in 1982, a decree of the Central  People's Committee designated the whole month of February as  "Festive February" and upgraded the celebration as an event next  to the celebration of Kim Il-song's birthday.    An NUB official analyzed: "Although there is a point where  the scale of the birthday celebration is reduced because it is  not a special birthday that falls on every fifth birthday (a  multiple of five or 10), however, it is deemed that the change  reflects a shrinking atmosphere due to economic difficulties and  the nuclear issue."</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Wassall keeps its options open on Evode bid Wassall, the mini-conglom-erate, yesterday gave itself the option of increasing its Pounds 113.2m final offer for Evode, the chemicals and plastics group, by withdrawing its recent statement in which it said its bid would not be increased. The Wassall board said this decision was taken following the competitive situation which arose as a result of the announcement by Laporte, the UK's second largest quoted chemicals group, that it was close to making a recommended bid above Pounds 1 a share for Evode. The news took Wassall by surprise. It had just announced its final offer of 95.2p a share.</p>

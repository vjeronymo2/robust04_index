			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / People: Planners for UK civil disasters The UK's contingency planning for dealing with serious civil emergencies is passing into new hands. The responsibility for co-ordinating emergency planning will fall to Rear Admiral David Bawtree, who becomes civil emergencies adviser when Air Vice-Marshal David Brook retires on October 18. Promoting emergency preparedness is now the job of Air Vice-Marshal Allan Blackley, who took over as principal of the Emergency Planning College on September 13 following the retirement of Brigadier John Bettridge. Bawtree, 55, recently retired from the navy after 38 years' service, during which he was naval base commander for Portsmouth. His involvement in safety and emergency planning for the navy involved the sort of liaison and co-operation with local and central government that will be his duty to encourage in his new post. The Emergency Planning College runs courses and seminars to publicise best practice in planning for major emergencies. Blackley, 55, has 34 years' air force service. He was operational commander of the military search and rescue organisation, co-ordinating air force and naval efforts.</p>

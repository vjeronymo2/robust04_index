			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Ban on Shia sect teachings The Malaysian government will ban the teachings of Darul Arqam, a radical Malaysian Islamic Shia group led the self-styled Abuya Sheikh Imam Ashaari Muhammad. In June, officials described Darul Arqam as a threat to national security and the government has accused Ashaari Muhammad of claiming to be the Iman Mahdi (the second prophet) and of building an armed, 313-member suicide squad trained in Thailand. No evidence has been produced on the suicide squads. Although the Malaysian constitution espouses freedom of religion that has been interpreted to mean the freedom of the non-Malay races to practise non-Islamic religions, the government has in the past, detained Islamic radicals. Darul Arqam, founded in 1969, claims a following of 10,000. Group publications say Ashaari preaches returning to life as the Prophet Mohammed decreed. He demands 'undivided obedience' to his mind and teachings while rejecting armed revolutions and western politics and preparing for the day when he will be 'handed over the administration of the country.'</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / MTS container port company seeks restructuring after losses MARITIME Transport Services, the company developing the new Thamesport container facility at the Isle of Grain in Kent, is discussing a financial restructuring with its banks after making pre-tax losses of Pounds 18.5m in 1991, mainly due to interest charges. According to the company's latest accounts, filed at Companies House three weeks late, MTS breached some of its banking covenants last May. The company agreed with its banks to defer about Pounds 9.5m of interest payments and has negotiated a Pounds 2m overdraft extension. The directors, led by chief executive Mr Geoffrey Parker, said they hoped to complete the restructuring before the end of May. The company has drawn down about Pounds 110m of its arranged loan facilities of Pounds 150m, and is not likely to seek new facilities under the restructuring. According to one of the main institutional backers, 'everyone is happy with the management, it's just been very tough trading'. Thamesport, which was developed from a greenfield site and designed to be one of the most modern facilities in the UK, has been hit by recession and has not met its targets for container throughput. The port is operating at about one-third its annual capacity of 400,000 containers. A company spokesman confirmed restructuring talks were 'actively' under way. 'The banks are very positive and unanimously in support of the restructuring,' he said. The 1991 figures, which show a pre-interest loss of Pounds 1m, covered the port's first full year's trading and included a full contribution from Evergreen, the Taiwanese carrier which switched to Thamesport from Felixstowe. Since then, other large shipping lines have signed contracts with Thamesport, but MTS is still thought to have made an operating loss last year. Phase 3 of the development, planned as a bulk cargo terminal and to be under construction by this year, is likely to be delayed because of low throughputs. The company had hoped to use the terminal for coal imports, but said yesterday it may now be switched to container use. MTS was a 1989 management buy-out from Mr Peter de Savary's Thames Estuary Terminals. Institutions, led by County NatWest Ventures and Legal &amp; General, hold about 80 per cent of the share capital.</p>

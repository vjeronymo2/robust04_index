			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Comex Dubai oil trading gets green light THE COMMODITY Futures Trading Commission has approved the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) as a contract market for Dubai sour crude futures. The contract will be traded in open outcry and will use an mutual offset system in co-operation with the International Petroleum Exchange in London. This system will allow market users to enter or exit positions on either exchange during their respective market hours. Mr Donna Redel, Comex's newly-elected chairman, said that the contract was important for the exchange's plans to diversify. Its launch, however, is not expected soon and will be co-ordinated with the IPE.</p>

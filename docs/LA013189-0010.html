			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A three-alarm fire early Monday at a Mission Gorge restaurant was caused by an  employee who accidentally left food cooking unattended, firefighters said.  </P> <P> Firefighters were called to The Bake House, 10450 Friars Road, about midnight.  When the flames began burning through the kitchen ceiling, the first  firefighters on the scene evacuated the building and summoned reinforcements,  said Larry Stewart, a spokesman for the San Diego Fire Department. About 100  firefighters eventually were dispatched to fight the blaze.  </P> <P> Although there were no injuries, a burning piece of facade fell and nearly hit  one firefighter, Stewart said. He escaped injury when two other firefighters  pulled on the hose he was holding, drawing him out from under the facade as it  fell.  </P> <P> Two neighboring businesses, The Main Attraction and Troy's Jr. Greek &amp;  American Cuisine, suffered ceiling and attic damage. Damage to The Bake House  was estimated at $1 million.  </P></p>

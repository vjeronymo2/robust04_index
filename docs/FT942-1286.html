			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa fails to find spur Johannesburg was mixed as the generally improved mood following Wednesday's nat-ional budget was countered by a lower gold bullion price. Trading was slow, as the package failed to spur a hoped-for recovery in demand, particularly by foreign investors. A stronger rand hampered export-oriented companies, especially gold mining issues, after bullion's softer showing undermined prices in the sector. The overall index finished 17 softer at 5,688, industrials firmed 4 to 6,586 and golds lost 21 at 2,222. De Beers retrieved an early fall to end unchanged at R113.75. Anglos shed 50 cents to R238 and JCI R1 to R105. Iscor collected 5 cents at R3.63, adding to its 9-cent advance registered on Wednesday. SAB was steady at R91.</p>

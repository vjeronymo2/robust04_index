			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 1 (AFP)--A cholera epidemic hit  China last year, killing 142 people as the number of cases rose  to the highest level in a decade, Health News [JIANKANG BAO]  reported Friday. A total of 11,717 cases of cholera were  reported in 12 of China's 30 provinces, the newspaper said,  categorising the situation as an epidemic that began in about  April and reached its high-point in September and October.    Two different strains were found, it said, describing their  origins as "complicated." It did not specify whether either was  the aggressive new 0139 strain of cholera, which has already  killed thousands in India and Bangladesh. In August, China  acknowledged that the mutant strain, which attacks people who  would normally have immunity after having cholera, had killed at  least two people in the far northwestern province of Xinjiang.    Health News said the low incidence of cholera in China for  the past 10 years was partly to blame for the rapid spread of  last year's epidemic because the population's immunity was low.  Unhygienic food and water supplies in rural areas and inadequate  grassroots health services had also contributed to the problem,  the report said.    The ministry of health has ordered local authorities to  emphasize prevention, particularly in areas where cholera has  been a problem, it said. Special clinics should be set up and  new cases reported to the ministry immediately, it added.</p>

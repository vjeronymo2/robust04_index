			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: C&amp;J Clark dissenters reveal plan A GROUP of shareholders in C&amp;J Clark, opposed to the Pounds 184m bid from Berisford International recommended by a majority of the private shoe group's board, yesterday outlined its alternative to the takeover. The plan was sent to shareholders in a letter. The dissident group, which has adopted the acronym Shoes, said its plan was for a shareholder council and a flotation of the company. This would lead to 'future stability', Mr Hugh Pym of Shoes said, advising shareholders to turn down the offer. Terms from Berisford, the property and trading group, comprise 213p in cash or securities plus 26p of deferred cash from the planned sale of properties. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, this week completed the twice yearly valuation of Clark shares putting a price on them of 100p. The next few days will be crucial in the Clark saga as the various factions put their cases to meetings with shareholders and employees, culminating in an extraordinary meeting on May 7 when Berisford's proposals will be put to a vote. Mr Alan Mackay, finance director of Clark, said the Shoes letter was 'not helpful at all and I do not think it (the plan) is deliverable.' A previous attempt to float Clark failed when insufficient shareholders voted in favour of necessary changes to the company's pre-emptive rights structure. Mr Mackay said the seven directors who recommended the bid 'feel the offer from Berisford has the merit of certainty and solves a number of problems which have been bedevilling Clarks for years.' Setting up a shareholder council, representing family members, would lead to a two-tier board. Mr Mackay said this 'does not appear to represent a simple solution'. Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive of Berisford, said that a shareholder council would tend to increase the conflict at Clark, not reduce it. He said Shoes' commitment to a flotation was not something Shoes, none of whose representatives are officers of the company, could deliver and it revealed a lack of knowledge of the Stock Exchange rule book. Shoes argued that the shares are worth 278p - the net asset value in the latest balance sheet. Mr Bowkett asked 'is Mr Pym making an offer of 278p? Is he promising 278p? It is all rather misleading.'</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ROMANIA;  </P> <P> OPPOSITION CALLS FOR DELAY IN ELECTIONS  </P> <P> Romania's major opposition parties demanded a delay in elections scheduled May  20 to allow more time to challenge the post-revolutionary leadership, which has  been attacked for its ties to the old regime. The demand represents the first  time the fractious opposition has openly pooled its forces to stop the National  Salvation Front's bid for long-term power. The National Peasant's Party and the  National Liberal Party, the two largest opposition groups, joined forces with  smaller parties in sending their demands to interim President Ion Iliescu.  </P></p>

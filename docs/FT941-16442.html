			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: London Investors appeared to be taking a breather last week, when trading was thin and prices drifted lower. But they should have some more substantial domestic economic figures to chew on over the next fortnight. Earnings and unemployment figures are due this week and December retail sales and inflation figures are due on January 19. Traders will be watching for signs of inflationary pressures that might prevent the government from cutting base rates. 'Earnings growth has fallen to 3 per cent and it is vital to the bull case for gilts that the rate of growth does not pick up,' says Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Warburg Securities. Long gilts fell about 1 1/2 points between Tuesday and Thursday last week. The higher-than-expected growth in the M0 narrow money supply measure was not encouraging. The M0 rise, and an 8.6 per cent annual increase in notes in circulation for the week to January 5, indicated buoyant spending over the Christmas/new year period. However, overseas factors were the main influence for much of the week. The Bundesbank left rates unchanged on Thursday, and in the early part of the week investors were fearful that the Fed might tighten US rates. But Friday's weaker-than-expected US employment numbers helped gilts to rally along with US Treasuries.</p>

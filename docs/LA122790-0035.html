			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: WITH TV, IT'S POLITICIANS AS USUAL  </P> <P> The network news executives met to decide what politicians they would book for  the 1991 season.  </P> <P> All the guests for the news shows had been used up in 1990, so the executives  were faced with renewing them or putting them on waivers for the new year.  </P> <P> Blunt said: "Do we want to sign up Secretary of Defense Cheney for another 12  months?"  </P> <P> Blowtorch replied: "He's been on every program, including 'People's Court.'  Frankly, I think he's overexposed."  </P> <P> "Who else can we get to speak for defense -- Ollie North?" Notory yelled.  "Let's renew Cheney until we find another spokesperson, preferably a tall  blonde who looks like Jane Pauley."  </P> <P> "OK, we stick with Cheney. What do we do about Secretary of State Baker's  contract?" Blunt asked.  </P> <P> "If we keep Baker as a guest, why do we need Henry Kissinger? They both say the  same thing."  </P> <P> "Yeah, but with different accents."  </P> <P> "Why don't we hold on to Baker for television and save Kissinger for radio?"  Notory suggested.  </P> <P> "How about Baker for the Brinkley show and Kissinger for 'Nightline'?"  </P> <P> Blunt said: "The last time we used Baker on the Brinkley show, we got a 3  rating."  </P> <P> Blowtorch protested: "It's not the person, it's the job. Secretaries of state  never get good ratings."  </P> <P> Notory said: "Are we renewing Sununu?"  </P> <P> "You better believe it. There is nobody with as much fire in his belly as  Sununu. Barbara Walters would take him over Donald Trump and Marla Maples  combined."  </P> <P> "I hate to think of what 'Meet the Press' would be like without Sununu."  </P> <P> "Not to mention all of CNN."  </P> <P> "I know that this is a silly question," Notory said, "but are we renewing Dan  Quayle?"  </P> <P> "We have to lighten up Sam Donaldson somehow," Blunt replied. "Besides, our  surveys indicate the viewers like watching Quayle for the same reason they  enjoy watching a train wreck."  </P> <P> Blowtorch interrupted: "Let's move along. How do we feel about signing up  Secretary of Treasury Brady as a guest?"  </P> <P> "Nobody knows who Brady is. You could put his picture on every milk carton in  America, and they still wouldn't have any idea why he was on television."  </P> <P> "If we don't take Brady, we need one more person from the Bush Administration  to service 'Face the Nation.' "  </P> <P> "There is none," Blunt retorted. "We're going to have to sign Newt Gingrich  again."  </P> <P> "If we use Gingrich, we're going to have to invite House Speaker Tom Foley."  </P> <P> "I saw Foley talk about the budget on McNeil/Lehrer, and he took the show to  the bottom of the sea. He died about the same time they did."  </P> <P> "So where does that leave us?"  </P> <P> "We still have one more possibility. Are we going to use Jesse Jackson as a  guest on the 'Today' show or not?"  </P> <P> Blunt sighed: "What choice do we ever have?"  </P></p>

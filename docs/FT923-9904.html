			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Pelota, blink and you'll miss it LITTLE in one's sporting life can prepare the Anglo-Saxon reporter for the confusion - and impact - of pelota. First the confusion. There are ten varieties of pelota, none of them played in Barcelona until the Olympics arrived. 'Basque pelota?' murmured my Catalan friend Enric when asked for information. 'I think we had a project about it in school. But I remember nothing.' Lesson 1: pelota may be big in the Basque country, Mexico, south-west France and even Uruguay but in Barcelona it is the big zero. Its presence at the Olympics as a demonstration sport owes everything to regional politics and trade-offs within Spain. Then Enric remembered an acquaintance who had once been pelota specialist for the respected El Pais newspaper. This caused a degree of mirth in the company comparable to naming a real tennis correspondent for The Sun. Unfortunately our expert was away on another assignment. Probably covering caber-tossing in Scotland. All this was forgotten and forgiven when confronted with the spectacle itself. Long-court pelota is the fastest ball game in the world. Top professionals serve the hard leather ball at around 160mph. It emerges from the curved wicker basket the players wear strapped to their wrists with the speed of a well-struck golfing three-iron. Squash is slow motion in comparison. Marble is the only cladding material for the walls of a pelota court. They have tried concrete but it pitted and crumbled under the impact of these tangerine-sized projectiles. All of which contributes to the enormous cost of a pelota court, for it is 60 yards long, 20 wide with walls 44ft high. Barcelona has built a special complex, the Pavello de la Vall d'Hebron, for pelota at the Olympics. It is a brick blockhouse, resembling London's Battersea power station but without the charm of the chimneys. Local taxpayers grumble at the Dollars 6m cost and wonder who exactly is going to use it once the Games are gone, but if it keeps the Basques happy and the bomb count at zero .. With the softer and slower varieties of the game, hand singles (with no racket and a rubber ball), and palette, played with a simple wooden bat, the front wall is of plexiglass to allow the raucous and riotous tiers of spectators an adequate view. In full-length cesta punta a steel mesh net, rather than glass, is required to contain the velocity of the ball safely . Only the very best co-ordinated ball players have any hope of being able to scoop this leather bullet into the basket from mid-air - given the speeds involved, it seldom touches the floor - and give it a two-handed acceleration that has been recorded at up to 185mp. Many of these shots must be performed in mid-air, leaping for the ball. Danger exists, too. As with squash, some of the trickiest plays involve a ball travelling parallel to and very close to the side wall. Hurling themselves across the court, players have split their heads open and died. Each pair must now wear crash helmets but broken bones still occur. The hand variation of the game is similar to fives, although with older roots. Women play a gentler variation still. Research has show that Egyptians, Greeks and Romans played a game very similar to pelota. Curiously, considering the later invasion by the Spanish, there is also some evidence that the Mayan civilisation enjoyed a variety of the game. Paintings from the medieval period around Bilbao show pelota being played in church squares and the porticos of grand houses. Since this is the final year for demonstration sports at the Olympics, pelota is probably making its first and last appearance outside the Hispanic world. Catch it now on TV or, if you are passing a curious brick bunker on Passeig Vall d'Hebron, drop in. Blink, and you will miss it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Saturday welcomed the proposed summit between the North and  South Korean leaders and expressed hope for its success.    "The fact that things have gone that far means a good  climate  has been produced. I hope the summit will succeed by all  means," Hata told reporters.    He was commenting on reports from Seoul that South Korean  President Kim Yong-sam has accepted his North Korean counterpart  Kim Il-song's offer to hold a bilateral summit without any  conditions to discuss the 15-month-old row over Pyongyang's  suspected nuclear arms development program and other issues.    It will be the first summit on the Korean peninsula, divided  since 1948.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Lawyers seek to avert legal aid cut BARRISTERS and solicitors in England and Wales offered yesterday to accept a legal-aid pay freeze next year if the government withdrew proposals outlined in the Autumn Statement to cut legal-aid eligibility. The offer was made by the Law Society, the Bar and the Legal Aid Practitioner's Group in response to indications from Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, earlier this month that he would welcome 'suggestions on how the legal-aid budget might be contained otherwise than I proposed'. Lord Mackay's plans, including a reduced level of disposable income that applicants can earn before being entitled to free legal aid, were attacked by lawyers and consumer organisations as a severe limitation on access to justice. The Law Society estimates that 10m people will become ineligible for civil legal aid. Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, giving this year's Richard Dimbleby lecture recently, said falling eligibility was a 'blot' on the justice system. The society, in a letter to Lord Mackay, called on the government to withdraw the proposed cuts in eligibility and start urgent discussions on substitute measures. Lawyers believe ways can be found to contain costs within public-expenditure targets that will be less damaging to the public. The offer to freeze legal-aid pay is unlikely to be popular with grassroots legal-aid lawyers who have complained loudly in recent years about erosion of legal-aid fees in real terms. Legal-aid pay rates are reviewed each April. This year lawyers received a 3 per cent increase in fees. The society said with rapidly rising overheads that amounted to a pay cut of 5 per cent in real terms.</p>

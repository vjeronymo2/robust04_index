			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / CIS states could help Georgia to protect supply lifeline from rebel attack Some CIS member states could act together to help Georgia protect a supply lifeline from rebel attack but Moscow would not intervene on its own, two Russian cabinet ministers said yesterday, Reuter reports. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, responding to a late-night appeal for military assistance by Georgia's leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, told Interfax news agency that Russia would not send in troops by itself. The Russian defence minister, Mr Pavel Grachev, speaking in Finland, echoed his words. 'Nobody intends to interfere in Georgia's internal affairs or civil war,' he said, 'but it is necessary to protect the Tbilisi-Poti road. Probably tough measures will be needed.' Rebels backing ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia have made strong gains in western Georgia in recent days, not only threatening supplies to the capital, Tbilisi, and to Russian units based in the country, but also to Armenia and Azerbaijan, who fear the fighting will throttle their supply routes.</p>

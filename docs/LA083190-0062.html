			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MENENDEZ BROTHERS APPEAL TO HIGH COURT  </P> <P> Two Beverly Hills brothers accused of the shotgun murders of their parents for  a $14-million inheritance have asked the California Supreme Court to block  prosecutors from using a tape of an alleged confession.  </P> <P> Erik Menendez, 19, and Joseph Lyle Menendez, 22, petitioned the high court on  Wednesday to overturn an appeals court decision permitting prosecutors to take  possession of a tape made by the brothers' therapist after the slayings of Jose  and Mary Menendez in their home on Aug. 20 last year.  </P> <P> If the Supreme Court declines to keep prosecutors from using the tape, defense  lawyers said they will challenge its use as evidence on other grounds.  </P> <P> The brothers, who deny killing their parents, are being held without bail  pending a preliminary hearing Oct. 22.  </P></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading The setback in UK gilts after the release of economic statistics brought a sharp fall in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the Liffe March contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 3,266, off 6 points from its previous close. Sporadic buying in the initial stages saw the contract advance to a high of 3,272. The release of a clutch of UK economic data brought a reversal in the fortunes of March as dealers reacted to the decline in UK bonds. The contract fell back sharply, pulling the underlying cash market lower. Traders also reported a significant amount of technical trading ahead of tomorrow's expiry of March. It finished at 3,238, down 34 from its previous close and at a four-point discount to cash. Volume at the official close stood at 22,141 lots. June ended the session at 3,247 on turnover of 9,044 contracts. In the Liffe Mid 250 futures, 35 lots were dealt in the March contract, which closed at 3,890, though volume in June was 120 contracts and it ended at 3,910. Business in the Liffe traded options was subdued and turnover came to 37,672 lots, of which 20,418 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,799 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. British Gas, the most active stock option, had 1,905 contracts dealt.</p>

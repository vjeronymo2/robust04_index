			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Reopening the road to Rio - Christina Lamb on Brazilian eco-tourism Samba dancers, voluptuous girls in dental floss bikinis and football are the images most people have of Brazil, according to Embratur, the state tourist authority. A marketing campaign by the Brazilian government and private sector aims to change this in a desperate attempt to resuscitate the country's ailing tourist industry. Aimed at the travel trade and individual tourists, the focus is to show Brazil as a paradise for eco-tourists. The 'Natureland Brazil' campaign involves an advertising blitz and the use of Brazilian musicians as 'ambassadors'. It aims to show that Brazil has far more to offer than the picture postcard resort of Rio which despite its beauty has become a liability because of its huge crime rate. The campaign marks a belated realisation of the need to invest money in marketing to attract tourists. Unlike Mexico and Venezuela, which have slapped travel posters on London buses and the New York subway, Brazil has spent nothing. The result, according to Varig, Brazil's largest airline, is that tourism has more than halved to 900,000 visitors since 1985. The Dollars 550,000 (Pounds 360,000) campaign is financed by Embratur, Varig and American Express Brazil, and aims to double income from tourism to Dollars 3bn in the next five years. The campaign began last month with a US tour by Milton Nascimento, one of Brazil's leading musicians who frequently sings about Indians and the environment. Each concert starts and ends with a three-minute video showing the country's environmental highlights. Amex Brazil and Varig are running a campaign in specialist magazines under the McCann Erickson-developed slogan: 'Feel the Brazilliance.' In addition the two companies are sponsoring seminars for travel agents in US gateway cities. American Express is also direct mailing to 150,000 of its US cardholders. The campaign is aimed at US tourists whose numbers have fallen largely because of crime in Rio. Joao Luis de Souza, commercial director of Varig, adds: 'What Brazil hasn't done is to think of tourism as a professional activity to be explored using management strategies, technology and marketing. It's all been very ad hoc and now we're paying the price.' To back up the campaign and make ecotourism viable, Varig is building hotels and has created direct links from Europe and the US to cities such as Recife, convenient for the beaches of the north east, or Manaus and Belem for exploring the Amazon. Although de Souza estimates that Brazil currently receives only 20,000-30,000 ecotourists a year, he says: 'The world is growing increasingly conscious of the importance of preserving the environment for the survival of mankind. It is inevitable that this will increase curiosity for seeing the environment in its natural form and where better than Brazil?'</p>

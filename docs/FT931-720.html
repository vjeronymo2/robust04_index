			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (7): Every 4 minutes a ship comes in - The world's largest port ANYONE sceptical about Singapore's confidence in long-range planning, and in its ability to circumvent its own environmental and demographic limitations, should visit the port, writes ANDREW GOWERS. Occupying a pivotal site at the southern end of the Strait of Malacca, one of the world's busiest shipping channels, it is now larger than any other in terms of on-shore surface area and of the gross registered tonnage of ships that call there. With volume still growing at an annual rate of 15-17 per cent, it is surpassed only by perennial rival Hong Kong in volume of container traffic, and that only in the last year as the latter's China trade has soared. Work on a new SDollars 1.4bn terminal in an island in mid-harbour to expand capacity nearly 50 per cent by 1995 from the current level of around 9m TEUs (twenty equivalent units - the standard container measure) is well advanced. Sounds like enough to be going on with? Not for Singapore. The Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) is already working on a plan to build almost three times as much capacity again in four phases by the year 2030: a new 36m-TEU container mega-terminal to be constructed mainly on reclaimed land next to the existing port complex. It would be foolish to question its determination to proceed on schedule, with the first few berths ready just as Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. In any other part of the world, this might sound like tinpot gigantomania. After all, many of Singapore's neighbours are engaged in their own elaborate and expensive port building or upgrading schemes. Surely there cannot be room for all of them and for another three Singapores? PSA and government officials beg to differ. Experience has shown, says Mr Lee Chee Yeng, the authority's director of operations, that Singapore stands to benefit from increasing business elsewhere in the region, that it can maintain and improve its service as a hub which other ports will feed with cargo. 'It's not a zero sum game,' he adds. This is already a well-established pattern for Singapore, destination for huge numbers of feeder services from Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and as far afield as Sri Lanka and southern India. As international container ships have grown ever vaster - from perhaps 1,000 TEUs two decades ago to 6,000 TEUs today - the need for efficient hub ports that can swiftly transfer containers from one vessel to another has grown. 'Ships are getting very big now and very expensive,' says Mr Lee. 'They want to go to a few big ports and get out quickly. Big ports offer a wider choice of lines and prices are more competitive.' The volumes of traffic are staggering. A ship arrives in Singapore on average every four minutes - about 80,000 a year. On any given day, around 60,000 20-foot or 40-foot containers are parked on the concrete waterfront while lines of vessels wait their turn in the haze beyond. Officials reckon that the port can turn around a ship carrying 1,000 boxes in 11 to 12 hours, which they claim is the fastest turnaround time in the world. In this the PSA - a profit-making body owned by the government but due for partial privatisation, perhaps next year - is helped by Singapore's fanatical approach to its own limitations, and its high technology. The two things which ports use particularly intensively are the two things in shortest supply on the island: land and labour. The PSA has thus had to find inventive methods of processing, storing, shifting and loading containers. It is experimenting with driver-less trucks to move boxes around and a computerised operating system which will plot precisely where they should go; it is plugged into a fully computerised document processing system which eliminates burdensome paperwork and completes customs procedures while the cargo is still at sea; it is using expert computer systems to determine the precise placing of containers within a cargo hold. The only big snag, it seems, in this world of just-in-time planning, control and automation is the ocean itself. Mr Lee confesses he has yet to come up with a technological answer to the typhoons that regularly sweep the south-east Asian seas.</p>

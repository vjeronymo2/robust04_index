			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- The equipment of the Kuwaiti  army with the newest Russian arms which have been demonstrated  to Kuwaiti military leaders and which will soon begin arriving  in Kuwait will help increase Kuwait's defence capability,  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said.    The Russian Defence Ministry will also train specialists to  operate and maintain Russian military equipment in Kuwait,  Grachev said at a meeting with visiting Kuwaiti parliament  chairman Ahmad al-Sa'dun in Moscow on Monday.    Kuwait is the first Persian Gulf country to have signed a  military cooperation agreement with Russia. "Russia strictly and  consistently observes the spirit of the agreement signed by the  defence ministers of the two countries on November 29, 1993 in  Moscow," Grachev said.    He used as an example the joint Russian-Kuwaiti military  exercises which Russia is ready to repeat and military and  technical cooperation between the two countries.    The Russian minister pointed to the similarity of positions  of the Russian and Kuwaiti leaders on regional and global  security, including Middle East settlement and the resolution of  the crisis in Yemen.    Grachev welcomed the visit of the Kuwaiti parliamentary  delegation to Russia as an important event in the development of  bilateral cooperation, including in the military sphere.    Ahmad al-Sa'dun told journalists after the meeting that the  aim of his visit is to convey the warmest wishes and  gratefulness of the people of Kuwait for Russia's firm position  on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.    He also pointed to the closeness of his views on  Russian-Kuwaiti military cooperation with Grachev's and said  that the Kuwaiti parliament fully supported and ratified the  agreement on military cooperation between the two countries. He  expressed the confidence that the Russian lawmakers will follow  suit.</p>

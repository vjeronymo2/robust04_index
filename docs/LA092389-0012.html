			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMISSIONER ROXANI GILLESPIE AND PROPOSITION 103 ROLLBACKS  </P> <P> In The Times editorial pages there was an article by Rosenfield and several  letters from readers, all complaining about the way Roxani Gillespie has  betrayed the intent of Proposition 103 (Aug. 31). I don't know about  Rosenfield, but I believe it is likely that many of the persons who voted for  103 and are now disappointed at how it is not being implemented had also voted  for George Deukmejian for governor. Since Gillespie is Deukmejian's appointee,  these persons are simply getting what they deserve.  </P> <P> ALBERT J. SAUR  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

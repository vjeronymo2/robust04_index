			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHENEY CUTS $10 BILLION IN 'HARD CHOICES' AT PENTAGON  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today detailed his $10 billion in Pentagon budget  cuts and said the "hard choices" included reductions in dozens of weapons  systems, a $1-billion slash in Star Wars research money and 16,800 military  manpower cutbacks.  </P> <P> Cheney, making his first appearance as defense secretary before his former  colleagues in the House, told the Armed Services Committee that only the Marine  Corps had been spared manpower cuts.  </P> <P> "No program was excluded from consideration during the budget adjustment  process," Cheney told the House panel at the start of what was expected to be a  daylong hearing.  </P> <P> "But my top priorities are quality people, forward strategy, readiness and  sustainability, efficient procurement and strategic modernization. The  adjustments we made to the budget were implemented within this context."  </P> <P> Under the budget agreement reached earlier this spring between the Bush  Administration and Congress, the Pentagon is required to cut spending plans by  $10 billion for the next fiscal year.  </P> <P> Cheney said that in making the budget changes, "not only did we have to make  hard choices, but we also had to make sure that they were the right choices."  </P> <P> Funding for Star Wars research has been cut by $1 billion to a new total of  $4.6 billion for fiscal 1990, Cheney said.  </P></p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soaring costs threaten Statoil methanol plant STATOIL, THE Norwegian state oil company, warns that costs for a NKr2.4bn (Pounds 225m) methanol plant to be built on the west coast of mid-Norway are threatening to escalate by several hundred million kroner, prompting a comprehensive and critical review of the project. The potential increase poses questions about the future of the NKr25bn Heidrun oil and gas field development and a NKr3bn methyltertiary butyl ether project. MTBE is used as an additive to boost the octane level of unleaded petrol. Statoil has an 82 per cent interest in the proposed methanol plant and partners Conoco Norway and parent company du Pont de Nemours have 18 per cent through the Statoil Methanol ANS partnership. An estimated 650m cubic metres of gas annually is meant to be supplied to the plant to allow it to produce 830,000 tonnes of methanol a year. The plant is planned to supply 200,00 tonnes annually of feedstock to a proposed MTBE plant allowing annual output of 500,000 tonnes. Statoil stresses that the cost over-run figures are uncertain but, because it takes such a serious view of the matter, a full appraisal of the project will be undertaken with findings to be presented in June.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed feature: "Today's Talk"] </F>   [Text] Dear listeners, sons of our people in wounded  Syria, and Arab brothers everywhere: On 16 January, Hafiz  al-Asad and Bill Clinton will meet in Geneva to conclude a  once-in-a-lifetime understanding between America and Hafiz  al-Asad. Immediately following the Geneva meeting, Christopher  or some other senior American official will begin shuttle trips  between Damascus and Tel Aviv make arrangements for implementing  the proposed agreement between al-Asad and Clinton in  preparation for signing an agreement or peace and cooperation  treaty between al-Asad and Rabin. These arrangements will  include 1) coordinating bilateral talks in Washington; 2)  raising the level of those negotiataing so that al-Shar' will  meet with Shim'on Peres; 3) preparing for holding a summit  meeting between al-Asad and Rabin in Cairo, Washington, or  elsewhere; and 4) resorting to secret talks again in order to  resolve the problems that cannot be solved in public bilateral  talks.    It seems that Hafiz al-Asad seeks an effective American role  in the next talks. Why? He wants to achieve greater American  sponsorship within the framework of his attempts to reinforce  his local, regional, and international position, both on  political and economic levels. He wants America to help him  improve both his domestic and Arab image. He also wants America  to guarantee the implementation of his coming agreement with the  Zionist because, as he believes, America is an unbiased and  effective mediator. He also believes that in the coming stage,  America would give him a distinguished role, one higher than the  position of other parties that held talks with the Zionist in  Madrid and Washington, particularly the PLO.    Hafiz al-Asad believes that through this approach, he will  gain America, and if he gains America, he will receive some  material and political privileges that he could not achieve  through face-to-face talks with the Zionists; in other words, he  wants to reach Israel via America, not the opposite. He also  wants America alone to help him obtain European and Western  assistance. Moreover, he wants America to help him obtain Gulf  assistance and donations.    This does not mean that eventually Hafiz al-Asad will not  announce his (?submission to Zionism) which has become a fact,  because his agreement with America and his concessions, for the  sake of America, will be in the interest of Israel.  Normalization is in the interest of Israel. Joint, bilateral,  regional, and international cooperation on political, security,  and economic levels is in the interest of Israel.    Hafiz al-Asad is eager to gain what al-Sadat and Yasir  'Arafat have gained. He maneuvers, however, to achieve this  over a longer period and for a higher price, or so he imagines.</p>

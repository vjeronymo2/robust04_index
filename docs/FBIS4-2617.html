			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] United Nations, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- In addressing the  UN Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations on 5 April,  Chinese representative Zhang Yan said that it is important and  timely for the committee to reexamine the issue in all aspects  at this critical hour so as to sum up experiences and seek  improvements.    Zhang Yan said: Peacekeeping operations, as an important  means employed by the United Nations to safeguard international  peace and security, play a useful role in preventing the  expansion of conflicts and promoting the settlement of disputes;  and the actions have received worldwide attention. However,  because of the need to expand peacekeeping operations rapidly,  they are confronted with many new problems.    He said: The Chinese delegation maintains that the urgent  task for the United Nations is, under the guidance of its  charter, to draw up a set of universally acceptable and  effective guiding principles so that peacekeeping operations  will have a solid political and legal foundation. The issue  that needs a priority solution is that peacekeeping operations  must strictly abide by the aims and principles of the UN Charter  so that the operations can maintain a correct political  orientation; peacekeeping operations must adhere to settling  disputes by peaceful means and the nonuse of force; and the UN  Security Council must be cautious in making decisions and it  must safeguard the United Nations' initiative and leading role  in peacekeeping operations.    According to a report, the United Nations has been engaged  in  17 peacekeeping projects, and 71,816 soldiers and policemen from  70 countries are carrying out peacekeeping missions in hot spots  around the world.    Peacekeeping budgets and expenditures have also grown  substantially along with the increase in peacekeeping missions.  Reports say that the expenses for peacekeeping operations during  the 1986-91 period were approximately $380 million per year on  average but that expenses soared to $1.73 billion in 1992 and to  approximately $3.6 billion in 1993.</p>

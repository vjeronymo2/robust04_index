			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>   [Text] Available information has confirmed that the United  States and Israel are currently planning to set up the most  sophisticated military base in the Middle East region. A joint  military committee has been formed to set up the base 23  kilometers east of the occupied city of Jerusalem.    According to information, a senior Zionist official recently  presented U.S. military officials with two separate maps for  that purpose. The new base will serve the joint  American-Israeli interests in the region. It will be equipped  with the most sophisticated U.S. long-range and medium-range  missile systems, in addition to multisystem rocket launchers.  The base will be automatically connected to Sixth Fleet  operations in the Mediterranean and will act as one of its  tributaries. American and Israeli military experts will  supervise the base.    Information indicates that the new military base will help  the Israeli plan of planting nuclear warheads in the holy places.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / A tractor driver from Harvard The success of a Harvard Business School graduate in seizing control of an ailing Russian tractor plant this week provides a cautionary tale to communist-era managers who are trying to rescue plants with old-style methods doomed to failure. Mr Iosif Bakaleinnik, 42, was elected chief executive officer of the Vladimir Tractor Plant on Thursday, just nine months after Mr Anatoly Grishin, the plant's manager for 16 years, blocked his first takeover attempt. The 60-year-old Mr Grishin convinced the majority of shareholders that his rival had 'neither the moral right nor the qualifications' to run the plant. But Mr Grishin was forced to quit in January after he tried to keep the plant going by taking out expensive bank loans to pay wages while delivering goods free of charge to his connections - insolvent enterprises that promised to pay him later but never did. Mr Bakaleinnik, who is still officially employed by the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private development arm, was at pains to explain to a suspicious workforce why he was embracing a Dollars 300-a-month salary to try to turn round a company which has been standing idle for the best part of four months. 'It's like climbing the Himalayas. You go up and if you're lucky you come down.' But he has already asked the IFC to keep a job open for him in Washington should he fail. The plight of the Vladimir Tractor Plant is typical of many Russian plants whose problems in a depressed economy have been compounded by gross mismanagement. With his western know-how and connections, as well as his plans for overhauling the company's financial and marketing strategy, Mr Bakaleinnik is seen, in the words of the plant's acting chief engineer, as a last chance to 'save the company and the workers who survive in it'. Mr Grishin's deputy until he went off to Harvard on a government scholarship, Mr Bakaleinnik ensured his boardroom victory by marshalling the support of the Russian government and institutional investors, who now hold 54 per cent of the company. His main backer is Renova, a US-Russian joint venture which spent Dollars 1m acquiring a 17 per cent stake. Mr Bakaleinnik will now try to raise the Rbs20bn-Rbs25bn (Dollars 11m-Dollars 14m) which he says the company needs this year to complete a long-delayed modernisation and restructuring programme, which has begun with efforts to cut the workforce from 14,500 to 10,500. He will also look for a strategic partner abroad. The company's bright spot is its hard-currency export market, which accounts for 14 per cent of its output. But Mr Bakaleinnik says that the flourishing of a domestic market will paradoxically depend on the ability of the country's conservative agrarian lobby - which opposes the radical reforms that made the plant's privatisation possible in the first place - to extract extra farming subsidies for peasants to buy his tractors.</p>

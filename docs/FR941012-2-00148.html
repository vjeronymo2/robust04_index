			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In understanding the language of the HTSUS, Customs consults the ENs. The ENs, although not dispositive, provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the Harmonized System and are thus useful in ascertaining the classification of merchandise. Customs believes that they should be consulted for guidance in determining the proper interpretation of the HTSUS. See T.D. 89&hyph;80, 54 FR 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989). EN 70.10, pg. 933&hyph;934, states, in pertinent part, that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This heading covers all glass containers of the kinds commonly used commercially for the conveyance or packing of liquids or of solid products (powders, granules, etc.). They include: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Carboys, demijohns, bottles (including syphon vases), phials and similar containers, of all shapes and sizes, used as containers for chemical products (acids, etc.) beverages, oils, meat extracts, perfumery preparations, pharmaceutical products, inks, glues, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These articles, formerly produced by blowing, are now almost invariably manufactured by machines which automatically feed molten glass into moulds where the finished articles are formed by the action of compressed air. They are usually made of ordinary glass (colourless or coloured) although some bottles (e.g., for perfumes) may be made of lead crystal, and certain large carboys are made of fused quartz or other fused silica *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These containers remain in this heading even if they are ground, cut, sand-blasted, etched or engraved, or decorated (this applies, in particular, to certain perfume or liqueur bottles), banded, wickered or otherwise trimmed with various materials (wicker, straw, raffia, metal, etc.); they may also have tumbler-caps fitted to the neck. They may be fitted with drop measuring devices or may be graduated, provided that they are not of a kind used as laboratory glassware.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Jars, pots and similar containers for the conveyance or packing of certain foodstuffs *&blank;*&blank;*, pharmaceutical products, *&blank;*&blank;* polishes, cleaning preparations, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These articles are usually made of ordinary glass (colourless or tinted) by pressure in a mould usually followed by blowing with compressed air. They generally have a large opening, a short neck (if any) and as a rule, a lip or flange to hold the lid or cap. Some of these containers, however may be closed by corks or screwstoppers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In HRL 087359, dated August 8, 1990, Customs explained the phrase ``commercially used to convey'', as used in the ENs, when referring to the class of glass containers commercially used to convey solid or liquid products. The ruling stated, in pertinent part, that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The key phrase in this instance is ``commonly used commercially for the conveyance'' of liquids. The root word of ``commercially'' is commerce which is described as the exchange or buying and selling of commodities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Webster's Third New International Dictionary, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (1986) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (1983). The root word of ``conveyance'' is convey which is described as to carry, bring or take from one place to another; transport; bear.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (1983) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Webster's Third New International Dictionary, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (1986). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Based on this ruling, Customs current position is that the principal use for the class ``containers used for the conveyance or packing of goods'' is that glass articles of this class be part of the exchange or buying and selling of commodities, and be used to convey or pack a product to a consumer who then uses the product and discards the container.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reviewing the Kraft case, the ENs and the relevant HRLs, Customs believes that together, they provide specific identifiable characteristics which are indicative, but not conclusive of whether a particular glass article qualifies as part of the class ``containers of glass of a kind used for the conveyance or packing of goods''. These characteristics would include, containers, of all shapes and sizes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. generally having a large opening, a short neck (if any) and as a rule, a lip or flange to hold the lid or cap, made of ordinary glass (colourless or coloured) and manufactured by machines which automatically feed molten glass into moulds where the finished articles are formed by the action of compressed air;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. in which the ultimate purchaser's primary expectation is to discard the container after the conveyed or packed goods are used;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. sold from the importer to a wholesaler/distributor who then packs them with goods;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. sold in an environment of sale that features the goods packed in the jar and not the jar itself;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. used to commercially convey foodstuffs, beverages, oils, meat extracts, etc.; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. capable of being used in the hot packing process; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. recognized in the trade as used primarily to pack and convey goods to a consumer who then discards the container after this initial use. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Customs current position is that the physical characteristics of a particular glass article are the primary indicator of whether it belongs to the class ``containers of a kind used for the packing or conveyance of goods''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

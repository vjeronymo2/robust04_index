			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by John Keegan: "Rose Holds the Aces in a </F> Dangerous Game of Dare"]    [Text] The easier part of General Rose's task is over.  The difficult part is about to begin. Not that his achievement  thus far has been easy. The intransigence and deviousness of  the combatants defeated both previous UN commanders in Bosnia,  Generals Morillon and Briquemont. No doubt the warring parties,  especially the Serbs, thought they could frustrate and dispirit  General Rose also. His skill in playing to such strengths as he  has had -- some high-quality troops and the authority to use air  power in their defence under UN Resolution 836 -- has outwitted  them. Looking back, it will be recognised that his manipulation  of those strengths amounts to one of the most cunning  military-diplomatic offensives ever mounted in the history of UN  peacekeeping and peacemaking.    The war-weariness of the combatants has also worked in his  favour. The Serbs, again in particular, had not only reached  but passed what Clausewitz called "the culminating point of the  offensive." They had captured more of Bosnia than they could  ever hope to populate, knew that they could neither occupy nor  partition Sarajevo, and were suffering casualties, and  international odium, for no purpose. General Rose's  determination to bring their bombardment of Sarajevo to an end  may have offered them an escape from an impasse.    The end of the Sarajevo siege has not meant, however, the  end  of the war. It has merely shifted its focus. Colonel Edward  Cowan, who was once the British military attache in former  Yugoslavia, said yesterday that it opened the way to the next  set of strategic imperatives. "The Serbs were always determined  to clear out the eastern enclaves (Gorazde, Srebrenica and  Zepa), and the Muslims were equally determined to win back that  Muslim land on the western bank of the River Drina."    In recent months the Muslims have improved both their  military situation and capabilities. The balance of advantage  around the eastern enclaves nevertheless rests with the Bosnian  Serbs. There they are far closer to Serbia proper than they  were at Sarajevo, while immediately across the Drina lie a  concentration of Serbian arms-manufacturing centres at Cacak,  Kraljevo and Krusevac, all on the road running directly to  Gorazde through Visegrad. The Bosnian Serbs were left 80,000  tons of shells at the start of the war. Even if that stock is  now heavily depleted, it can be replenished directly from the  factories across the Drina.    UN observers have reported that much of the Bosnian Serbs'  artillery withdrawn from Sarajevo has been repositioned around  Gorazde, where they have also just advanced their positions,  shortened the Muslim's defensive perimeter, and seized high  ground from which to overlook the city centre. Gorazde is  filling with refugees driven in terror from their homes in the  surrounding villages. There is every sign that a siege as  horrible as that of Sarajevo is about to begin but with the  Serbs better placed to bring it to a conclusion on their terms.    The blame for that rests partly with the United States. I do  not share the view that it is under any obligation to send  ground troops to former Yugoslavia. It already does most of the  world's policing, and if the Europeans, who have many more men  under arms, cannot find the will and means to mount an effective  intervention, their pretensions to unity for any purpose except  the protection of their domestic markets are contemptibly  hollow. Moreover, it is generally overlooked that the two  effective UN air strikes thus far mounted were by American  aircraft.    Nevertheless, President Clinton's recent reiterations of his  refusal to commit ground troops, echoed by his Secretary of  State and National Security Adviser, though issued for domestic  reasons, have weakened General Rose's ability to utter threats.  How, then, might he play the next round? What he has been  doing so far is to commit his UN troops to carry out tasks that  hamper the Serb strategy. He first employed them much more  aggressively as aid convoy guards, challenging the Serbs to deny  passage by force if they dared. They dared not. Then at  Sarajevo he threatened air strikes if they dared to keep their  artillery in place. They dared not.    At Gorazde he has committed special forces to identify and  illuminate Serbian artillery positions so that they can be hit  by air strikes, as they now have been. The Bosnian Serbs are  known to be badly frightened by air power, which they lack, and  thus far General Rose's strategy has worked effectively.    From this point on, however, the game of dare becomes more  fraught. Because special forces have to see a target in order  to illuminate it for aircraft, they run the risk of being seen  by the enemy. Indeed, they run the risk of being deliberately  hunted down. General Rose, a special forces officer of great  experience, knows that better than anyone. At least one of his  target indication officers was found and killed in the Falklands  in exactly that way.    He is therefore faced with the dilemma of finding troops to  protect his target indicators, when his chief problem is that he  is using target indicators because he does not have enough  troops to protect the Muslims in the eastern enclaves in the  first place. If there is no such thing as a free lunch, there  is no such thing as a cheap war, either. General Rose is poised  on the brink of escalation exactly as the Americans were in  Vietnam in 1965. Then their team of 17,000 "advisers" -- there  are 15,000 UN troops in former Yugoslavia -- proved to be too  few to bolster the South Vietnamese army. It may be that his UN  force is too small to bolster the Bosnian Muslims' efforts to  stand up to the Bosnian Serbs.    America got into a big war in Vietnam in 1965. How can  Europe steer itself away from enlarging its peacemaking  endeavour in Bosnia? It has no will to commit more troops. The  option of arming the Bosnian Muslims remains a recipe for  greater horror: let those who advocate it recall that a million  people died after arms were poured into Spain in 1936-38.    We have to hope that General Rose can continue to out-dare  the peacebreakers. Air strikes may have to be extended, perhaps  against the bridges over the River Drina, perhaps against the  Serbian complex of arms factories on the other side. The UN  force has advantages the Bosnian Serbs will never possess, in  signals intelligence, in target indication, in night-fighting  capability, in special forces, and above all in air power. The  Serbs, an observer of their military outlook recently observed,  are "paranoid" about spies and special forces, which they  believe are everywhere. They have a well-founded fear of UN  aircraft. Let us hope that they take counsel of their fears and  conclude that they lack the strength to put the UN force to a  real test of strength. If they do not, the war in Bosnia may  get nastier yet.</p>

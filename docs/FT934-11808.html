			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / The lame duck in winter Canada's oblit-eration of its Progressive Conservatives is tempting. Our Canadian cousins re-duced the party which had ruled them for the past nine years from 153 seats, and an overall majority in parliament, to two. It would be a delight so to humble Britain's Tories. They have governed us for the past 14 years. British voters should decide which two Conservatives to conserve, and defenestrate the rest. It merely requires some intelligent tactical voting. We can rule out Mr John Major. The prime minister would have to quit politics after such a disaster. Very well then, what about preserving Mr John Patten, the education secretary? Not quite. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary? Not exactly. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary? Please. This is serious. I need not list all the candidates for ejection. The choice of which ones to keep makes itself. The secretary for social security, Mr Peter Lilley, and the backbench rebel, Mrs Teresa Gorman, are the pair of Tories who most deserve to be condemned to wander, lost souls, in the purgatory of a Westminster in which all other MPs would be Labour, Liberal Democrat or Celtic nationalist. 'I am now the leader, Peter,' the one will say, to be met with an echo from the other. The torture would be the more exquisite for the fact that the only congenial spirits the condemned could turn to would be one another. This phantasmagoria should not be taken as an argument in favour of Labour, or a Lab-Lib coalition. We do not have the luxury of choosing a party with whose governance we would be satisfied. There is none such. The Liberal Democrats are not serious contenders. The Conservatives, Mr Lilley prominent among them, have been musing about taking us back to the 1950s. Labour demonstrated at its recent conference that it is still incapable of reshaping itself. Its leader, Mr John Smith, has put the brakes on the modernisers around him. With Labour in charge, it would be back to the 1960s. We adherents of the 'none of the above' tendency must therefore remain analytical. I have long assumed that Labour is out for ever; that we are effectively in a one-party state, as the Japanese and the Italians used to be. This has been the usual position taken in this space, although there have been one or two wobbles, most regrettably during the weeks before the April 1992 election. All assumptions should be questioned from time to time. The 'one-party state' theory is looking thin. The result of the Canadian election is one reason, but there are others. Japan's Liberal Democrats have been dismissed after 40 years in power. Italy is in revolt against political corruption, and fed up with its Christian Democrats. We will see what happens in New Zealand's election next week. Mr Major is looking for a surprise victory by Mr Jim Bolger, the incumbent Conservative prime minister. While keeping his fingers crossed, he should reassess the conventional wisdom, which is that Labour is so unappetising that the southern English will never vote for it in sufficient numbers to give it a majority. If that is still true, the Conservatives will win again in two or three years' time, following a return to relative prosperity. But what if it is not? The daunting answer is that the troglodytes in the Labour party would then have been proved right. Just wait for the Tories to rot on the vine, they say, and we're in. In short, it is no longer certain that 'one more heave', Mr Smith's cautious strategy of minimum disturbance, will fail. On this view it is at least possible that the next government will be Labour-led, Liberal Democrat-supported, and deeply, disappointingly, conservative. The deciding factor may be the extent to which Mr Major can re-establish the government's authority over its backbenchers. The Conservatives are still recovering from the shock of Black Wednesday. The natural respect for the leader of the party, the instinctive closing of the ranks in times of trouble, the very will to govern were blown away when Britain was ejected from the exchange rate mechanism. The prime minister was humiliated, his stature diminished. Rehabilitation is turning out to be a longer, slower process than anyone could have foreseen. Some progress has been made. The divisive bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty is now a statute; Europe, barring accidents at today's EC summit, may become politically manageable, at least in the short term. An economic recovery is under way, if fitfully. Mr Major's unashamed appeal to nostalgia got him through his big speech at the party conference. The mood is better now than it was in the spring. This rosy picture is spoiled by unruliness on the backbenches. Backbench revolts have now become the norm. Disunity is the problem; all else is secondary. The recent spate of headline 'climbdowns', 'U-turns', 'threats' and the like constitutes bad publicity of the kind that, if prolonged, could prove fatal. If the sense of drift that it suggests persists, we are in for one of the most drawn-out stretches of lame duck administration in British history. Yet each act of tacking and trimming is different. For example Mr Howard's a la carte approach to the Sheehy report on police pay and conditions suggests a certain weakness. The home secretary was selecting from a menu put up by the government's consultant. Managements that appoint them should know that the purpose of consultants is to provide intellectual support for ideas the client first thought of but could not impose. Mr Howard got the report, but could not implement all of it. Again, the government was obliged to accept a Lords amendment allowing British Rail to bid for franchises under the new arrangements for the railways. Some ground was recovered yesterday by tabling a new amendment, making it difficult for Byzantine Rail to bid. The big test is the Budget, due on November 30. One interest group is trying to bounce Mr Major away from defence cuts; another from putting VAT on domestic fuel; a third towards further social security restraint. The prime minister must ensure that the Budget is decided by the chancellor and himself, and supported by the cabinet and party. If he cannot achieve that, talk of the decimation of the Tories at the next general election will no longer be such a laughing matter.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YELTSIN CALLS FOR REFERENDUM ON GORBACHEV  </P> <P> Boris N. Yeltsin called today for a referendum in his vast Russian republic on  Mikhail S. Gorbachev's performance as president.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, largest of the 15 Soviet  republics, said his region is ready to conduct such a referendum.  </P> <P> Speaking in Kiev, where he was to sign a treaty with the Ukraine, Yeltsin said  the referendum would also ask Russians whether they have confidence in the  central government.  </P> <P> "Russia is ready to hold a referendum on two questions -- the entire presidency  of Mikhail Gorbachev and on faith in the central government," he told the  Ukrainian Parliament.  </P> <P> Such a plebiscite would ask more than half the Soviet Union's 290 million  people to cast judgment on Gorbachev's performance, possibly laying the basis  for a more direct challenge from Yeltsin.  </P> <P> Yeltsin censured Gorbachev's new plan, announced Saturday, to take charge of  all government ministries as a bid to increase his personal power and a  betrayal of promised decentralization.  </P> <P> Yeltsin compared Gorbachev's recent steps to the failed rule of the late Nikita  S. Khrushchev, "when the center tried to recentralize everything and the  reforms died."  </P> <P> The burly Siberian also took issue with Gorbachev's recent decree requiring  enterprises to give up most of their hard currency earnings to the central  government, calling it the "biggest mistake" of Gorbachev's eight-month  presidency.  </P> <P> Yeltsin said the hard currency order, if implemented, "will force us to our  knees."  </P></p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Technology: Radiation experiments come to light - Victims may never receive financial compensation This week, as in every week since early December, hundreds of Americans will call the US Department of Energy to report that they were subjects of human radiation experiments. Two months ago, Hazel O'Leary, the energy secretary, mentioned the word 'compensation' on national television in response to press accounts of experiments in the 1940s in which terminal cancer patients were injected with plutonium to see how it would affect them. Since the plutonium experiments were revealed, other cases have come to light: 17 boys in Massachusetts had been given breakfast cereal laced with small amounts of radiation; in Oregon, scientists irradiated the testicles of 67 prisoners. Some of the experimental subjects gave their informed consent, others were never asked. At her press conference, O'Leary said she was 'shocked and saddened' by news of the experiments. She then set up a toll-free telephone number for the public to report other 'abuses'. So far, more than 18,000 have called; about half are armed forces veterans who believe they have been exposed to radiation during nuclear weapons tests. Of the rest, more than 2,000 believe they were the subjects of experiments. A federal task force is gearing up to review government experiments involving radiation and humans from 1944 to 1974. By all estimates, most of the research was legitimate. Yet some experiments were unethical by today's standards, and perhaps even by the standards at the time. The sheer magnitude of the review task, however, has turned an attempt to 'come clean' on previous government abuses into a paperwork nightmare that may take years to complete. Over the past month, officials have begun to back away from talk of compensation. 'Financial compensation is just one of several models we're considering,' says John Donnelly, a spokesman at the Department of Energy. 'There may not be any compensation at all.' At a congressional hearing on the subject last week, administration officials said they were considering a range of options, from monetary compensation to medical follow-ups or just formal apologies. The US has an ample history of paying compensation when it has wronged its citizens, but it has usually done so only after pressure and years of bureaucratic wrangling. The largest compensation payment - Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1bn) - went to Japanese-Americans who had been confined in internment camps during the second world war. The government made its first payments in 1989, more than 40 years later. Perhaps the nearest thing to compensation for subjects of radiation experiments is the 1990 Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which aided 'downwinders' (members of the public who were exposed to fallout from atmospheric nuclear test), on-site participants of nuclear tests and uranium miners. To be eligible for a lump sum compensation of Dollars 50,000, the downwinders have to prove they have developed one of 13 specified types of cancer. The on-site participants are eligible for Dollars 75,000 if they can do the same. And the miners get Dollars 100,000 if they can prove they were exposed to high levels of radiation and subsequently developed lung cancer or one of four other respiratory diseases. Since 1992, the government has received 3,595 claims, of which it has approved nearly half, for a total of Dollars 112m. Although it took the government more than 40 years to begin paying the voluntary and involuntary participants of the nuclear tests, that programme is now considered a model. Compensation for subjects of radiation experiments could be a more difficult matter. Unlike accidental irradiation of the public near nuclear tests, the jury is still out on whether most of the experiments were cases of government wrongdoing. Although the standards of informed consent were often deficient by today's standards, the rules were different then. Many of the experiments were approved by ethics review boards before they began. While potentially harmful research on prisoners is now considered unethical, it was not until the late 1960s that this was generally accepted. Many researchers also point out that, although it has little bearing on the ethics of the experiments, most of the research was valuable; some of it led to the radiation safety standards in place today. Making the decision even more difficult for those who must determine whether or not to compensate, none of the experiments questioned has been shown to have caused lasting harm to their subjects. Ruth Faden, a Johns Hopkins University bioethicist, has been named to head a panel of independent experts who will review the radiation experiments. In her writings, she has argued that before the early 1970s (when the first comprehensive human subjects regulations went into effect in the US) the scientific community's collective sense of ethics was insufficient to make the phrase 'informed consent' truly meaningful. By that view, most of the radiation experiments could be in for a beating. But the panel has not met yet, and the completion of any substantive review could be more than a year away. O'Leary, striking a more tentative note, now says no compensation decision will be made before the review is complete. Science ethics, it seems, are sometimes more complicated than they seem.</p>

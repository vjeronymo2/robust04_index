			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Leading Article: No prizes yet There is no Nobel prize for investment banking. But if there were, the judges would have a problem in appraising the contenders - such are the divergent theories in the industry about how to make durable profits. The triumphant statement of half-year results issued yesterday by Barings, the UK merchant bank, throws down a gauntlet to proponents of the theory of integrated merchant banking. Barings, which prides itself on focusing on the most lucrative markets, has delivered much better results than those rivals, such as Warburg, which have modelled themselves on the much larger US investment banks. The US banks themselves, which have already disclosed disappointing profits for the second quarter - in some case losses - are expected to show further deterioration in the third-quarter figures which are now trickling out. The current creed of integrated investment banking is that to compete for high-margin business such as corporate advice, or placing of shares and other securities in the market, a bank needs many tools. In particular, it needs distributive power - the market presence to place those securities. That, as some have interpreted the doctrine, means participation in marketmaking, in proprietary trading, and in the latest fashions on the newest markets such as derivatives. An implication of that trend is that banks with more capital will have a hefty advantage. They will be able better to withstand the turbulence of the markets and to extract the maximum return from the riskiest products. If the theory is correct, the middle ground occupied by medium-sized banks may become increasingly uncomfortable. The question raised by Barings' success is whether specialisation offers a profitable alternative to integration for those banks that lack the capital to compete in the top league. Barings' figures, which showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 54.8m compared with Pounds 35.5m in the first half last year, owe something to luck: it has had relatively little exposure to some of the most turbulent areas this year, notably the UK fixed-income market. It has also benefited from its well-judged early entry into emerging markets, particularly in Asia. The more important test of the strategy will be whether its out-performance persists as bond markets recover, and as competition increases in Asia, and whether it succeeds in winning corporate advisory contracts without the appendages deemed necessary by its larger rivals. The implication of Barings' results is that division of the investment banking market is already well under way: into the giants, and the specialised houses. If large scale or specialisation prove to be the best recipes for lasting profits, banks in the middle will have either to find more capital or to retreat from the most fiercely contested markets.</p>

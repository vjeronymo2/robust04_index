			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to a report by the Ukrainian Navy press  center, officers and more than 20 servicemen of the Black Sea  Fleet's hospital in Ochakiv have asked the Ukrainian Defense  Ministry and the Ukrainian Navy command to enroll them in the  Ukrainian Armed Forces. They have recently taken an oath of  allegiance to the Ukrainian people. The hospital staff  explained that their decision was based on the fact that they  are all Ukrainian citizens, and that they were tired of being  hostages to circumstances, and to feeling the constant  psychological pressure caused by the uncertainty of their fate.  To prevent property and equipment from being taken away from  the hospital, additional security was deployed during the oath.  The press center report also notes that the command of the  Black Sea Fleet Ochakiv Division failed to convince the officers  to change their decision.</p>

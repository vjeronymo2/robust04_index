			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;L REGULATORS MAY SUE NEIL BUSH  </P> <P> Federal regulators are considering filing a lawsuit against President Bush's  son Neil and other former directors of a failed savings and loan in Denver,  charging them with negligence in causing substantial losses to the thrift,  government officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> If a lawsuit is filed, it would seek substantial damages, perhaps in excess of  $100 million, from Neil Bush and other former directors for the losses  allegedly caused while they served on the board of Silverado Banking, Savings  &amp; Loan in Denver, officials said.  </P> <P> The possible civil complaint is being discussed at the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corp., the agency that is overseeing the financial clean-up of  hundreds of insolvent thrift institutions across the country.  </P> <P> FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman and the other members of the three-person  board will make the decision whether to file a suit against Neil Bush and other  former directors of the defunct Silverado.  </P> <P> "An investigation is under way," said Alan Whitney, a spokesman for Seidman.  "But no final decision" has been made on filing a lawsuit, he said.  </P> <P> Neil Bush could not be reached for comment on the possible lawsuit, but he has  denied repeatedly that his actions as a Silverado director were improper. He is  challenging a separate administrative action filed against him by the  government.  </P> <P> Bush was a Silverado director from August, 1985, until August, 1988. Silverado  was seized by the federal government in December, 1988, and the loss to  taxpayers may exceed $1 billion.  </P> <P> Colorado regulators wanted to close Silverado in October, 1988, because the  institution suffered massive losses on real estate loans that went bad and had  exhausted its capital.  </P> <P> But Colorado lacked the money to pay off depositors, whose accounts were  insured by the federal government up to $100,000. Federal authorities had the  effective last word on Silverado's fate, and regional regulators have said that  an official in Washington made a phone call ordering them to keep Silverado  open beyond the date of the presidential election.  </P> <P> The Treasury Department's inspector general is conducting an investigation to  determine who placed the call from Washington, and whether political pressure  was involved.  </P> <P> The President's 34-year-old son already has been charged by another government  agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, with violating conflict of interest  rules. The agency said he failed to disclose to other board members that he was  involved in business relationships with two Denver developers who were major  borrowers from Silverado.  </P> <P> The OTS is seeking a cease-and-desist order barring Neil Bush from committing  future violations of the conflict of interest rules. An administrative law  judge will hear the case in Denver on Sept. 25. A final ruling will not come  until well after the November election.  </P> <P> Because Neil Bush's case will not be immediately resolved either for or against  him, the uncertainty seems likely to cause political problems for the  Administration.  </P> <P> The FDIC frequently sues directors or officers of failed financial  institutions. But the naming of the President's son as a defendant would be an  embarrassment for the White House, which is engaged in a political struggle  with the Democratic Party over who should be blamed for the huge S&amp;L  scandal.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said at the economic summit in Houston  that he had no information about the possible lawsuit.  </P></p>

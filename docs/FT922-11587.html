			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (24): A simple route for the private investor - Savings schemes / You are spared the anxiety of timing, as well as the need to buy your shares through a broker SAVINGS SCHEMES may have been the saviours of the investment trust industry. They were only introduced in 1984, after investment trusts themselves had been alive for rather more than a century, but now companies are keen to offer them. According to the Association of Investment Trust Companies, savings schemes are available for 118 trusts, managed by 18 different management groups. Take-up in the past few years has been extraordinary - Pounds 119.5m was invested by 130,700 savers last year, up from Pounds 90.9m in 1990. In 1988, the figure was only Pounds 22.5m, while in the early years of the schemes the money invested was insignificant - for example, only Pounds 89,000 in 1984. The raising of the annual limit on investment trust personal equity plans to Pounds 6,000 is likely to increase demand. This regular flow of money through savings schemes has helped to erode discounts and shore up investment trusts' defences against possible takeovers. Catering for small savers is a new departure for management houses, which had previously been geared for marketing trusts to institutions. But as far as private investors are concerned, a savings scheme is likely to be a more useful way to invest. Convenience is important. Until 1984, you needed a broker in order to buy and sell shares in an investment trust. But stockbrokers are not always the easiest people for small savers to get hold of, and the charges they levy for small transactions can, quite reasonably, be high. With a savings scheme, you simply make out a direct debit from a bank, and the trust administers a small savings account on your behalf. The trust buys as many shares as can be afforded each month, and holds any cash balance left over to be invested the following month. Saving schemes also release investors from the tricky problem of timing, which can otherwise be crucial to the return on the investment. For example, if you had put Pounds 1,000 into a trust in September 1987, just before Black Monday, you would now be doing a lot worse than if you invested in November 1987. Under a savings scheme, 'pound-cost averaging' works in your favour. When prices are low, your regular monthly payment buys more shares; when prices are high, it buys fewer - so that, provided the long-term trend is upward, a temporary fall in the value of your investment can even be good news. Pound-cost averaging ensures that the cost of your total holding will be lower than the average of the monthly prices on the day you invest. Had you continued to pay the same amount into such a scheme during 1973 and 1974, you would have picked up a lot of cheap stock, which went on to gain heavily. Low annual administration charges are savings schemes' other big advantage. In some cases, trusts make no charge at all, and none charges more than 1.5 per cent. This is cheaper than you could manage through a broker, while also more convenient. All of this helps to account for the increased interest in savings schemes, which itself has improved performance by contributing to discount erosion. Should demand for savings schemes now be choked off by higher taxes, as seems possible, the trend could go into reverse - discounts might widen if this regular source of demand were diminished. Even so, the performance of these schemes still stands up well to scrutiny. Unlike some of the more complicated financial vehicles mentioned in this survey, the aim of these schemes is very simple - long-term capital growth. This is not a way to provide yourself with an income. Therefore the accompanying figures, from Micropal, assume that income is re-invested (as it can be automatically under most schemes). The figures are hypothetical to an extent, as the schemes only started in 1984, and some later still. They show how your investment would have fared if you had invested Pounds 50 each month for the last five and 10 years. The five-year timescale catches the worst of Black Monday. Over five years, total investment of Pounds 3,000 would on average have become Pounds 3,519.57 - not perhaps all that impressive. But over 10 years a total of Pounds 6,000 invested would on average be worth Pounds 13,089.83. This is an impressive return. Only trusts whose managers offer savings schemes are included in the table, and charges are not included. Several investment trust Peps have a regular savings option, which could save you a capital gains tax bill in the long run.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE TOP SAVINGS SCHEMES' 10-YEAR PERFORMANCE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Management                      Value at Trust                       group                          March 1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Law Debenture             Law Debenture              Pounds 18,092.73 TR City of London         Touche Remnant                    17,412.79 Bankers                   Touche Remnant                    17,076.24 Lowland                   Henderson Administration          16,739.17 Murray Smaller Markets    Murray Johnstone                  16,308.94 Securities Trust of  Scotland                 Martin Currie                     15,974.34 Fleming Claverhouse       Flemings                          15,942.76 Foreign &amp; Colonial        Foreign &amp; Colonial                15,638.25 Moorgate                  Moorgate                          15,439.83 F&amp;C Eurotrust             Foreign &amp; Colonial                15,343.36 Murray Income             Murray Johnstone                  15,275.51 Temple Bar                Guinness Mahon                    15,028.89 Alliance                  Alliance Trust                    14,982.19 Second Alliance           Second Alliance Trust             14,926.48 English National          Henderson Administration          14,594.81  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Assumes Pounds 50 invested monthly since March 1, 1982, dividends re-invested.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Canadian Bonds: Passionate embrace fosters flood of issues GOVERNMENTS with hefty borrowing requirements and investors looking for decent yields at low risk are embracing each other with a passion in the Canadian bond market. International and domestic issues by all levels of government in Canada have exploded recently. Borrowings in January exceeded CDollars 10bn. Last week alone, Quebec raised CDollars 1.4bn through its first global issue and Manitoba tapped the Yankee market for USDollars 300m. At home, the federal government priced a CDollars 1.8bn five-year issue, while Prince Edward Island raised CDollars 60m. The market has so far absorbed the flood of new issues - not to mention numerous EuroCanadian offerings by non-Canadian borrowers - with remarkably little indigestion. Spreads between Canadian and US bond yields widened in January when domestic institutions were net sellers, but the gap has narrowed more recently. The benchmark Government of Canada 10-year bond yielded 7.49 per cent towards the end of last week, 135 basis points higher than equivalent US Treasuries. The gap was as wide as 164 points in January. 'There's a slight cost to this, but less than I would have expected it to be,' says a government-finance specialist at one Toronto securities firm. The surge in borrowing stems from yawning budget deficits at both the federal and provincial levels. The federal deficit is expected to jump to CDollars 34.5bn in the fiscal year to March 31 1993, compared to a projected CDollars 27.5bn in last February's budget. Royal Bank of Canada estimates that the 10 provinces will have a combined budget deficit of CDollars 23.5bn this year, up from CDollars 22.2bn in 1991-1992 and CDollars 9.8bn the previous year. Public sector borrowings in the domestic market could top CDollars 60bn in 1993 as a whole. The supply of funds has so far matched, and even outstripped, demand. Some smaller provinces are said to have been offered a year or two's requirements in a single issue. For investors, the main attraction has been the combination of a stable currency, a more generous yield than US securities with little extra risk, and a liquid market. Mr David Adamo, director of fixed-income research at ScotiaMcLeod, says: 'If you're a US or European investor looking for an attractive rate in a country with minimal inflation, Canada looks good.' Prices, especially at the short end, are expected to remain firm for the time being. With the economy still weak, analysts predict further falls in short-term interest rates with inflation at 1 to 2 per cent. Canadian securities will also benefit from any further improvement in the US bond market. Mr Daniel Kelly, vice-president for fixed-income research at Wood Gundy, adds that the Canadian provinces, almost all of which have single-A credit ratings or better, will continue to have access to the Yankee market 'as long as people are reasonably optimistic on the US dollar and US interest rates'. But a warning shot was fired over the market last week by the CD Howe Institute, one of Canada's premier economic think-tanks. The institute reported that most of the 19 economists at a recent seminar on the fiscal outlook felt that Canada's public debt burden has grown to the point where 'continued easy access to financing cannot be taken for granted'. Mr Warren Jestin, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, suggested that uncertainty about the outcome of Canada's general election later this year, further bad news on provincial finances, or evidence that Ottawa will have difficulty cutting its deficit 'could all trigger a less receptive borrowing environment'. Demand for funds, especially from the provinces, shows few signs of easing, however. Mr Benoit Durocher, a Royal Bank economist, predicts that provincial deficits will not come down much in 1993-1994. While tax revenues will rise as the economy accelerates, finance ministers can no longer rely on inflation to push taxpayers into higher income-tax brackets, or to boost receipts from sales taxes.</p>

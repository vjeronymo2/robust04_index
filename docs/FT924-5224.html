			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: BIL boardroom coup architect is ousted MR BRUCE Hancox, a principal architect of the coup two years ago that ousted Sir Ron Brierley as chairman of New Zealand's biggest investment company, Brierley Investment (BIL), was him-self replaced yesterday. The new chairman is Mr Bob Matthew, another Brierley director and chairman of Air New Zealand, who is to relinquish executive tasks within the BIL group. The changeover, announced at the group's annual meeting yesterday, sparked speculation that Mr Hancox was replaced because of market perceptions that he was too outspoken on political and other issues and was spending too much time on his private business - a charge he denied. Mr Hancox also said there had been 'no coup' against him because he had never wanted to be chair-man. Mr Matthew is a prominent and highly successful businessman. At Air New Zealand, he oversaw the restructuring of the airline, now one of the world's most profitable companies in its sector. He said yesterday he intended to take an equally active role as chairman of BIL. Other changes in the board included the appointment of Mr Robert Peel, chief executive of Mount Charlotte, BIL's biggest investment. Mr Andrew Meehan has also been appointed an executive director. He is one of the country's best known bankers and was previously chief executive of Southpac, the New Zealand merchant bank subsidiary of Lloyds Bank of the UK.</p>

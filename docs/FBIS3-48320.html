			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- Social Democratic Party  (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Tuesday his party cannot  make concessions on a proposed ban on corporate donations to  individual politicians in political reform talks.    "The root cause of corruption is corporate donations," he  told a news conference. "I believe it is necessary to limit the  flow of corporate and organizational funds to a political party  and forbid one to individual lawmakers."    The SDP is the largest grouping within the seven-party  coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. His  remarks indicate the SDP cannot accept a call from the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to ease the planned  ban on corporate donations to individual legislators.    The coalition and the LDP are likely to begin formal  negotiations on possible modifications to government-sponsored  political reform bills, which cleared the House of  Representatives in November but were rejected by the House of  Councillors on Friday [21 January].    The package, aimed at rooting out rampant political graft,  features introduction of single-seat constituencies with  proportional representation in lower house elections and  stricter curbs on campaign funding.    The coalition and the LDP have been far apart on the balance  between single-seat districts and proportional representation as  well as the ban on corporate and organizational donations to  individual politicians.    Murayama also ruled out the possibility that Hosokawa will  dissolve the lower house for a snap general election if he fails  in his promise to realize reform before the current Diet session  ends January 29.    "If the lower house is dissolved amid this serious economic  slump, it will create a political vacuum," the SDP chairman  said, adding the matter should be taken into consideration at  least after the formulation of the national budget for fiscal  1994, starting April 1.    Meanwhile, a group of 19 out of 20 SDP upper house  legislators who voted against the government package or  abstained from the voting last week said Tuesday they had formed  a group intent on leading parliamentary debate to place priority  on enacting antigraft provisions rather than on proposals to  revamp Japan's electoral system.    The group said they will not send a representative to a  20-member consultative panel comprising legislators from both  houses, a panel that may produce a compromise version of the  reform package.    Seventeen SDP members voted against the bills and three  others abstained from voting at an upper house plenary session  Friday.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Lincolnshire and South Humberside (7): Investment defies the recession - Agriculture and food-processing continue to be dominant industries LINCOLNSHIRE tulip bulbs, exported to Amsterdam; Lincolnshire ducks, savoured in Japan; Lincolnshire ducks' feet, highly esteemed in China; Lincolnshire peas, computer-monitored in their pods - the county's centuries-old agricultural industry has certainly moved with the times. It is the British county most heavily dominated by agriculture. The sector employed 8.8 per cent of the county's workforce in 1987, compared with a national average of just 1.5 per cent. According to the National Farmers Union, Lincolnshire is Britain's biggest producer of cereals, potatoes, vegetables and oil seed rape. Sugar beet, poultry, pigs, flowers and bulbs are also important. The county has been affected by agriculture's trend towards increased mechanisation: between 1978 and 1988, total numbers working on Lincolnshire's land, including farmers and casual and part-timers, dropped from 29,486 to 23,167, and the decline in jobs continues. But it has also seen heavy investment by major food companies, despite the recession. It has benefited, too, from proximity to both Grimsby, a major food-processing centre, and to the Humber ports whose east-facing location will become increasingly important as a result of the single European market. Agriculture dominates Lincolnshire physically: the sparsely populated county has only eight centres with more than 10,000 inhabitants. And the sector also has important spin-offs, such as agricultural engineering. But the Rural Development Commission, promoting diversification, has been spending Pounds 2m a year on small factory and workshop developments since the early 1980s, when much of the county was designated a rural development area. All RDA boundaries are being reviewed next year. As elsewhere, there is concern over the GATT negotiations and reform of the common agricultural policy. A more localised worry - even harder to influence - is the spate of dry summers which have hit the county's irrigation systems. 'The real crunch will come if we get another dry and hot summer,' says Mr David Hill, the NFU's East Midlands senior policy adviser. The NFU is pressing the government to consider how water could be transferred, possibly into the Trent river system. Recent private-sector investments in Lincolnshire include Christian Salvesen's new Pounds 8m vegetable-packing factory at Easton, near Grantham, claimed to be Europe's most advanced. The company, the largest UK processor of frozen green vegetables, has three large plants in Lincolnshire and another at Grimsby. HL Foods, part of Hillsdown Holdings, operates three production centres in Lincolnshire, including a new chilled-salads factory at Spalding, described as the UK's most up to date. Another major food company, Geest, is headquartered at Spalding, where its Tropical Produce distribution centre has recently been refurbished. Geest's subsidiary, the Pasta Company, is now developing a large pasta-processing complex at Barton-on-Humber, in South Humberside. Other well-known Lincolnshire-based names include Nickerson Group (exporters of ducks to the Far East), near Caistor, and William Sinclair Holdings, of Lincoln, producers of horticultural, pet and equestrian products. The county is also home to a number of successful producer co-operatives. Some north Lincolnshire fields are yielding a new cash crop - oil - while, on the coast, Conoco's new Theddlethorpe gas terminal, linked to the Lincolnshire Offshore Gas Gathering System, will supply up to a third of the UK's natural gas needs. The importance to Britain's food industry of the land from the Humber to the Wash is underlined by the presence in Grimsby of 400 food-processing companies. Promoted as 'Europe's food town', it estimates that 20,000 people work in its food sector and directly related companies. Since 1989, food manufacturing investment in the town has exceeded Pounds 75m, including a Pounds 25m pizza factory, Europe's largest, developed by Ross Young. Despite the loss of deep-sea trawling in the mid-1970s, about half the town's food processors are fish-related - Grimsby still has a fleet of 100 Seine netters and the UK's largest fish market. Fish is also imported for processing. And the town has an honourable role in sustaining a great British tradition: most English fish-and-chip shops are serviced within 24 hours from Grimsby. Despite all this, the food-processing sector last year delivered Grimsby a major blow - news that Findus, moving out of fish-finger production in the UK, was to close its local plant, costing more than 900 jobs over two years. The knock-on effects of closure would be serious: Findus' gross annual wages bill locally is Pounds 7m. Its contracts with 130 local suppliers are worth Pounds 1.8m. Now, however, Booker, part of the Fitch Lovell food conglomerate, has expressed interest in taking over the plant. A deal depends on whether government assistance will be granted. All this has heightened annoyance in Grimsby that the town is an intermediate area, while Scunthorpe, with lower unemployment, is a development area, offering inward investors more incentives. It has not escaped the notice of 'Europe's food town' that, since 1984, its steelmaking neighbour has won 1,200 food-sector jobs - Scunthorpe now has seven substantial food plants, compared with just one before. In the dog-eat-dog world of lobbying for government aid, Grimsby, with its above-average jobless rate of 10.9 per cent, is arguing that it needs at least as good a deal as Scunthorpe. Unusually, Grimsby's manufacturing sector is dominated by two unlikely bedfellows - food and chemicals. The chemical industry, employing 3,200 people, lies within the borough and to the north along the coastal strip towards Immingham. It is investing very heavily in 'green' technology. But combining food and chemical industries as environmental standards rise will not be easy, admits Mr Roy Bentham, Grimsby's director of leisure and economic development. 'As years go by, we have to make sure the two don't affect each other adversely,' he warns.</p>

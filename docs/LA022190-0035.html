			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PENGUINS COUNTER LOSS WITH A WIN  </P> <P> The Pittsburgh Penguins have been hearing for several days that with Mario  Lemieux lost probably for the rest of the season, they figure to fall into the  Patrick Division cellar.  </P> <P> In their first game since Lemieux left for Los Angeles and a month of therapy,  the Penguins gave no sign they intend to fold.  </P> <P> John Cullen and defenseman Paul Coffey took up the slack and led the Penguins  to a 6-4 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers Tuesday night at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Cullen had three goals and Coffey had four assists as the Penguins rallied to  pull within one point of the division-leading New York teams, the Islanders and  the Rangers. They are five points ahead of the Flyers, who are tied for last  place.  </P> <P> There is some hope that if the Penguins are one of the four teams in the  division to qualify for postseason play, Lemieux will rejoin them. Lemieux,  suffering from a herniated disk, will not undergo surgery at this time. He will  undergo therapy and treatment under spine specialist Dr. Robert Watkins.  </P> <P> Although Cullen scored twice in the middle of the first period, Philadelphia  led, 3-2, before Coffey set up Tony Tanti and Kevin Stevens for goals that put  Pittsburgh ahead to stay late in the second period.  </P> <P> The Penguins, who beat the New York Rangers in overtime Wednesday night when  Lemieux's scoring streak ended at 46 consecutive games, are 2-1-1 since Lemieux  went out. He played only briefly in that game before the pain was too much.  </P> <P> "We're not going to moan about the loss of Mario," Coffey said. "We all have to  play a little harder and we will do all right.  </P> <P> "We have 19 games left and, I figure if we can win 10 of them we will make the  playoffs. We'll miss Mario, but we are still a capable team."  </P> <P> Coach Paul Holmgren of the Flyers said he thought the Penguins played a more  solid game without Lemieux.  </P> <P> Chicago 8, St. Louis 3 -- It was a big night at St. Louis for another Lemieux,  Jocelyn (no relation).  </P> <P> Lemieux, a former No. 1 draft pick of the Blues, had his first NHL hat trick as  the Blackhawks took a four-point lead over the Blues in the Norris Division. He  scored only 19 goals previously.  </P> <P> The Blues, with a chance to move into a tie for the lead, led, 2-1, after a  period. But Lemieux scored his eighth goal of the season 17 seconds after the  faceoff. He scored again at 4:14 and the rout was underway. At 6:30 Lemieux  completed his hat trick and Chicago led, 4-2.  </P> <P> Goaltender Jacques Cloutier had to face only 17 shots in winning his 16th game  and stretching the Blackhawks' lead to four points.  </P> <P> Buffalo 4, Winnipeg 3 -- Mike Hartman scored at 2:06 of overtime for the Sabres  at Winnipeg.  </P> <P> The Jets, unbeaten in their previous six home games, led, 3-2, until Scott  Arniel tied the game midway through the third period.  </P> <P> Edmonton 4, Vancouver 2 -- The Oilers regained first place in the Smythe  Division with this victory at Vancouver. With 72 points, the Oilers lead  Calgary by a point.  </P> <P> Boston 5, Calgary 3 -- Wes Walz, in his second NHL game, had his first goal and  assist at Calgary as the Bruins knocked the Flames out of the lead.  </P> <P> The win improved the Bruins to 36-21-5, best in the league and kept them three  points ahead of Buffalo in the Adams Division.

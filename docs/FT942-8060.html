			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Frei delays action on power of Chile's military leaders Chilean President Eduardo Frei has promised to push through important amendments to the 1980 constitution, inherited from the military regime, though he has postponed dealing with the most controversial issue - the immobility of commanders-in-chief. Mr Frei, in a weekend address to Congress, said he would seek to remove from the Senate the eight non-elected members appointed by former dictator General Augusto Pinochet. The presence of the designated senators makes it difficult to force controversial legislation through the 46-member body. Mr Frei, who assumed office in March, will also move to change the binominal electoral system which guarantees the opposition disproportionate power in parliament. However, the president, who said the proposed changes were not a matter of 'imposing one's will over others', avoided the issue of his own inability to appoint or sack military commanders, including Gen Pinochet. Mr Frei has repeatedly protested that such limits on presidential authority are incompatible with full democracy. The president, according to a fellow coalition member, Mr Jorge Schaulsohn, did not wish to 'waste time or congest the legislative timetable on constitutional reforms that we know beforehand are going to fail'. Mr Frei's willingness to avoid more controversial amendments improves his chances of pushing through those he has proposed. The president's emollient attitude, however, fails to address the current constitutional impasse in which the police chief, Gen Rodolfo Stange, remains in office in spite of government insistence that he should go. Gen Stange, one of the unremovable commanders-in-chief, is being investigated for the alleged cover-up of three political murders committed by the police. In private, the government admits it does not know how to end the confrontation.</p>

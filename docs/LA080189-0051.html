			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A bill to require drug and alcohol testing of all railroad workers who hold  safety-sensitive positions was passed by the House. Cleared on a voice vote and  sent to the Senate, the measure requires the immediate suspension without pay  of any employee who tests positive for drugs or alcohol. It requires  pre-employment testing, random testing, testing based on reasonable suspicion  of drug use, testing after train accidents as well as part of regular physical  examinations. The House passed a similar bill in the last Congress, but it  could not reach a compromise with the Senate, which pressed for drug testing of  all transportation workers.  </P></p>

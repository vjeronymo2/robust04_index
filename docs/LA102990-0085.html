			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SMOG ALERT CALLED IN NORTHERN COUNTY  </P> <P> Coastal fog that pushed its way inland caused a first-stage smog alert in  portions of northern Orange County on Sunday after it mixed with smog trapped  by a high pressure system that is expected to remain until Wednesday.  </P> <P> "Low clouds are being kept close to the ground because of a shallow inversion  layer that is making the clouds produce the fog," said Stephen Burback, a  meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which forecasts the weather for The Times.  </P> <P> Burback said the high pressure system will remain over Southern California for  at least another day, creating the unusual fog-and-smog mixture that wreaked  havoc with Orange County motorists over the weekend.  </P> <P> Once the fog lifts, high temperatures are expected in the low- to mid-80s, with  some cooling expected by mid-week, Burback said.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Santa Ana reported a warm 83 degrees after the fog lifted. Newport  Beach, which spent much of Sunday under a thick blanket of fog, was 68 degrees.  </P> <P> Anaheim had a high of 85 and San Juan Capistrano had an 81.  </P> <P> In Brea, morning fog gave way to a smoggy afternoon "that never cleared up,"  said Brea Fire Department Capt. Paul Bartley.  </P> <P> Although the air quality was unhealthful, it resulted in few calls from  residents with respiratory illnesses, Bartley said.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District posted the first-stage smog  alert at 3 p.m. Sunday after the Pollutants Standard Index (PSI) level reached  205. The PSI measures the amount of pollutants in the air, whether ozone,  carbon monoxide or nitrogen dioxide.  </P> <P> "Unhealthful for sensitive people" warnings occur when the PSI registers from  101 to 199. A first-stage smog alert, meaning the air is unhealthful for  everyone, occurs when the PSI registers 200 to 275.  </P> <P> The high-pressure system should start shifting east by mid-week, Burback said,  and Hurricane Trudy, which brought three- to five-foot breakers on south-facing  beaches over the weekend, is also expected to help clear out the smog.  </P> <P> Trudy, with winds well over 100 knots, is about 1,000 miles west of the tip of  Baja, Mexico, and about 1,200 miles south of Southern California.  </P> <P> "The lid holding the pollution and the fog would be pretty much gone in maybe  one more day, or possibly a second day before a northern storm moves down the  coast," Burback said.

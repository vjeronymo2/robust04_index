			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> Albert Maloveryan]    [Text] Tallinn, 25 May -- The withdrawal of troops from  Estonia will free Russia's hands and it will be able to defend  the rights of its fellow countrymen living in that republic more  effectively. Thus spoke Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  at a meeting today with representatives of the Russian-speaking  population. According to him, when the last soldier leaves,  Moscow will be able to step up economic, political, and  psychological pressure on the Tallinn authorities and thereby  provide all the necessary guarantees for not only military  pensioners but the non-native population of Estonia as a whole.    The minister told his fellow countrymen about the results of  the meeting of the foreign ministers of the member-countries of  the Council of the Baltic states which was held there. He said  that the "problems of the Russian-speaking population and  military pensioners raised by the Russian delegation found wide  response among the other participants in the conference." The  head of the foreign relations department of the Russian  Federation told them about progress in the implementation of the  state aid program to compatriots living abroad. He lamented  that the 35 Russian departments participating in it "are not  always free from the prejudices of the cost-led economy." It  seems that the Foreign Ministry which he heads is no exception  since the Russian Embassy in Tallinn still has no "secret"  telephone link with Moscow.    In conclusion Kozyrev replied to numerous questions from  those present and assured them that Russia "will not leave its  fellow- countrymen abroad to the mercy of fate."    Also today, the foreign minister of the Russian Federation  left Tallinn for Paris to attend an international conference  which opens tomorrow on signing the pact on stability in Europe.</p>

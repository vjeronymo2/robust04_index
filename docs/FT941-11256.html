			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Warsaw deputy premier Borowski offers resignation Mr Marek Borowski, Poland's finance minister and deputy premier in charge of the economy, offered his resignation yesterday as leaders of Poland's two coalition parties sought in vain to define their relationship within the government, writes Christopher Bobinski from Warsaw. Several hours of crisis talks yesterday saw leaders of Mr Borowski's LeftDemocratic Alliance (SLD) failing to wring assurances from Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister and Peasant party (PSL) leader, that he would respect the division of powers inside the government agreed when the coalition was established last autumn. Mr Pawlak has yet to accept the resignation, which comes after he last week dismissed Mr Stefan Kawalec, a deputy finance minister, against Mr Borowski's wishes. That sacking followed a row over the pricing of a bank privatisation.</p>

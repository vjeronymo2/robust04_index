			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: For investors with an eye to foreign profits / A look at when and where to buy THERE IS an old stock market adage: 'Sell in May and go away. Come back on St Leger day.' With interest rates in the UK relatively low, Britons thinking of investing overseas in the hope of better returns could find some wisdom in this saying. St Leger day this year falls on September 11. The chart shows that, since 1964, the average capital return on the FT-All Share index between May 1 and September 11 is just 0.56 per cent. By investing on September 11 and selling on April 30, though, the average return rises to 10.7 per cent. The same principle seems to hold true in world markets. Since 1982, the average return April-September is 1.54 per cent compared to 10.72 per cent for the rest of the year, according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International index. Darting in and out of the market can be expensive and hazardous, though. Most experienced private investors know the best returns come over the long term, with five years a prudent minimum. 'Sell in May' can be used as a guide to timing - especially if tthe main world markets show signs of being quiet over the next few months. New investors may consider it better to wait, rather than monitor their investments nervously throughout the dog days of summer. The Weekend FT asked fund managers what they thought of the strategy, and which markets offered the best opportunities. Martin Wooller, director of fixed income at Fidelity Investments: 'Statistically, sell in May has often been a good policy, especially in the UK. 'But equity investment is, and should be, long term. Do not try to be a short-market timer. The professionals can't do it, so there is no reason why others should be able to. 'We are cheerful about the UK because the market appears to be buying the green shoots recovery story and there are, once again, good stocks to pick out. We do not focus on the blue chips but more on the FT-SE 350. The market is broadening, so this would be a good time to go in. 'The European markets are behaving sensibly in that they see German monetary policy being relaxed, which is improving the valuation basis of the markets. But earnings disappointments will come through in the summer so, again, that could be a good time to buy. 'We are cautious about the US because of anxiety that the recovery is faltering. A number of companies have reported disappointing earnings. 'If you want to sell in May, this would be the market to get out of; but we would say, put at least part of the money back into south-east Asia for the long term because the place keeps growing. 'Hong Kong, as an entry point into China, is not for the faint-hearted because there are dangers that the Chinese economy is overheating. And there is still the question of what will happen after 1997. But we regard it as a long-term hold.' David Rosier, chairman of Mercury Asset Management Private Investors: 'Market timing is the hardest part of the business. Short-term movements have got very difficult to predict and are getting harder because the world has become a smaller place. 'The Japanese market has risen strongly in response to foreign buying, but it is expensive. Company profits will continue to fall. 'Our view is that the market is unlikely to rise sharply from present levels and, when people focus on its evaluation, there is a risk that it could fall sharply. 'We are neutral on the US. There is a modest economic recovery but the market is fully valued. 'Continental Europe has reacted positively against a background of falling interest rates, but the markets are having a hard time coming out of recession - they are behind the UK in this. Some areas are more attractive than others. For example, the new government in France is likely to focus on domestic issues and rates will come down. 'We are positive about UK equities. There will be a gradual recovery in a low interest-rate environment, and there could be good growth in the economy in the next year and the year after. 'The next few months could be a good time to build up a portfolio when the market is not rising quickly. But you must accept that the shares you buy now may be slightly lower in value in a few months.' Jeremy Tigue, director of Foreign and Colonial Management: 'Although sell in May is a reasonable theory around the world, for many investors the time to buy is in a period of weakness. We think the UK market will be higher by the end of the year than now. But the British Telecom issue and Zeneca rights issues in June/July will act as a restraint on the market. It will then be the holiday season, so the market is likely to be quiet. 'The market in the United States has not done very much recently but there are signs of recovery. We are now waiting for President Clinton's announcement on health-care reform. 'The health-care sector has already suffered a lot in expectation of what might happen so, unless the plans are radical, the market might be discounting the bad news. 'There is bound to be a period of consolidation in Japan. After the steep rise in the Nikkei index the chances are that the market will be quiet for the next few months.' Michael Lenhoff, portfolio strategist with Capel-Cure Myers, feels the major markets are over-valued. 'On a price/earnings ratio the UK, at 17 times 1993 earnings, is higher than in 1987. In the US the multiple is 16 and that, too, is high. 'In Europe, Germany is extremely expensive; it is about 40 per cent overvalued on a p/e ratio. So, the conventional wisdom is appropriate for these markets. 'We are, nonetheless, keen on the US market. Recovery is being translated into strong corporate earnings' growth and monetary policy is good, too, but the cloud is political. 'We are worried by the difficulty President Clinton has had with his economic stimulus package. So, there is an added dimension of uncertainty, which the market will treat adversely. 'We are equivocating on Japan. There is no evidence of a recovery in corporate profits, and there are even questions about that in 1994. 'We had increased our weighting to Japan at the end of last year, but we would not go any further at the moment. 'We are expecting 5-7 per cent growth in south-east Asia and have a double weighting in this part of the world. 'Hong Kong looks expensive and is overvalued, but it is one of the few plays on China. There will be short-term volatility, but we want to be in that market for the long term. 'In the UK, we were saying that the FTSE-100 would reach 3,300 by the end of the year, but that assumed further interest rate cuts. We might have to trim back our year-end forecast to 3,150.'</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT FOES CORDON OFF BUCHAREST INTERSECTION;  </P> <P> ROMANIA: LAWMAKERS EMPOWER POLICE TO INTERVENE, SETTING UP A NEW CONFRONTATION.  </P> <P> Anti-government protesters cordoned off a busy intersection Monday, and one  chamber of the Parliament empowered police to break up the demonstration,  setting up the battle lines for a new confrontation.  </P> <P> The brutality unleashed against residents of the capital last week has served  only to embolden anti-Communist demonstrators, who now sense that President Ion  Iliescu's new government is on trial with Western democracies.  </P> <P> By reoccupying University Square and obstructing traffic, the protesters have  put the government on notice that the unrest will end only when their demands  for dialogue on opposition rights are met.  </P> <P> The newly elected Chamber of Deputies voted to give the police power to move  against the disturbance, but it was not clear when such action might be taken.  </P> <P> "The city is just boiling," said Victor Bradu, a 34-year-old artist at the  protest, describing the public mood after last week's violence.  </P> <P> Others said there will be no peace in the capital until Iliescu's leadership  shows some tolerance toward dissent by allowing independent television to  operate and by lifting restraints on newspapers that have been critical of his  National Salvation Front.  </P> <P> The protesters contend that Iliescu's party is a haven for former Communists,  like himself, who claim to seek a path toward Western democracy while  repressing opponents in the style of their totalitarian predecessors.  </P> <P> Iliescu last week summoned to Bucharest a horde of miners who rampaged through  the city for three days, beating citizens at random with crude clubs and rubber  hoses. They destroyed the headquarters of Romania's two main opposition parties  and shut down the newspaper Romania Libera and other publications that had cast  Iliescu and the front as neo-Communists.  </P> <P> The brutal tactics have given credence to the oppositions' accusations against  the front and united the student and intellectual communities against the  government that has ruled since the December overthrow of dictator Nicolae  Ceausescu.  </P> <P> "Those who love democracy and liberty and fight against communism will not give  up simply because the current leaders have reverted to the system we had under  Ceausescu," said Leonte Teodorescu, a history professor showing solidarity with  the demonstrators.  </P> <P> Laszlo Tokes, an ethnic Hungarian religious leader in Transylvania, has  suggested that Romania may be headed for "a second revolution" to free itself  from communism.  </P> <P> Iliescu is under strong foreign pressure to restore some semblance of democracy  in his troubled nation or forgo the Western aid and trade benefits under  consideration for Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "It will be difficult to mend this breach in their image, as it is a very  severe one," said a senior West European diplomat.  </P> <P> Foreign ministers of the European Community, meeting in Luxembourg, decided  Monday to postpone a decision on granting special aid to Romania because of the  violence.  </P> <P> In Washington, the U.S. State Department called Monday for the government to  immediately release demonstrators they wrongfully jailed last week, and again  warned that U.S. economic aid will be held back until the government respects  human rights.  </P> <P> At the parliamentary session that convened Monday, opposition deputies insisted  that last week's violence be investigated.  </P></p>

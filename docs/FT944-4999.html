			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television An unexpectedly good evening in. Omnibus looks at Robert Louis Stevenson, the centenary of whose death falls this year, in Stevenson's Travels (10.20pm, BBC 1) with PD James and fellow Caledonian literati Candia McWilliam and Alasdair Gray. This extraordinary story-teller has been taken for granted too long. What the deadpan social satire in Without Walls: Chez New:House of Glass (9.30pm, Channel 4) reveals is less a Treasure Island for our times than a Jekyll and Hyde parable of modernity and high technology, as we suffer with Debra from Canonbury while she tries to get her ultra-new house built. This is preceded by Battersea Bardot (9pm), a catchpenny title for a tawdry tragedy. The irony is that while Cathy Come Home sparked off a national scandal about homelessness, the star, Carol White, went on to a disastrous career that ended in drugs, penury and obscure death in America. It sounds as trite as London Kills Me (10pm, Channel 4), Hanif Kureishi's unoriginal expose of the underside of a not so swinging London.</p>

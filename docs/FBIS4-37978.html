			<p>BFN     [Text] The higher committee for receiving donations met  yesterday under Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, Presidential  Council member and the committee's chairman. The committee  members discussed a number of issues on the committee's agenda  which aim at activating the higher committee's work and  expanding its activity outside the homeland in a bid to allow  our expatriate citizens to join in the honor of participating in  the popular move to support the efforts to defend unity and  constitutional legitimacy. In order to achieve that goal, the  higher committee for receiving donations set up a committee to  contact the brother expatriates in sisterly and friendly states.    In a related development, Brother Judge Hamid al-Hitar,  member of the higher committee for receiving donations and head  of the health care committee, said in statements to the Yemeni  News Agency, SABA', that a medical convoy yesterday left for the  governorates of al-Bayda' and Abyan, with a shipment of  medicines and supplies needed by the hospitals in the two  governorates to enable them to offer medical services and full  health care.</p>

			<p>Nicaragua   <F P=102>   PA1706045494 Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO DE HONDURAS in Spanish  13 Jun 94 p 12 </F>  <F P=103> PA1706045494 </F> <F P=104>  Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO DE HONDURAS </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Army Commander General Guillermo  Paredes has said the joint patrols Honduran and Nicaraguan  troops are conducting along the border are yielding positive  results. The military chief has said the operation along the  border consists of an inspection of each area, although the  troops coincide only in certain points to coordinate actions  against delinquents, rearmed groups, or drug traffickers.    He added the war on drug trafficking, which has been  intensified in recent days, is primarily a police task, but the  military force is present to provide support whenever necessary.  He explained it is inadvisable to report on the border patrol  operations, because that would alert delinquents.    Paredes has also said the ceremony marking the closing of  the  DNI [Department of National Investigation] was an appropriate  recognition of those who devoted their lives to serving the  fatherland. In addition, the ranking officer has said that the  DNI had heroes who gave their lives in service of their country  and that this was an indication of loyalty and devotion.  Paredes has said the DNI closure is a historic event, because a  civilian corps technical in nature will replace this institution.    Modern times point to new paths, Paredes has said, but we  must be careful whenever substantial changes are made in  organizations that are in charge of public security, because an  error of appreciation could generate problems in the near  future. The DNI, he added, has to be replaced by a corps with  greater professional outreach, capable of facing the high crime  rate that has beset the Honduran nation.</p>

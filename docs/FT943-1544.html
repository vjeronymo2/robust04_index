			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley plans restructuring - Unquantified charges dash investors' hopes of increased dividend Laura Ashley, the clothing and furnishings retailer, yesterday dashed hopes of an increased dividend with its second profits warning in a year. The group said unquantified restructuring charges expected in the second half would hit full-year profits. This meant it would be unlikely to pay anything more than a nominal dividend this year, similar to the payment of 0.1p in 1993. The scale of charges would be determined by an extensive costs review, expected to be completed in January. The warning accompanied the announcement of interim pre-tax profits up from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 5.1m, after net gains of Pounds 2.2m covering disposals and exceptional charges. Gross profit rose 3 per cent to Pounds 80.1m (Pounds 77.4m), on sales also of Pounds 148m (Pounds 144m). Shareholders, who have remained loyal through several years of restructuring, are likely to be sharply disappointed with the company's comments. Earlier this year, hopes were raised of at least a marginal increase in the payout after the final results. 'Investors have been holding out for a while now in the hope that these results would show they had managed to turn round the US and get to grips with stock problems,' said one analyst. 'None of these things has occurred.' The company also announced that it would not look for a chief executive until the cost review had been completed. A new management team had been put in place following the departure of Mr Jim Maxmin, as chief executive, and Mr Andy Higginson, as finance director. Mr Geoff Haslehurst, commercial director, has become finance director and Mr Graham Searle, former managing director of Dunhill, is to continue as managing director for the time being. Mr Haslehurst admitted that the prospects of further restructuring had been disappointing to the group and shareholders alike. However, costs were too high. Laura Ashley would also have to tackle further stock problems, although these were not expected to have a substantial adverse impact. The retail business returned flat sales in the first half on a like for like basis, hit by difficulties in the garment business. These had been addressed and current sales were up by 5 per cent on a like for like basis in the UK, 13 per cent in North America and were flat in Europe. There is no interim dividend. Earnings were 1.21p (0.22p). COMMENT Just when shareholders thought they had truly earned a respite from the bad news at Laura Ashley, the group comes up with this. Based on its own calculations of what returns should be, the second-half charges could be as much as Pounds 20m-plus. Even more worrying is the thought that it will not look for a chief executive in the short-term. If anything, Laura Ashley needs a strong figure to balance what appears to be resurgent family interests. However, it tried that once without success. Excluding the uncertain charges, forecasts have been pulled back from Pounds 10m to Pounds 7.5m. this is not one for the faint-hearted.</p>

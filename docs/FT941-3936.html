			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Level playing field is required for UK Nasdaq Sir, Ronald Cohen and Sir Andrew Hugh Smith present contrasting views on the merits of a separate smaller companies stock market (Personal View: March 8). What do private investors - key buyers of growth stocks - think on this longstanding issue? Having watched the rise and demise of 1980s Over-The-Counter and Third Markets, I recall more wealthy share promoters than investors who backed fledgling issues. Standards of disclosure outside the London Stock Exchange were appalling. Sir Hugh's concern for quality reporting is therefore imperative. Shouldn't investors have 'information rights' to glean most of what is required to value shares from the financial statements? Mr Cohen doesn't even mention disclosure, and as a venture capitalist he must ensure a market for his seedcorn investments. Buyers beware. But the London Stock Exchange hardly champions investors outside City circles. Representatives of its member firms have privileged access to company results briefings, where the future is evaluated and quickly factored into share prices. 'Sid' has no access to these meetings, and is also disadvantaged by smaller company share placings which favour institutional investors. Even in a major offer for sale, individuals typically receive a prospectus only 48 hours before the applications deadline - with insufficient time for consideration. If Mr Cohen's proposed 'UK Nasdaq' will radically reform new issues for private investor participation, list detailed company announcements on TV Ceefax and uphold reporting standards, it could win strong public support.

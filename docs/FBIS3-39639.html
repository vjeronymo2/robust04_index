Joe Clark, the UN secretary  general's special representative in Cyprus, headed the UN  delegation. The meeting lasted two and a half hours.    In a statement after the meeting, Clark said that Kliridhis  and the UN officials had a preliminary talk on all the key  points and added they will do the same during their meeting with  Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas this afternoon. Clark said:  I do not want to define where we stand point by point. He  described the discussion as useful and said it is completely in  line with the positive developments and goodwill shown by both  sides so far.    Asked whether they discussed the map, Clark said they looked  at some maps and will surely look at some more. Asked whether  there was an agreement on the maps, Clark said the UN officials  noted the position they were presented with and will consider it  as the procedure develops.    Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said our side is  attending the proximity talks in goodwill and a constructive  spirit, aiming to reach an agreement within the four  prerequisites set by the UN secretary general. He mentioned  that some procedural issues were discussed at the meeting and  our side explained its positions on significant issues such as  handing over Famagusta's fenced-off area to UN control and the  opening of Nicosia Airport.    Kasoulidhis noted that our side did not make any suggestions  that fall outside the four UN secretary general's prerequisites.  He added that safe movement to and from Famagusta and security  in Famagusta's fenced-off area during the return of residents  and during the work to reconstruct the city are high on our  side's agenda and are considered necessary prerequisites for the  success of the talks. Our side made suggestions on these issues.    Our side also raised the issue of the timeframe in which  Famagusta's fenced-off area should be handed over to the United  Nations, the time during which the legal residents will be able  to get back their property in the first phase, and the time  during which the legal residents will be able to get back their  property in the second phase in conjunction with the timeframe  for opening Nicosia Airport.    The spokesman mentioned that our side raised various issues  on the opening of Nicosia Airport, always keeping in mind the UN  secretary general's four prerequisites. It also discussed with  the UN envoys some of its positions on Butrus-Ghali's first  document, which refers to 14 confidence-building measures.  Kasoulidhis said: We have not exhausted our positions on many  issues. We will do this tomorrow and we will wait to hear the  other side's views.    Answering a question, Kasoulidhis said that Kliridhis raised  with the UN representatives the issue of Famagusta's fenced-off  area map and asked that the United Nations present a more  detailed and accurate map to the two sides as soon as possible  so that both sides could agree on the map that would be used in  the talks. The UN representatives will present the map by  tomorrow. Kasoulidhis mentioned that he will release the map  that the United Nations gave to the government last May, adding  that it was small and did not present the area clearly and with  details.    In a statement before the meeting, Clark said progress has  been made and added that there has been an agreement in  principle on the confidence-building measures and an agreement  on how we will proceed. Clark said: I hope we will be able to  draw a clearer picture on how the two sides approach the key  points and discuss them with the two leaders. I intend to  discuss all the key points to make as much progress as possible  today. I believe there is a basis for some optimism because we  have made some progress. The challenge is to maintain this  progress in a way acceptable to both sides. Clark said: This  is just one phase of the procedure. Success on the  confidence-building measures opens the door to success on the  most basic issues.    Answering a question on whether he will not deal with the  first of the seven points on the agenda, Clark said he intends  to deal with all the issues today. He said: In every meeting  we will define the specific order we will follow. I believe it  is important to clarify from the start that we intend to deal  with all the points at every meeting. Asked whether Famagusta's  map, which is printed today in some newspapers, is the true one,  Clark said he did not see the map.    The UN envoys will meet Denktas this afternoon.</p>

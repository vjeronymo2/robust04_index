			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / US official to visit Pakistan Ms Hazel O'Leary, the US energy secretary, is to visit Pakistan this week in an initiative to promote US investments in Pakistan. Ms O'Leary will head a delegation of more than 70 leading businessmen with interests mainly in the energy sector. Mr John Monjo, the US ambassador to Islamabad, described the visit as 'a forward-looking event' in encouraging private American investments. The two officials played down concerns that prospects for new investments were limited until Pakistan and the US resolve their dispute over Islamabad's controversial nuclear programme. Washington cut off aid to Islamabad three years ago amid concerns that Pakistan was producing nuclear weapons - a charge denied by Pakistan. Although Ms O'Leary is not expected to sign any fresh aid agreements, her visit will help encourage US businesses to consider investing in Pakistan, officials from both sides said. Mr Monjo said prospective investors were encouraged by Pakistan's economic liberalisation programme, which had remained intact despite five changes of government last year. He also said a new energy policy, announced by the government this year, was attracting new investors. Pakistani officials expect the two countries to sign fresh joint venture investments worth up to Dollars 2bn by next summer. If those forecasts prove accurate the extent of US investments in Pakistan could rise substantially. In the past 46 years, US businesses have invested up to Dollars 450m in Pakistan. According to Pakistani energy officials, new commitments to support investments of up to Dollars 5bn have been received by the Ministry of Water and Power in Islamabad since the energy policy was announced. If those projects are executed, they will add almost 5,000 megawatts to Pakistan's existing power generation capacity of approximately 9,500MW.</p>

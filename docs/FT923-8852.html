			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Books: A Georgian man of letters - Anthony Curtis reads a new biography of Robert Bridges ROBERT BRIDGES: A BIOGRAPHY by Catherine Phillips Oxford Pounds 25, 363 pages LARKIN gave Bridges five entries in The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse and that seems about right compared (say) with Yeats's 20. 'A Passery-By' and 'April 1885' show Bridges at his solemnly rhetorical best; the much anthologised 'London Snow' reveals his skill at delineating landscape and in matching sound to sense; and 'Poor Poll' his humorous virtuosity with the long syllabic line, incorporating sentences in Latin, Greek, German, Italian and French into its texture. Then Larkin ends with 'Ethick,' part of the final section of The Testament of Beauty containing Bridges' thoughts on prayer. That poem in four parts - an extended paean as much to Reason as to Beauty, published in 1929 - was Bridges' swan-song. By then, he was a vigorous 85-year-old poet laureate, awarded the OM by King George V to whom the Testament is dedicated. Its sales took the Clarendon Press at Oxford by surprise. They originally printed around 2,000 copies, but 19,000 had been sold by January 1930 and it went through edition after edition until the mid-1940s. It went out of fashion as Eliot's Four Quartets, a similar kind of poem, came in. The face Bridges presents to us in his work, and in the photographs contained in this biography, is that of a Georgian man of letters par excellence. He belonged to the last generation of poets before modernism took over and subversion of the social order through literary work became the norm. In Bridges, we have a supreme example of the writer, not as any kind of rebel, but as a respectable member of society helping to prop up its foundations. Bridges combined this with deep concern for the purity of the English tongue and a zeal to reform our language's illogical spelling. That campaign, which involved the Oxford Press trotting out several new typographical symbols in order to print his Society for Pure English pamphlets in his private alphabet, came to nought. Ezra Pound, who was a contemporary, admired one or two of Bridges' lyrics. The two men met and Bridges - of whose charm of manner Catherine Philips gives examples - went through Pound's Personae and Exultations helpfully, commenting on the style. Afterwards, though, Pound could not resist putting in the boot. 'I spose,' he wrote in a note to TS Eliot, 'I can cite what I once said of Britches? I managed to dig about 10 lines of Worse Libre out of one of his leetle bookies.' It is characteristic Poundage: highly amusing and grossly unfair. Bridges was not a particular champion of vers libre and his 'leetle bookies' are full of examples of a consummate use of rhyme and other meticulously executed metrical forms. As a poet, Bridges was not in the least complacent; he experimented continually, at one stage taking classical prosody as his model. Beginning in 1912, Bridges' reign as poet laureate was long and prestigious, but he has had bad luck since. He is remembered by the literary world not as a poet in his own right but as the friend and literary executor of Hopkins, especially as the individual responsible for preventing Hopkins' work from seeing the light of day fully until the end of the First World War. Many years after Hopkins' death. Bridges wrote to Hopkins' mother and explained that it was because he himself was trying to write poems in sprung rhythm that he did not wish the poetry-reading public to have - for the present, at any rate - the confusing example of Hopkins' eccentric use of it. Was Bridges merely being self-seeking in this most controversial decision of his life? Bridges' latest biographer has a foot in both camps, being also the editor of the Oxford Authors' edition of Hopkins and of his selected letters. Phillips suggests, somewhat tentatively, that it was more a case of Bridges being naive and perhaps a little arrogant than of anything else. Bridges admired the work of his old Oxford contemporary and friend but, having rescued it from the Jesuits, did not see just what a poetic bombshell he was sitting on. It was only after the great success of Bridges' wartime anthology The Spirit of Man (1916) - a fascinating insight into Bridges' eclectic taste in literature and philosophy, in which he published some of Hopkins' poems alongside Rimbaud's - that he felt the time was ripe for an edition of them. Phillips does not allow the relations with Hopkins to take up a disproportionate share of this carefully written life. She traces Bridges' early years - after his education at Eton and Oxford - as a doctor, including a spell in the casualty department at a top London hospital. There followed his happy marriage to Monica, daughter of Alfred Waterhouse, the architect. Bridges met his wife through living on Waterhouse's estate at Yattendon, near Newbury. After that came Bridges' decision to give up medicine and become a full-time poet and essayist. Like Maugham's similar decision, it eventually paid off. When Waterhouse died, the couple used some of their inheritance to build a permanent home they called Chilswell on Boar's Hill. Once they were established there (surviving a disastrous fire), Oxford welcomed Bridges back into the academic and musical fold with honorary fellowships, recitals and dining rights. Bridges' early friendships with late Victorians like Henry Newbolt, Digby Mackworth Dolben and Canon Richard Watson Dixon are balanced at the other end of the scale by his exchanges with Bloomsberries like EM Forster and Clive Bell. Let us leave him entertaining Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley and Ottoline Morrell on Boar's Hill. Woolf writes that Bridges 'sprang from a rhododendron bush, a very lean tall old man with a curly grey hat and a reddish ravaged face, smoky fierce eyes, with a hazy look in them; very active, rather hoarse, talking incessantly.' This book serves him well in the quiet, painstaking, scholarly way he would, surely, have appreciated.</p>

K.C. Li, a department chief with the Council for Economic  Planning and Development (CEPD), said Taiwan's index of leading  economic indicators, which measures economic prospects three  months ahead, rose a mere 1.6 percent in February, lower than  America's 3.8 percent, Japan's 4.6 percent, Germany's 6.4  percent, Britain's 9.2 percent and France's 2.8 percent.    The leading indices of the 12-member European Union [words  indistinct] Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development surged 6.5 percent and 4.9 percent respectively in  February, Li reported.    "All these figures show that the Taiwan economy is not  recovering as fast as industrialized countries," Li noted.    He said one major reason behind Taiwan's slow recovery is  that local enterprises still hesitate to make new investments.    Li pointed out that although a government economic forecast  released earlier this year optimistically predicted that private  investment would grow 13 percent in 1994, machinery imports  declined 0.9 percent in the January-February period as compared  with the year-earlier level. Machinery imports are used to  gauge a country's investment activity.    Li said relatively high interest rates have undermined  investment willingness here. Taiwan's prime lending rate now  stands at 7.75 percent, 2 to 3 percent higher than that in many  other countries.    Difficulties in land acquisition have also discouraged  investment, Li said. According to a recent CEPD survey, 758  private companies have been forced to shelve their investment  plans since last August because of difficulties in acquiring  needed factory land.    As part of its effort to encourage private investment, Li  said, the government has decided to release at least 2,382  hectares of industrial land in the near future for local  manufacturers to house their new plants.    Li added he remains cautiously optimistic about Taiwan's  economic prospects for the year. Global trade is expected to  grow 5.4 percent this year, higher than 1993's 2.6 percent  growth. "This is good news for Taiwan's export-oriented  economy," Li observed.    He further said the New Taiwan [NT] dollar depreciated by an  average of 6.36 percent against the US dollar, the Japanese yen  and the Deutsche mark in the past few months. The NT dollar is  expected to remain weak in the months ahead and this will help  boost Taiwan's export competitiveness, he added.</p>

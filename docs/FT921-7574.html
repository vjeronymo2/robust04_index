			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / De Klerk throws down gauntlet to right: Referendum for whites aims to defuse Conservatives' threat to reform PRESIDENT F W de Klerk's announcement of a referendum to determine white support for political reform in South Africa shows considerable political courage. It carries enormous risks. If he wins, he will be the hero who saw off the right wing threat, clearing the way for peaceful transition to majority rule. Should he lose, the alternative is too ghastly to contemplate. The return to power of a party, in this case the Conservative Party, committed to returning to the days of grand apartheid, would provoke civil conflict on a scale not yet seen in South Africa. In the short term, Mr de Klerk has regained the initiative from the right-wing CP which trounced Mr de Klerk's National Party (NP) in Potchefstroom by-election on Wednesday. Both parties billed the by-election as a test of white opinion on the negotiation process. The Conservative Party's victory has allowed it to boast that it is now the voice of the majority of whites. Mr de Klerk's announcement will test that boast, but this time on conditions more favourable to the president. By-elections are great opportunities for casting a protest vote. Potchefstroom, a small town 120km south of Johannesburg, was no exception. There was much to protest about. White voters are nervous about the pace and content of political reform. Compounding this anxiety are spiralling levels of violence, three years of recession and a debilitating drought. All these factors assisted CP candidate Mr Andries Beyers in overturning a NP majority of 1,583 votes to win by 2,140 votes on Wednesday, a swing of 11 per cent. However, the conservatives will find a referendum more difficult to win. Mr Donald Simpson, a pollster at Potchefstroom University, calculates that based on Wednesday's result, an alliance of the NP and the liberal Democratic Party should win 59.5 per cent of the vote in a referendum to 40.5 per cent by pro-CP right-wingers. Mr Tony Leon, Democratic Party MP, argues that voters will reward Mr de Klerk for his bravery. 'It is a remarkable move. People will always respond to courageous and strong leadership and he's offered both in strong doses.' Surprising though the referendum announcement was, the reasoning is not hard to discern. The CP believes the Potchefstroom victory merely proves its contention that while the NP is negotiating on behalf of whites at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, the CP truly represents most whites. The National Party knew it faced a haemorrhage of support to the right while having precious little to deliver to the electorate in terms of a clear political future, or better economic conditions. Mr de Klerk turned the tables. The CP will have to replace electoral triumphalism with a reasoned defence of its view of the future. This prospect fills the NP with confidence. At an election meeting last week in Potchefstroom, Mr de Klerk said voters should not vote for the policies they prefer, but for the policy which can succeed. He described CP policies as 'a suicide path for Afrikaners, whites and all other minorities'. Mr de Klerk said there were two issues facing white voters: which party will they trust to negotiate for them, and whose policy can best secure their and their children's future. The NP is sure to stress in the weeks ahead the CP's inability to deliver on either score. But the National party will be aware too of the need to communicate much more closely with its followers about what is happening at the Codesa talks on democratic reform; in particular, that the government is not planning to hand over power. Commentators have recently likened Mr de Klerk to General Jan Smuts, the South African statesman respected abroad but rejected by the electorate at home in 1948. Mr de Klerk will be determined to prove the comparison invalid. Ironically the ANC - which is opposed to any racially-based referendum  - is likely to play an important role assisting Mr de Klerk. It will be forced to support him, if for no other reason than the fact that there is no prospect of negotiating with a Conservative government. Professor Mervyn Frost of Natal University notes that on the one hand the ANC will have to be reasonably low-key, so as not to frighten white voters away from the NP through guilt by association. On the other, they can considerably strengthen the National Party's hand by issuing mollifying statements on issues such as nationalisation, white schools, and job security in the civil service. The ANC will not like having its hand forced in this way, but it has little choice.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (6): A small shift overseas - The US FOR YEARS, there has been speculation that the US pension fund industry would start to invest serious portions of its collective portfolio in overseas markets. And, for years, there has corresponding little action. But now, it seems that the sums which investment managers are willing to devote to overseas holdings are finally becoming meaningful. According to the annual survey conducted by Greenwich Associates, the Connecticut-based consultancy, the 2,000 largest US tax-exempt pension funds held around 4.5 per cent of their assets in international stocks by end-1990. In money terms, that amounts to around Dollars 87bn. True, this still compares poorly with the percentages invested abroad by the likes of the UK pension industry. Nevertheless, recent progress towards more geographically diversified portfolios by US funds should not be understated. For example, the public sector pension funds, the most laggardly element of the pension sector in this respect, held around 1.7 per cent of their funds' assets in international stocks back in 1987. Today, the figure is 3.2 per cent. And most observers reckon that the trend has considerably further to go. Greenwich Associates itself concluded that by 1993, around 7.7 per cent of US pension funds' assets might be invested internationally. Quite why US pension fund managers have seen the light recently is a matter of debate. Some observers suggest that the trend results largely from the development of overseas markets themselves, with the result that a substantially larger spread of investment opportunities has been created. Equally, it may be worth noting that certain traditional domestic investment areas, like real estate, have hit well-publicised problems, at least in the short term. This may have stimulated the search for prime opportunities elsewhere. Greenwich Associates, for example, notes that the percentage of funds planning to start investing in equity real estate has been declining over the past few years 'from 9 per cent in 1988, to 6 per cent in 1989, and to 3 per cent in 1990.' Nevertheless, most players involved with the pension fund sector concede that this international thrust is not without problems. 'Many fund managers are wrestling with currency management,' comments one large mutual fund group - although it adds that 'the lag on the learning curve is disappearing fairly quickly.' Another factor worth considering is the fact that net cash flows in the US pension fund sector are currently negative, by a fairly significant margin. This, in turn, may stimulate the search for asset growth. Distributions last year were estimated at around Dollars 89bn, compared with contributions of about Dollars 83bn. In 1989, cash flow was negative to the tune of some Dollars 1bn. The pressure is noticeably greater among the corporate pension funds - in contrast to the public sector, where contributions still outweigh distributions. Quite separately, the sector is tussling to establish what role it should play in corporate governance. It could be argued that US investors have woken up to the excesses of the 1980s somewhat belatedly, but a general stirring among pension fund managers is now perceptible. The latest proxy season has not be a comfortable one for some US companies, and a number of high profile public pension funds - like Calpers - can take some of the credit.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106>   [Interview with Pal Csaky, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Christian Democratic Movement Club of Deputies, by Jana  Pankovcinova; place and date not given: "The Hungarian  Coalition Will Support the Law on Bilingual Signs"]    [Text] At the May meeting of the National Council of the  Slovak Republic, deputies are expected to discuss the  government- sponsored amendment to the law on the official  language, under which, in communities in which the Hungarian  minority represents at least 20 percent of the population, it  will be possible to use the name of the community in the  language of the minority in accordance with a list of community  names that has been drawn up. This amendment is being referred  to as the law on bilingual signs. We have asked Pal Csaky,  chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH]  Club of Deputies, whether the Hungarian coalition will support  the bill in parliament.    [Csaky] We have proposed several times that the limit be  lowered to 10 percent. We did not propose this for the sake of  the Hungarian minority, but in the interest of the other ethnic  minorities in the Slovak Republic. Should, however, only a  limit of 20 percent guarantee the passage of this much-needed  law, we will accept this and will give our support to the bill.  I hope that the bill will be passed, although there are still  some problems. These should be sorted out predominantly at the  political level.    [Pankovcinova] What problems do you have in mind?    [Csaky] The list of admissible names in the language of  minorities that is to constitute a separate supplement to the  law will contain the Slovak and Hungarian names of communities.  Experts are now holding discussions on what name to give every  community. I do not consider this approach fortunate. The name  that is being used at present should be accepted, in my opinion.  After all, the law's objective is to calm passions and to give  citizens a feeling of being at home.    [Pankovcinova] You are talking about calming passions. Are  you not afraid of the opposite? When the same bill was  discussed in the National Council of the Slovak Republic several  months ago, the plenum approved the motion by a Slovak National  Party deputy that the limit be raised to 30 percent, which  eventually blocked the bill's passage. Is there no danger of  the same situation recurring?    [Csaky] The 20 percent limit is the maximum in Europe. In  Finland, for example, the limit is 7 percent. Slovakia is in  store for a bitter election struggle, in which everything,  including this law, will be used and misused. This is also  signalled by the counter-proposal put forward by deputy J. Rea  (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia). This counter-proposal  only repeats the proposals made by the former government of  Vladimir Meciar, which are unacceptable to us. I am calling for  wisdom and tolerance. If we really think that Slovak society  should become more democratic, then no one can object when, at  the points of entry and exit of a community, the name of the  community is given also in the language of the minority. The  Slovak name will remain the official name of the community that  will be used on maps, in telephone directories, bus and train  schedules, etc., even though former Minister of Transportation  and Communications Hofbauer misleads the public by claiming the  opposite.</p>

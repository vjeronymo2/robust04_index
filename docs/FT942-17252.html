			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / People: Lasmo To Rudolph Agnew falls the job of leading Lasmo back from the wilderness. The struggling oil company, which recently passed its dividend, yesterday named Agnew to succeed Lord Rees who steps down as chairman next month. Agnew is an experienced boardroom hand, of course. As chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields, he fought off the 1988 takeover bid by Minorco, only to agree a sale to Hanson, on whose board he subsequently sat. He has held several other chairmanships including Stena Line and TVS, and is non-executive director of numerous other companies, among them Newmont Mining and Standard Chartered. His mining experience has taught him that 'there's no future in predicting the commodity price. You've got to get down to being a low-cost producer of whatever you produce.' As for the oil price, 'you must assume that it's going to be low,' he said yesterday.</p>

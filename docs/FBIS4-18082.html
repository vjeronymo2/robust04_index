			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Franz Schoenhuber, chairman of the  right-wing extremist Republikaner, maintains his accusation of  "instigating people" against Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the  Central council of Jews. "I do not retract one word here and  now," Schoenhuber stated in Bonn on Tuesday [29 March] and  added, "I am calmly expecting a lawsuit."    Schoenhuber justified his accusations by pointing to  statements by Bubis at the beginning of March, when the latter,  in the view of the Republikaner chairman, blamed followers of  his party for being coresponsible for arson attacks. As a  result, Schoenhuber filed a criminal complaint with the Bonn  Land Court on 4 March, accusing Bubis of instigating people and  slander. The proceedings are underway but it was passed on to  the Mainz public prosecutor's office, obviously because of  competence.    After the attack on the synagogue in Luebeck Schoenhuber had  repeated the accusation and called Bubis one "of the worst  instigators of people in Germany," after Bubis, for his part,  had called right-wing extremist parties "intellectual arsonists"  and blamed them for the attack on the synagogue.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Shop staff 'back Sunday opening' MOST shopworkers who work on Sunday do not object to doing so, according to a survey published yesterday. But while 54 per cent have no objections, 46 per cent of the 5,000 workers questioned by the University of Stirling's Institute for Retail Studies said there were disadvantages. The findings were published as Kwik Save, the grocery discount chain, announced that while it had opened on the last two Sundays before Christmas it had no plans to open on future Sundays. It remained opposed to unrestricted Sunday trading because that would lead to increased costs for the industry and 'ultimately to the demise of the unique high street shopping environment we enjoy in this country'. The survey of shopworkers who work on Sunday for nine multiple grocery and DIY retailers - the largest of its kind so far undertaken - was commissioned by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, which campaigns for limited deregulation of Sunday opening. The most popular motive for Sunday working was financial. Seventy per cent of workers received at least time-and-a-half pay for Sunday working. Only 2 per cent said the principal reason for working was because they were forced to by management. The Keep Sunday Special campaign, which supports only limited Sunday opening, attacked the survey as a 'sham' because it relied on interviews with people who already work on Sundays. A survey commissioned by KSS from Cambridge University in November found that 93 per cent of unionised employees not currently working on Sunday did not want to do so, and a third of employees had been asked to work on a Sunday but had refused. Usdaw, the shopworkers union, said the survey confirmed its experience that full-time permanent shop staff and managers were reluctant to work on Sundays. Mr Roger Boaden, director of the Shopping Hours Reform Council, said the survey showed fears about Sunday working were groundless. Sunday Working.

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Automotive boost for Ricardo RICARDO GROUP, the engineering consultancy where top management changed last year after a boardroom upheaval, reported pre-tax profits up 31 per cent, from Pounds 2.04m to Pounds 2.67m, for the year to end-June. Sir Philip Foreman, chairman, said the new team had carried out the commitment made a year ago to do better for shareholders, in spite of continuing economic difficulties in its business sectors. The group now operates three divisions - automotive, aerospace, and a mainly nuclear-based high technology consultancy. Mr Christopher Ross, chief executive, said the automotive division had been the group's main strength. The division carries out work for Japanese, US and EC carmakers on exhaust emissions, noise, fuel economy and performance, and now numbers four of the six German carmakers among its customers. The group had transferred its thinking in the automotive sector to its other divisions over the past year, he said, moving into more high margin, added value work. Customers included Rolls-Royce and Airbus, and the group had won a big contract from Shorts of Belfast for work on a new executive Lear jet. Operating profits were ahead 69 per cent at Pounds 4.14m (Pounds 2.44m) on turnover up 15 per cent at Pounds 59.9m (Pounds 51.9m). Total group turnover of Pounds 65.6m (Pounds 57.6m) included Pounds 5.59m from discontinued operations. This reflected the contribution from Ricardo Technical Communications, the group's publishing division, sold in June. Exceptional items amounted to Pounds 967,000, including a Pounds 300,000 write-off of goodwill on the disposal and a Pounds 650,000 property write-down. The group said it had maintained a strong balance sheet in spite of Pounds 5.4m of capital expenditure, Pounds 2.6m of depreciation and Pounds 1.6m of research and development costs. Net borrowings at the end of the year were Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.6m) and gearing was 15 per cent (12 per cent). Earnings per share were 4.2p (3.6p). The proposed final dividend is 3.8p for an unchanged total of 5.7p.</p>

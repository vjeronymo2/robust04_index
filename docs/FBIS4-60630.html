			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 May (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today received the credentials  of Ambassador Ahmad Muhammad Luqman, Yemen's new delegate to the  Arab League, succeeding Ambassador Ahmad al-Shajni, who died  recently.    Ambassador Luqman stated that he and the Arab League  secretary general discussed several issues concerning ways to  resolve the Yemeni crisis and said that the Arab League has  resumed its mediation efforts to resolve the crisis. He noted  that efforts are being made quietly to resolve the crisis within  the context of the Yemeni Constitution. He said: In Sanaa we  look at the situation from the viewpoint that a state exists and  there are legitimate constitutional institutions chosen by the  entire Yemeni people. Hence no party has the right to declare  secession.    He described the current war in Yemen as one between the  legitimate government and separatist rebel forces.    Asked about Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's  readiness  for dialogue with the Aden leaders, Luqman said Sanaa has never  stopped the dialogue, which continued throughout 'Ali Salim  al-Bid's stay in Aden. He called for resorting to legitimacy  and constitutional institutions.    Ambassador Ahmad Muhammad Luqman, Yemen's new permanent  delegate to the Arab League, was born in al-Hudaydah in 1948 and  began his political career as deputy minister of social affairs  from 1976-1980. He then became minister of state and secretary  general of the Higher Council of Youths and Sports from  1981-1983, minister of municipalities and housing from  1983-1988, and minister of insurance and social affairs from  1990-1993.</p>

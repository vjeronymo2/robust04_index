			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Noriyoshi Igarashi: "Chinese Approaches </F> to Japan -- a Strategy To Keep the U.S. in Check"]    [Text] Beijing -- Chinese Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji, who  is playing a key role in promoting China's reform and opening up  policy, will visit Japan from 23 February. The Japanese  Government is studying ways for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  to pay an early visit to China. The Japanese and Chinese  Governments, which have agreed to further strengthen their  relations, plan to promote a brisk exchange of visits by their  leaders. The Chinese Government, which sees Japan-China  relations as the centerpiece of China's foreign policy strategy,  is placing increasing importance on Japan.    China wants to keep the United States in check and this is  one of the major reasons why China has reaffirmed its policy of  attaching importance to Japan.    China has used its big market as a trump card to promote the  economic diplomacy. Major European nations, which imposed  sanctions on China following the Tiananmen incident, have  competed with each other in mending their fences with China.  The United States, however, has kept its sanctions against  China in place. Both China and the United States have begun to  move toward improving relations following Sino-U.S. summit talks  in November 1993, but there has been no change in the U.S.  attitude toward China. The Chinese side believes that as long  as forces that loathe the dictatorship of the Communist Party  are active in the United States, U.S. policy toward China will  continue to waver.    As an Asian and Pacific nation, China places the greatest  importance on relations with Japan and the United States. It is  quite natural for China to attach importance to Japan while its  relations with the United States remain unstable. China is  seeking more aggressive cooperation from Japan. A Chinese  source said: "It is not good for China to stay in the same  place indefinitely."    China hopes Japan will distance itself from the United  States  and adopt its own foreign policy. Both Japan and China have a  common interest in the stability of Asia. China believes its  best bet at the moment is to emphasize the importance of  cooperation with Japan.    An example is North Korea's suspected nuclear development.  China's position is that "North Korea's military strength poses  no threat to Japan, the United States or South Korea, and China  will seek to settle the issue through dialogue rather than risk  the danger of war on the Korean peninsula by joining the United  States in threatening North Korea." China asserts its position  is in the interests of all Asian nations, including Japan.    China hopes for economic cooperation from Japan and this is  a  primary factor in its policy of promoting relations with Japan.  Japan's aid and investment, including its transfer of high  technology to China, are indispensable for the development of  China's economy, energy and infrastructure, such as railroads  and irrigation. China needs Japan's know-how to promote its  market economy. China is seeking Japanese cooperation in  gaining the membership of GATT.    China believes both China and Japan need to understand each  other more deeply and this is another reason for China  approaching Japan. In the past few years, awareness has grown in  Japan of the threat from China.    With China's economy growing rapidly, China has been  modernizing its military and paying attention to the sea,  thereby heightening awareness among Asian nations of the threat  of China. Japan has pointed out its concern over China's  military buildup at every opportunity and linked its aid to  China's military buildup. China has tried to allay concerns  about China's military buildup, citing the low level of China's  military spending.    There is also the issue of Taiwan. A high-ranking official  of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry visited  Taiwan last year. China reacted by expressing concern over the  visit.    China is increasingly jittery about the issue of Taiwan.  Taiwan is moving toward becoming an independent nation and the  United States has continued to sell weapons to Taiwan. In  addition, Taiwan and the ASEAN are making conspicuous  rapprochement. If the United States and the ASEAN support  Taiwan's position, it would become a major stumbling block to  the reunification of China. As China sees it, it is necessary  to drive a wedge between the United States and ASEAN.    China is concerned that if China and Japan do not deepen  each other's understanding of the issue, it will destroy the  foundation of Japan-China relations. China believes the two  countries need to hold more discussions to that end.    While China thinks there are some outstanding issues with  Japan, it feels friendly toward Japan.    One of the reasons for China feeling friendly toward Japan  is  Prime Minister Hosokawa's attitude toward Asian nations. During  his visit to South Korea, the prime minister expressed the  forthright remorse for Japan's war of aggression that China has  long sought.    China sees the Chinese and Japanese as Orientals. The  Chinese leadership appears to be a little weary of U.S. attacks  on China's abuse of human rights. China firmly believes it is  Japan that fully understands China's assertion that "China needs  stability."    China has remained silent about the breakdown of the  framework talks at the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks. China  appears to be appraising Japan's action in its heart. A Chinese  official expressed sympathy to Japan, saying, "The United States  is adopting a heavy-handed method in the economic field." China  appears to be hastily analyzing how the breakdown of the  framework talks will affect Japan-U.S. relations, Japan-China  relations, and China-U.S. relations.</p>

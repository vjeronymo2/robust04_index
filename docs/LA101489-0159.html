			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS' OLD NEMESIS HAS NEW LOOK  </P> <P> So much has changed for the University of the Pacific football team this  season.  </P> <P> The Tigers have a new coach in Walt Harris, who has installed a new offense.  They have abandoned the wishbone for a passing game that is being guided by  former Mission Viejo High School quarterback Troy Kopp.  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton can only hope that the peculiar phenomenon of Pacific  football has changed as well.  </P> <P> Pacific hasn't had a winning season since 1977, but for the past four seasons,  the Tigers have given Fullerton fits.  </P> <P> A look at the legacy:  </P> <P> 1985 -- Fullerton took a 22-0 lead in the first quarter, then collapsed. After  three quarters, Pacific led, 30-29. It took a touchdown with less than two  minutes left for Fullerton to win, 43-37.  </P> <P> 1986 -- In the final game of a season in which Fullerton had won only two  games, the lead went back and forth. Fullerton went 98 yards for a touchdown  with a minute to play to tie the score and made a two-point conversion to take  a 39-38 lead. But the Titans let Pacific drive deep, and held on to win only  after a 45-yard field goal try failed.  </P> <P> 1987 -- In a game that may be the most notorious in the Titan tradition of  self-destruction, Fullerton lost, 22-14, in a game ridden with penalties and  turnovers.  </P> <P> 1988 -- Fullerton's vaunted defense gave up two huge plays, including a 77-yard  touchdown pass, and the Titans trailed at halftime, 10-7. A bumbling Titan  offense couldn't score another touchdown, but Stan Lambert pulled out a 13-10  victory with two 40-yard-plus field goals -- the second after a series in which  the Titans managed to gain only one yard.  </P> <P> As Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy takes his team into Pacific's Amos Alonzo Stagg  Memorial Stadium at 2 p.m. today, it's difficult for him to know what to  expect.  </P> <P> Refer to the phrase that has become Murphy's weekly refrain: "It depends on  which team shows up."  </P> <P> Will it be the turnover-prone team of the early season, the one that just  avoided being upset by Cal State Northridge?  </P> <P> Will it be the potent offensive team that took a 27-point halftime lead over  Nevada Las Vegas?  </P> <P> Or will it be the confounding team that let Dan Speltz's school-record 481  yards passing go to waste in a 34-23 loss to winless Utah State last week?  </P> <P> From Fullerton's point of view, it simply needs to be a team that will win.  </P> <P> With a 1-1 record in the Big West, Fullerton would almost certainly be out of  contention for the conference title with another loss.  </P> <P> "Two losses, and it's over," Murphy said.  </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> Pacific's Greg Koperek, a senior defensive back from Edison High School, had  four interceptions in four games before breaking his arm against Fresno State.  Doctors said he might be out for the year, but this week doctors gave him  clearance to play -- only three weeks after the fracture. . . . Titan injury  report: Defensive lineman John Bavaro, who suffered bruised ribs in the first  quarter of the loss to Utah State last week, has not been through full  practices this week but is expected to play. Fullerton is one of only two  conference teams that does not have a winning series record against Pacific.  The Titans are 7-7. New Mexico State is 4-5. . . . Fullerton and Pacific have  one common opponent, Nevada Las Vegas. Fullerton beat the Rebels, 34-20.  Pacific lost to the Rebels last week, 30-7.  </P></p>

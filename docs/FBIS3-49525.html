			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Journalists showed great interest in the Croatian  view of the negotiations in the Croatian Embassy in Bonn this  morning. The majority of the journalists' questions referred to  the cease-fire agreement -- an agreement which the Croatian side  had put forward -- and the status of Neum. We are singling out  as particularly important remarks made by the Croatian president  regarding the results and conclusions of the NATO summit in  Brussels:    [Begin Croatian President Franjo Tudjman recording] It was  with great expectations that the world awaited the NATO  conclusions. As far as we are concerned, we can be pleased with  those points referring to the crisis in former Yugoslavia,  particularly the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. These conclusions  for the first time show a higher level of resolve to apply  force, air strikes not only against those who are strangling  Sarajevo, but also against those who are preventing the passage  of humanitarian aid, and also against those who are threatening  certain areas by their offensive combat operations. This is very  important for us, as this directly refers to the current Muslim  offensive in central Bosnia. From that point of view, it seems  that these conclusions will also contribute to speeding up and  concluding negotiations on restoring peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording]</p>

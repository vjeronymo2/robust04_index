			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Bayer The market should hardly have been surprised to learn that Bayer's full year profits will be lower than last year. Dreadful figures from ICI and DSM last week underlined how bad conditions in bulk chemicals have become. On top of the cyclical problem of over-capacity and weak prices, European companies face the threat of cheap dollar imports. The foreign exchange markets have been doubly unkind to Bayer; its US pharmaceuticals earnings will be weak this year when translated into strong D-Marks. There must be some doubt about how far pharmaceuticals can prop up the bulk chemicals side. The company is not alone in facing the threat of a tougher drugs pricing regime in the US, whoever wins today's presidential election. Equally worrying is the prospect of enforced 5 per cent price cuts in Bayer's home market, but it is encouraging to see the company determined to keep the lid on costs. Third quarter figures due at the end of this month will determine whether Bayer joins ICI, BASF and DSM on the list of chemicals companies with doubtful dividends.</p>

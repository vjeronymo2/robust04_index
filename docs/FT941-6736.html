			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Treuhand finalises sale of Laubag, Veag The German Treuhand privatisation agency yesterday sealed the sale of eastern Germany's brown coal fields and the region's largest electricity company, writes Judy Dempsey. The sale of the Laubag lignite mines and Veag ends a two-year attempt by the agency to sell the two companies. Laubag was sold to a consortium, led by Rheinbraun, a subsidiary of RWE, and which includes PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk. The consortium is expected to invest DM6bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in the fields and to guarantee at least 10,000 jobs.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Burns-Anderson shares suspended BURNS-ANDERSON, the recruitment and financial services group formerly chaired by Sir John Harvey-Jones, had dealings in its shares suspended at 2p yesterday, pending clarification of its financial position. The group, which recorded pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.74m in 1991, has been in negotiations with its bankers, which include National Westminster, pending an extraordinary general meeting on Tuesday . The group's net assets had dropped to less than half the value of its share capital. Burns-Anderson is the holding company for the country's third largest network of independent financial advisers, Burns-Anderson Independent Network. Mr Alan Taylor, managing director of the network, which has 375 members registered with Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for IFAs, said yesterday that his company was financially 'ringfenced' from the group. There were no cross guarantees and there could be no call on his company's assets were the group to go into liquidation. Fimbra said yesterday that it was watching the situation closely. Most of the company's problems have been caused by a downturn in business in the group's recruitment companies, Morson International and Burns-Anderson Recruitment. Sir John Harvey-Jones, former chairman of ICI and renowned troubleshooter, was on the Burns-Anderson board between June 1987 and March 1991. The company fell into loss in 1989-90.</p>

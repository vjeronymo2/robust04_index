			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP from Washington] </F>   [Text] North Korea has clearly expressed that it will  accept the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] proposal to  send an additional inspection team to Pyongyang for inspections  of a radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon.    Kim Chong-su, deputy ambassador of the North Korean Mission  to the United Nations, said today that, because they had already  proposed that the IAEA send its inspectors to Pyongyang, they  would accept them at any time. Also, he acknowledged, for the  first time, that North Korea had not begun the work of replacing  fuel rods at the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor.    Diplomatic sources in Washington said that North Korea has  already issued visas for the IAEA inspectors to visit Pyongyang.  They predict that IAEA inspectors will leave for Pyongyang this  weekend and that they will conduct inspections early next week.</p>

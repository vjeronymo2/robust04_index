			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Democrat line on tax code criticised TAX proposals by Governor Bill Clinton, Democratic presidential candidate, to keep US factories in the country would further complicate the US tax code and cause 'a terrible misdiversion of tax energy', according to Dr Gary Clyde Hufbauer, author of a new study from the Institute of International Economics. He proposes restructuring the US tax system for multinationals to encourage both exports and foreign investment in the US, and to reverse the bias against US production of high-technology goods. He also urges co-operation among the leading industrial countries in devising common rules on taxation of foreign earnings. Taxation of foreign subsidiaries in the US is a presidential campaign issue. Mr Clinton has suggested Dollars 45bn (Pounds 25.2bn) can be raised over four years by requiring foreign companies 'to pay their fair share'. Legislation put to Congress this year would require a minimum tax on foreign companies which underpay their US tax through transfer pricing. The study concluded that the US could raise Dollars 6bn a year through improved enforcement of transfer pricing and the use of a timely arbitration procedure to settle disputes. Implementation of all their reforms would yield Dollars 12.3bn annually. In taxing multinationals, they recommended: An end to taxing income earned by US companies from their foreign operations, while abolishing the foreign tax credit for earnings abroad. Increasing the Foreign Sales Corporation exemption from 15 per cent to 40 per cent. Ensuring that royalties and fees earned overseas by US companies are taxed solely by the US at normal corporate rates. (Technology income earned abroad is almost tax-exempt now, while technology income earned by the same companies in the US is normally taxed at 34 per cent.)</p>

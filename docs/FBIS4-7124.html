			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Fuel Rod of Experimental Nuclear Power Station To Be </F> Replaced in DPRK" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- According to a  spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea, the DPRK will soon begin the replacement of  the fuel rod according to the operation plan of the 5 megawatt  experimental nuclear power station for the present as part of  the undertakings for the normalization of our peaceful nuclear  activities.    Answering a question put by KCNA today, the spokesman said:    Consistent is our stand to show the honesty of our nuclear  activities, although the replacement of the fuel rod is being  made while we are still in a unique status following the  temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared  withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.    Hence, we decided to voluntarily notify the International  Atomic Energy Agency of our plan for the replacement of fuel rod  and, especially, to allow inspectors of the IAEA to observe the  process of replacement of the fuel rod so that they may verify  that nuclear materials are not diverted to non-peaceful  purposes, and promptly issued entry visas to the inspectors as  requested by the agency.    If inspection activities falling within the scope of routine  and ad hoc inspections are raised in the course of the  replacement of the fuel rod, they may be allowed after the  nuclear issue is settled in a package deal at future DPRK-U.S.  talks.    We will leave the fuel rod to be replaced this time strictly  under the containment and surveillance of the IAEA and fully  provide the continuity of safeguards data.    We are studying the problem of "additional inspection" of  the  radiochemical laboratory raised during the March inspection  activities of the IAEA in close relations with the attitude of  the United States and the IAEA Secretariat.    Hence, we have already notified them that we are willing to  allow an "additional inspection" as an exception after examining  their future behavior in keeping with the change of the current  situation surrounding the exchange of special envoys between the  North and South.    If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat, ignoring our  good will, rudely demand sampling and other inspection  activities in disregard of our unique status at the time of the  replacement of the fuel rod, we will have to regard it as a  sinister political intention to continue more openly the  campaign for stifling the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear  activities.    When an irrevocable complex situation is created by that, we  cannot hold ourselves responsible for it at all.    If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat respect our  unique status and take a fair attitude and position, looking  straight at the current situation, another opportunity of  finding a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue will be  created.</p>

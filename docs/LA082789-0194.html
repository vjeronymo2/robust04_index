			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The operator of Pennsylvania's Limerick 2 nuclear plant was granted a  full-power license after agreeing to make nearly $2 million in modifications to  bolster the plant's ability to withstand a severe accident. The $2.9-billion  reactor had been in the planning and construction stages for 20 years. Before  the 4-0 vote by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Philadelphia Electric, the  plant's operator, and the citizens' group Limerick Ecology Action reached  agreement in a dispute that threatened to send the parties to court. LEA had  been pressing for possible design changes to lessen the risk and environmental  impact of a severe accident. Philadelphia Electric agreed to make two plant  modifications, evaluate others and allow an LEA safety expert on a review team  to study risk reduction efforts at Limerick. The modifications were not  required by the NRC.  </P></p>

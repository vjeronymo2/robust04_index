			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / New row in prospect over EU recycling proposals The 18-month row over the anarchy in Europe's divergent regulations for recycling waste packaging is threatening to reignite following a new block yesterday on a common European Union law which should already have been agreed. The long-stalled waste packaging directive was agreed in principle last December, against German, Dutch and Danish objections that its targets for the recovery and recycling of packaging were not stringent enough. Passage of the directive is a litmus test of the Twelve's ability to reconcile their environmental ambitions without distorting competition in the single market. A year ago, France threatened to ban imports of German packaging waste, and six other states complained their own recycling industries were being buried under the volume of waste Germany was sending to its neighbours for processing. Before this, Germany, tired of waiting for legislation at EU level, had set itself ambitious recycling targets it did not, and still does not, have the installed capacity to meet. Furthermore, it has undercut its partners by subsidising the waste it exports. The UK complained last year that its imports of plastic waste had rocketed by 450 per cent in 1992 against the previous year, entering in some cases with German subsidies of Pounds 200 per tonne. Although last December's deal was brokered by the Belgian EU presidency, it is, ironically, Belgium which has now gone over to the German side. Along with the Netherlands and Denmark, it constituted a blocking minority at a meeting in Luxembourg of EU environment ministers which the 'green' northern trio could not muster on their own. If Belgium cannot be budged in negotiations at senior official level in the next few days, lengthy negotiations with the new European parliament have to begin. Moreover, from July when Germany assumes the EU presidency, it would fall to Mr Klaus Topfer - Bonn's environment minister and unrepentant architect of the stricter and contested German legislation - to act as conciliator. The targets Mr Topfer thinks too low require a minimum of 50 per cent and maximum of 65 per cent of packaging waste to be recovered within five years of the directive coming into effect. Within that, a minimum of 25 per cent and maximum of 45 per cent would have to be recycled. The centre of the new row is a new two-part amendment from the European parliament saying that the EU can use 'economic instruments' (including taxes) to further the recycling effort, but that these should not distort competition or the free movement of goods. The caveat worries the Belgians. High waste packaging recycling standards and 'green' taxes put in place in the past few years by the Flemish regional authorities could face legal challenge Belgium fears, even though a little-tested EU treaty article does allow higher standards on public health and environmental grounds even when there are competition side-effects. Belgium believes it needs to register its opposition now, to stand a chance in the European Court later if the Flemish standards are ever challenged. The fact that the parliament's amendments include possible fiscal intervention in recycling (including tax incentives) has also worried the UK government, which is firmly opposed to EU-wide taxes on the environment.</p>

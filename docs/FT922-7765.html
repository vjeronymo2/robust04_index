			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / International Company News: Perrier blames 9% fall on impact of Gulf war SOURCE PERRIER, the celebrated French mineral water group recently taken over by Nestle, the Swiss food multinational, yesterday reported a 9.2 per cent decline in net profits for last year. France's leading mineral water group attributed the earnings decline, to FFr325m from FFr358m in 1990, to the economic impact of the Gulf war. A slowdown in tourism hit sales to hotels and restaurants, but the weather also played a part. Consumers drank less in what was an unusually cool summer in France and the US last year. Turnover climbed only slightly, by 3.3 per cent from FFr13.19bn to FFr13.63bn. There was a fall in extraordinary gains from asset sales, to FFr78m last year from FFr403m in the previous year. Operating profits were also down, by 3.2 per cent to FFr1.07bn over the same period.</p>

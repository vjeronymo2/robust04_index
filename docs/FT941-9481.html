			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Foreign investment pours into Kazakhstan Multinationals are flocking to Kazakhstan which is approving some of the richest energy and privatisation deals in the former Soviet bloc. Two years after the Soviet break-up, Kazakhstan is second only to Russia among the 15 ex-USSR republics in attracting foreign investment. Mercedes-Benz, Fiat, and Daewoo have all established sales offices in the the country which is committed to a gradual move to a market economy and mass privatisation. Philip Morris is investing Dollars 300m (Pounds 205m) for a 88 per cent share of an Alma-Ata cigarette factory and some tobacco farms. Almost every big and many smaller western oil companies are vying to exploit the republic's reserves, which some analysts estimate at 35bn recoverable barrels. Kazakhstan is the second biggest former Soviet oil producer after Russia, with an annual output of about 22m tonnes. It produces around 12 tonnes of gold a year and contains much of the former Soviet Union's silver, lead, zinc, copper and other mineral resources. The republic's industry is based mainly on metallurgy, heavy machinery, agro-processing, petrochemicals and textiles. The International Monetary Fund has lent its endorsement to the republic, granting Dollars 1.3bn to support the local currency, the tenge. Western donors have pledged official cash worth Dollars 1bn to Kazakhstan this year to help its transition to a market economy. The Philip-Morris deal and a couple of high-profile oil agreements have helped Kazakhstan partly to satisfy Western investors that, unlike many of its former Soviet counterparts, it is a serious partner. The government has tenders out for two large state margarine factories and a sweet-making plant. The privatisation tenders, scheduled to close in March, have attracted a lot of foreign interest, according to Ms Susan Bruno, a local representative of the consultants KPMG Peat Marwick. This is at least partly because successful buyers can expect to own the plants almost outright, instead of the usual 49 per cent limit in many republics. Later this year, the government also plans to privatise 38 big state enterprises, but through local ownership. There are, however, considerable difficulties; Kazakhstan has a daunting combination of Asian-style personal business, Soviet bureaucracy and rampant corruption and crime. 'This is not an easy country to do business in. The costs are very high,' says Mr Ben Miller, managing partner for the Ernst &amp; Young office in the capital, Alma-Ata. 'They are educated people. If you think you're going to come in, take advantage of the locals and go home with a pot of money, it isn't going to happen.'</p>

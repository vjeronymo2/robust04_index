			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Optus threatens to drop cable-TV network plan Optus Vision, the recently-formed joint venture involving Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network, Continental Cablevision of the US and Australia's Optus Communications, yesterday threatened to drop its plans to build a national cable network for Australia after the federal government said it would allow duplicate cabling by rival provider Telstra. Telstra, better known as Telecom in its home market, has recently linked with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to develop a cable infrastructure, primarily for the provision of pay-TV. The Optus Vision network, by contrast, would be used for pay-TV and interactive services, but would also aim to carry local telephony facilities. Mr Michael Lee, the federal communications minister, yesterday said monopolies in cable infrastructure would not be allowed, and that the government would not act to stop duplication of cable networks being laid by the Optus Vision and Telecom/News Corporation consortia. Optus Vision had proposed a mechanism by which the two network providers would not build rival cable networks in any area before one cable was built to all populated areas of Australia. After Mr Lee's statement, it noted that if it pulled out of the infrastructure race, Telecom's monopoly over local telephone services would be preserved. 'The prospect of local phone calls becoming cheaper will effectively disappear,' said Mr Bob Mansfield, chief executive of Optus.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Directors respond to 'inaccurate and misleading' criticism Amstrad's directors sent a letter to shareholders yesterday responding to some of the criticism of Mr Sugar's 30p-a-share buy-back bid for the shares he does not already own. The board, which does not include any non-executive directors, described some of the comment on Mr Sugar's offer as 'inaccurate and misleading.' In particular the directors emphasised that Kleinwort Benson, 'is not providing, and never has provided, advice to Amshold or Mr Sugar' in connection with his bid. 'Kleinwort Benson was appointed by Amstrad's board to provide independent financial advice for shareholders on the proposal.' The letter also defended the proposed Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) loan from Amstrad to Amshold, Mr Sugar's private takeover vehicle. In connection with Mr Sugar's offer price, directors warn shareholders 'that a company's audited net asset value does not represent its likely realisable value on liquidation nor necessarily its value on sale'.</p>

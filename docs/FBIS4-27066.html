			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] While speaking yesterday afternoon at the  meeting to exchange experiences in improving the style of  thinking of the leading bodies of departments directly under the  jurisdiction of the provincial government, provincial party  Secretary Guan Guangfu stressed: Departments directly under the  jurisdiction of the provincial government should strengthen the  building of their leading bodies and [words indistinct].  Provincial party Deputy Secretary and Governor Jia Zhijie  presided over yesterday's meeting. Present at the meeting were  provincial party Deputy Secretary Qian Yunlu and Ding Fengying,  Li Daqiang, Deng Guozheng, and Huang Zhiyuan, Standing Committee  members of the provincial party committee.    In his speech, Guan Guangfu fully affirmed the gratifying  achievements scored, over the last few years, by the leading  bodies of departments directly under the jurisdiction of the  provincial government in improving their style of thinking.  [passage indistinct] [passage omitted]    Some leading bodies and leading cadres have little interest  in theoretical study. Some leading cadres' sense of purpose is  getting blunted, and ideas such as money worshiping, hedonism,  and out-and-out egoism are spreading among them. A small number  of cadres are corrupt. Some leading bodies inadequately  practice democratic centralism and are disunited and  uncoordinated in action. Still other leading cadres have a  superficial style of work, lax discipline, and are inefficient  in work. We should attach great importance to these problems  and take effective measures to solve them. [passage indistinct]  [passage omitted]    Guan Guangfu pointed out: In the new situation, in improving  the style of thinking of the leading bodies of departments  directly under the jurisdiction of the provincial government,  with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide,  we should comprehensively improve their quality and genuinely  build them into strong and fighting collectives which are firm  politically, bold in making reform and blazing new trails,  united and coordinated in action, and are able to perform  official duties diligently and honestly, maintain close ties  with the masses of people, and comprehensively implement the  party's basic line. Therefore, at present and for a certain  period of time to come, in improving the style of thinking of  the leading bodies of departments directly under the  jurisdiction of the provincial government, we should pay  particular attention to the following aspects of work:    1. We should thoroughly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, learn about  socialist market economy, and strive to enhance our ability to  solve practical problems by using theories as a weapon and to  control the overall situation of market economy. [passage  indistinct] For leading cadres to study theories, what counts  is perseverance, willingness, and an effective guarantee in  terms of systems. The core-group study system of the leading  bodies of departments directly under the jurisdiction of the  provincial government should be upheld.    2. We should practice democratic centralism, do an ever  better job of maintaining unity among leading body members,  foster an idea of keeping the overall situation in mind, enforce  discipline, strive to achieve unity with the party Central  Committee ideologically, politically, and in action, ensure that  government decrees are implemented smoothly, and promote Hubei's  reform, development, and stability. [passage omitted]    3. We should effectively improve party style and strengthen  the building of clean government and strive to set a good  example in performing official duties diligently and honestly.  Persisting in opposing corruption and encouraging honesty,  improving party style, and strengthening the building a clean  government have always been the focus of the party building in  the new period and especially improvement of the style of  thinking of leading bodies. [passage omitted]    4. We should improve our leadership methods, change our work  style, and improve our work efficiency. Leading bodies should  start with overcoming formalism, enhance the sense of  approaching things realistically and stressing practical  results, and creatively do their work in light of the actual  conditions of their subordinate departments. Leading bodies  should energetically conduct investigation and study, adhere to  the concept of from the masses and to the masses, go down to  grass-roots units to extensively solicit the opinions and  demands of the masses, find out the contradictions and problems  existing in their practical work with comrades at the  grass-roots units, study work, sum up the new experiences the  masses have created in practice, offer specific guidance, and  help them solve practical problems. [passage omitted]    In conclusion, Guan Guangfu stressed: Secretaries of the  working party groups (party committees) of various departments  should effectively and personally take up the job of improving  the style of thinking of leading bodies and play an exemplary  role in this regard. [passage omitted]    More than 1,000 persons including members of the working  party groups (party committees) of the various departments,  commissions, offices, and bureaus under the direct jurisdiction  of the provincial government attended the meeting.</p>

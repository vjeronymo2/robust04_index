			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan has called  for restraint and understanding in relations with Cambodia,  saying Thailand cannot respond to the daily accusations by Phnom  Penh of its support for the Khmer Rouge.    The government should be firm and act maturely as the  Cambodian allegations could be made for domestic gain or to  resolve internal problems.    Surin's comments came amidst strong criticism by Cambodian  leaders, who have repeatedly charged that Thailand has assisted  the Khmer Rouge to launch offensives and sheltered the Maoist  faction's leaders.    Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut has  threatened to take the matter to the UN Security Council. He  also warned that bilateral relations between the two governments  could be jeopardized.</p>

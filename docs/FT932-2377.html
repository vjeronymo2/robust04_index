			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (4): Airlines' problems fail to deter newcomers - Transport, Karen Zagor explains rail's recovery 'We travel by plane, oftener than not, and yet the spirit of our country seems to have remained a country of railroads' - John Cheever. IF THE quintessential American Wasp author of Bullet Park were alive today, he might be gratified to see how literally the spirit of the railroads has been resuscitated in the US, after nearly being smothered by the predominance of airplanes. Thanks to the vast distances between cities in North America, air travel began to take over from railroads as the main means of transport during the 1960s. In recent years, a business traveller would be almost as likely to ride a camel to a meeting as travel by train in most parts of the US, Canada and Mexico. But with the advent of high-speed trains, there are signs of a rail revival, at least in the US. On the popular New York City to Washington DC route, a high-speed Metroliner train has competed successfully with the airlines for many years. Although the journey by Metroliner takes just under three hours and is considerably slower than the half-hour flight, it is popular with business travellers who enjoy circumventing airport traffic. In addition, trains are rarely delayed by bad weather. According to Amtrak, which runs the passenger rail service, the company accounts for 45 per cent of all rail and air passengers travelling from New York to Washington. Amtrak is now testing trains for a high-speed service from Boston to New York. By 1997, it hopes to have trains operating at 150mph along the Boston to Washington corridor. These would cut nearly two hours from the standard Boston to New York service, and shave about 40 minutes from the regular Metroliner time. Extensive rail projects have sprung up in many metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles. In Texas, plans for a high-speed rail service are on the drawing boards, but opposition from local airlines, fearful that they will lose too many customers to the trains, may ultimately kill the project. For the moment, competition from the railroads is the least of the airline industry's worries. The combined forces of high fuel costs, fewer travellers and the recent series of crippling fare wars have left the industry badly bruised and deeply in the red. In the past three years, the biggest US airlines lost more than Dollars 10bn. Some of the biggest US carriers, including Pan Am, Eastern, Midway and Braniff, have not survived. TWA is a shadow of its former self, and Continental has only recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Instead of the Pan Am and Eastern shuttle from New York's La Guardia to Washington's National airport, passengers must now look to USAir and Delta, although planes still depart every half-hour with every passenger guaranteed a seat. Yet tough times have not discouraged newcomers from entering the fray. They include: Kiwi, which recently started flying from New York's Newark airport; Reno Air (which operates out of Reno, Nevada); Morris Air, which flies from Salt Lake City; Private Jet, which is based in Atlanta; and Ultrair, a Houston-based carrier which offers up-scale services at full-fare economy prices. Although the airlines have suffered tremendously from their own fare wars, there are no signs that the days of the cut-price ticket have ended. Indeed, before the official start of summer this year, Northwest Airlines launched a bout of price-slashing by offering discounts of up to 33 per cent on domestic flights. The terms and conditions of these deeply-discounted fares can make it difficult for a business traveller to take advantage of them, especially since most discounts require advance purchase and a Saturday night stay. Some carriers offer corporate discounts to big companies. Others, such as Air Canada, offer special discounts for business meetings and conventions on full-fare economy and business class fares when companies make bookings for at least 10 people travelling to the same destination. If working to a tight schedule, it is worth checking with the Department of Transportation, which publishes detailed information of on-time performances for regularly scheduled flights. For example, Delta's flight from Miami to Atlanta at 2:15pm arrived 27 minutes late more than 80 per cent of the time in April. Travel agents and airline ticketing offices also have access to on-time performance for specific flights, thanks to the advent of computerised reservation systems. A travel agent should also provide information on the type of aircraft being flown. This is essential for those who would rather walk barefoot across the country than get on a turbo prop plane. Many of the smaller cities and towns in the US and Canada are connected to larger cities by regional airlines. The planes used by these smaller carriers are most accurately described by their former name - 'scheduled air taxis'. Since most regional airlines now share computer codes with the major airlines, a computer might not recognise the difference between American Airlines, which has a fleet of jets, and American Eagle, which uses turbo props. Travellers who plan to work on portable computers during a flight should note that many airlines now ban laptops, as well as compact-disc players and cellular telephones during take-off and landing. Some, responding to concerns about possible interference with navigation equipment, have banned the use of electronic devices altogether on flights. There are no such restrictions on trains. Yet, regardless of the 'spirit of the country' and the revival of train service in the US, until a train is invented that can cover about 3,000 miles in under six hours, most business people will continue to do most of their travelling in North America on a plane.</p>

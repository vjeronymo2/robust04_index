			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec fails to cut output ceiling as prices slide The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last night brushed aside demands that it cut its production level to boost prices. Its failure to do so is likely to lead to greater short-term volatility in international oil markets. Opec officials conceded that the strategy of sticking to its present output ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day could lead to further price falls when markets open today. The communique issued after the meeting said, however, that the agreement reached in Geneva in September was 'reasonable and objective' and should be given 'the necessary time to achieve its goals'. It also called for restraint and strict adherence to the accord. The communique said that 'all producers should join in the effort' to balance supply and demand. Brent Blend, the benchmark crude, closed at Dollars 15.33 per barrel for January delivery compared with Dollars 15.59 on Tuesday and Dollars 15.88 on Monday prior to the conference. Traders took a gloomy view of the outcome of the meeting before it ended last night. Mr Subroto, Opec's secretary-general, told a news conference at the end of the talks that ministers concluded that a small output cut would not be effective and a large cut would have been hard to achieve. He expected prices to decline initially but then recover. There was no immediate comment from Saudi Arabia on the meeting's outcome. Mr Ali Ahmed al Baghli, Kuwait's minister of oil, said he was happy with the accord. The Opec decision followed several weeks of mounting pressure on the organisation as prices steadily weakened because of low demand in the main oil consuming countries, especially in Europe and Japan. The perception among refiners and traders that supplies are plentiful also helped to push prices lower. Several Opec members, including Iran, had called for a cut as the price of the Opec basket of six crude oils fell. An Opec delegate said moves to organise support for a 2 per cent cut in production failed because it was considered too small to have an impact on the price. He said there were also doubts that all members would abide by a cut. As for a larger reduction which some analysts said was necessary to prop up prices, the delegate said: 'No one was in favour of a 1m barrel a day cut,' although he conceded that a cut of such magnitude would have had a positive influence on prices. The ministers also castigated non-Opec producers, including the UK and Norway, for boosting output.</p>

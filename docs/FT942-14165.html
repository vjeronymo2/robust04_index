			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Compaq earnings leap 108% Compaq Computer's first quarter earnings surpassed all analysts' expectations, with a jump in gross profit margins and strong sales growth worldwide. Net income for the quarter reached a record Dollars 213m (Pounds 144m), an increase of 108 per cent from Dollars 102m in last year's first quarter. Earnings per share advanced to Dollars 2.39 from Dollars 1.23, up 94 per cent. Sales jumped 41 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn, from Dollars 1.6bn last year. Analysts said Compaq appeared to be winning market share from all of its competitors, including International Business Machines. North American revenues surged 52 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 1.2bn. European sales were up 26 per cent at Dollars 829m, while sales in other regions grew by 68 per cent to Dollars 239m. The earnings performance was well above analyst's projections of about Dollars 1.68 per share. Compaq's shares closed at Dollars 101 7/8 in New York, up Dollars 3 1/8 . Gross margins jumped by four percentage points to 27.1 per cent of revenues. The increase reflected strong sales of Compaq's higher-margin network servers, said Mr Andreas Barth, senior vice-president in charge of European operations. Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and chief executive officer, has set a goal for Compaq to overtake IBM and Apple Computer to become the world's largest PC manufacturer by 1996. 'With such tremendous momentum we have a really good chance of achieving that goal,' said Mr Barth. 'In Europe we are already in second place, behind IBM and we expect to achieve first place within the next two years.' Compaq's biggest challenge is meeting demand. During the quarter, demand outstripped supply in several product categories, the company said. The company recently announced plans to expand manufacturing and distribution operations in the US, Scotland and Singapore. It also announced it would open its first Latin American manufacturing facility in Brazil, and expected to begin production at a plant in Shenzhen, China, by the end of the second quarter. To finance growth, Compaq recently raised Dollars 300m with a debt offering.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Inflation pressures tamed, says CBI Few signs of overheating or inflationary pressures in the UK economy appear in the latest quarterly trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry. The proportion of companies working below capacity rose slightly to 59 per cent this month from 57 per cent in January, while 92 per cent had sufficient capacity to meet expected demand. 'The outlook for inflation remains positive, with no sign of cost and price pressures emerging,' said Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee. The same number of companies reported that unit costs had fallen during the past four months as reported an increase, and only a balance of 2 percentage points expected a rise in costs over the next four months. A balance of 1 percentage point said domestic prices had fallen over the past four months, and there was the same balance for companies expecting prices to fall further over the next four months. The CBI calculates most of its figures by subtracting the percentage of companies expecting a decline in a variable from those reporting an increase, and by then expressing the result as a balance. The CBI also found that companies had been cutting their export prices. This runs counter to official figures which appear to have shown that exporters have been increasing prices. Mr Sudhir Junankar, associate director of economic affairs, said the CBI was comfortable with its figures, which had been prepared on a consistent basis - unlike the official trade figures which recently introduced the Intra-stat system. Figures for output and orders were positive, with the balance of 16 percentage points reporting higher total orders during the past four months being the best figure since January 1989. 'As yet, there is no sign of manufacturing output faltering in the face of the tax increases introduced at the start of this month,' the CBI said. However, growth in output and orders was at a slightly lower rate than had been expected when the sur-vey was last conducted in January. British companies are making significant progress towards world-class status, says a report out today, Graham Bowley writes. Researchers from the London Business School interviewed 21 manufacturing companies including Shell UK, Rover Group and Courtaulds to find out if, and how, British-based companies are striving to become world-class. They found that all the companies they visited had achieved substantial improvements over the past five years across a range of performance indicators such as productivity and customer service.

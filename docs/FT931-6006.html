			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: SAS sees little likelihood of merger DISCUSSIONS between KLM, Swissair and Austrian Airlines are not expected to result in a merger, Mr Harald Norvik, SAS chairman, expects. Speaking at an industry forum in Bergen, Norway, he stressed that the airlines were looking to co-operate more closely rather than combine. There had been speculation that the four airlines might eventually merge following last Friday's announcement that they were launching detailed talks on the feasibility of setting up a 'global airline system'. Mr Norvik said: 'The talks are aiming to establish if the conditions exist for discussions on closer co-operation, and I don't think that a collaboration would lead to a merger. The issue is what degree of co-operation and co-ordination would be appropriate.' He said SAS was not holding talks with any other airlines. SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines already co-operate through a loose grouping known as the European Quality Alliance, which involves joint marketing activities and co-ordination of timetables. It first became clear that KLM was interested in partnership talks with the EQA airlines in late January. Last Friday, the four groups said they were setting up joint working groups to explore opportunities more closely.</p>

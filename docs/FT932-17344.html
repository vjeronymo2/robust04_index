			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Observer: Oversubscribed When 19,000 BT employees cleared their desks for the last time one day last July, the main union representing them described the redundancy package it had negotiated as 'one of the best in the UK'. Indeed, the deal was so attractive that the union, the National Communications Union, has now decided to offer it to its own employees. But even BT was unable to offer the proportion of redundancies being made by the union; up to one-third of the NCU's 160 staff are likely to be leaving. With the loss of 30,000 members last year and the prospect of another 30,000 over the next two years, the union says it would have been heading for an annual Pounds 2m loss without the staff cuts. BT's redundancy programme led to the coining of 'compulsory retention' as part of the industrial relations lexicography. When BT discovered that the deal was 50 per cent oversubscribed many employees were disappointed to discover that they had to stay. With low morale and high pay-offs, the NCU could find itself in the same position.</p>

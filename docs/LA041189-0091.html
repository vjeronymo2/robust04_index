			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Looking for Prospects: Beatrice Co. said it is looking for acquisitions in a  policy switch following three years of rapid-fire divestitures. Beatrice was  taken private in a 1986 leveraged buyout led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;  Co. Beatrice has sold several of its holdings, including the Avis car rental  firm, the Tropicana juice business and underwear-maker Playtex. Proceeds were  used to pay down debt. The company's remaining businesses are almost all  food-related, and Chief Executive Fred Rentschler said he's looking for  businesses compatible with operations such as Beatrice's Swift-Eckrich meat  division or its Hunt-Wesson food operations.  </P></p>

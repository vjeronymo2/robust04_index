At the end of the talks with Andrey Kozyrev,  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic stated that his forces will  end the blockade of the airport at the besieged city of Tuzla  and its starving population will now be able to receive  humanitarian aid.    The West tried long and unsuccessfully to get the Serbs to  take this step. Karadzic remained firm: The Serbs were afraid  that the Muslims would use the airport for arms shipments. The  Serbian weapons deployed in the immediate vicinity of the runway  could have destroyed any aircraft approaching Tuzla. Since May  1992 the airport has been virtually inoperative. The  humanitarian aid convoys have had to be sent overland -- along  very difficult roads. The several hundred thousand inhabitants  of the Muslim enclave (including 25,000 Serbs) were in a  desperate position. In the West there were increasingly  frequent calls to end the blockade of the airport by military  means. France officially put forward such a proposal.    As in the case of Sarajevo it was Moscow which undertook the  mediation mission. "Tuzla was one of the most sensitive  problems on Bosnian territory," Vitaliy Churkin, Russian deputy  foreign minister, told IZVESTIYA. "We talked with the Serbs for  a long time about opening the airport so that the accord which  was reached in Moscow was no surprise." The crucial argument  which convinced the Serbs to make concessions was Russia's  readiness to send its observers to Tuzla where they could  monitor the freight arriving at the airport. "We trust the  impartiality of the Russians. Their presence is the guarantee  that the Muslims will not receive weapons instead of food,"  Karadzic stated.    The date of the start of the operation has not been  announced  yet. In Churkin's words, 50 Russian observers are ready to fly  to Bosnia in the immediate future. Moscow has promised that the  first plane carrying humanitarian aid to land at Tuzla airport  after the lifting of the blockade will be Russian.    There are two reasons for the Serbs' compliance. First, the  persistence of Churkin and Kozyrev. The head of Russian  diplomacy has acknowledged that the talks with Karadzic, lasting  over two hours, were difficult. Once again Moscow had to use  all its influence on the Serbs to persuade them to accept a  compromise. The second reason is the firmness shown by NATO in  the skies over Bosnia on Monday: Four planes violated the UN  no-fly ban and were shot down by U.S. fighters. The Serbs  realized that the West was prepared for firm action and that  this time its threats were not empty talk. Moscow, in turn,  made it clear that it would not enter into confrontation with  NATO for the Serbs' sake. The Russian reaction to the incident  in the air was indicative in this respect. The Foreign Ministry  supported the West and pinned all the blame on the violators of  the "no-fly zone," although there was hardly any doubt that the  downed planes were Serbian.    By all accounts, Karadzic realized that in the present  situation stubbornness will cost dear and concessions are  inevitable. Russia's proposal to send its observers to Tuzla  enabled Karadzic to save face and at the same time rebuff the  supporters of the hard line in parliament and the army, who have  been accusing him of being too soft.    Karadzic supported Boris Yeltsin's proposal for a summit  meeting on Bosnia to be held in Moscow. He let it be known that  the Serbs could make new compromises. The joint communique  adopted on the results of the talks reflected that idea although  it was worded very vaguely: "The Bosnian Serbs will show the  maximum constructiveness taking into account among other things  the qualitative criteria of the territorial demarcation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina."    In the opinion of Russian diplomats, Karadzic is prepared to  abide by the promise to withdraw the artillery 20 km from  besieged Sarajevo as NATO is demanding. Admittedly, there have  been reports lately that the Serbs are not fulfilling their  obligations and that from time to time their tanks have been  violating the "prohibited zone." In Moscow, however, they are  convinced that such incidents are happening against the will of  the Bosnian Serb leadership, which is not in full control of its  armed formations.</p>

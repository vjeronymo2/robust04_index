			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): There are changes in the line-up ... DURING THE past quarter, Mercury Asset Management have decided that, since their portfolio is now settled, with few reasons for major change, they can no longer contribute valuably to the Professionals' review. We have opted not to replace them, because this would make comparison invidious. Also, David Poole has been headhunted by another leading London merchant bank, and Tim Howe, director of Singer &amp; Friedlander, has agreed to contribute in his place. Since Mr Howe has been closely involved over the past year in managing Singer &amp; Friedlander's 'portfolio', continuity has been assured. . . . but the rules remain the same THIS FEATURE is not a competition, but an allocation exercise, the purpose of which is to see how four professional fund managers manage a Pounds 250,000 portfolio on behalf of a hypothetical client of their choice. In each case, the client is assumed to be either a wealthy individual or a small self-administered pension fund. All the fund managers emphasise that they are investing for the long term (10 years or more) rather than for short-term gain. The exercise started at the beginning of October 1990. The portfolios given here were drawn up as at the beginning of this month, and will be reviewed at the end of June.</p>

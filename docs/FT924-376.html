			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: School fees and IHT OUR SON is unable to meet the heavy cost of private schooling for his young son. We have agreed to do so. Should we pay the school direct or make the payments to our son (in which case inheritance tax rules may apply)? There are certain provisions which enable a person to make a disposition in favour of a child, but the exemption arises only if that person is not in the care of a parent in accordance with section 11 IHTA 1984. Therefore, we do not believe this exemption would apply. Whether you make the payment to the child or directly to the school does not appear to matter, as it would still be regarded as a transfer value because your estate would be diminished by virtue of the disposition. Therefore, we would expect the payment to be subject to inheritance tax. You each have an annual exemption of Pounds 3,000 but, in addition to this, Section 21 IHTA 1984 provides an exemption for normal spending out of income. If it can be shown that the payment was made as part of your normal spending; and that it was made out of income; and that, after allowing for the transfer value, you were left with sufficient income to maintain your normal standard of living, then this exemption might apply. If your income after tax and normal spending is greater than the payment for the private schooling, then this exemption might apply, especially if it has an income nature in that it is a regular recurring item.

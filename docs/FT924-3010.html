			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Panic allowed to challenge Milosevic THE Serbian Supreme Court ruled yesterday that Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Panic can challenge Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in elections on December 20. The court said its decision was final, meaning Mr Panic will be registered as a candidate. It overturned a ruling by the Serbian electoral commission disqualifying the prime minister on the grounds that he did not meet the one-year residence requirement. Mr Panic immediately challenged Mr Milosevic to a TV debate. In the grip of Mr Milosevic, Serbian TV has been waging a campaign against the Belgrade-born US millionaire. Mr Panic has won popularity among Serbs for his pledge to end the war in Bosnia and to persuade the United Nations to lift sanctions. He holds a narrow lead over Mr Milosevic, according to opinion polls. Mr Milosevic, widely seen as chief instigator of the war in Bosnia, said at a campaign appearance: 'We will continue our policies. We cannot give up our interests and rights and we'll protect them.' In Sarajevo yesterday there was sporadic shelling but the strategic airport road re-opened after intense fighting on Tuesday. Ten trucks carrying 150 tonnes of relief supplies for the 380,000 people trapped in the capital arrived from Vitez. In Geneva, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic accused Bosnian government forces of provoking fighting to put pressure on the UN for military intervention. The UN Security Council declared yesterday it would consider stronger measures against Bosnian Serbs 'as soon as possible' to ensure relief supplies continued to reach Sarajevo. Diplomats said no course of action had been determined, but measures could include establishing safe havens for Bosnian Moslems or using air power to protect relief convoys. Nato allies today will discuss contingency plans for the former Yugoslavia, ranging from more peacekeeping troops to using air strikes against Serb targets.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Foreign Affairs: Europe's security surplus - Instead of setting up rival structures, Nato should become the 'secular arm' of CSCE The challenges we face in this new Europe cannot be comprehensively add-ressed by one institution alone, but only in a framework of interlocking institutions tying together the countries of Europe and North America.' Thus spake the heads of state and government of Nato at their meeting in Rome last November. And of course they were right. The new order in Europe was never expected to be orderly, and the 'new security architecture', lacking a single architect, was bound to be a ramshackle affair. The phrase 'interlocking institutions' has caught on, but 'institutional overcrowding' might be a more apt description of what is happening. Broadly speaking, all the institutions are trying to move in the same direction - that is, they aspire to absorb and integrate the ravaged economies and warring nationalities of central and eastern Europe into the relatively prosperous and peace-loving North Atlantic world. Their plurality could even be seen as a fine example of the pluralism they all preach. Even if they all map out different routes to the common destination, that could be a good thing - so long as their 'interlocking' does not take the form of gridlock. Things are not that bad yet, but the routes are beginning to criss-cross in a rather alarming way. Or, to change the metaphor, the alphabet soup is getting a little too thick to be digestible; and Nato is guilty of thickening it gratuitously. That is ironic, because Nato's strongest argument throughout this bewildering process has been that we should hold on to and make use of existing institutions, rather than invent airy-fairy new ones which would only spawn new bureaucracies. Yet Nato itself has spawned an unnecessary and possibly mischievous institution: the North Atlantic Co-operation Council (NACC). You can tell there is something wrong with this animal by the very fact that it has to be pronounced nack-see, to distinguish it from NAC, the North Atlantic Council, which is Nato's governing body. (One of the most common symptoms of institutional overcrowding is what we doctors call 'acronymic overload'.) But a more serious objection is that it duplicates the membership of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), while taking over what should be that body's functions. NACC was formed at the end of last year as a forum for co-operation between Nato and its erstwhile adversaries, the former members of the former Warsaw Pact. In large part it was intended to console them for Nato's unwillingness to admit them as members or give them security guarantees. It thus comes into the category of confidence and security building measures, which has always been the concern of CSCE. Its most useful role at present is to discuss the implementation by the republics of the former Soviet Union of arms control agreements signed by Moscow - especially the treaty on conventional forces in Europe. But that treaty, although negotiated between the members of the two alliances, was formally part of the CSCE process, and its adjustment to the new realities could have been done within a CSCE framework. It is true that the new democracies, which were very keen on CSCE two years ago when it seemed to offer the best hope of escaping from the old blocs and forging new ties with the west, have lately shown more interest in Nato, as being something firmer and more tangible. But what is firm and tangible about Nato is its character as a mutual defence pact and military alliance, with integrated force structures and a firm commitment of 'all for one and one for all'. And it is precisely those aspects of Nato that are being withheld, for the time being anyway, from central and eastern Europe. If central and east European countries are disillusioned with CSCE it is because Nato countries have been very cautious about investing it with any real security functions, or with the staff and resources to carry them out. CSCE could have been given a boost, had it been made the forum for the kinds of security co-operation now to be carried on in NACC. The parallelism between the two bodies has been underlined by the way they have both reacted to the break-up of the Soviet Union. Both have been ready, without any real debate, to welcome all the ex-Soviet republics including those of central Asia which, by definition, are outside Europe and, for that matter, a very long way from the North Atlantic. This makes it all the more obvious that the main difference between the two organisations is that NACC, while including all Nato's former adversaries, excludes Europe's 'neutral and non-aligned' states. It is as though Nato believed that Moldova and Tajikistan, which are members of NACC had somehow become more deserving, more reliable, or more important to north Atlantic security than Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Austria and Switzerland: a manifestly absurd proposition. Institutions once created are hard to get rid of. NACC is probably with us now until such time as all its members are admitted to Nato proper. But people do seem to be realising already that Nato's true vocation in the post cold war world is to become the military muscle of CSCE. Nato's secretary-general, Mr Manfred Worner, suggested recently that the alliance could make its military expertise, and even troops, available for missions ordered by CSCE. Within the last ten days that idea has been taken up by such diverse authorities as the German Social Democrats, the Dutch foreign minister and, most interestingly, the chief US delegate to the CSCE review conference, to be held in Helsinki later this month. CSCE has no troops of its own, but it is developing a political and diplomatic role, in response to an evident demand. Two weeks ago it sent a mission to Armenia and Azerbaijan, led by the charismatic Count Karl Schwarzenberg, who is chief of staff to President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia. (He apparently worked wonders in persuading nervous Russian helicopter pilots to fly the mission into Nagorno-Karabakh in the midst of the fighting.) Last Friday, after hearing the mission's report, the CSCE, meeting in Prague at the level of senior civil servants, put forward a plan for a ceasefire, humanitarian aid, renewal of the Russo-Kazakh mediation effort and the deployment of ceasefire observers drawn from CSCE countries, if the warring communities can agree to accept this. Such observers would need military experience, and Nato would be well placed to supply them. It could also supply a peacekeeping force if that proves to be necessary - the UN's capacities in this department being already stretched to breaking point. It is ironic to think that a Nato force would now almost certainly be more acceptable politically than a Russian one, on what was a few months ago Soviet territory, and that the Russians themselves would be delighted to see it go there. Of course, even if Nato supplies the expertise and logistics, there is no need for a CSCE peacekeeping force to be drawn exclusively from Nato members. If Germany, for instance, had constitutional inhibitions about sending its own troops, perhaps it could pay 'scutage' in lieu and the money could be used to finance, say, a Polish or even a Serb or Croat contingent. Experience of other people's wars might help the armed forces of some east European countries to see their own problems in better perspective; and they could certainly do with the hard currency.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: TVX, Kinross withdraw CDollars 2.3bn Lac Minerals bid TVX Gold, an aggressive Toronto-based international gold producer, has withdrawn a CDollars 2.3bn (Dollars 1.6bn) joint bid with Kinross Gold, another medium-sized Canadian producer, for Lac Minerals. TVX and Kinross revealed their friendly share exchange proposal on August 1. It was rejected by Lac, as were bids from Royal Oak Mines and American Barrick Resources. Lac said it wanted to remain independent. TVX and Kinross wanted to split Lac's assets, with TVX taking the Chilean properties and Kinross the Canadian properties. TVX said yesterday it was not in its shareholders' interest to pursue the merger. Royal Oak's revised CDollars 2.4bn bid is due to expire tonight and American Barrick's CDollars 2.1bn offer expires on Friday. The Ontario Securities Commission decided on Friday that Lac must dissolve its poison pill shareholder protection plan if either bid is accepted by 66 per cent of its shareholders.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Vienna, May 18 (AFP) -- UN nuclear inspectors  who traveled to North Korea to determine if spent reactor fuel  was diverted for bomb-making have begun their work, the  International Atomic Energy Agency said Wednesday [18 May].    A spokesman for the UN agency said the three inspectors had  got down to their week-long assignment but he refused to provide  details.    North Korea said over the weekend that it had already begun  replacing spent fuel rods from a reactor at Yongbyon, 90  kilometers (54 miles) north of Pyongyang.    The inspectors are pressing to check the rods to see if  fissile material has been diverted to make a nuclear weapon.    North Korea denies having a nuclear weapons program.  [passage  omitted]    The IAEA says the operation could take a few months.</p>

It would also update an existing incorporation by reference to refer to the 1993 edition of AAMI's voluntary guidelines on ``Recommended Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers''. These standards and guidelines contain recognized benchmarks for high quality dialysis procedures. Section 1881(b)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act authorizes the Secretary to limit Medicare payment for ESRD services to facilities meeting the requirements prescribed in regulations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments will be considered if we receive them at the appropriate address, as provided below, no later than 5 p.m. on April 15, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mail an original and three copies of written comments to the following address: Health Care Financing Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, Attention: BPD&hyph;766&hyph;P, P.O.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1881 of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorizes Medicare coverage and payment for the treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in approved facilities that provide dialysis and transplantation services to ESRD patients. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) grants approval of ESRD facilities after a State survey agency determines that the facility is in compliance with conditions for coverage of suppliers of ESRD services in 42 CFR part 405, subpart U. Since their initial publication on June 3, 1976 (41 FR 22502), the conditions for coverage have undergone several revisions as a result of legislation, as well as operating experience, to reflect evolving medical standards and techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations contain conditions and standards prescribing the services that must be provided and the qualifications of staff who provide those services. The decision as to whether a facility complies with a particular condition for coverage depends on the manner and degree to which the supplier satisfies the various standards within each condition. A supplier is not in compliance if, after completion of a survey, a State survey agency determines that the supplier fails to comply with one or more of the standards within the conditions for coverage, and the deficiencies are of such character as to limit substantially the supplier's capacity to furnish adequate care or to affect adversely the health and safety of patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Quality of Water Used in Dialysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Our current regulation governing the quality of water used in dialysis at &sect;405.2140(a)(5) requires that water used for dialysis must be analyzed periodically and treated as necessary to maintain a continuous supply that is biologically and chemically compatible with acceptable dialysis techniques. Records of test results and equipment maintenance are maintained at the facility. This standard was developed in 1976 and has never been modified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

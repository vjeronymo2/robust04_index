			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Strong dollar hits Gillette sales ECONOMIC weakness in Europe and the strength of the US dollar were blamed by Gillette, the consumer products group, for holding back sales outside the US in the second quarter. Sales grew by 3 per cent, to Dollars 1.24bn, during the period. Net income rose to Dollars 134.7m, or 61 cents a share, from Dollars 120.5m, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier, in line with analysts' expectations. In spite of the dollar's strength, Mr Alfred Zeien, chairman and chief executive, said that blade and razor products had achieved strong gains worldwide. Though no figures were released, the company said that sales of these products had been 'considerably higher' and profits had showed 'strong gains'. By contrast, profits fell 'significantly' in the toiletries and cosmetics areas, due to spending in support of the launch of the Gillette Series range of male toiletries. There was also said to have been a significant decline in profits on stationery products, excluding figures for Parker Pen, whose figures will be included only from the next quarter. First-half net income, meanwhile, rose from Dollars 249.9m or Dollars 1.13 a share to Dollars 277m or Dollars 1.25. The latest figure, however, was struck before the deduction of Dollars 138.6m, equivalent to 63 cents a share, for an accounting adjustment, which lowered net income to Dollars 138.4m, or 62 cents, for the six months. First-half sales amounted to Dollars 2.45bn, compared with Dollars 2.41bn last year.</p>

Continuous Incidents (Part Three of Four)  -- The Xu Haining Incident    A number of incidents between China and Britain also  occurred  at the time, one being the Xu Haining [1776 3189 1337] incident,  and another the Yang Yang [2799 3152] affair.    As stated above, Xu Haining played a frequent role in Hong  Kong's public activities during the 4 June period, holding up a  banner with the words "NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY Branch" at the  million-person demonstration rally on 21 April 1989, as well as  giving a speech in his capacity as an employee of a NEW CHINA  NEWS AGENCY [NCNA] branch at a race track mass rally, which was  reported widely in the media, making him for a time the man of  the hour in Hong Kong. After these incidents occurred, while I  kept Zheng Hua [6774 5478] [deputy director of the Hong Kong  Office of the NCNA] from investigating them, Xu Haining was very  nervous about them, so left the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA and  went into hiding. As we were concerned that he might flee  abroad, we sent someone to find him. The one who found him  reported that he was staying at a friend's home, being somewhat  panic-stricken and distraught. While our messenger told him  that he would have no problems if he returned to the NCNA, he  did not believe this and was not ready to return. But before  long, he returned on his own, after which not only did we not  reproach him, but, in an attempt to calm him down, I even sent  the leader of the concerned department to console him.    But after a few days, he again ran away on the sly. We very  quickly heard that he had been taken to London by the British  Hong Kong government. We immediately reported this to Beijing,  which immediately told us to negotiate with the British Hong  Kong government for Xu Haining's return. But as the British  Hong Kong government claimed to have no knowledge of him, the  matter was "suspended" (shelved).    At the time, a concerned NCNA branch department discovered  that many employees of Chinese agencies were lined up at certain  foreign consulates to apply for emigration. And certain other  employees of Chinese agencies were saying privately that they  would not be transferred back to China and, if they were, they  certainly would not go, being ready when necessary to go abroad.  As we were already somewhat prepared psychologically for this,  having guessed that Hong Kong's Chinese agencies might lose some  people, we did not treat the the Xu Haining matter as a crucial  one, so that we took it up with the British Hong Kong government  only to make them think twice.    Before long, the Chinese Embassy in London telegraphed the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Hong Kong and Macao Working  Committee that Xu Haining had fled on his own to the Chinese  Embassy in Britain, and was asking to be returned home. Xu  Haining claimed that it was the British Hong government that had  sent someone to escort him to London, after which he was settled  by a refugee agency, which gave him 70 pounds sterling a day.  While there was also someone to accompany him on a tour of  London for the first few days, no one paid him any attention  later, leaving him feeling helpless, so that he fled to the  embassy to ask to be returned home. So the embassy telegraphed  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Hong Kong and Macao  Working Committee for instructions on how to handle the matter.    After exchanging views with the State Council Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we  telegraphed our embassy in London that we wanted Xu Haining  returned to China. But the embassy then telegraphed us that Xu  Haining had fled again, and could not be found. It turned out  that the British had learned of Xu Haining's contacts with the  Chinese Embassy, so had moved him elsewhere.    A few days later, Xu Haining again ran to our embassy, which  retained him this time, negotiating with the British Government  for his return home, and buying him a plane ticket. But the  British Government asked to send someone to talk with Xu  Haining, which request was refused by the Chinese Embassy, which  agreed only to allow the British to send someone to question him  at the airport in the company of [Chinese] Embassy personnel.  It was learned that the British asked Xu Haining only if  returning home was his own wish, to which he replied that it  was. Which was how he left Britain and was returned to China.    Beijing's view was that the Hong Kong and Macao Working  Committee should handle the matter. So we decided to let him  return first to Guangzhou to recuperate at our Guangzhou #8  Office Guest House, where we assigned someone to give him some  work to do to calm him down. But as the Hong Kong media was  looking for him everywhere, and Xu Haining was from Hangzhou, we  contacted the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, sent him to  Hangzhou, and asked Zhejiang Province to arrange for a place to  let him recuperate. We considered Xu Haining in his state no  longer suitable for return to work in Hong Kong, so asked the  Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee to let him stay in Zhejiang  and to find other work for him.</p>

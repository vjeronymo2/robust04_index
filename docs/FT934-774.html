			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Menem bid overcomes obstacle President Carlos Menem's re-election bid overcame a big obstacle yesterday when the lower house of Argentina's Congress narrowly approved a package he had negotiated with Mr Raul Alfonsn, former president and leader of the opposition Radical party, John Barham writes.

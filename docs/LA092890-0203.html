			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: RIVERS' SHOW MAY HAVE PROMPTED TAYLOR'S LIBEL SUIT  </P> <P> THE NATIONAL Enquirer may have the "Joan Rivers Show" and their own former  gossip columnist R. Couri Hay to thank for that $20-million lawsuit Elizabeth  Taylor has slapped against the beleaguered tabloid weekly.  </P> <P> A few months ago, Hay was a guest on Rivers' TV talkfest. When the chat got  around to Taylor, still hospitalized and dreadfully ill with pneumonia, Couri  began telling Joan and her live audience how Taylor was drinking and hiding  liquor bottles under her bed.  </P> <P> It was verbatim from the National Enquirer, although he did not mention the  tabloid by name.  </P> <P> Taylor's public relations people were appalled that anyone would sit and say  such things on TV as if they were actual facts, and it is believed that they  then went back and took another good hard look at the Enquirer story itself.  (Heretofore, Elizabeth had always shrugged off the tabloid's stories about  her.)  </P> <P> During Couri's recital, to make matters worse, Joan Rivers laughed and made a  few wisecracks, joking that Taylor would leave the hospital "thin, but drunk."  This added fuel to the Taylor reaction.  </P> <P> Television -- still more powerful than it knows!  </P> <P> ACTING IS one way to get to the top, but it is a cruel and ugly business for  the most part and even "arriving" at the top is no guarantee that one won't be  savaged and torn to shreds by the critics.  </P> <P> Frank Rich of the New York Times recently reviewed the new lead in the Broadway  musical hit "Gypsy." He gave Linda Lavin one of the worst write-ups in theater  history and left the Rialto gasping for breath as usual.  </P> <P> Then, last Sunday, just to compound matters, the newspaper offered up another  opinion by David Richards in which a headline went out of its way to smash  Lavin like a fly on a windshield. The paper said: "In the Role Linda Lavin  Comes Up Short." Lavin recently replaced Tyne Daly in the role.  </P> <P> So much for the idol of millions from the TV series "Alice" and for the  hard-working and gifted Lavin, who won an Antoinette Perry Award for her  performance as the mother in Neil Simon's play "Broadway Bound."  </P> <P> But here is the capper to this terrible rush of events.  </P> <P> Playwright Simon is out in Hollywood getting ready to turn his "Broadway Bound"  dramatic comedy into a movie. So guess who Simon wants for the role in which  Linda Lavin won the Tony?  </P> <P> Neil Simon now wants Tyne Daly to play it.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICARAGUA AND EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> Bravo for your editorial on the "new" Contra package, flawed with the old  policy of Contra aid to keep an army together!  </P> <P> Five Central American presidents have called for all aid to rebel groups to  stop, and repatriation of the Contras before any elections in Nicaragua.  Secretary of State James Baker's statements that they approve of his  "bipartisan" package are erroneous.  </P> <P> The Democrats now have the opportunity to take the lead in setting a policy  towards Nicaragua that a majority of American voters have wanted for years: 1)  no more Contra aid (they can be disbanded with the money already accumulated  from the last aid). 2) Negotiate directly with Nicaragua about treatment of the  Contras. 3) Lift the trade embargo, so that the U.S. could be Nicaragua's main  trade partner instead of the Soviets.  </P> <P> When the Bush Administration calls for more than $4 million per month out of  our tax pockets to coddle the marauding Contras, it's time for the Democrats to  resist the "bipartisanship" siren.  </P> <P> BARBARA MOREL  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman--Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali said  Tuesday [3 May] no Jordan-bound ship was intercepted by the  enforcers of the sanctions against Iraq after the April 25  meeting between His Majesty King Husayn and U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher in London.    During that meeting, Mr. Christopher announced that subject  to "some fine-tuning" Washington was accepting Jordan's proposal  to replace the sea-based inspections by American-led warships  with an on-shore sanctions verifications regime.    Dr. al-Majali, in a meeting with Egyptian reporters ahead of  Thursday's meeting here of the Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher  Committee, said that despite the acceptance announced by Mr.  Christopher no further steps had been taken to place the  sanctions-verifications regime at al-'Aqabah.    The fact that no ship was intercepted after the London  meeting does not automatically mean that the inspectors have  called off the maritime interceptions, Dr. al-Majali said.    At the same time, Dr. al-Majali reaffirmed Jordan's position  that it would not allow any "inspection" of cargo at al-'Aqabah.  Lloyds Register, the international neutral agency nominated to  take over the sanctions-verification regime, was free to  "observe" incoming and outgoing cargo at al-'Aqabah when  Jordanian customs inspectors open them as required by the  Kingdom's laws and regulations, he said.    The agency, he said, could report to the U.N. Sanctions  Committee on its observations. Beyond that, Dr. al-Majali  added, Jordan would not accept any arrangement that would  infringe upon its sovereignty.    In his comments to the Egyptian journalists, Dr. al-Majali  welcomed the resumption of meetings of the joint  Jordanian-Egyptian committee and expressed hope that the meeting  would lay the cornerstone for restoring Arab cooperation and  coordination.    He said that the committee will also discuss means to  bolster  political relations.    The prime minister underlined the need for ending inter-Arab  differences and "to open a new chapter, particularly at this  criticial stage..."    Dr. al-Majali said it was essential that the Arabs assume an  effective role in any regional order.    He said features of the "new world order" were not yet clear  enough, nor are those of the regional Arab order.    "The only clear thing is that the United States is  dominating  the world under the new order," he added.    Dr. al-Majali said "There is no room under the new order for  spectators" and emphasised the need for effective Arab input in  shaping this order.    Dr. al-Majali said Jordan's participation in the  multilateral  peace talks has been reduced to an observer status to protest  the continued blockade of al-'Aqabah port. He noted that  multilateral talks are meant to address economic and social  problems.    On the Palestinian-Israeli accord, Dr. al-Majali said what  was taking place between the Palestinian and Israelis was an  affair concerning the two parties.    "We shall accept what the Palestine Liberation Organisation  (PLO), the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian  people, accepts," he said. "However, we do not want the result  of any accord to negatively affect us."    He added that Jordan had hoped for greater  Jordanian-Palestinian coordination, given the unique brotherly,  historical relations between the two peoples.</p>

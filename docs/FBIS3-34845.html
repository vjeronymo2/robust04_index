			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Damascus, 15 Feb (SANA)--The Palestinian National  Salvation Front [PNSF] has warned against the seriousness of the  Cairo agreement signed by Israel and the PLO. It pointed out  that this agreement has clearly disclosed the extent of the  concessions 'Arafat made in the Oslo agreement.    In a statement issued today, the PNSF said the articles and  terms of reference of the Cairo agreement violate national and  pan-Arab principles. This agreement is a coordinative approach  with the enemy and an attempt to end our people's intifadah,  tamper with their security, and liquidate their cause and  rights, which will threaten our people's existence and national  destiny.    In another development, brother Abu-Musa [Sa'id Musa  Muragha], secretary of the Fatah Central Committee, said the  Fatah Movement rejects the Cairo agreement which bestows full  legitimacy on Israel's occupation of the Gaza Strip and Jericho  and entrenches the Zionist settlements.    In a press statement today, Abu-Musa added: We see in this  agreement an additional step in a plan hostile to our people and  nation. This step is intended to generalize the phenomenon of  the Oslo agreement in the region and penetrate deeper into Arab  ranks by peddling partial and separate agreements, he noted.</p>

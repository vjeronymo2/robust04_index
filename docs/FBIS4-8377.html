			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- This morning, Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic received Yasushi Akashi, head of  the UN mission in former Yugoslavia, and colleagues.    During the talks, which covered the latest developments in  former Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Milosevic said that by  bombing Serb positions, the United Nations has abandoned the  principles of impartiality vis-a-vis the warring sides in the  civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and openly sided with the  Muslims. This has seriously brought into question the trust  required for the realization of its role as mediator in the  negotiating process in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Serbian president pointed to the fact that the offensive  by the Muslim forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been going on for  a long time now, and that Gorazde's position as a so-called safe  zone, in full view of UN representatives, has been abused by the  Muslim forces, allowing them to concentrate on their offensive  against the Serbs.    The United Nations has neither prevented, nor hindered these  attempts but, on the contrary, has supported them in terms of  direct military involvement, something the Serb nation and the  Serb Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina condemns energetically. In  the view of President Milosevic, this behavior is not in the  interest of peace but prolongs the war and intensifies  instability in this region.    In President Milosevic's opinion, the only real way out of  the current situation is to achieve a general agreement on the  cessation of all hostilities.    A peace agreement should be reached as soon as possible  without prejudging the political solution, President Milosevic  stressed, pointing out his belief that the Serb side will accept  new negotiations without preconditions after a cessation of all  hostilities is in place. However, this can be done only on an  equal footing. This means that the sanctions should be lifted.  If the international community sincerely wants peace then it  should respect the principle of equality. Sanctions imposed  against Serbia and the Serb nation represent a constant impetus  for the Bosnian authorities to continue the war. That is why  lifting the embargo is the simplest way to make the Bosnian  authorities abandon their war policy.    Yasushi Akashi agreed with the assessment that an agreement  on a general cessation of hostilities is better than a partial  one because it ensures the best conditions for the resumption  and successful conduct of political negotiations based on the  principle of the equality of all three sides.    Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also attended  the talks, the statement issued by the Serbian president's  office says in conclusion.</p>

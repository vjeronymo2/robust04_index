			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Business and the Environment: Rapeseed fuels the energy debate - A diesel mixture is being used to power vehicles More than 300 diesel vehicles are being driven on French roads powered by a 'green' fuel which Jacques Delors, president of the EC Commission, believes will become accepted throughout the EC. Produced from rapeseed oil, the fuel - known as Diester, a trade name derived from ester (an organic compound) - reduces pollution and provides an income for Europe's agricultural community. Many Elf service stations, particularly in the Paris region, provide a mixture of regular diesel fuel and up to 5 per cent of Diester. It is this mixture of fuels which Delors says will become the EC standard. Diester is intended to run any vehicle with regular diesel engines - its main use is with municipal vehicles. The fuel does not affect their performance, longevity or maintenance. Tests show that this is true for engines running on a mixture of fuel containing up to 30 per cent Diester. At present, French authorities do not foresee a higher percentage of Diester in the fuel and French automotive manufacturers do not plan to develop special engines, says Luc Schorter, general manager of Ouroumoff, the Paris-based consulting engineers. Ouroumoff built France's first Diester factory at Compiegne, north of Paris. Its client for the FFr50m (Pounds 5.8m) pilot plant was Robbe, a company specialising in non-food uses of vegetable oils and owned by Sofiproteol, a French financial institution. While Diester benefits the environment by helping to alleviate the greenhouse effect and levels of acid rain caused by diesel exhaust fumes, Schorter also stresses the agricultural factors. 'It is a very intelligent solution for the farmers,' he says. Land lying fallow because of EC 'set-aside' rules can be cultivated for non-food purposes. In the medium term, rapeseed destined for Diester production could produce an annual 500,000 tonnes of Diester, or 4 per cent of French diesel fuel consumption. Schorter believes this level of production will be reached in five years and continue to increase. Today, however, Diester would not be economically viable without government help. A subsidy of FFr1,000 per hectare is available to farmers growing rapeseed for conversion to Diester. Also, Diester is not subject to the same tax imposed on other diesel fuels and petrol. Even so, the price will not fall to that of regular diesel for at least two years because of the limitations of production technology. In Diester production, a chemical reaction takes place in which rapeseed oil is combined with methanol in the presence of an alkaline catalyst. At the Compiegne factory, which Delors inaugurated earlier this year, a process known as Esterfip, developed by the French Petroleum Institute (IFP), is employed. According to Schorter, it is not difficult to make Diester. Financed in part by the EC, the plant built by Ouroumoff has a capacity of 20,000 tonnes a year. Schorter says if Diester is to be priced the same as ordinary diesel fuel, plants must be able to produce at least 100,000 tonnes a year. For this, continuous production is vital. The IFP has developed and is testing such a process; others are also trying. Schorter forecasts that within five years, France will have five factories making Diester, each with an output of at least 100,000 tonnes. They will operate in different regions, the first coming on stream in 1995. Government subsidies for Diester will decline as the more cost-effective continuous process plants start up, but the question of what to do with the rapeseed husks left when the oil has been squeezed out and with the glycerine by-product remains unanswered. Meanwhile, to satisfy a growing demand for Diester, the Compiegne factory plans to double output to an annual 40,000 tonnes.</p>

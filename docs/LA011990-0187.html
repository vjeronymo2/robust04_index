			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GIANTS SIGN CARTER FOR ONE YEAR  </P> <P> The San Francisco Giants have signed free-agent veteran catcher Gary Carter to  a one-year contract, the club announced today.  </P> <P> Carter, 35, is an 11-time All-Star selection and a career .265 hitter with 304  home runs during 15 Major League seasons, but he suffered through a poor season  last year.  </P> <P> Carter hit just .183 with two home runs and 15 RBIs while playing in a  career-low 50 games for the New York Mets in 1989. He was out much of the  season with an injured right knee.  </P> <P> Contract terms were not released by the Giants. Last year, Carter's contract  with the Mets was valued at $2.16 million.  </P> <P> "Gary Carter is a great asset for our ballclub," said Al Rosen, president and  general manager of the National League champions. "We think he can still  produce both offensively and defensively. He's a proven leader both on the  field and in the clubhouse.  </P> <P> "Gaining Gary gives us another proven veteran at the catching position, which  is something a number of clubs would like to have," he said.  </P> <P> After playing for the Mets and Montreal Expos, Carter returns to California,  where he attended high school. He's a 1972 graduate of Sunny Hills High School  in Fullerton.  </P> <P> "I'm excited to be a Giant," said Carter from his home in Palm Beach Gardens,  Fla. "Since Al Rosen and (Manager) Roger Craig came to San Francisco, no team  has been more committed to success. I've gotten used to being in a winning  atmosphere the last several years, and I'm sure that will continue this year.  We have an outstanding lineup, and I'm looking forward to making whatever  contribution I can."  </P> <P> Carter, who ranks fifth on the all-time Major League list of games caught with  1,823, was a member of the 1986 Mets team that won the World Series.  </P></p>

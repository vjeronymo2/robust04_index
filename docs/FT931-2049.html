			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Ontario Hydro raises CDollars 1.5bn amid brisk new activity NEW issue activity in the international bond market was brisk and varied yesterday, in spite of weakness in government bond markets across Europe. Ontario Hydro raised CDollars 1.5bn through an issue of five-year global bonds. The issuer had announced its intention to launch a global bond issue last week. The Kingdom of Sweden is also said to be considering a five-year Canadian dollar Eurobond issue. Ontario Hydro's bonds, which carry a coupon of 7 1/4 per cent, were priced to yield 73 basis points over comparable Canadian government bonds, in the middle of the indicated range of 72-74 basis points. An official at Goldman Sachs, one of the four joint lead managers, said that investor demand gauged in the run-up to yesterday's launch enabled the underwriting group to pitch the bonds slightly below an original target spread in the mid-1970s. The bonds were distributed mainly in Europe and Canada, but interest from eastern Asia was thin, mainly because of the ending of the Japanese financial year. When the bonds were freed to trade, the yield spread was virtually unchanged. The day's other big issue was a Dollars 1bn seven-year warrant Eurobond issue from Roche Holdings Inc, the US financing arm of the big Swiss drugs company. The proceeds of the bonds, which carry a coupon of 2 3/4 per cent, will be used to re-finance Roche's loans related to the Dollars 2.1bn purchase in 1990 of a 60 per cent stake in Genentech, the Californian biotechnology company. The issue, led by Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), has a novel structure whereby holders of the warrants, which are exercisable into Roche Genussscheine (non-voting profit-sharing certificates), have conditional protection against a fall in the value of the Genussscheine. However, this protection is eliminated if the shares rise to a so-called 'knock-out' price. The potential gains for investors are also capped. The issue got a mixed reception. One syndicate manager involved in the deal called the structure 'unnecessarily complicated'. Others said that the structure puzzled investors and that the main beneficiary was the issuer itself, since it was able to raise a large amount of money at a a relatively low cost. An official at SBC said that the issue had got off to a good start, with demand for the package mainly from Switzerland. UK accounts showed some interest for the stripped bonds. SBC quoted the bonds at 100 1/2 bid in the late afternoon, but there was little actual trading. Some dealers said the lack of activity suggested that the rest of the market was unable to put a value on the bonds. Elsewhere, Abbey National took advantage of investor demand for short-dated dollar-denominated paper and raised Dollars 250m via a three-year Eurobond issue. The bonds were priced to yield 38 basis points over comparable US Treasuries, which offered a 10 basis point pick-up over the three-year Dollars 250m issue launched last week by Landesbank Schleswig Holstein Girozentrale. Weakness in the German government bond market hampered the launch of Metallgesellschaft Finance's DM300m seven-year Eurobond issue, though an official at the joint lead manager, Deutsche Bank, said that sales had gone well in view of the unfavourable market circumstances. The bonds were priced to yield 70 basis points over comparable Bunds and were not freed to trade by the close of business. The European Investment Bank braved the Eurolira market, raising L300bn through a five-year issue. The bonds, which were priced to yield 50 basis points below comparable Italian government bonds, were mainly bought by foreign investors wanting lira paper not issued by the Italian state, an official at the lead manager Credito Italiano said. The stream of Eurosterling issues continued as Eksportfinans, the Norwegian export financing agency, launched a Pounds 100m five-year issue. The bonds were priced to yield 43 basis points over comparable gilts and were not freed to trade by late yesterday.</p>

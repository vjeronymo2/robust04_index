			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weak bonds leave bourses trading lower Bourses fell back in the afternoon as bonds weakened. AMSTERDAM retreated slightly in line with the performance on neighbouring markets. The AEX index slipped 2.13 to 410.56. DSM continued to move ahead, helped by reports of brokers' upgrades, with the shares rising at one stage to an all-time high of Fl 156.50, before falling off at the close to finish Fl 2.80 higher at Fl 152.00. Hoare Govett has put a buy recommendation on the stock and forecast that the chemical's group would continue to show a sharp increase in profits in the next few years, helped particularly by the rise in plastics prices. The broker raised its estimates for 1994 and 1995 earnings per share to Fl 13 from Fl 10 and to Fl 19 from Fl 15 respectively. The other main story of the day concerned KLM, which said it had bought the stake held by Foster's, the Australian brewer, in Northwest, lifting its holding from 20 per cent to 25 per cent. KLM said it would use part of the proceeds from its share issue earlier this year to fund the purchase, estimated at some Fl 180m. KLM closed 10 cents up at Fl 49.40. FRANKFURT increased its losses in the post-bourse, after a negative earlier session, as the market came under pressure from bunds. The Dax index ended official hours off 11.97 at 2,124.12, and in the Ibis retreated to 2,118.08. Turnover remained low at DM6.8bn. Brokers do not expect the market to receive a lift from the meeting of the Bundesbank today, with no movement on interest rates expected. The expiration of options tomorrow has also unsettled investors this week. ZURICH extended losses during the afternoon, with lower bond futures and the weak dollar depressing the mood. The SMI index lost 21.1 at 2,637.7. Mr Michael Clark at Robert Fleming Securities commented that relative to the rest of Europe, the performance of the Swiss market had been volatile over the summer, suffering as the key sectors in the market - the financials, chemicals and drugs, and foods - had been out of favour. Although sentiment towards these stocks had changed somewhat in the past few weeks, he said, it did not appear to be enough to generate any further significant recovery in the prices of stocks such as Nestle and the drug issues, except possibly Roche, for the time being. Among chemicals, Roche certificates declined SFr70 to SFr6,155 and the Sandoz bearer shares finished SFr8 cheaper at SFr692. CS Holding, upgraded to a buy by James Capel following its decision to withdraw its bid for Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein, slipped SFr3 to SFr564, while UBS retreated SFr8 to SFr1,212. Nestle weakened SFr16 to SFr1,220 as investors sold holdings ahead of today's half-year figures. Cyclicals put in a firmer performance, with BBC bearers SFr3 higher at SFr1,172 and Sulzer registered SFr11 ahead at SFr692. PARIS was upset by pressure in the matif, sending the CAC-40 index down 16.42 to 1,952.94. The index moved in a range between 1,968 and 1,949 as turnover reached FFr2.8bn. Peugeot was hit by the news of the imminent Renault privatisation, its shares falling FFr29 to FFr796. Better news came to the assistance of Bancaire, up FFr34.20 at FFr487.50, as it reported good first-half figures. MILAN remained on the upward track in technically driven trade ahead of today's end of the September account. The Comit index rose 6.74, or 1 per cent, to 654.93. Insurers led the market's advance, with Generali rising L750, or 1.8 per cent, to L41,550 ahead of the bonus one-for-10 rights issue which begins tomorrow. Mediobanca put on L200 at L13,900 after the merchant bank said that its capital increase, postponed because of poor market conditions in June, would be discussed at a shareholders meeting on October 28. The FT-SE Eurotrack Indices committee has approved the quarterly changes to the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 and 200 indices. The following constituent changes will be made on September 19: for inclusion, KPN, INA and Philips Electronics; for exclusion, Fomento de Construcciones, Banca Commerciale Italiana and Stet. On the indicative reserve list: Telecom Italia, Schneider, Volkswagen (Reg), Investor 'B', Zurich Insurance (Reg) and Akzo Nobel.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vilma Estrada from the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] President Violeta Chamorro has said that her  government has shown clear signals of its determination to  settle the property issue, adding that it does not need a 90-day  deadline to resolve the problem of properties confiscated from  U.S. citizens, as stipulated by an amendment approved by the  U.S. Congress.    [Begin Chamorro recording] [Words indistinct] 90 days. I  have  given clear signals of my resolve to settle this issue since I  assumed the presidency. We have returned what does not belong to  us and gradually resolved other problems. [end recording]    Foreign Minister Leal explained that the Gonzalez-Helms  Amendment deals with returning properties confiscated from U.S.  citizens or compensating them as well as with creating a  procedure to resolve this problem in keeping with international  law. This is precisely, he continued, what the Nicaraguan  Government has been doing.    [Begin recording] [Leal] We began returning properties in  the  hands of the state in October of last year. We began with 40  companies. This is an ongoing process, because as soon as we  return some properties, more U.S. citizens appear demanding  other properties.    [Chamorro, interrupting] I may add that it is not only U.S.  citizens but citizens of Spain, Mexico, and other parts of the  world who are demanding the return of their properties. This is  a terrible situation. We, the Army, and the police must all work  together to solve the problem. Everyone who profited from the  pinata-like giveaway must return the properties.    [Unidentified reporter] What do you think of the  insinuations  made by the director of Channel 8, who questioned your authority  as president during an interview with Presidency Minister  Antonio Lacayo?    [Chamorro] [Words indistinct] is wrong because I was elected  by the people. I am in control, not Antonio. Antonio, like my  foreign minister and everyone who works here, is working for all  of you, for the people of Nicaragua. [end recording]    President Chamorro presented 21 motorcycles to 21  humanitarian institutions in the country.</p>

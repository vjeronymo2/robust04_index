			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $60,000 IN JEWELS TAKEN FROM COUPLE AT HOME  </P> <P> A Chinese nightclub owner and his wife were robbed Friday of nearly $60,000 in  jewels at their home near La Puente, the second residential holdup this week of  an Asian family in the east San Gabriel Valley, sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, a retired Vietnamese couple were assaulted at their Diamond Bar  home and robbed of more than $40,000 in cash, jewelry and guns.  </P> <P> The 64-year-old husband fractured his foot when he tried to escape by jumping  from the window of a second-story bathroom.  </P> <P> While detectives do not have any evidence that the two cases are related, they  said both assaults were committed by Asian youths and are part of a growing  trend of Asian-on-Asian home robberies in suburban immigrant communities. Asian  families are sometimes preyed on because they often store valuables at home and  have learned in their native countries to fear retribution if they cooperate  with police, authorities say.  </P></p>

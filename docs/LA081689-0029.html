			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE VALLEY: THE DOORMAN ADVISED PASSING FOURSOMES THAT THE MAIN HALLWAY  BROKE LEFT.  </P> <P> A charity golf tournament was held inside the Woodland Hills Marriott the other  day.  </P> <P> Some celebrities and some plain folks got together for a bellman's version of  miniature golf. Everyone was handed a putter and a ball, and they set off to  putt-putt through 18 very short holes in the hotel's lobby, hallways and larger  suites.  </P> <P> Sand was sprinkled on the floor to form "traps" and potted plants acted as  "trees." The doorman advised passing foursomes that the main hallway broke  left.  </P> <P> Cute idea. And money was raised for a good cause. But it seems these people  missed a rare opportunity.  </P> <P> See, the Marriott is a reasonably nice hotel. Expensively decorated with  ornamental vases and potted plants. Extensive use of glass.  </P> <P> Tremendous potential for damage.  </P> <P> Nothing quickens the pulse like an outburst of senseless demolition, so why not  give everyone a full bag of clubs and let'em tee off? Imagine all the crashing  and bashing about -- that kind of action is a no-miss for network news. ESPN  could supply color commentary. A historic event.  </P> <P> It could have started slowly, tension building. The first few holes  crisscrossed a restaurant, so you could have ruined a few place settings and  maybe somebody's appetite. Merely a warm-up.  </P> <P> Holes six and seven ran through the hotel's nightclub. Row upon row of  expensive liquor bottles. Floor-to-ceiling mirrors. The possibilities would  have been endless.  </P> <P> Hole 11, a nifty par three, was situated in the concierge's VIP lounge. Here,  experienced golfers could have faced a difficult chip shot to take out the  chandelier. Ah, the spirit of challenge. Beginners could have opted for a  simpler, straight drive through the picture window that lay just beyond the  hole.  </P> <P> Onward to the 12th tee -- the presidential suite generously furnished with  Oriental artwork, glass table-tops and wonderfully delicate-looking lamps. Talk  about a target-rich environment. Be sure to wear safety goggles.  </P> <P> Given half an hour and a decent selection of irons, my grandmother could have  made a shambles of this room . . . and she has a pitiful short game.  </P> <P> Best of all, several fairways cut across heavily populated areas. One tee in  the lobby afforded a clear lie to the front desk, where unwitting tourists  waited to check in. Another hole, bordering the pool, could have offered  novices an easier shot at slow-moving targets.  </P> <P> Envision innocent bystanders scrambling for cover. Not since the golden era of  Gerald Ford has golf enjoyed such excitement. The game needs a shot in the arm.  A little adrenaline, a threat of physical injury to compete with spectator  sports like, say, Australian rules football.  </P> <P> Alas, none of this came to pass: A putter simply can't generate the power, lift  and distance required for widespread breakage.  </P> <P> So contestants putted peacefully. Well, relatively peacefully.  </P> <P> "They're arguing and shouting," said David Smith, a former professional golfer  brought in to supervise. "They seem to be having fun."  </P> <P> Players were divided into teams, suited businessmen paired with television  actors. The new Gidget was there and one of the old CHIPS guys and some soap  opera actors.  </P> <P> Some of the stars were so well-known that they had to introduce themselves at  length. "I'm an unknown, quasi-pseudo-semi-celebrity," said Stephen Mendel, who  said he acts in a show called "Night Heat" that he said airs each Tuesday at 1  a.m.  </P> <P> Several Hollywood agents were on hand too. They scurried about the periphery,  trying to get their clients noticed. One woman, who represented a teen-age  actor on a Fox Network sitcom, asked a television news crew from the same  network to film her young star at play. She was ignored.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a hockey player turned out to be one of the best golfers. But every  once in a while, he'd glance uneasily at the other players, as if antsy to lay  a hip check on someone, anyone.  </P> <P> In a perfect world, a vicious maneuver like this would have fit perfectly with  the Destruct-O-Golf theme.  </P> <P> "No," said Steve Duchesne, who plays defense for the Los Angeles Kings. "In the  summer I'm kind of quiet."  </P> <P> Another wasted opportunity.  </P> <P> You couldn't even find a violently bad dresser in the crowd. Several people  wore plaid, but there wasn't a single pair of Sansabelt slacks to be seen. One  woman had the audacity to show up wearing Batman earrings. Think she'd get two  steps inside a stuffy club like Augusta?  </P> <P> Yet, despite the crowd and the setting, this tournament did have some  similarity to real golf.  </P> <P> People cheated.  </P> <P> "Lots of cheating," said one tournament organizer. "Terrible cheating."  </P> <P> People drank a lot too. Every third hole passed by a bar. Now this feature  should be incorporated into regulation golf. Want to see a pro like Greg Norman  really lose it in sudden death? Feed him a half-dozen margaritas on the back  nine.  </P> <P> Anyway, the 70 or so businessmen and actors seemed to have fun, and they raised  $5,000 for the Celebrity Outreach Foundation, which gives money to groups like  the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Planned Parenthood and the Greater Los Angeles  Partnership for the Homeless.  </P> <P> Still, no pottery was shattered. No wood splintered or mirrors cracked. No  broken glass.  </P> <P> Just think, this could have been something special.  </P></p>

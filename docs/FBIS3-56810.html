Rakhmanov, </F> under the "Interlocutor of the Day" rubric, by Colonel Anatoliy  Ladin; place and date not given: "Inappropriate To Hold Talks  on Battlefield"]    [Text] Calling Card    Imamali Sharipovich Rakhmanov was born 5 October 1952 in the  village of Dangar in Kulyab Oblast's Dangarinskiy Rayon. He  began his working life as an electrician at an oil mill. He  served in the Army. He is an economist by training, graduating  from Tajik State University in 1982. At the 16th extraordinary  session of the Supreme Council in Khudzhand (November 1992) he  was elected chairman of the Tajik Supreme Council.    [Ladin] Esteemed Emomali Sharipovich, the situation in  Tajikistan is still complex. However, there are noticeable  signs of a move away from a military to a peaceful life. What  is the republic's leadership doing to speed up this process?    [Rakhmanov] We have been trying to secure peace and  tranquillity from the very first days when the republic's new  leadership was elected. Over a year has already elapsed since  that day but there is of course still a long way to go until we  have total tranquillity in political life as well as order in  the economy.    The main thing that we have tried to achieve is to unite the  people, channel their efforts into reviving our ravaged economy.  In our bid to secure civil peace and harmony between the various  political forces and public associations, we have declared an  amnesty on three occasions. Those people who were embroiled in  the armed struggle against the legitimate government by  deception have been able to revert to a peaceful life. Those  who did not want to lay down their arms have crossed the Pyandzh  River over the border into Afghanistan. Now they are  destabilizing the situation there, causing concern for the  Afghan leadership.    [Ladin] At one time there was a great deal of talk about  separatist sentiments among the leaders of certain regions of  your republic. Is there a problem of disunity today between  Tajikistan's oblasts?    [Rakhmanov] Some people would very much like this problem to  materialize. I can assure you that separatist sentiments are  not as strong in our republic as some writers are claiming. The  central authorities have already established total mutual  understanding with Leninabad Oblast. Admittedly, some  difficulties have arisen in relations with Gorno-Badakhshan.  This was attributable to the fact that some hard-line  opposition thugs went there via the Pamir passes. They were  afraid of taking responsibility for crimes committed in the  south of the republic and in the capital and it paid for them to  incite the civilian population of the autonomous oblast to  disobey the center. What is more, the thugs blockaded the  Dushanbe-Khorog high-mountain road, which immediately made it  difficult to deliver economic freight to the oblast, as well as  fuel and food. They were also able to exploit this situation....    The blockade has now been lifted. A decree adopted by the  Council of Ministers has made provision for 22 billion rubles  [R] in early preferential credit to be allocated to the oblast.  Aid is being provided to improve medical, trade, and transport  services and build housing. Naturally, this is no easy matter  since the republic's economy is in the throes of profound crisis.    [Ladin] But Dushanbe is nonetheless not laying down its  arms. Nevertheless there is the opinion that the situation in  Tajikistan can only be stabilized once and for all by political  rather than military means. What would you say to that?    [Rakhmanov] The very question holds a reproof directed at  the republic's leadership. But I cannot agree with it. We are  forced to use force against an armed adversary. And you will  agree that it was inappropriate to set up a negotiating table on  the battlefield. The bloodshed had to be stopped first. Which  was what we did in late 1992.    We spent the whole of last year establishing mutual  understanding and cooperation with frightened peasants and  wavering representatives of the intelligentsia. Had we not done  this, today we would not have the strategic program for economic  reform, the new draft Constitution, and a number of fundamental  laws adopted by the parliament. All that is to the credit of  academics, lawyers, writers, and highly-qualified specialists.  They put their trust in us and followed us. But the time has  now come for active political dialogue with leaders of the  former opposition, those who did not take part in the armed  struggle.    [Ladin] What is your opinion of the role played by Russia  and the other CIS states in defending Tajikistan's independence?  What effect is the presence of the collective peacekeeping  forces having on the situation in the republic?    [Rakhmanov] I would like to pay my profound respects to the  relatives and friends of those guys who died in the summer of  1993 in the Russian 12th Border detail. It is hard to find  words to express both grief and admiration for the magnitude of  the sacrifice! We are sincerely and cordially grateful to the  peoples and governments of all the CIS states....    Regrettably, internationalist soldiers are still dying in  armed clashes with intruders on the Tajik-Afghan border. It is  also the task of the CIS collective peacekeeping forces in  Tajikistan to put an end to this. It is my profound conviction  that their very presence will have a favorable effect on the  moral climate in the republic and on the population's mood.    The peacekeeping forces' mission is to stabilize the  situation on the border. But they are performing a task of  general significance for all the CIS peoples, in particular  those living in the Central Asian region.    [Ladin] Is Tajikistan today able to set up its own armed  forces? In your view, what are the prospects of military  cooperation with Russia and other CIS states?    [Rakhmanov] The Tajik people have not made ready to fight  anyone. There are no major troop formations stationed on our  territory. Only the numerically "reduced" 201st Division, now a  Russian division. We therefore found ourselves in an extremely  difficult position when the need arose to rebuff large armed  gangs infiltrating the border.    We have been creating our own people's army in a combat  situation in the direct sense of the word. The republic's  Supreme Council has already adopted the Laws "On Defense" and  "On the Armed Forces of the Republic of Tajikistan." But we do  not have enough money to perform this task. The state budget  deficit now totals R130 billion. In view of this, even the  upkeep of the collective peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan is  today split as follows: Russia has taken on one-half of all  expenditure associated with the collective peacekeeping forces,  Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are responsible for 15 percent a  piece, while Kyrgyzstan and our republic are responsible for 10  percent each.    [Ladin] How do you see the republic's army in the future?  Is Tajikistan interested in recruiting officer cadres from  other states?    [Rakhmanov] What have we got today? According to the  figures of the Defense Ministry, which, incidentally, is also  barely a year old, we have formed the Fayzal Saidov 11th Special  Purpose Brigade, a special purpose detachment, a helicopter  squadron, and a military hospital. There are very few Tajik  officers. Historically a military career has not appealed to my  compatriots. However, now it is necessary for us to train  national military cadres.    The Sangak Safarov Military College has been set up in  Dushanbe and a training brigade is being formed. A military  lyceum on the lines of the Suvorov School is being organized in  Khudzhand. I would like at least one-half of our army to  comprise indigenous nationals. But that is a thing of the  distant future. We are counting on aid from Russia, Ukraine,  Kazakhstan, and other friendly states in training highly  professional officer cadres, particularly in the middle-level  and top echelons of command.    As for the conditions of service in our army for officers  from other states, we will follow universally accepted  international norms in this. But that is, I repeat, a thing of  the future. For the time being let us say a big thank you to  the glorious men of the Russian Federation and the other CIS  states who are defending the southern borders of the CIS  together with our republic's troops.</p>

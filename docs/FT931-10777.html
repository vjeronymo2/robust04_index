			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Letter: Poor compensation for living in London Sir, I was not surprised to read that some local authorities in other parts of the country feel that London does too well out of the area cost adjustment ('A north-south council divide widens', February 3). In the famous phrase, they would say that, wouldn't they? The true position is that London boroughs do very poorly out of the adjustment. A conservative estimate is that the capital's 33 authorities are being deprived of more than Pounds 200m a year precisely because the area cost adjustment does not take London's higher costs into sufficient account. These should include full allowance for salaries and wages, rents and business rates, the costs of homelessness, caring for the very high numbers of refugees, and the London-wide concessionary fares scheme. Further, it is clear that Londoners subsidise those living in other areas of the country. Some Pounds 2bn flows out of London through uniform business rate, and London councils will lose a further Pounds 220m in grant under the council tax, as a result of higher property values. Cleveland, Shropshire and others can complain, but they won't find much sympathy from London's council leaders and chief executives, nor from their council tax payers who consistently face higher bills than householders outside London, irrespective of their local authority's political colour.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, March 11 (OANA-BERNAMA) --  Malaysia's prime minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, said Malaysia  sympathised with the workers in Britain who faced losing their  jobs in the wake of Kuala Lumpur's decision not to entertertain  British companies in awarding government contracts.    Nevertheless, the government could do nothing to withdraw  the  decision because when contracts were given to British companies,  the government was assailed by baseless allegations by the  British mass media and even some political leaders of that  country. "As such, if we do not give contracts to British  companies, there will be no accusations. Should we give profits  to the British companies so that they (the media and some  political leaders) can hurl accusations at us?" he told  reporters here Friday.    Trade Union Congress (TUC) General Secretary John Monks was  reported to have written to British Trade Minister Richard  Needham to express the concern of trade unions about the  damaging consequences for jobs in British industry if the  current restriction on the involvement of British companies in  government projects imposed by the Malaysian Governemnt was not  lifted. News reports today said TUC also wrote to the Malaysian  Trade Union Congress (MTUC) to seek its help in appealing to the  government to withdraw the decision. [passage omitted]    Asked to comment on the TUC concern, Dr. Mahathir said it  should urge the newspapers in Britain -- the source of the  problem that led to Malaysia's action -- to stop publishing lies  about the country rather then asking help from the British  Government and MTUC to resolve the situation. By right, they  should urge their newspapers. We ask for very little... That  is, don't tell lies, he added. Dr. Mahathir said Malaysia's  request was not difficult to fulfil because all that was needed  was courage to tell the truth. Say what is true. If people are  not involved in bribery, don't say there is bribery. If it is a  loan and not a grant, say it is a loan and not a grant. He said,  however, that the mass media in Britain appeared to consider  telling lies as forming part of press freedom. Malaysia does not  agree with that view because press freedom was limited to  reporting the truth and did not extend to making false  allegations or condemning someone, he added.    If they (the newspapers in Britain) continue to do so, it is  difficult for us to consider the interests of the workers in  Britain. We must give priority to our nation, he said when  asked if the government would withdraw its decision should MTUC  make an appeal on behalf of TUC. Dr. Mahathir was also asked if  he would write to THE SUNDAY TIMES, London to seek that it  correct its report containing the allegations of bribery made  against Malaysian politicians and himself by reporting the  truth. It's of no use for me to write to THE SUNDAY TIMES which  does not in the least feel at fault because they are the one who  started all this, he said.    He added, however, that THE FINANCIAL TIMES (London) had  asked him for an explanation of the cabinet decision. I  received a letter from THE FINANCIAL TIMES, not SUNDAY TIMES,  asking me to give my views. I might give some explanation.    He said Malaysia's action had nothing to do with allegations  in the British press about a linkage between Malaysia's purchase  of military equipment from Britain and British aid for  construction of the Pergau hydroelectric dam in Kelantan.</p>

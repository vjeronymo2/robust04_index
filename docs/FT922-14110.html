			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Iraq-Kuwait border team delays report THE United Nations commission demarcating Kuwait's northern border with Iraq, as part of the Gulf war ceasefire agreement, is unlikely to deliver its final decision on the boundary until June at the earliest, officials close to the commission said yesterday. The five-member UN team convenes today in New York for a meeting after which it had been expected to announce its findings. Although the team is understood to have reached agreement on four sections of the 200km (125-mile) disputed border between the two countries, observers of the commission's work say the team may require a further meeting. The commission will continue meeting until April 20. It is working to determine the exact position on the ground of the international boundary that was agreed by Iraq and Kuwait in a 1963 exchange of minutes, and which was based itself on a loose definition of the border made in 1932. The team is expected to mark a line to the north of the de facto Iraq-Kuwait border before Iraq's invasion of the emirate in 1990 - a line likely to lie north of several Iraqi-drilled oil wells in the Rumaila oil field and expected to cut across the Iraqi Umm Qasr naval base.</p>

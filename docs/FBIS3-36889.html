This development of events harms  prospects for normalizing the situation in that country," says a  joint statement on Afghanistan, which was issued here on 8  February by the foreign ministers of Russia and Uzbekistan.    The two countries' foreign ministries, the statement says,  "call for an end to the fratricidal war in Afghanistan and urge  all Afghan military-political forces to abandon their reliance  on force and to embark on a joint search for political  compromises, for the sake of national consolidation and  reconciliation."    The statement stresses: "The sides consider that the  conflict  in Afghanistan, which is a result of internal contradictions in  that country, threatens security and stability in the region.  They are seriously concerned at the increased tension on the  southern borders of the CIS.    The foreign ministers of Russia and Uzbekistan support the  integrity of the Afghan state and the inviolability of its  borders. They are convinced that a settlement of the existing  contradictions and a decision on Afghanistan's future  development is a matter, first and foremost, for Afghans  themselves. The sides intend to continue maintaining strict  neutrality and abiding by the principle of noninterference in  Afghanistan's internal affairs. Russia and Uzbekistan are  willing to do their utmost to facilitate the achievement of  these objectives within the framework of general international  efforts, cooperating with the United Nations and all interested  states.    In this connection, the ministers stressed the timeliness of  the initiatives that the Uzbek president presented at the 48th  session of the UN General Assembly concerning a settlement of  regional conflicts in Central Asia, including the Afghan  problem. They emphasized their readiness to take part in their  joint implementation.    The sides confirm their readiness to develop goodneighborly  relations and comprehensive, mutually advantageous cooperation  with a peaceful, independent, and sovereign Afghanistan in the  interests of mutual understanding and confidence in the region."</p>

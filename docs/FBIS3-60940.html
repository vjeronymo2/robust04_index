Security forces have arrested Attia's father-in-law, named  only as Bouchakor in the report, charging him with sheltering  the armed gang after the December 15 killings, and have  recovered stolen goods.    Attia was reported to have led an armed band for more than a  year and to be responsible for more than 200 attacks. He has  been implicated in an assault on the Boughezoul barracks, 150  kilometres (90 miles) south of here, which left 19 soldiers  dead, EL WATAN said. [background passage omitted]</p>

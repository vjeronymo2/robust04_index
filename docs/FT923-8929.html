			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Man In The News: Scyther with a soft edge - David Simon When David Simon greeted Prince Charles at the opening of BP's elegant new headquarters in London's Finsbury Circus earlier this year, guests were somewhat concerned. BP's then chief operating officer had a black eye. Perhaps Mr Simon had come to blows with his chairman and chief executive, the ebullient Mr Robert Horton, one or two observers were heard to mutter. In fact, Mr Simon had walked into a door. A punch-up would definitely not have been his style. There is to Mr Simon something of the John Major: the same sober-suited, heavy-spectacled, bank manager exterior, the same good humour masking a more steely edge, and allowing the occasional suggestion of smugness. The parallels do not end there. Like Mr Major, Mr Simon was a bit player in his predecessor's downfall, but once the dagger had been wielded, he found himself thrust to the fore. Both inherited a ship that had been blown off-course, both were brought in to mend relations within and outside their organisations, both promised a more collegiate style of management. Both also promised a change of style, rather than of substance. Both, too, moved quickly to jettison some of their former leaders' cherished dogmas. Mr Major abandoned the electoral liability of the poll tax; and this week Mr Simon reversed BP's policy of maintaining its dividend, come what may. Here, however, the analogy break down. In some respects, Mr Simon has acclerated his predecessor's programme of overhaul in a way the UK prime minister has not. Moreover, in contrast to Mr Major's meteoric rise, the new BP chief reached the top after more than 31 years with BP; and for most of that time his rise has shadowed that of the man whose job he was to inherit. Simon was born in London in 1939, the son of an engineer. He was educated at Christ's Hospital, and, with sponsorship from BP, went up to Cambridge to read modern languages. He joined BP in 1961, four years after Robert Horton, and spent his early career in marketing in Europe. After honing his business skills on an MBA course at the European Institute of Business Administration in Fontainebleau, he moved around the company before spells as marketing director in BP Holland, and with BP Oil in the UK. By 1982 he was chief executive of BP Oil International, and found himself tackling the losses and oversupply of the group's worldwide refinery division at the same time as Mr Horton was handling similarly difficult decisions at BP Chemicals. Four years later, Mr Simon became the second-youngest group managing director. The youngest, by three weeks, was Mr Horton. When chairman and chief executive Sir Peter Walters left in 1990, both Mr Horton and Mr Simon vied to succeed him. Mr Horton got the job. Mr Simon, characteristically, agreed to stay on as chief operating officer, enhancing his reputation as a team player committed to BP. Mr Horton summed up the differences in personality between the two with his remark shortly before his appointment: 'Simon is good. I've told him that if I get the job I'll be happy for him to work with me. If he gets it, there is no way I am working with him.' On a personal level, Mr Simon is said to guard his privacy, and is believed to have disapproved of Mr Horton's publicity-seeking. 'It's not that I haven't got an ego,' he once confided to a colleague after observing Mr Horton holding forth for an Italian TV crew. 'It's just not particularly important to me.' Unlike his predecessor, he is also careful to maintain a life outside work. While BP was in turmoil less than 48 hours after the boardroom coup which ousted Mr Horton six weeks ago, Mr Simon was to be found at his local golf course. Associates say he is approachable, popular, and good-humoured, as well as being shrewd. He can also be ruthless. 'He is not mild-mannered in the sense of insipid or wimpish,' said one BP insider. 'He is slightly sardonic, and uses irony rather than temper to get points over.' When it comes to business, a senior City figure says that Mr Simon is more of a careful planner than a daring entrepreneur. 'He is not someone to get carried away about a sexy scheme and embark on it as an act of faith. He would have to prove on the financial side that it would work.' He is said to be a prudent man, who abhors debt, and despite his unflappable exterior is a worrier, with a great deal of nervous energy. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of drinks group Grand Metropolitan, of which Mr Simon is a non-executive director, summed him up thus: 'David is an outstanding non-executive, a very interesting combination of the shrewd strategist, and the thorough and highly analytical operator. He has a refreshing style matched by a highly entertaining sense of humour.' These qualities have been noticed by the City, to which Mr Simon represents a more amenable figure than Mr Horton, and which has offered him several chairmanships of big companies in recent years. Mr Simon preferred to stay at BP, even though he was growing increasingly unhappy working with Mr Horton. Now, he has the chance to run the company his way, though the programme he outlined this week had, apart from the dividend cut, more than a touch of his former boss about it - accelerated job cuts, cost and spending reductions, and sales of non-core assets. Employees and shareholders alike will be hoping the style of implementation will be different from Mr Horton's. Those who know Mr Simon suggest he will be better able than Mr Horton to carry people with him. It will not be easy. Rumours are already emanating from BP that after 'Hatchet Horton', the new chief executive has been branded 'Scything Simon'. But, warns a colleague, he should not be judged prematurely. 'I see no reason to believe that David is not behaving with the characteristic guile of a good chess player. It is just that people sometimes don't realise from the opening move how good a player someone is.'</p>

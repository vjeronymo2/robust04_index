			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / International Company News: Mitsukoshi cautious despite 12.3% rise MITSUKOSHI, the Japanese department store operator, yesterday reported a 12.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y19.33bn in the year to the end of February. The company said demand for imported paintings and other luxury goods boosted sales. This year, however, the group expects profit growth to increase only marginally. Total sales rose 10 per cent to Y866.7bn (Dollars 6.24bn), with an 8 per cent increase in clothing sales, a 15.3 per cent increase in those of household articles and a 17.9 per cent rise in sales of sundry goods. Japan's department store sales rose sharply early last year, but growth has been slower in recent months. Consumer confidence was affected by the Gulf crisis and by more general concerns about the slowing of Japanese economic growth. Mitsukoshi expects pre-tax profit this year to rise only to Y19.4bn on sales of Y936bn. Japanese department stores fear that consumer spending could slow if interest rates remain high and that purchasing power will be lessened by the relatively low wage increases won at the annual spring bargaining sessions. The Brazilian government has raised the share of steel group Usiminas held by Japanese group Nippon Usiminas from 4.65 to 12.88 per cent in preparation for the group's privatisation.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       NRI TOKYO BOND INDEX  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        PERFORMANCE INDEX                                    Average December 1983 = 100                 yield    Last   12 wks   26 wks                         25/4/91      (%)     week     ago      ago Overall                  154.00      7.12   154.10   152.75   145.63 Government Bonds         151.69      6.97   152.01   150.80   142.53 Municipal Bonds          155.79      7.23   155.77   155.59   147.91 Govt.- guaranteed Bonds   158.62      7.28   158.57   157.70   150.54 Bank Debentures          151.10      7.17   151.11   149.54   144.18 Corporate Bonds          157.07      7.38   156.65   154.09   147.84 Yen-denom.

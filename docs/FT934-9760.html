			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: German exchange rule warning RULES requiring issuers of securities on German stock exchanges to publish a full prospectus in a so-called 'official stock-market newspaper' should be done away with, the president of the influential Association of German Banks said yesterday. Germany was the only country in Europe to have such a rule, Mr Eberhard Martini said. This put the German financial markets at a competitive disadvantage to other European financial centres. He said it cost between DM75,000 and DM150,000 per prospectus to comply with the rule, and this could drive business away from Germany. Mr Martini, chief executive of the Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel Bank, warned the rule increased the tendency of issuers of DM bonds to launch deals outside Germany. It also hindered the German stock exchanges' attempts to persuade foreign issuers to seek a listing in Germany. Mr Martini suggested the proposed law on the reform of the German securities markets, the second Finanzmarktforderungsgesetz which received cabinet approval last week, should be amended to do away with the rule. The law contains sweeping measures to enhance German financial markets. It will make insider dealing a criminal offence, and establish a regulatory body for securities market supervision. After his official speech yesterday, Mr Martini said the German banking sector was proving itself one of the most stable in the world. Despite the deep recession in Germany, he said operating profits would rise substantially at many banks this year. However, he warned that these gains would be offset by, in some cases, 'massive' provisions for bad and doubtful debts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pusan, Dec. 30 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean man who  escaped a North Korea-run logging yard in Siberia and arrived in  South Korea recently, said here on Thursday there are about  10,000 North Korean loggers in Siberia who he said lead  ``animal-like'' lives due to the lack of daily necessities.    Kim Kil-song, 31 of Sinuiju, North Pyong-an Province, told a  press conference that lately North Korean loggers are forced to  earn rubles by doing household chores at Russian homes or manual  work at Russian industries.    ``These extra works are at the instructions of Kim Chong-il  after logging failed to fetch money due to the lack of  transportation means. But workers have been obliged to  contribute up to 90 percent of the money they earn in extra work  to North Korea,'' Kim said.    The defector said he escaped Siberia after he learned his  protest over the compulsory contribution was reported to  security authorities.    He said that after the escape he managed to reach  Vladivostok  where he could stealthly board a Pusan-bound Russian freighter  with the help of a Korean-Chinese there.    Kim said North Korea's head logging office is in Khabarovsk,  which he said controls nine field logging yards in Siberia.    Until 1975, prison inmates and those who had just served out  their terms were shipped to Siberia, he said, adding that  thereafter, however, ordinary people were recruited because  prisoners were often involved in troubles.    Kim said that during his military service in North Korea, he  personally took part in digging a tunnel near Kaesong which he  said was for use in holding nuclear. [sentence as received]    ``I heard that they were mining uranium at an uranium mine  near Pyongsan County, North Hwanghae Province,'' he said.    The defector said that also during his active service, Army  officers used to boast during lectures, ``the United States are  afraid of us as we have nuclear arms. We even can reject  nuclear inspections.''</p>

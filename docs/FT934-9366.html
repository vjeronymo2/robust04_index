			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Gore scores but game is still in doubt - The TV clash with Perot over Nafta PUNDITS and pollsters alike declared Vice-President Al Gore the clear winner in Tuesday night's televised debate with Mr Ross Perot about the North American Free Trade Agreement. Unlike an election debate, however, this confrontation could hope to influence fewer than a hundred members of Congress who remain uncommitted either for or against Nafta. The debate's impact on ordinary viewers - a pool already diminished because the debate reached only homes with cable television - will be felt only indirectly in the crucial vote in the House of Representatives next Wednesday. Mr Gore may have attained a number of his objectives. The forum gave him the opportunity to present the case for the treaty to a sceptical public, made fearful by the slow recovery and corporate cutbacks. The vice-president underlined the foreign and trade policy initiatives at stake and the danger that the administration might be unable to overcome a Nafta defeat to complete the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. However, he also presented a somewhat negative case for the agreement: he repeatedly noted that the US could withdraw with only six months' notice if the pact did not work, and warned that 'the Gatt round would probably not be completed if Nafta were defeated'. While the vice-president did not manage to provoke Mr Perot into any stunning displays of paranoia, by constant needling he succeeded in making his opponent appear nasty and thin-skinned. (Only on Sunday Mr Perot told a rally that he had been warned by the FBI of a plot against his life by six armed Cubans.) The perception that Mr Perot may be more of a drawback than an advantage to the Nafta opposition appears to be shared by several leading opponents of the treaty, both inside and outside the Congress. The tone of Mr Perot's arguments was so unremittingly negative and defensive that he actually served up an excuse for any congressman still in search of a reason to vote in favour in next week's Nafta debate. The administration's calculated gamble, that identifying the anti-Nafta camp closely with Mr Perot would work in favour of the agreement, appears to have paid off, at least to some modest degree. It still needs a political miracle to get Nafta through the House of Representatives. The hope was that the debate would create a momentum towards passage of the treaty that the administration has been unable to achieve after weeks of deal-making. Indeed, in its wake, one congressman, Mr Jim Bacchus of Florida, announced his support, but he had been leaning towards a yes vote and the administration has to secure 25-35 more. It was useful to the pro-Nafta side that an hour after the debate was over Mr Gore was quickly declared the winner in an ABC telephone poll by 47 per cent of viewers compared with 33 per cent for Mr Perot. But the real gains come in the televised soundbites - like the one in which Mr Perot calls the vice-president a liar - and follow-up reporting. Mr Al Hunt, former Wall Street Journal bureau chief, yesterday accused Mr Perot of lying when he claimed to have never hired lobbyists. Mr Hunt said Mr Perot had secretly lobbied the Ways and Means committee and had 'snuck through' a Dollars 15m tax break for himself 'in the middle of the night'. It was one more attack on Mr Perot's credibility, begun when the vice-president pointed out that the Texan had supported Nafta before running for president. Mr Gore held up a brochure featuring Mr Perot's picture and extolling the benefits to be derived from Latin American trade for the Perot family Alliance airport project in Fort Worth, Texas. Mr Perot scored a number of debating points with his visual aids. One featured a modern US company factory in Mexico surrounded by slums which have sprung up for the workers. Mr Gore could have made the point more effectively that, without Nafta, working and environmental conditions will just worsen. Ironically, Mr Perot often sounded as though he were more interested in protecting the living standards of Mexican workers than those of their US counterparts, and argued, with apparent seriousness, for a 'social tariff' to force the Mexican government and elites to raise wages. The sheer fact that the debate took place reflects the administration's need to play catch-up in a race that is almost won by Nafta's opponents. The best opportunity for winning support for the agreement was during the negotiations on the side accords on environment and labour. But those accords were not strong enough to win over influential members like Congressman Richard Gephardt, the majority leader. Instead, the administration is caught up in nerve-wracking last minute efforts which seem only Sisyphean. No such thing as free treaty, Page 19</p>

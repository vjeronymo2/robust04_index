			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PETITIONS BATTLE OVER SCHOOL MOVE;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: PARENTS PROTEST PLAN TO RELOCATE UCLA EXPERIMENTAL SCHOOL IN SANTA  MONICA. BUT SOME RESIDENTS ARE SUPPORTING THE MOVE.  </P> <P> The controversy over the plan to move UCLA's experimental elementary school  into the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District turned Monday's Santa  Monica school board meeting into a battle of petitions.  </P> <P> Parents protesting the relocation presented a petition with more than 2,000  signatures, stating that moving the Corinne A. Seed University Elementary  School into a public school system would compromise research at the school.  </P> <P> A Santa Monica resident also presented a petition to the board supporting the  move.  </P> <P> The school, commonly referred to by the acronym UES, is California's only  remaining laboratory school. Free of state education requirements and a local  school board, it tests new teaching techniques and philosophies on its  students.  </P> <P> The petition said the site proposed for the school, a portion of Los Amigos  Park in the city's Ocean Park area, would result in a loss of irreplaceable  open space.  </P> <P> Shayna Roosevelt, 10, and three other UES students read a student petition to  the school board, noting that the school's idyllic nine-acre site at UCLA  provides "special places to be alone" and for "talking behind trees." The  students said they fear their teachers will quit if the school is moved.  </P> <P> Consideration of the move started more than a year ago, when UCLA disclosed  plans to build a new graduate business school on part of the laboratory  school's site. UCLA announced last month that it will proceed with the move.  </P> <P> The state and the Santa Monica-Malibu school district must approve the plan  before the move occurs.  </P> <P> The school board, which will not vote on the move until a contract has been  worked out, has assured UCLA that the university would retain full control over  UES, Supt. Eugene Tucker has said. Within the next couple of months the  district and UCLA staff will issue an "accurate statement of the educational  advantages of moving the school," he said Monday.  </P> <P> Ocean Park resident Anna McDonnell gave the board a petition with 73 signatures  supporting the move, which she said had been gathered in one afternoon, and she  promised to collect more. She said she was annoyed by numerous flyers that have  been left at her door by UES parents.  </P> <P> "The people who're opposed (to the move) are very organized. . . . (But) it  doesn't accurately reflect the way Ocean Park residents feel," she said later.  </P> <P> The school board authorized Tucker to work with the UES admissions committee on  recruiting 4-year-olds from low-income families in Ocean Park to attend UES at  no cost to the parents, regardless of whether the school moves. The laboratory  school is interested in enrolling up to 15 such children in September to help  diversify its student body, Tucker said.  </P></p>

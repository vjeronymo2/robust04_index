			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: US effect puts LIT Pounds 1m in red LIT Holdings, the marketing services, investment and fund management group, swung from profits of Pounds 1.29m to losses of Pounds 1.21m pre-tax for the year to end-December. Operating profits of Johnson Fry, the UK financial services activity, rose from Pounds 2.4m to a record Pounds 2.81m. However, LIT America, the provider of market services to the US futures and options markets, ran up a loss of Pounds 50,000. This compared with profits of Pounds 2.39m previously. A provision of Pounds 1.8m against doubtful receivables at LIT America was taken above the line. Last month it was announced that agreement in principle had been reached for the sale of LIT America to Spear Leeds &amp; Kellogg, a New York-based securities firm. Consideration will be in cash and loan notes. Proceeds of the cash element will be used to reduce indebtedness, which at the year-end stood at Pounds 11.3m. Group turnover for 1992 totalled Pounds 76.9m (Pounds 81.5m). Central charges were cut from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 2.1m. Losses per share emerged at 6.8p (1.4p). The directors said the preliminary results had been prepared without regard to the possible financial effects of the proposed sale of LIT America or the proposed capital reconstruction.</p>

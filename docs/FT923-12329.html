			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / People: Constructive careers Terry Wood (above left), md of Try Build, has been appointed a director of TRY GROUP. ***** Robert Neill (above right), formerly marketing director of Norwest Holst Construction, has been appointed marketing director of HIGGS &amp; HILL's UK construction division. ***** Roy Harrison has been promoted to md of TARMAC's building materials division; he succeeds Derrick Sims who is retiring. ***** Charles Denny, chairman and chief executive of McLAUGHLIN &amp; HARVEY, is retiring; Andy Stoddart has been appointed group md. Derek McClune is also to retire. ***** John Gains and Bill Reid have been appointed to the board of JOHN MOWLEM. ***** Malcolm Jardine has been appointed md of ALRED McALPINE INTERNATIONAL. He spent 29 years with French Kier which merged with Beazer in 1986 and became director of Beazer Europe and overseas, but left when Beazer was taken over by Hanson. Bob Kottler moves from Tarmac to become a director of Alfred McAlpine International. ***** John Cassidy, formerly deputy chairman of Barrett Developments and more recently a non-executive director of WAIN GROUP, has been appointed group finance director. Stephen Owen, group financial controller also becomes company secretary in place of David Ince who remains finance director of Wainhomes (Chester). ***** David Walton, formerly md of David Wilson Homes, has been appointed md of BELLWAY HOMES Wessex and West division. ***** Every US investor knows Nasdaq. But overseas the name of the fast growing US over-the-counter market is less well known, and Ellen Hipschman, a 37-year-old American marketing consultant, has been given the job of putting this right. Hipschman has been appointed marketing director of Nasdaq International, the London arm of The Nasdaq Stock Market which ranks third in size after the New York and Tokyo stock exchanges. She replaces Isobel Carter, a former London stock exchange official, who left to join Chase Manhattan's global custody business in March. After graduating from the University of California, Hipschman worked for Applied Survey Research and Fairchild Semiconductor before joining consultants Regis McKenna, first in Silicon Valley and most recently in London. Apart from getting Nasdaq's name better known outside the US, Hipschman's job will involve persuading overseas companies to list their shares on Nasdaq and encourage greater use of Nasdaq International's market for trading US securities during the European time zone.</p>

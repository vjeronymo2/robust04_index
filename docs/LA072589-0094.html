			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> LOOKING AT DANCE IN A LITERALLY DIFFERENT LIGHT  </P> <P> Modern dance fans who flock to Three's Company's summer Lo-Tec concerts have  learned to look at dance in a different light. But, last weekend, visiting  choreographer Heidi Duckler moved the concert to a nearby parking lot and  turned the lights down even lower to drive home a point on perspective.  </P> <P> The evening began on a traditional note -- with Duckler's dancers doing  excerpts from a full-length work by their resident choreographer. Then, about  halfway through the evening, the entire audience was ushered out of the studio  and directed to the parking lot for a decidedly nontraditional experience.  </P> <P> It was there that the crowd was introduced to Duckler's special brand of Lo-Tec  dance, a site-specific work lighted by automobile headlights. By the time the  audience had assembled on the opposite side of the performing area, the six  dancers, decked out in resort wear and sunglasses, were already languishing on  beach chairs. And they "danced" most of the piece without removing themselves  from the chairs lined up along the brick wall of the adjacent building.  </P> <P> It was tongue-in-cheek all the way as "Sight Specific" poked fun at the  superficiality of a tourist's-eye view of the world. Even the spectators got  into the act when the dancers turned their instant cameras on the crowd --  snapping pictures of the ogling audience. Like the target of their satire, the  dancers seemed oblivious to the real nature of the event.  </P> <P> If the comic theater piece seemed oddly out of place in an asphalt parking lot,  that was the ironic edge to the message: that tourists soak up the sun without  ever ingesting the true cultural experience. On a broader scale,  "Sight-Specific" lampooned the quirky inaccuracies of perception.  </P> <P> The eight sets of headlights that surrounded both the dancers and the audience  threw more than enough light on the subject, and added a touch of the macabre  that would have been difficult to duplicate indoors. They may never replace  standard lighting instruments, but the automobile lights did have a fascinating  effect.  </P> <P> The studio-bound dances that shared the evening with Duckler's outdoor novelty  were much more traditional. Three's Company billed the concert as a "split  evening," and it was -- in more ways than one. In addition to its double venue,  it was divided between two very different dance makers.  </P> <P> Duckler's part of the program included two excerpts from her full-length  "Ancient Terrain." The short curtain-raiser might have suffered by being seen  out of context, but it seemed more interesting for its Day-Glo costumes  (uncredited on the program) than for its symbolic or kinetic thrust. And the  score was so over-amplified as to be grating.  </P> <P> The meatier second segment, which showed off the company's technique, was  weightlessly buoyant and strong in its imagery. The opening solo had Duckler  rising from behind a rock, like a mermaid emerging from the ocean. And the  dance continued to ebb and flow through most of its ensemble maneuvers. Only  when the dance grew too literal did it seem pretentious or forced.  </P> <P> Tucked into the first part of the program was a brief solo, danced and  choreographed by Lorna Dunn, a long-limbed, limber dancer who is an intern with  Three's Company this summer. "New Moon" made its strongest statement with a  dark silhouette of Dunn set against an eerie, red-lit backdrop. Borrowed  Graham-esque images pervaded the piece as the dance unfolded, but Dunn proved  she could command the spotlight.  </P> <P> After intermission, a group of nine Three's Company interns took part in a  work-in-progress by Lar Lubovitch soloist Rick Michalek. Michalek titled the  piece "Studies for a Duet," and it was obvious that the budding choreographer  was cataloguing permutations on the two-dancer theme. However, few of the  couplings he created for this concert were particularly interesting or  inventive, and the dancers would have benefited from a little more rehearsal  time.  </P> <P> Saturday night's performance played to a packed house -- the biggest crowd of  this Lo-Tec season. In fact, many gung-ho dance watchers were forced to squat  on floor mats in front of the grandstands. But that didn't seem to dampen their  enthusiasm for this unusual mixed bill.  </P> <P> Next week, the San Jose-based Margaret Wingrove Dance Company makes its San  Diego debut, and Shawn Womack, a visiting workshop instructor from Ohio,  unveils a new work for five Three's Company interns.  </P></p>

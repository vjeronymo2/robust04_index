			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: UK housing association launches Pounds 50m debenture PEABODY TRUST, a UK housing association, added to the supply of secured bonds in the domestic market with a Pounds 50m, 25-year debenture issue. The bonds, secured on housing estates in London, have a coupon of 10 1/4 per cent and were priced yesterday to yield 165 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent gilts due 2017. The money is being raised in part to help finance the purchase of empty housing, part of government initiatives launched last year. It will also be used to repay existing bank debt. Covenants in the issue include provisions that allow investors greater access to information about the company. This and similar covenants in other recent issues have been prompted by concern at the failure of a debenture issue from London &amp; Provincial, which was repaid early at less than face value.</p>

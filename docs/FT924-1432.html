			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Trade talks season likely to come to end INTERNATIONAL trade negotiators are today expected to call a halt to the pre-Christmas push for a breakthrough in the Uruguay Round of talks on global trade liberalisation. Many are voicing frustration at the slow progress made in recent weeks, while others are casting doubt over whether a successful result is achievable. Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has called a meeting today of the top-level Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC), at which he is expected to 'close the negotiating season'.

The US official said that France's actions 'call into question the status of much of the EC's overall negotiating position'. EC negotiators were swift to challenge Mr Dumas' claims, insisting they had a full and unequivocal mandate to negotiate a Uruguay Round deal. They said the offers tabled this week were aimed at achieving a 'global, balanced package' (one of the few phrases they shared in common with Mr Dumas). They called the offers 'illustrative', confiding that there was scope for them to be improved if better offers came from other countries, in particular Japan. One Community official insisted that it was still possible to complete the talks by the beginning of March, when the expiry of US fast track authority would put progress in jeopardy: 'I feel it can still be done.'</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Report of its death an exaggeration: The conservative revolution could still have further to turn Looking back, global changes in political mood seem too obvious to miss. At least two shifts stand out since 1945. The first, in the early 1960s, marked the end of the grey, cautious postwar years and the coming of age of a confident, socially progressive generation. But the high spirits soon fizzled out amid the economic troubles of the 1970s, creating space for the conservative revolution of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. It is tempting to argue that a third shift is now under way. In the US, the election of Mr Bill Clinton has drawn a line under 12 years of conservative presidential rule. Against the odds, Mr John Major has clung on to power in Britain, but his government seems in almost as much disarray as the defeated US Republicans. It seems an age since the late 1980s when a triumphant Mrs Thatcher, promising to go 'on and on and on', launched a blitzkrieg of market-oriented reforms, affecting just about all parts of society, from healthcare and education to law. The 'economic miracles' of the 1980s seem equally distant. In much of the industrialised world, the most obvious legacies of free-market economics are deflating asset prices and excessive levels of debt. In the UK, a government that once proclaimed the importance of fiscal probity finds itself running some of the biggest deficits in British history. In the US, the changes are just as striking. The Reagan/ Bush 'supply-side' theory that tax cuts would revitalise the economy without creating deficits is discredited. Mr Clinton's 'people first' economics, involving large public investments in areas such as education and training, healthcare and infrastructure, is rapidly becoming the new orthodoxy. The affluent are bracing themselves for higher taxes. It would be too hasty, however, to conclude that the conservative revolution is over. The 1980s appear to have changed attitudes, perhaps for good, in many countries. Asked to cite a viable alternative to free-market capitalism, democratic socialists used to shout 'Sweden', which for decades had grown rapidly despite the claims on resources of a large and intrusive state. But Sweden is now trying to move into the European main stream by curbing welfare spending, cutting tax rates and subjecting the government sector to market disciplines. And if you look beyond the industrialised world, there seems no question that free-market doctrines are gaining ground. There is a fierce debate about how best to reform the economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. But the goals are less often questioned: few doubt the importance of establishing a functioning market system in which industry responds to the demands of consumers rather than vice versa. The collapse of state communism, moreover, has helped undermine confidence in large bureaucracies everywhere. A less celebrated, but nearly as startling, transformation is under way in the third world, where many countries, disillusioned with the socialist-style economic planning introduced after the second world war, are relying more heavily on market-oriented policies. If the economic reforms gathering momentum in China are taken into account, there seems no question that the world as a whole is moving in a free-market direction. It seems doubtful, moreover, whether the ideological backsliding in rich countries will be maintained. Led by Mr Clinton, the US is likely to fill holes in its social safety net. But the US will be merely catching up with reforms introduced decades ago elsewhere, not blazing a new trail. Meanwhile, at least two kinds of economic and social change may increase the role of the market: Fears in the 1950s and 1960s that giant monopolistic companies would gradually dominate all areas of economic life seem unfounded. In many sectors - personal computers, for example - rapid technological change appears to favour smaller, more flexible companies. Efficient production, moreover, may no longer require the physical presence of huge numbers of workers. In knowledge-intensive industries, 'telecommuting' from home is becoming practicable for increasing numbers of employees. Putting these trends together, it seems at least possible that the era of corporate giants offering lifetime employment is drawing to a close. Yet if more people work in small companies or as independent contractors, the proportion of economic activity governed by market transactions, rather than bureaucratic interaction within large organisations, is likely to rise. Steady growth in per capita incomes may result in higher demand for private social services as people grow increasingly frustrated with the standardised services offered by the state. Indeed there may be a natural 'life cycle' for the public sector. Following industrialisation, the state grows rapidly to provide poor and middle-class families with services - such as education, healthcare and pensions - that they cannot afford to buy privately and which were previously the preserve of a rich elite. But as a rising proportion of the population achieves the prosperity once enjoyed by the few, more families become capable of meeting their needs privately. Demand for private education, for example, is likely to continue growing. But a withering of the state as the bulk of the population becomes affluent (by past standards) is not inevitable. It may maintain market share by improving the quality and diversity of its services; and, to the extent that deprivation reflects differences in the relative, rather than absolute, incomes of rich and poor, it will retain a role in reducing inequality. The sheer youth of the conservative revolution is a further reason for doubting its early demise. The socialist reaction against market capitalism became a powerful political force toward the end of the 19th century. But socialism was not a one or two-decade wonder. The arguments for greater social and economic equality and more extensive government regulation of (and substitution for) free enterprise dominated political debate throughout the world for the next 70 odd years. Policies, however, adjusted fairly slowly - and with some setbacks. In Britain, the more radical ideas advocated by Fabian socialists at the turn of the century - such as the need for sweeping nationalisation of industry and very high marginal tax rates - were not implemented until after the second world war. But for many decades the direction of social change did not seem in doubt; after 1945 even bastions of free enterprise, such as the US, imposed top income tax rates of about 90 per cent. The conservative revolution of the late 1970s could be merely an interruption of this longer-term 'socialist' trend. But it seems more likely that a natural limiting point was reached - in western democracies as well as former communist countries. By the late 1970s, a case could be made in most countries that big government and high taxes were beginning to exact a price in terms of diminished personal incentives and reduced industrial efficiency. The world is thus probably now tacking back erratically to a revised (and socially more responsible) version of the laisser-faire doctrines of the 19th century. Mr Clinton's victory and the Major government's descent into fuzzy pragmatism are not inconsistent with these deeper forces. Both leaders are less ideological than their predecessors, but neither is seeking a return to the 1970s; the market-oriented reforms of the 1980s will mostly stand. The best analogy is perhaps with the 1950s when right- wingers such as Dwight Eisenhower and Winston Churchill had to accommodate themselves to their times; neither tried to reverse social reforms of the 1930s and 1940s. We are thus still in a conservative era. But the 1990s are a decade of consolidation; people are catching breath after the ideological tumult of the 1980s. Yet if the pace of change in the past century is any guide, the conservative revolution is still in its infancy. Do not be surprised if ideas that seemed to die with the passing of the Reagan/Thatcher era reappear in new - and more outrageous - guises within a few years. We have not, by any means, heard the last from libertarians seeking to 'empower' individuals by abolishing higher rates of tax, rolling back the welfare state and purging the economy of wasteful subsidies.</p>

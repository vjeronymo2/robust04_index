			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax relief on Pibs I BOUGHT 10,000 Bradford and Bingley 11 5/8 Pibs on December 8. The interest dates are January 20 and July 20. The total price included purchase of 141 days' interest at Pounds 449.07 (ie, gross of any tax). I received my interest payment on January 20: Pounds 435.94 (net of 25 per cent tax). I might have to pay higher-rate tax on the interest as well. How do I claim tax relief on the Pounds 449.07 in the original total purchase price? It can be claimed in your next tax return. Ask your tax office for the pamphlet on the accrued-income scheme: IR68. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

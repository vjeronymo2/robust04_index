			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Turks see twin danger for textiles in EU link - John Murray Brown reports on nervousness over the shape of a customs union planned to start in 1995 AS TURKEY and the European Union this week opened the final round of negotiations to achieve a customs union in 1995, a potential flashpoint is emerging in the sensitive area of textiles. With many Turkish industries now urging the government to provide protection beyond the deadline, clothes and cloth manufacturers are worried that Brussels may use this as a pretext to retain quotas on textiles. Theoretically, a customs union requires both sides to remove tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, which would mean the reduction of Turkish import duties to zero and the lifting of EC textile quotas. Turkey would also have to adopt the Union's common external tariff (CET) for third countries and fall into line with EU trade policies. But textiles could suffer doubly if they remained restrained from expanding export markets in the EU, while also facing renewed competition at home from EU imports as barriers came down. Mr Okan Oguz, chairman of the Garment Exporters' Association says this could 'kill off large parts of our industry'. The issue is clearly vital for the industry, Turkey's largest foreign exchange earner, with exports worth Dollars 5.3bn in 1992. When first imposed in 1982, quotas only affected cotton yarn, but as Turkish industry has matured, an increasing range of products have faced volume curbs. The EU now places quotas on six textile and 10 apparel categories, from cotton yarn, knitted fabric, T-shirts and knitted outwear. The importance of textiles for Turkey's economy can hardly be overstated. Textiles and apparel production accounts for 14 per cent of Turkey's gross domestic product, over a fifth of manufacturing employment, and 37 per cent of Turkey's export earnings. Equally vital is the role of EU markets. Turkey is the largest supplier to the Union, accounting for 10 per cent of the EU's supplies; conversely, the EU buys 72 per cent of Turkey's total textile exports. Commission officials say they have not received a formal request from Ankara to reschedule the tariff cuts for any of Turkey's so-called vulnerable sectors, although the car industry, consumer electronics and packaged foods have been mustering support in Ankara for a reprieve. Structurally, the textile industry appears ill-suited to mount its own campaign. For one thing, the interests of the two branches of the industry - the textile and apparel manufacturers - are frequently in conflict over customs union. Textile or fabric producers could well benefit from the adoption of the Union's protectionist policies towards third countries. For example, last year, Turkey took action against Pakistan over cotton yarn imports in what was the first known case of an anti-dumping action by one developing country against another. With a customs union, Turkish producers will have the full EU negotiating muscle behind them. As one textile manufacturer saw the prospect, 'this is a gift from God'. However, for the apparel sector, restrictions on Pakistani or other cheap imported cotton will merely add to garment producers' costs. Officials point out that Pakistan last year shipped 8,500 tonnes of cotton yarn to Turkey, while Pakistan's current quota into the EU as a whole is only 9,000 tonnes. Another concern of the apparel producers, is that, while they account for the lion's share of textile exports - apparels were worth more than Dollars 4bn in 1992 - they have little political clout, comprising as they do some 10,000 small and medium size businesses. And yet it is the apparel companies which will be most vulnerable to increased import competition once a customs union is in place. With Turkish import levies at around 40 per cent, few EU fashion houses have penetrated the Turkish market. The value of EU garment sales to Turkey last year was worth a mere Dollars 36m, according to the Garment Exporters' Association. But with a customs union, EU products will be able to enter Turkey duty free. Marks and Spencer, the UK stores group, last month announced it was looking for a franchise partner to market clothes imported from the UK. And Turkey's youthful and increasingly brand-conscious population is likely to attract other international names. Turkey's own branded products such as Vakko and Beymen could find themselves under severe pressure. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the European commissioner in charge of customs, in a speech in Istanbul last month, was careful not to commit herself on quotas. The issue will ultimately be decided by the member states, not the Commission. But it is no secret that Portugal, and to a lesser extent Spain, would be only too happy to see restrictions retained on Turkish imports.</p>

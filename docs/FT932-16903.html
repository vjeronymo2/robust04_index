			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / La Scala upset over top job THE Italian cultural establishment, reeling from accusations of financial mismanagement and alleged corruption, is set for a further blow with the likely imposition of a special administrator at Milan's La Scala opera house. The threat follows the decision by a regional appeals court in the province of Lombardy to accept a claim by an splinter union group that the July 1990 appointment of Mr Carlo Fontana, La Scala's new superintendant, to a four-year term, was illegal. The case is the latest round in a running battle between Milan's famous theatre and various dissident workers, who have taken a variety of legal steps against its management. The latest twist comes at a particularly sensitive time for La Scala, and for Italy's arts world in general. La Scala has suffered this season from critical attacks on Luciano Pavarotti, the tenor whose first-night performance in Verdi's opera Don Carlos was given a less than rapturous reception by many in the sophisticated audience. Subsequent performances went well but Pavarotti's relationship with the opera house has grown more strained since his last-minute decision to pull out of performances in I Pagliacci, which opened this week. Other leading Italian opera houses have also been no strangers to financial or management disputes lately.</p>

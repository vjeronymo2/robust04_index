			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITAN WOMEN SWEEP NORTHRIDGE BEHIND BRYANT, VAN DORTRECHT  </P> <P> Anjie Bryant and Ann Van Dortrecht each pitched three-hit shutouts as Cal State  Fullerton swept Cal State Northridge, 4-0 and 1-0, in a nonconference softball  doubleheader Sunday at Northridge.  </P> <P> In the opener, Bryant, a sophomore left-hander, struck out two and allowed only  two balls out of the infield.  </P> <P> The Titans (2-0) scored three runs in the first inning and added another in the  fourth.  </P> <P> Fullerton loaded the bases in the first on two walks and a hit batter off  Northridge's Heather Lindstrom.  </P> <P> Debra Ann Hartwig's single and an error by left fielder Pam Smith quickly  cleared the bases, however, giving Fullerton all the runs it would need.  </P> <P> Fullerton collected four runs, two unearned, and five hits in four innings  against Lindstrom.  </P> <P> Fullerton scored its only run of the second game on Missy Coombes' first-inning  single. Van Dortrecht struck out nine and walked only one. RALPH NICHOLS  </P></p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Management: Burying the office in paperwork A new month approaches and wads of computer print-outs from the personnel department are hitting managers' desks throughout the UK. With the spread of computerised personnel systems, which are often linked to payroll systems, the potential for collecting, storing and disseminating information on employees is vast. Apart from basic data on staff numbers and how much they cost, information may also be stored on training and productivity. The problem is that many personnel departments appear to be churning out reports and sending them to managers with little or no consultation. A new study by the University of Sussex-based Institute of Manpower Studies* finds that managers either throw away the reports, or have to wade through reams of irrelevant material before alighting on the figures they need. In a survey of 200 managers conducted by IMS, nearly a third of managers were either very dissatisfied or dissatisfied with the type of information they received from the personnel department. Best provided were data on staff numbers and their pay and benefits; the provision of data on productivity, absence and skill levels were all identified as needing improvement. A recurring theme in the report is lack of communication between those producing and receiving information. IMS found that the personnel systems managers it interviewed for the study were focused almost entirely on 'the system'. Most were planning to incorporate more data and some were thinking of a new system. Not many mentioned more communication with managers as a future priority. *The Information Gap: a human resource management view by Iris Morgan. IMS report 246, 1993.

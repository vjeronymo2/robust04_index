			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Change to Low End of RVP Valid Range in the Simple Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The low end of the valid range for RVP in the Simple Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was based on the distribution of data used in the model's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development, as well as a consideration of the needs of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping programs under the Simple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model. Since VOC emission reductions under the Simple Model are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished primarily through limits on maximum RVP levels, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valid range for RVP in the Simple Model only affects toxics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance calculations. In promulgating the final regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency determined that refiners had no incentive to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RVP below 6.6 psi for the purposes of complying with the toxics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards since reductions in fuel benzene and aromatics are much  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more effective in reducing emissions of toxic compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast to the Simple Model, the absence of RVP caps and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the impact of other fuel parameters on emissions under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Complex Model will likely result in large variations in RVP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels in reformulated gasoline. RVP control will continue to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the primary mechanism through which VOC emissions are reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because RVP is the most cost-effective fuel parameter to control,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and because the RVP effect on VOC in the Complex Model is quite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large. As in the Simple Model, the valid range for RVP in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Complex Model was determined from an examination of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of data used in the model's development and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs of the reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The low end of the valid range was set at 6.4 psi to accommodate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large reductions in RVP while maintaining the accuracy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Complex Model. Fuel RVPs are expected to reach this low level in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Phase II of the reformulated gasoline program, and the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists for them to be reached in Phase I as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California has been developing its own program in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated gasoline must meet more stringent requirements than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the federal program during the years 1996 and 1997 that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Simple Model will be in effect. Given California's more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent requirements, the potential exists for fuel having an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RVP of less than 6.6 psi to be either sold or used as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blendstock in and outside of California. With the low end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valid range for RVP set at 6.6 psi, these California reformulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasolines might not be certifiable as federal reformulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline. Also, refiners trying to blend down tanks quickly at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminals in the spring to meet summer volatility requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may end up with fuels that have RVPs as low as 6.4 psi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the low end of the valid range for RVP under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Complex Model is 6.4 psi, the Agency has determined that the low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of the valid range for RVP under the Simple Model should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likewise be 6.4 psi. The change from 6.6 psi to 6.4 psi makes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the low end of the valid range for RVP consistent throughout  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Phase I of the federal reformulated gasoline program, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides an additional element of flexibility for refiners to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complement the already established blending and enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tolerances. The change should have no effect on the environment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since presumably only cleaner fuels would be allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification under the Simple Model. Both the Simple and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Complex Models are linear with respect to RVP for all pollutants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and this linear relationship would simply be extended from 6.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> psi down to 6.4 psi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Change to High End of Aromatics Valid Range in the Simple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It was and is the intention of the Agency to avoid, to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent possible, establishing regulations which require refiners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reformulate their conventional fuels. The anti-dumping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program is designed to ensure that a refiner's or importer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conventional gasoline stays as clean as it was in 1990, and does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not require reformulation beyond those levels. Thus the valid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range limits for conventional gasoline in both the Simple and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Complex Models were designed to be as wide as possible while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simultaneously ensuring the accuracy of the models. As an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional level of flexibility, the Agency also allowed for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extension of the valid range for conventional gasoline if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refiner's individual 1990 baseline fuel exceeded the specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valid range limits (see discussion in Section II.B. below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

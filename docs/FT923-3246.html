			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Syndicated Loans: Sweden faces a testing time over credit standing SWEDEN'S credit standing in the international financial community will be tested this week as foreign banks ponder whether to support its Ecu8bn syndicated loan, announced on Friday. Like the UK the week before, Sweden is borrowing heavily to support its currency in the face of the turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The success of its deal will be a pointer to other countries which are said also to have considered foreign borrowing to defend their currencies. 'If it doesn't go well, other countries will start to get worried about what it will cost them to do the same thing,' said one large US bank considering whether to participate in the Swedish deal. In many ways, the transaction has powerful attractions. Sweden has not come to the international markets since 1989, so its loan will be snatched up by banks wanting to develop their relationship with the country. It was also generally considered on Friday to be well priced. The yield to participating banks was put by one bank at nearly 20 basis points (0.2 percentage points) over London interbank offered rate (Libor), compared with 10 basis points on the UK deal. Given that the loan is zero-weighted for capital purposes, this was widely seen as a good price for a three-year facility. However, concerns about Sweden's credit standing overshadowed the loan at the end of last week. The country has a AAA credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's and a Aa1 rating from Moody's. But after the recent events banks are likely to think hard about increasing their exposure to the country before its economic prospects become clearer. 'There will be credit officers in many banks who have sat up in the past week and said, 'what is happening in Sweden?'' said another big international bank. That could lead banks to freeze their limits to Sweden in the short term, he said. Sweden also drew heavily at the end of last week on two standby banking facilities, totalling Dollars 3.4bn, to support its currency. JP Morgan said it would be approaching the National Debt Office's close relationship banks over the next few days with the aim of putting together a group of lead managers, and it hoped to syndicate the deal among about 30 banks. It added that some banks had already shown an interest in participating. The loan consists of two parts. The first is an Ecu3bn 364-day loan which will be used immediately, and carries a margin of 10 basis points over Libor. The second part is an Ecu5bn three-year multi-currency revolving credit, with a margin of 18.75 basis points over Libor and a commitment fee of 10 basis points on the undrawn portion. The Kingdom of Spain is planning to come to the capital markets this week. It talked to investment bankers in London last week about a Dollars 2bn Eurobond issue.</p>

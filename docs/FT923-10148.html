			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Novo calls for Pounds 9m Novo Group yesterday announced a sharp rise in profits, an Pounds 8.8m rights issue to help fund a Pounds 3.3m acquisition, and a capital reorganisation. For the 12 months to March 31 profits at the pre-tax level rose to Pounds 1.08m helped by the acquisition in April 1991 of Novo Communications for Dollars 14m. Turnover amounted to Pounds 12.8m. The figures compared with Pounds 158,000 and Pounds 9.45m for the preceding 18 months. Earnings were 10.1p (1.44p). The underwritten rights issue is of 29.38m new ordinary shares on a 16-for-3 basis at 30p per share. The directors said the 'geographical mix of the group's earnings and its unwieldy loan structure' had combined to prevent it paying its preference dividends. The ordinary payment is therefore omitted - a 1.6p total was paid for 1991.</p>

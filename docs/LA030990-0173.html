			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWS OF ELDORADO'S PLAN TO BUY SURPRISES AMERICAN INTERSTATE  </P> <P> Eldorado Bancorp, one of Orange County's largest and most profitable banks,  Thursday announced a proposal to buy American Interstate Bank of Newport Beach  in a stock transaction valued at $5.8 million.  </P> <P> But American Interstate said in a statement late Thursday that it had received  "no proposal upon which it could act," and Chairman Franklyn D. Jeans said he  was "flabbergasted" by the Eldorado announcement.  </P> <P> J. B. Crowell, president and chief executive of Eldorado, said the two  institutions had been talking for several months and that he hopes to have a  positive response from the American Interstate board of directors within  several days.  </P> <P> But Jeans said Crowell had simply given him an unsigned letter outlining the  proposal when the two had lunch together in late February, and that the  American Interstate board had decided that it was not interested in a merger at  this time.  </P> <P> "I told Crowell that we had discussed it but that we were concentrating on  building our own institution, and I thought that was the end of it," Jeans  said. "When I saw the press release, I damned near fell out of my chair."  </P> <P> Crowell could not be reached for a response late Thursday, but Eldorado chief  financial officer David Brown said: "I hope they're analyzing (the proposal)  carefully. It doesn't sound like they spent much time with it."  </P> <P> Brown said a "letter of intent" was sent to American Interstate on Thursday. He  also said Eldorado had talked with some American Interstate shareholders who  were interested in the deal and that Eldorado would "like to sit down and talk"  with the American Interstate board.  </P> <P> Jeans said he had received only another letter from Crowell along with the  press release, not what he would consider a bona fide proposal.  </P> <P> Gerry Findley, an Orange County banking consultant, said a deal "may make a lot  of sense for both sides." He called Eldorado "an excellent bank" with an excess  of capital and a need for faster growth and said that American Interstate  offers some solid assets.  </P> <P> Eldorado has over the past several years bought American Security Bank of San  Bernardino, the Bank of Indio, and American Merchant Bank of Newport Beach. It  now operates eight branches and has assets of $276.6 million.  </P> <P> But Eldorado's 1988 effort to merge with Landmark Bancorp of La Habra -- a deal  that would have created the largest banking company in Orange County -- did not  come to fruition. A deal in which Citizen Holdings of Newport Beach would have  purchased Eldorado also fell through in 1988.  </P> <P> American Interstate, formerly known as American State Bank, experienced  difficulties through much of the 1980s, after recovering from a brush with  insolvency at the beginning of the decade. The bank operates two branches, one  in Newport Beach and one in Orange; it has assets of $66.4 million.  </P> <P> Crowell said that although Eldorado also has branches in those two cities, each  is on the other side of town. "They would fit very nicely into our network of  branches," he said. "We feel we can take the assets (of American Interstate)  and bring better bottom-line results. We've done that with our other three"  acquisitions.  </P> <P> Eldorado's transaction proposal calls for Eldorado to issue 0.325 new shares of  stock for each outstanding share of American Interstate. American Interstate  would then be merged into Eldorado.  </P> <P> Many small banking institutions are seeking to expand their bases to prepare  for the increase in competition expected when interstate banking is allowed  next year in the state. Jeans said there have been a lot of informal merger  discussions taking place because of that.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MERGER CANDIDATES  </P> <P> </P> <P> ELDORADO BANCORP  </P> <P> Year ends Dec. 31.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:1.78IN:1.78IN:1.78IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (in millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Assets  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $276.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $250.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $199.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $180.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net income (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $ 3.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $ 3.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Number of Employees: 180  </P> <P> Number of Branches: 8  </P> <P> Shares outstanding: 2,761,703  </P> <P> 1990 High/Low:: 15.38/14.25  </P> <P> Wednesday's close (AMEX): $14.50  </P> <P> </P> <P> AMERICAN INTERSTATE BANK  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:1.89IN:1.67IN:1.67IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (in millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Assets  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $60.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $57.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $61.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $55.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net income (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> (-0.54)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.65  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.43  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.02  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Number of employees: 38  </P> <P> Number of branches: 2  </P> <P> Shares outstanding: 1,226,923  </P> <P> Latest close (OTC): $3.00  </P> <P> * For nine months ending Sept. 30, 1989  </P> <P> Source: The Findley Reports, Eldorado Bancorp  </P></p>

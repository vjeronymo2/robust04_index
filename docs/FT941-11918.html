			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Armed resistance to S Africa poll feared: Without a deal, right-wingers could turn to force This is an ominous week for South Africa. Within days, the odds are that conservative Zulus or right-wing Afrikaners, or both, will begin a campaign to resist April's all-race elections, by force of arms. In this land of political miracle, where apartheid was ended not through war but through negotiation, a last-minute deal is still possible. But if there is no deal, the right-wing Freedom Alliance, including the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party, the white right Afrikaner Volksfront and other right wing groups, will almost certainly commit itself to fight. Thus, South Africa will have taken an irrevocable step to a civil conflict which could prevent peace for years to come, and bedevil or destroy its nascent democracy. South Africans react to the threat variously: some mutter about Bosnian-style civil wars; others dismiss it with disdain, certain a new government will crush the right. It is not easy to gauge the exact magnitude of the threat. But certain facts are clear: 'We don't have any soldiers,' says a member of the KwaZulu civil service simply, highlighting the limited military options available to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, head of the KwaZulu government (he denies he has any military intentions, but warns transparently of the 'risk' of civil war). With no army, no heavy weapons such as armoured cars, artillery and aircraft, and with KwaZulu's fragmented geography (it is scattered piecemeal through Natal), it is hard to see Chief Buthelezi fighting an Angolan-style war, using secure bases and quasi-conventional warfare to control large areas. Still, obtaining sophisticated smaller weapons would not be hard, given Natal's long coastline and the ease with which thousands of automatic weapons enter from neighbouring Mozambique. Reports already indicate that missiles and rocket launchers have come in that way, and small arms are readily available: when supporters of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini opened fire in Pretoria last month, in a spontaneous show of militancy, hardly a man among the thousands present did not have a pistol or automatic weapon. Lack of training would also hamper Inkatha: the 4,000-strong KwaZulu police force is loyal to Chief Buthelezi, but it is hard to know how many would leave the force to fight in the hills once the KwaZulu force is reintegrated into the South African police. In traditional areas of Zululand, all adult males belong to an 'impi' or war party, but they fight mainly with assegais (short spears) and knobkerries (battle mallets). Though two well-placed sources have confirmed white right-wingers are training Zulu self-defence units in sabotage and terrorism, this does not involve large numbers. Funding could prove problematic, though Chief Buthelezi has several rich backers overseas. If conventional civil war is unlikely, Inkatha could lead a guerrilla conflict which would fester for years, undermining stability in Natal. A new government could probably crush such resistance in the townships around Johannesburg, where it is confined to migrant workers' hostels which an ANC government would not hesitate to raze. But in Natal, the already bad security situation could get worse. 'He's got a formidable support base if they remain firm, and that's a chilling thought,' one senior Natal provincial official said. 'If he decides to be a disruptive force he can create a tremendous lot of havoc. The Zulus potentially have far more destructive force than the white right, because they can afford to make their people cannon fodder, which the right cannot.' South Africa's worst nightmare would be joint resistance by the white and black right, with right-wing whites providing commanders, training, strategic planning, and perhaps even heavy weaponry from SA Defence Force armouries, using Inkatha as the 'cannon fodder'. Such a force could disrupt the crucial rail line to Durban port, the main port for the Johannesburg area. No one knows how many trained military men the white right could count on for such resistance: the top ranks of the SADF are firmly committed to the new government; but among the various part-time, locally based forces and reservists, which total up to 450,000 men, support is unclear. Even if most of the right wing's threats are mere bluster, enough true militants probably exist to cause considerable disruption, and to prevent elections altogether in certain areas (the poll will go ahead nonetheless, and international election observers seem determined to declare the election 'free and fair'). So the ANC's choice will be to split the right now, a strategy they have pursued for months, or try to crush it after the elections. Either way, prospects are grim. In the words of the police commander for the Natal midlands: 'We will have such a mess, if they (the right) do not take part, then it will be, in the words of (former President) John Vorster, too ghastly to contemplate.'</p>

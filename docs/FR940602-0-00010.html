			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS has determined, in general, not to require additional assurances from domestic applicants. The OTS currently seeks all information needed to consider holding company applications, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has promulgated regulations and issued forms that require savings and loan holding companies to file information with the OTS on a regular basis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and has broad authority under section 10(b) of the HOLA to examine savings and loan holding companies and their affiliates. In addition, the OTS has broad authority to investigate and bring enforcement actions against holding companies and other affiliates of savings associations under section 10(g) of the HOLA, as well as other statutory provisions, including section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Nevertheless, section 10(e)(2)(C) gives the OTS broad discretion with respect to the circumstances under which additional assurances may be required, as well as the nature of such assurances, and the OTS may, where appropriate, seek additional assurances regarding the availability of information from an applicant and its affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See OTS Form H-(e) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 12 CFR 584.1 and OTS Forms H-(b)10 and H-(b)11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to holding company applications submitted by foreign acquirors, the OTS has, as a matter of policy, required foreign acquirors to enter into a foreign acquiror agreement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Foreign acquiror agreements generally state,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that the foreign acquiror (i) voluntarily consents to United States jurisdiction for purposes of laws relating to United States depository institutions, (ii) shall designate agents in the United States for service of process, and (iii) shall permit the OTS to examine it to such extent as the Director may prescribe. In addition, as a policy matter, the OTS and its predecessor, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, have generally required foreign acquirors to establish a United States holding company as the direct holding company of the acquired savings association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the OTS has required foreign acquirors that attempt to rebut a rebuttable determination of control under 12 CFR 574.4(b) and 574.4(e) to file a foreign acquiror agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS will continue to require foreign acquirors to enter into foreign acquiror agreements, but will not require further assurances as a general matter. As noted above, the OTS, where appropriate in the context of a particular application, may seek additional assurances from a foreign acquiror that it will make information available to the OTS concerning itself or its affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of applications involving a foreign bank, the OTS will consider whether the bank is subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis by the appropriate authorities in the foreign bank's home country. In the proposal, the OTS requested comment on the standards to be applied in this area, and on whether the OTS should subject foreign bank holding companies to the same requirement. As the statute refers only to foreign banks, the final rule, as was the case with the proposal, refers only to foreign banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) implementing section 202(a) of the FDICIA set forth the basis on which the Federal Reserve Board will determine whether a foreign bank is subject to ``comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Federal Reserve Board regulation provides that the Federal Reserve Board will determine whether the foreign bank is supervised or regulated in such a manner that its home country supervisor receives sufficient information on the worldwide operations of the foreign bank (including the relationships of the bank to any affiliate) to assess the foreign bank's overall financial condition and compliance with law and regulation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 58 FR 6348, 6360&hyph;6361 (12 CFR 211.24(c)(1)(ii)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulation sets forth certain factors that the Federal Reserve Board will assess, including the extent to which the home country supervisor: Ensures that the foreign bank has adequate procedures for monitoring and controlling its activities worldwide; obtains information on the foreign bank and its subsidiaries and offices outside the home country through regular reports of examination, audit reports, or otherwise; obtains information on the dealings and relationships between the foreign bank and its foreign and domestic affiliates; receives from the foreign bank financial reports that are consolidated on a worldwide basis, or comparable information; and evaluates prudential standards, such as capital adequacy and risk asset exposure, on a worldwide basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

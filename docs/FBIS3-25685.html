			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This morning, President Bongo held discussions with  trade unionists and the business community in Libreville on how  to mitigate the negative effects of the devaluation and the  strikes paralyzing the nation's economic activities. Following  this exceptional meeting, the Gabonese Confederation of Free  Trade Unions [CGSL] has decided to suspend its general strike.  CGSL Secretary General Francis Mayombo talks to Jean de Dieu  Odong Ovono.    [Begin Mayombo recording] After the explanations given by  various parties, the head of state ordered negotiations to  commence swiftly. Thus negotiations will begin this afternoon  at the Ministry of Planning with a view to reviewing prices.  Next week, precisely on 1 March, we shall examine, together  with the same committee, the parity of wage increases.    We are, therefore, suspending our strike in order to  negotiate with the government and to analyze the eventual  increases whose percentages we do not know yet. We shall first  have to negotiate with the government and show evidence of  skyrocketing prices. This will enable us to trigger off a  system of negotiations on the basis of the loss of purchasing  power and the housewife's expenditure. It is only then -- at  the 1 March meeting -- that we shall be clear about the parity  of the increases that will be made. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: 'GYPSY' CARAVAN WINDS UP AT BISTRO FOR POST-SHOW BASH  </P> <P> Arrive fashionably late. Bolt from a limo. Deadpan "for ready money only" when  the paparazzi invites you to stop and smile. Sweep through the bistro door.  Grab a Kir cocktail. Plop in a booth, sigh and pronounce: "What's good about  the living theater is if you don't get it exactly right, they give you the  chance to try again next time."  </P> <P> Tyne Daly is in town, and the doe-eyed star of "Gypsy," which is headed for  Broadway, was reluctant to wax ecstatic about her opening night Tuesday at the  Orange County Performing Arts Center.  </P> <P> "It was hard to feel the room (Segerstrom Hall)," she said at Birraporetti's,  site of the post-performance bash. "But it was my first time. I'll know better  tomorrow. I did take a tour of the theater today and saw there wasn't a bad  seat in the house."  </P> <P> As Daly ("Mama Rose" in the show) chatted with good friend Stephanie Zimbalist,  party guests rhapsodized about her performance.  </P> <P> "She had such intensity on stage," said Thomas Kendrick, president of the  Center board. "She controlled the stage, built her character with the same  intensity she builds Mary Beth Lacey on 'Cagney and Lacey.' "  </P> <P> "I loved Tyne," said Jeanette Lane Bradbury, who played Dainty June to Ethel  Merman's Mama Rose when "Gypsy" opened on Broadway in 1959. "I thought she was  incredible. She didn't act. She was. She knocked me out."  </P> <P> Bradbury, who lives in North Hollywood, confessed that she had few happy  memories from her Great White Way days with Merman. "It was difficult. Merman  was cold. When you acted with her, she looked at your forehead. She didn't  relate. Her whole performance was totally centered around her. She didn't take  anything from anybody, which is so different from Tyne, who lives off everybody  and herself as well."  </P> <P> "Tyne has that role of being a lady-cop type, a dramatist," said Susan Strader,  whose husband, Tim, is a vice chairman of the Center board. "But her comedic  timing and her belt-it-out singing voice are fantastic!"  </P> <P> "I loved the show," said Tim Strader. "The first act was for the ladies. The  second act (with scantily clad female strippers) was for the men!"  </P> <P> Going from a sweet-and-simple type to a svelte stripper "is difficult because  it happens so quickly on stage, in front of everybody," said Crista Moore, who  plays Gypsy Rose Lee in the production. "There's no time to prepare, think, or  wind up to it. But that also makes the part exciting."  </P> <P> As guests and cast members heaped their plates with goodies such as pineapple  pizza and chocolate cake embellished with roses (natch!), pianist Confrey  Phillips entertained with selections from the show. "I played at the  opening-night party for the movie 'Gypsy' when it premiered at the Odeon  theater in London," Phillips recalled. "It was nice to meet Natalie Wood (who  played Gypsy Rose Lee). I always fancied her, thought she was a marvelous,  lovely looking lady."  </P></p>

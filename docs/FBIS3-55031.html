			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Vinogradov ; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] We have just received a statement of the Foreign  Ministry of the Russian Federation, which states: The  leadership of the Russian Federation has received with profound  grief and indignation the report of the brutal murders carried  out in recent days in Tajikistan of Russian-speaking citizens --  a deacon of the Orthodox Church, a whole family including five  children, and a young woman resident of Dushanbe. We are firmly  relying on the fact that the Tajikistan authorities will take  the most energetic measures in investigating what has happened  and in speedily identifying and suitably punishing the  murderers. We also expect that the Government of Tajikistan  will do everything necessary to ensure the security and the  protection of the rights and dignity of the Russian-speaking  citizens of the republic.</p>

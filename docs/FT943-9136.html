			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate moves in Europe hit share prices - Market Report Confidence in the UK equity market was badly shaken yesterday by the moves to higher interest rates in Sweden and Italy, which prompted savage falls in British government bonds. Not even strong gains in regional electrical stocks (recs) could save the FT-SE 100 Index from a fall of 28.8 points to 3,138.2; traders feared that the 3,100 mark could be at hazard this morning if the US bond auction disappoints. Although the  1/2 percentage point rate rises in Sweden and Italy appeared to reflect obvious domestic factors, the reaction across bond and equity markets served to indicate the depth of concern that the interest rate cycle may be on the turn in Europe. The stock market opened higher but this owed much to substantial gains among the recs following what was seen as a price review highly favourable to the companies from the official regulator. Heavy turnover in the recs lifted the Seaq figure well above recent averages for the first hour of trading. But it was clear that the rest of the market was by no means as confident, and that worries over the near term outlook for interest rates continued to plague investors in the UK market. The market had already begun to cool off when the news that Sweden's Riksbank had raised its key rates in order to resist inflationary pressures sent bonds and shares sharply downwards. Increased selling was seen and the investment mood turned distinctly sour. Some hurried selling was seen from fund managers who had not already reduced portfolios of stocks influenced by interest rates. By midsession, nervousness ahead of publication of US data on retail sales and producer prices had increased the market's uncertainty and the Footsie was 34.2 down at 3,132.8. But the US data turned out to be relatively benign, with a rise of 0.5 per cent in the June PPI only just above expectations and, with Wall Street steady at the opening, London markets managed a modest rally. Optimism was quickly extinguished by the rise in Italian interest rates, which was followed by a renewed slide in UK bonds that quickly turned share prices off again. Although the market closed above its lows for the day, traders believed that 'the Footsie was only saved by the bell'. The Dow Average was down 16 points soon after London closed. Feverish dealing in the final half-hour saw heavy selling of calls on the Footsie option and few traders were prepared to be optimistic ahead of the opening of the market this morning. The pressure fell entirely on the blue chip stocks which were the most directly linked to stock index futures and to hurried selling by the institutions. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, helped by a strong contingent of recs stocks, climbed 9.7 to 3,726.9. Some traders have identified significant US demand in the recs sector. Trading volume, boosted by the recs activity and also by trading statements from Shell Transport, BOC and Royal Insurance, rose by 17 per cent from the previous day to 694.4m shares, with non-Footsie business making up around 60 per cent. On Wednesday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.36bn. After the close of trading, market strategists tried to make the best of a painful day. Several argued that yesterday's developments implied no pressure on interest rates in Germany or other leading European countries. The Bundesbank is likely to continue focusing on domestic factors, including domestic money supply, and any rise in German rates is still a long way off. But there was no avoiding the jolt delivered to confidence in UK equities, even among those analysts who have been predicting that base rates could rise before the end of next month.</p>

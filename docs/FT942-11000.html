			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: IBM to restructure marketing operations International Business Machines is realigning its worldwide marketing and sales operations into 14 teams, each addressing a specific industry segment. The change represents the most far-reaching reorganisation at IBM for several decades. IBM will 're-engineer the way we go to market,' said Mr Lou Gerstner, chief executive, in a memo to employees. 'I believe we have to step up our ability to help customers apply technology in their enterprises. Customers need it and want it.' The shift is a central part of Mr Gerstner's plan to return IBM to a satisfactory level of profit, following heavy losses over the past three years and slim profits in the first quarter of this year. The reorganisation represents a fundamental change in IBM's marketing and sales approach. Currently, the 40,000-strong salesforce (excluding an even larger support staff) is organised along geographic lines, under country and regional management. Under the new plan, industry-specific marketing teams will be created to report to worldwide or divisional managers. However, regional sales managers will retain responsibility for product marketing, IBM said. They will co-ordinate the local activities of the industry teams. Traditionally, IBM sales personnel have been generalists - selling everything from typewriter ribbons to mainframe computers. Over recent years, many have become product specialists. Some, within the Application Solutions Division, have specialised in creating information-processing systems for particular industry segments. ASD will play a leadership role in the reorganisation, Mr Gerstner said. With the revamp, IBM sales representatives will become industry experts, or consultants, rather than product sellers. This will require extensive retraining.</p>

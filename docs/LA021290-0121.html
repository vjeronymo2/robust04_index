			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SEN. THURMOND, 87, ANNOUNCES HE WILL RUN FOR HIS 7TH TERM  </P> <P> Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), a living legend in South Carolina and the oldest  member of Congress at 87, announced today that he will be a candidate for a  seventh six-year term.  </P> <P> The senator was accompanied at a series of news conferences across the state by  his wife, Nancy, and key political supporters.  </P> <P> A heavy favorite for reelection -- no Democrat has stepped forward to challenge  him yet -- Thurmond would be 94 at the end of another term, making him the  oldest member of Congress ever. Sen. Theodore Green of Rhode Island was 93 when  he retired in 1961 and Sen. Carl Hayden of Arizona was 91 when he retired in  1969.  </P> <P> Thurmond generally answers questions about his advanced age by pointing to his  daily physical fitness regimen and challenging anyone to find a candidate in  better shape.  </P> <P> The lawmaker, who became the oldest member of Congress when Florida Rep. Claude  Pepper died last year at the age of 88, indicated that his seniority in the  Senate would help him better serve his constituents.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't elect a man just because of his seniority, but if he has all the  other qualifications then it should be counted, and it is very helpful," he  said.  </P> <P> Thurmond is the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.  </P></p>

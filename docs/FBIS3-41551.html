Otto Sumarwoto said that bringing old industrial equipment  into Indonesia will not only cause pollution problems, but will  also be economically inefficient.    ``Moreover, the public's growing concern on environmental  problems will become a threat to the operation of such old  industrial facilities. Their products can, in the long run, be  also completely rejected on the international markets,'' Otto  said referring to the government's new investment policy, which  is partly designed to attract the sunset industries of more  developed nations into Indonesia.    The importation of second hand plant-equipment was  previously  banned in Indonesia, but has been made possible by the new  package. He warned that the government should be more cautious  in licensing such old industries, as their operations will not  only cause environmental problems but also create a high cost  economy.    ``Their operations will not only be inefficient but are also  under a threat in the long term, in line with the public's  growing concern about environmental problems,'' he said.    He said the government should have a long-term perspective  in  drawing a policy so that its negative impacts can be minimized    The government, as part of the deregulatory measures issued  last month, also allows foreign investors to own 100 percent of  the equity of an industrial company producing intermediary  products, raw materials and semi finished products, with paid-up  capital of only U.S. $2 million.    Minister of Industry Tunk Ariwibowo said the move is an  important breakthrough taken by the government to attract the  relocation of industries from more developed nations.    The restriction on the importation of second hand machinery  equipment and other capital goods was abolished as part of the  government's package to encourage the relocation of more  developed nations' industries into the country.    Otto estimated that industries relocated into Indonesia will  survive only within five years because after that period they  will no longer be able to compete due to their rising production  costs.</p>

At present, Customs authority to assess the $30 fee is limited to returned checks presented with respect to noncommercial importations for which no formal entry was required, and other Customs transactions not backed by a Customs bond. The purpose of the proposed change is to enable Customs to recoup the administrative costs incurred in processing all returned checks and other defaulted payments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before May 23, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments (preferably in triplicate) must be submitted to U.S. Customs Service, ATTN: Regulations Branch, Franklin Court, 1301 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20229, and may be inspected at the Regulations Branch, 1099 14th Street, NW., suite 4000, Washington, DC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  David Baker, Office of the Comptroller (202&hyph;927&hyph;0620).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By a document published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as T.D. 92&hyph;73 on August 10, 1992 (57 FR 35458), Customs amended its regulations to establish a $30 charge for each check that is returned by a financial institution to Customs unpaid, if that check was presented either for payment of duties or other charges incurred on noncommercial importations for which a formal entry was not required or for payment in connection with any other transaction not backed by a Customs bond (&sect;24.1(e), Customs Regulations; 19 CFR 24.1(e)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, Customs has not been entirely successful at charging the $30 fee in part because Customs cannot differentiate in a cost effective manner between returned checks made by individuals on noncommercial importations, and those made by commercial entities, which are usually backed by a Customs bond. Moreover, because Customs is only authorized at present to charge the fee in connection with noncommercial importations or other transactions not backed by a Customs bond, Customs is unable to recoup the administrative costs incurred for processing all returned checks and other defaulted payments. In particular, &sect;24.1(e) does not authorize charging the fee for processing defaulted payments made through the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) (see &sect;24.25, Customs Regulations; 19 CFR 24.25).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 24.1(e) was made applicable only to noncommercial importations and other transactions not backed by a Customs bond, primarily because of the availability of liquidated damages in cases where checks were returned unpaid in connection with commercial importations and other transactions which were supported by a bond.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the assessment of liquidated damages does not recoup the administrative costs connected with processing defaulted payments. All liquidated damages collected by Customs are credited to one of the Treasury Department's miscellaneous receipt accounts which cannot be used to defray the expense of processing defaulted payments. The $30 fee provided for in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;24.1(e), on the other hand, is credited to a Customs account whose purpose is specifically to recoup the administrative costs associated with processing defaulted payments. Thus, because the $30 fee is money usable by Customs in this regard while liquidated damages are not, the two assessments may not properly be considered a duplicate assessment for a single defaulted payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, against this backdrop, Customs proposes to amend &sect;24.1(e) so as to permit the application of the $30 fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for all returned checks, other monetary instruments, and ACH defaulted payments, regardless of whether the maker is commercial and/or bonded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When inspection of regulated articles or outdoor household articles reveals gypsy moth, treatment is often necessary. Treatment is done by qualified certified applicators, which are private businesses that charge, on the average, $50 to $100 to treat a shipment of articles. Most qualified certified applicators are small businesses. By declaring an area as a generally infested area, the regulations may increase business for the qualified certified applicator located in generally infested areas. It is estimated that these businesses will average $50 to $150 per month in additional income per business. Since the seven counties in Ohio to be regulated contain the metropolitan areas of Akron, Cleveland, and Toledo, we expect that several hundred shipments containing outdoor household articles will require inspection to move out of the generally infested area. We anticipate training up to 24 qualified certified applicators to perform these inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of direct costs from this rule would be incurred by establishments moving trees or shrubs with roots, such as nurseries. We estimate that approximately 130 such establishments move approximately 1,050 shipments of trees and shrubs each year to areas outside the generally infested areas. All of these establishments are believed to be small entities. These establishments would need to be inspected, either by an inspector or through self-inspection under a compliance agreement. If the inspection reveals signs of gypsy moth, the establishment would have to be treated in order to ship regulated articles outside the generally infested area. We estimate that annually, approximately 10 percent of these establishments (13 establishments) will be required to treat the establishment, and that the average area to be treated will be 17 acres. At an average treatment cost of $10 per acre, the average total annual cost to each establishment would be $170.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Christmas tree industry would also be impacted by this rule change, since Christmas trees moved interstate from generally infested areas to areas not generally infested would have to be moved under a certificate or permit. We estimate that there are about 5 Christmas tree producers in the generally infested areas who ship approximately 100 trees each year to nonregulated areas. All of these establishments are believed to be small entities. Services of an inspector will be available without charge to inspect the premises and issue certificates and permits. We estimate that 10 percent of these premises will be found to contain gypsy moth, and will require treatment in order to ship trees. The average area to be treated is estimated to be 80 acres, and treatment costs are estimated to average $10 per acre. Therefore, we estimate that the total annual treatment costs for one Christmas tree producer would be approximately $800.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is expected that, in most cases, Christmas tree growers would meet the requirements for certification by having inspectors determine that the plantations where the trees are grown are free from gypsy moth. This alternative would be less costly than inspecting or treating individual shipments of trees and would minimize the economic impact of the change to the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.

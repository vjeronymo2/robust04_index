On the eve of the Lunar New Year, I would like to extend New  Year's greetings to all compatriots at home and abroad, wishing  you a happy New Year and every success.    The year end is a time for reviewing the past and looking to  the future. Over the past year, thanks to the concerted efforts  of all compatriots, we have achieved substantive progress and  fruitful results in internal, economic, diplomatic and cultural  affairs, as well as in cross-strait relations.    In internal affairs, our long-term endeavor to promote  democracy has taken root and begun to blossom in the Taiwan,  Penghu, Chinmen and Matzu areas. The elections of county  magistrates and a city mayor held toward the end of 1993 and of  county and city assemblymen two weeks ago came to successful  conclusions, even though the styles of fierce campaigning still  need much improvement through the joint efforts of all people.  Obviously our countrymen have gradually become more familiar  with the exercise of democracy and, while airing individual  views, have also displayed the consensus of sharing a common  destiny, thus enabling us to take a giant stride toward a  rational, just society.    In economic affairs, despite the global depression our  society, propelled by its enormous vitality, has seen a steady  and continual expansion of the national economy, achieving a 6  percent growth rate. The government's efforts to improve the  investment environment and open up the market for free  competition have also laid a sound foundation for Taiwan to  become a business center of the Asia-Pacific region.    In diplomatic affairs, we have adhered to the pragmatic  principle of working actively to return to the international  community, thus arousing the attention of various countries to  the existence of the Republic of China [ROC] as well as their  awareness of the reality of China's separation and divided rule.  Through participating in international organizations, attending  international conferences, and strengthening cooperation with  and providing humanitarian aid to foreign countries, we have won  the affirmation of the international community and, even more,  the respect and position we deserve.    In cultural affairs, we have integrated traditional with  modern cultures to create the most dynamic new culture in  Chinese history. Through popularizing cultural activities, we  have incrementally achieved successes in enriching our  countrymen's cultural life and fostered their awareness of  individuals versus community and state.    In cross-strait relations, we have prudently carried out the  policy toward the mainland in line with the timetable set in the  "National Reunification Program." Since the Ku-Wang meeting,  mutual understanding between the two sides of the strait has  been further enhanced through consultations on routine affairs,  exchange of visits by people of various circles, and continuous  nongovernmental exchanges, thereby enabling the "Taiwan  experience" to exert considerable influence in the Chinese  Mainland.    Dear elders, brothers and sisters: The achievements over the  past year have laid the foundation for future development.  Looking into the future, we are confident and determined to  once again open up a new situation in history. Meanwhile, we  must thoroughly recognize the following:    -- The ROC's development will not lead to its alienation  from  the mainland. As a matter of fact, the fruitful results of our  endeavor for political democratization and economic  modernization have placed us in the van of a transformation  period of Chinese culture; and our experience during the course  of development is precisely what Mainland China will need in the  future.    -- The ROC should not shut itself out of the international  community, but should actively participate in international  affairs and exert its utmost to the establishment of a new  international order. Moreover, it should play a more active  role in consolidating economic relations between Asia-Pacific  nations and should become a major partner in promoting regional  development.    -- The mainland, which should have maintained brotherly  relations with Taiwan, must abandon its anachronistic ideology  and structure and carry out economic modernization and political  democratization with new knowledge, understanding, and  strategies so as to work together with us in striving to  rejuvenate the Chinese nation and assist each other with full  pride in the international arena.    Another new year is around the corner. I hope all countrymen  will continue to work concertedly and will dedicate themselves  to the people of this land, striving to rejuvenating the Chinese  nation and creating a brighter future. Finally, once again,  best wishes and a happy New Year to you all. Thank you!</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 19 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--A research  report released recently by the China State Statistical Bureau's  Industry and Communications Department discloses that the role  of the "growth rate effect" as a special characteristic of  China's industrial economy has decreased in recent years in the  wake of the deepening of reform. A review of the internal and  external factors regulating economic returns shows that "market  inflexibility syndrome" on part of enterprises has emerged as a  major factor.    The newspaper ZHONGGUO XINXI BAO run by the State  Statistical  Bureau carried a report on this recently. The said research  report maintains that in recent years, in the wake of the full  progress of the reform of the economic structure on all fronts  and the enforcement of the relevant regulations, the regulatory  function of market mechanisms has increased every day. An  investigation conducted in 1991 by the department concerned into  the cause of losses in 50 enterprises in the three cities of  Beijing, Shenyang, and Tianjin revealed that three categories of  factors--those related to policies, macroeconomic operations,  and enterprise operations and management were responsible for  19.4, 47.8, and 32.8 percent of the cases respectively. Another  investigation conducted last year by the department concerned  into the cause of losses in more than 2,500 enterprises in eight  provinces and cities, including Shanghai, Shandong, and Jilin,  showed that the number of cases due to factors related to  policies and macroeconomic operations had both been reduced to  around 9 percent, whereas the number of cases due to factors  related to enterprise operations and management had risen  drastically to 82 percent. This change indicates that poor  management and market inflexibility on the part of enterprises  themselves have emerged as the major factors affecting their  economic returns.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Live report from New Delhi via telephone, by special </F> correspondent Rey Rodriguez]    [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived in  New Delhi today on his tour through Southeast Asia. Robaina's  visit is at the invitation of Salman Khursheed, minister of  state for external affairs, who visited Cuba last November. On  that occasion, Khursheed conveyed to his Cuban counterpart  India's interest in entering spheres such as biotechnology,  fishing, and the sugar industry.    This nation of over 800 million inhabitants has a high level  of scientific-technical development and great trade, and it  exerts a marked influence in the region.    Before arriving in India, Robaina made a 24-hour visit to  Cambodia, where he was received by Cambodia's Foreign Affairs  Minister, Prince Norodom Sirivut. During Robaina's visit, the  two leaders agreed to put political and economic relations on  the same level, and coincided in seeking new forms of  cooperation for mutual benefit. Robaina arrived in Cambodia at a  time when Cambodia is increasingly seeking to incorporate itself  into the region as it tries to find a negotiated solution to the  conflict in that nation -- through a program of national  reconciliation signed in Paris last November.    Tomorrow the Cuban foreign minister will meet with his  counterpart Dinesh Singh and with representatives of the Chamber  of Commerce and Industry. He will also tour the Indira Gandhi  Memorial.    On Saturday, Robaina will be in Malaysia, where he is  expected to have meetings with important businessmen, after  which he will leave for Vietnam, the last stop of this tour  through Asia.</p>

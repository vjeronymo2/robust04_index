			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 26 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  telephoned U.S. President Bill Clinton on Sunday [26 June] to  assure him that Japan will push ahead with ongoing bilateral  framework trade talks, aides said.    "We would like to clear the way (for further progress)  through mutual dialogue without allowing the talks to move  backward," the outgoing Japanese leader was quoted as telling  Clinton.    "I have directed working-level officials to make efforts in  that direction," he was quoted as telling Clinton.    Hata also said Japan will not allow the current political  impasse to adversely affect its reform efforts, including those  for the election system and other political matters, economic  issues such as market opening, and administrative reform, the  officials said.    On the North Korean nuclear issue, he told Clinton there has  been "a step forward" thanks to U.S. efforts and pledged to  continue playing a role expected of Tokyo in close cooperation  with Washington and Seoul.    The officials quoted Clinton as thanking Hata for giving  instructions toward enhancing cooperative relations between the  two countries.    The President told him Washington will continue to cooperate  closely with Tokyo in resolving the question of Pyongyang's  suspected nuclear arms development program, adding he wants  progress to be made in the trade talks, the officials said.    Clinton said he was personally impressed by Hata's  capability  and personality, they added.    Hata made the call to Clinton's presidential retreat at Camp  David to brief him on the prime minister's announcement Saturday  that he is stepping down to open the way for a stable new  government.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Doboj, April 25 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem forces on  Monday stepped up the intensity of their attacks on Bosnian Serb  positions and villages in the wider region of Doboj in northern  Bosnia.    Moslems attacked Serb defence positions west of Doboj with  strong small arms and mortar fire and tried to carry out an  infantry attack, but it was repulsed, Bosnian Serb military  sources said.    Moslem forces carried out a strong infantry attack northeast  of Teslic (southwest of Doboj), planning to break through the  Serb defence lines, but Bosnian Serb units repulsed this attack  and forced the Moslem formations to retreat.    Moslems on Monday also stepped up attacks from anti-aircraft  weapons and small arms northeast of Doboj, but the attacks  ceased after the Serb side returned strong fire.</p>

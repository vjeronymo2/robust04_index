			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HAWAII;  </P> <P> COAST GUARD AIDS SINKING FREIGHTER  </P> <P> A Coast Guard cutter reached a sinking Greek freighter 800 miles  north-northeast of Hawaii and picked up half of the 28 crew members while the  rest battled to save the ship. "It does not look good, but they're not  abandoning ship yet. They're still trying," Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer  Dennis Hubbard said. Three Coast Guardsmen from the cutter Sassafras boarded  the 620-foot M.V. Bulka of Kingston, St. Vincent, which was on its way to South  Korea from Los Angeles with a cargo of scrap metal, to help with the pumps that  the vessel has been using to try to pump water out of its cargo hold.  </P></p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Police and Bank of England combine to fight bank fraud THE POLICE, the Bank of England and the security services are planning to join forces in a renewed fight against bank fraud in the wake of last year's closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the corrupt international bank. Talks are taking place between the Bank, the Cabinet Office, the Home Office and the Treasury on the establishment of a new 'inter-agency group', the Bank said yesterday. In a separate development, however, the Bank found itself at odds with the speaker of the House of Commons over allegations, by the Labour MP Mr Brian Sedgemore, that it leaked details of its response to a select committee report into BCCI. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, said she strongly deprecated the alleged leak because it showed 'great discourtesy to this House'. While she had 'no influence' with the Bank of England, she would have expected 'as a matter of courtesy' that MPs would be informed of responses to select committee reports 'in advance of any other outside body'. The Bank yesterday gave the Treasury select committee members its detailed response to their report and also published the response. However, newspapers, including The Guardian and the Financial Times, carried details of this response in their Tuesday editions. 'If there has been a breach of privilege it was entirely inadvertent,' the Bank said yesterday. The select committee report, published in March, had been critical of the supervisory system and also made some criticisms of the Bank's behaviour. In its response to the report, the Bank said that an 'effective co-ordinated response to complex frauds' may require 'new machinery for the exchange of information or for investigation'. An official said this new machinery was likely to be an inter-agency group containing representatives of the Bank and various investigators, including the police, the Customs and the National Drugs Investigations Unit. The security services will also be represented, although the official said 'we never talk about such things'. A Bank official admitted yesterday that before BCCI was closed, 'communication (between the Bank and other investigators) could have been done better'. The Bank also gave details of an international initiative to prevent money-launderers from exploiting Swift, the telecommunication system used to transfer funds between banks in different countries. The extent of the fraud at BCCI had been partly hidden by its ability to disguise its identity when making payments through other banks. Bank response attacked, Page 8</p>

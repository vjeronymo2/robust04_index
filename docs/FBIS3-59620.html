Businesses willing to settle in the rural districts  of Floeha, Mittweida, and Zschopau can, for a limited time, make  use of the manpower of unemployed scientists and engineers at no  cost to themselves. In return, the small and mid-size firms must  commit themselves to creating jobs in the region after a given  period of time. The project is not without controversy. The  Saxon FDP [Free Democratic Party] is afraid of government  subsidized competition for research firms in the private sector.    Regions near Chemnitz are marked by the decline in the once  dominant textile industry. After reunification, only a fraction  of the jobs in this area of business could be salvaged.  Manufacturing companies are still in short supply. Peter Daetz,  Director of the Center for Economic Development and Advanced  Training GmbH (CEDAT) in Floeha, made the point that "during the  recession, we couldn't get anyone to settle here." Three rural  districts of Saxony and the state of Saxony are partners in the  non-profit CEDAT, which concerns itself with promoting economic  development and a second labor market.    In spite of enterprise zones, low real estate prices and  development programs, there was no apparent successful influx of  people into the structurally weak area. When the Technical  University of Chemnitz-Zwichau had to let almost 1,000  scientists and engineers go at the end of 1992, the promoters of  economic development got the idea to offer this potential in  research and development (R&amp;D) at no cost to regional  companies,  to those establishing new business enterprises, and to investors  from West.    The following model served: If a company, at no cost to  itself, employs the services of a scientist for one year, it is  obligated afterward to create two to three secure jobs in the  region. Breach of this commitment results in the threat of  contractual penalties. This measure of creating work is financed  according to 249h of the Employment Promotion Act. There are  currently 150 scientists and engineers available for this  undertaking. "Since R&amp;D work is not being done for money, we  are  not giving any competition to private research companies," Daetz  emphasizes. Representatives of Chambers of Industry and Commerce  should guard against jobs eluding private companies.    The measures are handled institutionally by the Assistance  Center of Middle Saxony (ACMS). Members are the CEDAT, the  State, the Construction Company of Saxony, the District Savings  Bank as well as the municipality of Floeha. Up to now the ACMS  has been able to conclude ten contracts with companies, which  created 60 secure jobs. By the end of 1994 the number should  climb to 200. Without the R&amp;D offer, these companies would  never  have come to Saxony-- Daetz is certain of that. The FDP of  Saxony is not sympathetic to the ACMS also getting government  support. Around 10 million German marks are at the disposal of  the ACMS for two years.</p>

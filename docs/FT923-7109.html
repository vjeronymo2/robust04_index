			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Mexican meat could be Caribbean poison - Canute James on concerns that Mexico's presence in Nafta will undermine the region's economies THE agreement which will link Mexico's economic destiny to that of its US and Canadian neighbours to the north is being regarded with more than slight discomfort by the countries in the Caribbean Basin. For the past year, there has been little doubt in the minds of Caribbean and Central American trade ministers that the region will be hurt by Mexico being part of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Both the Canadian and US governments have been petitioned repeatedly to ensure some form of preferential treatment for the region. Mr Brian Mulroney, Canadian prime minister, on a recent visit to Trinidad, offered countries in the region some comforting words: 'The Caribbean countries will lose nothing but there will be greater competition in the North American market. What we would propose is to evaluate any impacts after a reasonable time, see what they are and, if there are any, try to accommodate them in meetings with the Caribbean leaders.' The problem for the region is based on the fact that, for many years, it has survived through trade preferences. Most recently, 24 Caribbean and Central American countries have been benefiting from the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), a trade programme offered by Washington, which selects countries which may ship a range of products to the US duty-free. Several countries also benefit from a similar programme offered by Canada, while others have preferential access to the European Community market under the Lome Convention. Mexico in Nafta threatens to remove the advantages of preferential entry to the US and Canada because small regional economies cannot compete with Mexico. Business leaders and government officials in the region say they are already seeing the effects of Mexico's participation in Nafta. Investment decisions were delayed as the negotiations for Mexico's entry went on. 'The US is not yet willing to consider the likely impact of an expanded Nafta on the Caribbean Basin states, but says this will be reviewed in four to five years,' says Ms Judith Bennett, a promotions officer with Jampro, Jamaica's economic development agency. 'But, during this period, the Caribbean states will lose a large part of their industries, particularly agriculture and garments.' The region has made much of opportunities to expand exports of garments to the US in recent years. Although not allowed duty-free access under the CBI (a concession to the fears of the US domestic industry), countries in the Caribbean and Central America have been granted quotas under a programme in which US-made fabric is cut in US plants and then sent to the region for assembly, with duty paid on the added value on re-entry to the US. The countries which have benefited from this Dollars 2bn-a-year industry have asked Washington to ensure that they are allowed duty-free entry to the Nafta when Mexico becomes a member. 'If this does not happen, then we can tell this industry good-bye, and face the political price of the anger of the hundreds of thousands of women who work in the factories,' said one official from the Dominican Republic. The region's sugar exporters have also been worried at reports that Mexico could ship 1.5m tonnes of sugar a year to the US. This would amount to more than current US imports under quotas from 44 countries, many in the Caribbean. There is general agreement in the region that one way to control the damage would be to join forces. But, for the Caribbean states, such co-operation has always been slow and difficult. Mr Norman Garca, executive director of Fide, the Honduran export development agency, says the start of the Central American common market in January will allow its members more strength in dealing with Nafta. This should be followed by discussions with the Caribbean islands to create a wider economic union, he suggested. 'We must either get out of the way of Nafta, or follow,' Mr Garca said. 'We must follow Nafta. We have no alternative. The Caribbean Basin countries must first get together, and then talk to Nafta.' Mexico is expected to be admitted to the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation group (Apec), the 15-nation regional economic consultative body, officials at the South Korean foreign ministry said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Seoul. A ministry official said no objections to Mexico's membership were expected at the group's fourth ministerial meeting in Bangkok on September 10-11. Apec is made up of Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, the US, Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Brunei.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Disputes over truck  pollution and fish were dominating a European Union [EU]  ministerial meeting here Monday [21 February] on negotiating  terms to let four applicant countries into the EU, diplomats  said.    The meeting stretched into the night as European Affairs  ministers prepared for negotiations Tuesday with counterparts  from the applicant countries -- Austria, Finland, Norway and  Sweden.    Monday's meeting was dominated by Austria's attempts to curb  polluting truck traffic over the Alps, and Spain's efforts to  extract a high price for Norway's integration into EU fisheries  affairs.    "We are not the ones doing the asking. The Union is warning  that applicants must accept EU rules," Belgium's European  Affairs Minister Robert Urbain said.    Hanging over the meeting was a decision by Swiss voters on  Sunday that all truck traffic across the Swiss Alps must be  switched to rail, for environmetal reasons.    Switzerland is not among the current applicants for EU  membership, but diplomats pointed out that Austrians might  follow the Swiss example by also taking a hardline environmental  stand in the Austrian Alps.    Austria is insisting on maintaining strict limits on truck  traffic across the Alps until 2004, seven years later than  accepted by Brussels.    As a member of the EU, however, Austria would be expected to  accept its fair share of the huge truck traffic flow across the  EU's single market, which might be unacceptable to its voters.    The diplomats warned that the traffic flow across Austria  could increase because of trucks diverted from Switzerland,  adding fuel to the environmentalist anti-EU movement in Austria.    In the fish dispute, Spain was insisting at Monday's meeting  that its fishing fleet, the biggest in the EU, be given access  to Norway's fishing waters as part of a membership deal.    France and Ireland were also pushing for protection from  cheap Norwegian fish exports.    And the EU countries were battling with another important  consequence of taking Austria, Finland and Norway into the Union  -- the need to cut their high agricultural prices down to EU  levels.    Prices in these countries are inflated by hefty subsidies  needed for the survival of farmers in harsh Arctic and Alpine  conditions.    The two sides are split over how to cushion the effect of  price equalisation, and the EU's demands that the applicant  countries should bear the full cost.    Adding pressure to the negotiations is a deadline of  February  28 for finishing them so that the applicants can join the EU by  January 1 next year.    The EU's Greek presidency has pencilled in February 25-28  for  a final four-day negotiating bid to reach agreement before March  1.</p>

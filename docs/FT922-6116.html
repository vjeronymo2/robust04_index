			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Fanuc shows first fall in five years FANUC, the Japanese maker of numerical control devices and other machine tools equipment, yesterday reported its first profit fall in five years and warned that earnings would slide further in the current year. For the 1991 fiscal year group pre-tax earnings fell 25.4 per cent to Y52bn (Dollars 401.8m). The company predicted that earnings will decline by 29.3 per cent to Y36.9bn in the current fiscal year. The company blames the setback on Japanese companies' continuing reduction in spending on industrial facilities. Net profit decreased by 20.1 per cent to Y30.1bn, and it is predicted to fall to Y20bn in fiscal 1992. Sales were down by 15.6 per cent to Y155.8bn, reflecting a 20 per cent fall in orders. Fanuc expects a further 9.4 per cent decrease in turnover in fiscal 1992 largely due to the sluggish Japanese economy. Shiseido, the cosmetics company, posted a 7 per cent rise in consolidated sales to Y553.3bn for the year to end-March, on strong demand of higher value cosmetics and hair treatment products.</p>

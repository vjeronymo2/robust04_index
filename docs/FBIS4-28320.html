			<p>BFN     [Text] China's biggest trade and investment delegation to  ever visit Australia is continuing to generate multimillion  dollar deals for local companies. About 500 business people,  including 119 Chinese representatives, are today meeting at an  investment forum in Sydney. Last week's first session of the  forum in Melbourne resulted in 147 letters of intent worth a  potential $1.2 billion [Australian]. Managing Director of the  Australian Trade Commission Ralph Evans says the Chinese  delegation has an extensive shopping list.    [Begin Evans recording] There were up to $10 billion worth  of projects and that $1.2 billion on which there have been  companies that have signed initial letters of intent represents  12 percent of that. So, they have come with a very extensive  shopping list and we would hope that more of it can be tapped  into during the session here in Sydney today. [end recording]</p>

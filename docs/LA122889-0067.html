			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALENDAR;  </P> <P> ANTHONY GATES TO LEAD WEST L.A. AGAINST ALUMNI  </P> <P> Anthony Gates, West Los Angeles College sophomore forward, is off to a blazing  start. The Fremont High School graduate is averaging 19.4 points and 11  rebounds a game and had 38 points, the fourth-best scoring game in WLAC  history, and added 18 rebounds in a 103-94 victory over San Bernardino at the  Riverside Tournament. He made 17 of 24 shots from the field against San  Bernardino.  </P> <P> Gates and his teammates will play host to an alumni squad at 6 p.m. Friday at  Veterans Memorial Auditorium, Culver City. The Oilers (7-8) will open Western  State Conference play against Glendale at 2 p.m. Wednesday.  </P> <P> Those who will play for the alumni include Mike Lippman (1969-70), Ed Azzam  (1973-75), Darryl Hawkins (1978-80) and Frank Lopez (1984-86).  </P> <P> Lippman holds school records with an average of 27.2 points for one season and  48 points in one game. Azzam, Westchester High School boys basketball coach,  played for what may have been Coach Charles Sands' best team, which finished  with a 23-10 record in 1974. Hawkins was captain and the most valuable player  on the 1979-80 team that finished 23-11. Lopez leads the Oilers in career  assists.  </P> <P> Three other Oilers besides Gates have been scoring in double figures. Freshman  guard Maurice McKinzy is averaging 14.5 points, sophomore guard David Hollaway  14.2 and freshman guard Booker Waugh 13.5. McKinzy is also from Fremont,  Hollaway from Crenshaw and Waugh from Westchester.  </P> <P> WLAC won three of four games and finished fifth at Riverside. Besides defeating  San Bernardino, the Oilers beat Chaffey, 77-69, and Golden West, 76-72. WLAC  lost to San Diego Mesa, 75-72.  </P> <P> Other highlights at Riverside included Hollaway's 24 points, including four  three-point shots against Golden West; McKinzy making 13 of 14 free throws  against San Bernardino, including 10 straight down the stretch; Waugh's 29  points against San Diego Mesa and Gates' 19 points and 12 rebounds in the  Chaffey game.  </P> <P> The Pepperdine women's basketball team (6-3 at the start of the week) will be  the host team for the Zuma Jay's-Lady Wave tournament, which begins Friday and  ends Saturday at Firestone Fieldhouse.  </P> <P> On Friday, Iowa State (6-3) will meet San Diego State (1-6) at 6 p.m., and  Pepperdine will face Texas San Antonio (4-4) at 8 p.m. Saturday, the  third-place game will be at 6 p.m. and the championship game at 8.  </P> <P> Last week the Waves shot a season-best 55.6% from the field and defeated UC  Santa Barbara, 65-52.  </P> <P> Four Pepperdine players were scoring in double figures as the week began.  Sophomore forward Shannon Frowiss is averaging 14.7 points a game, senior guard  Sherri Murrell 12.2, senior forward Kristy Greenberg 11.2 and junior center  Sharon Wilson 10.4. Frowiss was averaging a team-high 7.9 rebounds.  </P> <P> Felice Lipscomb of Santa Monica High School, defending state champion in the  100-meter hurdles, will compete in the 60-yard high hurdles and run anchor on  the favored Santa Monica High mile-relay team in the Sunkist Invitational  indoor track meet on Jan. 19 at the Sports Arena. Prep events begin at 4:30  p.m.  </P> <P> In the 60 hurdles, Lipscomb, who won the 100 hurdles in 13.69 at the state meet  last spring, will be facing girls who finished second and third to her in that  event: Kwani Stewart of Yuba City and Keri Sanchez of Santa Teresa. This is the  first time the 60-yard hurdles have been run by girls at the Sunkist.  </P> <P> Three members of the U.S. national team in rhythmic gymnastics -- national  champion Alexandra Feldman, Jennifer Hasse and Polina Friedman -- will be  featured in the seventh annual Lights Invitational Meet at 1 p.m. Jan. 14 at  Veterans Memorial Auditorium, Culver City.  </P> <P> The meet is sponsored by the Los Angeles School of Gymnastics in Culver City.  Alla Svirsky, coach of the U.S. national team in the 1988 Olympics, is  executive director of the school.  </P> <P> The meet will include teams from Chicago, Jacksonville, Fla.; San Francisco,  Palos Verdes, San Pedro and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Former Pepperdine guard Dwayne Polee, the most valuable basketball player in  the West Coast Conference in 1985 and 1986, and ex-Wave forward Eric White, an  all-conference selection from 1985 through 1987, were named to the conference's  all-decade team. Loyola Marymount center Hank Gathers was named the  conference's Player of the 1980s.  </P> <P> Others named to the team of the '80s were guard John Stockton of Gonzaga,  forward Forrest McKenzie of Loyola Marymount, guard Jose Slaughter of Portland,  forward Robert Haugen of St. Mary's, center Scott Thompson of the University of  San Diego, guard Quintin Dailey of the University of San Francisco and the late  center Nick Vanos and guard Harold Keeling, both of Santa Clara.  </P></p>

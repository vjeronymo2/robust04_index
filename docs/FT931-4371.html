			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Observer: Con jobs High unemployment is evidently proving good business for some, and on an international scale. Witness, for example, the 30 would-be workers from South Africa marooned in Bahrain. Having been offered lucrative locally advertised oil-rig jobs in Kuwait with 'Offshore International', they each handed the supposed company's agent nearly Pounds 5,000 for travel costs and a 'character premium' to ensure they would serve for a given time. The organiser travelled with them part-way, promising that a courier would be waiting in Bahrain to take them to the site. When he failed to materialise, they checked and discovered there was no such company, and of course no jobs. But the con artist responsible, who had an Australian accent and claimed Irish origins, seems unlikely to be the same conman wanted for interview by the British police. Styling himself D A Baxter, he has been purporting to recruit sales staff for Euro Disney, asking applicants for advance payments to cover costs. With convincingly English restraint, however, he is charging only Pounds 6.75 a head.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [G. Akhmedov report: "Factor of Development--the Market: </F> Word of the Organizers of a New Party"]    [Text] Fuad Asadov, president of the Union of  Leaseholders and Entrepreneurs, delivered a statement at a news  conference. He announced that a congress of members of his union  had been held at the end of May. It had decided on the creation  of a new political organization--the Azerbaijan Republic Reform  Party (ARRP).    The action committee formed an organizing committee,  which commissioned Fuad Asadov to hold a news conference and  describe the business and tasks of the party that is being  formed.    Journalists of republic newspapers and agencies--BAKINSKIY  RABOCHIY, VYSHKA, RESPUBLIKA, MILLYAT, ADALYAT, EKHO SUMGAITA,  ASSA-IRADA, ANS-PRESS, and others--displayed great interest. The  party is being formed on the basis of the Union of Leaseholders  and Entrepreneurs. Several years ago its members were the first  to embark on the transformation of Azerbaijan's industry and  agriculture on a market basis--to create leased and small  enterprises, cooperatives, stock companies, and private farms.    Of course, things were difficult for them, and some of them  had their fill of hard times. Had it not been for the decisive  actions of the leaders of the union, who vigorously defended the  rights of the leased collectives in the court of arbitration,  and their protests in the press and on radio and television, it  would hardly have been possible to preserve their market  structure status. For example, Edison Akhundov, director of the  Remdetal small enterprise, went to law six times with the  leadership of the Automotive Trust of the Ministry of  Agriculture, and justice was ultimately restored. And the  leadership of the State Committee for Sport attempted with a  squad of police officers to induce Maya Ismaylova, general  director of the Ilman leased production association, to hand  over her files. The workforce stood solidly behind her and the  Supreme Court of Arbitration rejected the plaintiff's unlawful  importunings.    The Union of Leaseholders and Entrepreneurs in fact became  the public defender of all who aspired to switch to market  relations. Together with the News Media Workers Union Republic  Committee it conducted a competition under the motto "For the  economic revival of Azerbaijan." Many newspaper, journalist,  economist, and scientist winners were awarded valuable gifts and  cash prizes. The union is participating actively in law-making  activity of the republic Supreme Council.    Its leaders have now embarked a new difficult venture--the  organization of a party. According to Fuad Asadov's statement,  the main factor of Azerbaijan's development and its emergence  from the crisis is the market economy. But the brakes have been  applied to the switch of the national economy to the tracks of  the latter, and it is proceeding only middling well, as they  say. This situation can no longer be tolerated. The main reason  for the running in place is the absence of a set of laws on the  market economy. The entrepreneurs are bound hand and foot  because of this, which is preventing them from investing their  forces, knowledge, and talent in production in full. To achieve  their goals, the entrepreneurs are forced today to bow to  government, ministerial, and customs officials, yet what is  necessary is that all be subordinate to and depend only on laws  regulating economic and social life. The current chaos and  turmoil and the absence of prescriptive documents are creating  conditions for endless and prejudiced inspections by  representatives of the prosecutor's office, the police,  financial and tax authorities....    A principal task, whose accomplishment the new party will  tackle first and foremost, is an acceleration of the adoption of  laws regulating and organizing the economy in a new way,  remembering here the classical expression: policy is the  concentrated expression of the economy.    Of course, the ARRP will fight also for people's social  rights, and it has other goals also. To journalists' questions  as to whether the party would aspire to seize power, it was  stated that such was not its mission.    Any citizen of Azerbaijan may, without distinction as to  national origin or religious belief, become a member of the  party. Group membership of enterprise and organization workers  also is permitted.    The ARRP urges Azerbaijan's development along the path of  democracy, civilization, independence, and liberty. It rejects  extremism and violence aimed at the overthrow of the current  system and supports the efforts of the president of the republic  for a political solution of the Karabakh conflict and his  efforts to stabilize society. The ARRP Organizing Committee  points to the danger of inaction and indifference and calls on  the citizens for unity, active struggle against internal discord  and the dirty games of various political forces, and unification  for the sake of the prosperity of their native Azerbaijan.</p>

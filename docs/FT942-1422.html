			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / CBI reports upward price pressures The industrial recovery remains on track but growing numbers of manufacturers expect to raise prices in the next four months, the latest Confederation of British Industry monthly industrial trends survey shows. The survey, published today, says companies' price expectations rose in June, after several months in which price expectations have been fairly flat. Twenty-one per cent of companies questioned hope to increase domestic prices in the next four months, while only 9 per cent expect to reduce them. This positive balance of 12 per cent on the question of raising prices is significantly higher than in the months between February and May, when the balance ranged between minus 1 per cent and plus 4 per cent. The CBI pointed out yesterday, however, that company expectations could be overly optimistic - when the balance of price expectations last rose to 12 per cent in January these expectations were largely unrealised. Although the City is watching closely for any sign that the economic recovery could be fuelling inflationary pressures, Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, yesterday denied that the figures were a cause for alarm. He said: 'The outlook for inflation is less positive than last month . . . but we cannot yet be sure that this signals a change from the subdued inflation outlook of recent surveys.' Mr Davies added: 'Companies are still facing tough competitive conditions in both home and export markets and overall inflationary pressures remain low.' Elsewhere, the survey, which questioned 1,124 companies representing about half of UK manufacturing, paints a picture of steady, modest growth. Order books remained at their best levels for five years with 28 per cent of companies believing that business is 'below normal', while only 25 per cent believe it is 'better than normal'. The balance in these total orders between export-driven and domestic demand was stable - suggesting that April's tax increases have not significantly dented domestic demand. Export order books were unchanged, at their best level for four years - 27 per cent of companies said exports were above normal, while 29 per cent said they were below.</p>

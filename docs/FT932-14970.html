			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / East Europe looks askance at bank: But the Attali row is not top of the region's agenda THE amount of money disbursed by the EBRD compared with amounts it has spent on its staff and officials is just one of many financial issues preoccupying east European officials. But it is hardly top of their agenda. 'We are in the middle of debating the budget,' one Bulgarian official said. 'We are in the middle of what could be described as a kind of trade war,' said a Hungarian official. He was referring to a one-month ban imposed by the European Community on some meat imports, provoking retaliatory action from east European countries. A Czech official said: 'We are trying to get much closer to the Community. The EBRD is not what you call top of our agenda.' Despite these other concerns, several east European officials have reservations and anecdotes about the organisation of the EBRD. 'I'm not that surprised to read about the way the bank spends its money,' one Bulgarian official said. 'Look, I was told that when the bank set up its office in Sofia, it bought everything from abroad. It didn't even buy the nails from Bulgaria. If the bank wants to do business with us, why not at least make some sort of gesture?' Another Bulgarian official remarked: 'The nails came from Britain.' He went on: 'The other complaint we have about the bank is that it is too slow in investing in the private sector. The bank, until recently, has supported big projects. But we are not looking for big loans. We want to build up small-scale industry. When we told the bank this, it said the people to implement these projects did not exist in Bulgaria. That's bull-shit.' But he and other east European officials believe the bank has enough vision under Mr Jacques Attali to push through a plan drawn up by Mr Ronald Freeman, head of the bank's merchant banking division. 'Mr Freeman's argument is that if the west is going to provide aid to Russia, why doesn't the west pay the countries of eastern Europe to supply the food, commodities and machinery,' said an east European diplomat. A senior Hungarian official said the bank had 'done some good deals here. Not all are first class, but we are quite satified.' Yet the official, in common with other officials from central Europe, admitted the bank was slow in disbursing money. 'Since April 1991 until the end of last year, the bank has committed Ecu250m (Pounds 198m) for investment in 11 Hungarian enterprises. But only Ecu20m has been disbursed. The bank could be a lot faster. But we appreciate its efforts,' another Hungarian official added. 'I suppose if you are going to criticise the bank, you should not raise the question of its survival. Instead, the issue of accountability should be raised - you know, making it more open. Looking at how decisions are made. That sort of thing,' she added. Similar views about slow disbursement and decisions were echoed by Czech and Polish officials. A Czech official wanted the bank to take more risks, despite the limitations of its mandate. A Polish official said: 'Maybe the bank could be a bit more open.' But Mr Attali is open when it comes to getting invitations, says a diplomat. 'Whenever there is a state visit or a prominent official coming to London, Mr Attali insists on getting invited to dinner or receptions. . . He is very pushy and often very condescending to the east Europeans. But he has put eastern Europe high on the agenda.'</p>

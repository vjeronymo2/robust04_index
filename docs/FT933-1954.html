			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (4): New name for an old idea - Although the client/server concept has emerged only recently, it is based on well- established ideas of how computer power can be distributed effectively for better business systems / Client/server systems only variations on well-known themes. Despite outward appearances, the advance of information technology is usually gradual and evolutionary. There are, of course, occasional 'great leaps forward' like microprocessor chip fabrication technology or the relational database. But mostly, progress is slow. Users cannot afford to throw out technology and systems in which they have invested much effort and large amounts of money. So they stick to what they know until the pressure to change is irresistible. The arrival of low-cost personal computers and networks has created enormous pressure for change - with the result that increasing numbers of companies are turning to these technologies to save money and build more flexible IT systems. Networks of cheap computers are now able to match traditional mainframes in performance at a much lower cost. The client/server model - a design approach for building IT systems using networked computers - is central to the shift away from central mainframe-based computing to distributed systems. The client/server model separates the functions of an IT system and distributes them across several computers. Client computers - typically PCs or workstations - provide a 'friendly' front end and some local processing features. Server computers, located elsewhere in the network, provide services such as database storage, electronic mail and transaction processing. The main advantage of the client/server model is that each component computer can be built to suit the specific tasks it is expected to handle. Front-end workstations and PCs can be equipped with graphics-based 'windowing' software to make them easier to use. Server computers can be optimized to access large databases or handle many transactions simultaneously. Although the client/server model has emerged only a recently, it is based on well-established ideas of how computer power can be distributed effectively. The UK's Girobank has used this approach to its systems design since the early 1980s and evolved gradually to a client/server system. It has always been a large user of computer power since it was founded in 1968 as the first 'telephone bank.' But in the late 1970s, Girobank needed a fundamental re-appraisal of its IT systems: 'We needed to re-think the systems infrastructure and knew we would have to replace all of our core systems,' explains Mr Paul Podesta, facilities and logistics manager at Girobank. The demands of telephone banking meant that Girobank needed a system which was 100 per cent reliable, 24 hours a day. It had relied on ICL mainframes through the 1970s but decided to move away from a single, central computer to a distributed network. It chose IBM mainframes, to handle batch processes such as statement production, and several Tandem Nonstop computers for online transaction processing. Girobank has several regional centres where the Tandem computers process the front-end transaction load and then pass data to the IBM mainframe. These systems are linked by a wide-area network which also has 2300 terminals and about 300 PCs connected to it. There are a further 1,000 PCs which are not connected to the network. The network must process over one and half million transactions each day in addition to supporting the 'back-room' tasks such as statement production and accounting. The Tandem computers act as clients to the mainframe system. The PCs, running Microsoft's Windows, are being used as the front end - or client - for some applications. 'We have invested in the PCs for their productivity benefits. It gives our users access to the 'warehouse' of data on the larger systems,' says Mr Podesta. The choice of Tandem systems has helped to ease the move to client/server computing. The Tandem software uses a technique called requester/server which is very similar to client/server. Both the requester and the server can be on the same computer - although they are separate software components. 'We have a consistent user interface across all of our applications and it has helped us to re-use software. A piece of server software can be called by many different client processes. The Tandem design enforces a structure which lends itself to re-usability. 'This makes the journey to client/server much easier.' Girobank is well-positioned to move to the next stage and distribute more of its business logic to the network. To make this move, Girobank needs the right tools and Mr Podesta currently sees this as a barrier - 'the complexity is daunting in a large system. Small organisations can do it with a few PCs and a local area network. But it is much more difficult with a large organisation and the tools always lag behind the operating software and the hardware.' He adds that it is still early in the development of large-scale client/server systems and design techniques have still to evolve: 'We don't know what questions you need to ask when you design a client/server system. There is no body of knowledge to turn to so it will be a while before the tools are mature enough.' This in no way lessens Mr Podesta's enthusiasm for the client/server approach, however: 'The real driving force is that client/server lets us re-design how people work. In the past we have built computer systems which implement sequential processes, changed the work to fit in with that and fragmented people's jobs. 'An accounts clerk used to work with pieces of paper - ledgers and so forth. Then the comptometer came along and took part of that job elsewhere. Computers have taken it even further. 'With client/server we can bring it all back together.' He is, however, realistic about the cost of the transition to client/server and notes that the real benefits are in the user area not within the IT department. 'The labour costs associated with distributed systems are higher - even though the capital cost of the hardware is lower. The users have to do more for themselves and they need support and training.' The long-term benefits which will come from client/server systems are related to their ability to produce better-designed and more useful business systems. Pioneers have begun to realise some of these benefits and Girobank, at least, is confident that there will be more to come.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 31, RIA -- "Importantly, the initiative  to stage the first ever joint exercises of Russian and American  peace makers in the U.S comes from the U.S. legislators, not the  executive authorities," Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State  Duma Foreign Affairs Commitee, told the media in reply to a RIA  query. He said that the initiative is especially topical in the  light of the acute debates in the State Duma around the issue of  staging the exercises in the Totskiy grounds in Russia.    There is ample reason to change the site, Lukin holds.  Russia is living with a feeling of enhanced national  self-awareness, responsibility and even "trampled national  pride." That is why the nascent partnership with other  countries, including the U.S., must be tactful and careful.    In this connection Lukin welcomed the initiative of the U.S.  legislators who seem to appreciate the complexity of the current  situation in Russia.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Consumer credit 'shows fall but 31% up on year' Consumers took out 8 per cent less credit in April than in March, according to figures released by the Finance and Leasing Association today. The figures are not seasonally adjusted, however, and may reflect the restricted number of trading days in April because of the Easter holidays. Compared with April 1993 consumer credit showed a 31 per cent increase at Pounds 1.34bn, the association said. Economists have been watching for evidence that consumer behaviour has been affected by the impact of April's tax increases on pay packets. The seasonal effects on the association's figures makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Official figures for April's consumer credit are published today. There was further evidence of a diverging trend between credit on store cards and credit for larger items such as personal loans or car finance. Store-card credit fell just 3 per cent between March and April and was still 46 per cent higher than a year ago. Both personal loans and motor finance saw a 12 per cent fall between March and April, and are respectively only 19 per cent and 25 per cent higher than a year ago. Business finance showed a fall in the rate of growth, with April's leasing total 17 per cent lower than a year ago. Hire purchase was up 25 per cent year-on-year. Mr David Hardisty, chairman of the FLA, said: 'Although there are indications of an economic upturn, there seems to be a wait and see attitude among businesses. They still need to be convinced that the recovery will last before making investment commitments.' Figures from Infolink, the credit information group, show that credit applications in the retail sector in April were 10.7 per cent higher than in April last year. The annual rate of increase for home-loan applications, and for new-car loans, fell between March and April.</p>

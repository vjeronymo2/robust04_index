			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Shop front needed for design Sir, Your report on the break-up of the Design Council ('Design Council break-up decided by government', September 24) and Christopher Lorenz's accompanying article ('The Design Council on a crash diet') confirm that government is anxious to maintain a design consultancy and an educational role. However, there is no mention of salvaging the considerable and largely self-financing promotional activity the council used to undertake on behalf of British manufacturers in the Design Centre and overseas. The trade and industry minister correctly suggests that 'design as a subject needs to be moved into the mainstream'. Nothing can be more 'mainstream' than getting British design into the marketplace. This more than anything determines whether designs are commercially relevant and experience of market factors is an essential design ingredient. There is little point in indulging our aptitude for creating innovation while neglecting to exploit inventive achievements. We need trade and industry and therefore to rescue the Design Centre shop front and not just the back room of design consultancy. Peter York, 64 Dry Hill Park Road, Tonbridge, Kent TN10 3BX</p>

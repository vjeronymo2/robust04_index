			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil falls by 2% Concern about November inflation and a possible further increase in nominal interest rates dragged stock prices down for the second day in a row to close 2.02 per cent lower yesterday. Trading was sluggish since most investors were out of the market ahead of the All Saints Day holiday today, when Brazil's markets are closed. The Bovespa index retreated a further 970 points to 47,009. Investors were worried about forecasts that the November inflation rate could reach 3 per cent after a 1.9 per cent rise in October. US investment bank Merrill Lynch has reduced its portfolio weighting in Latin American markets in view of the gains shown since the summer and their 'historic sensitivity to sharp movements in US interest rates'. It said Brazil faced a difficult few months ahead and the change in government could mark a correction from recent gains. The bank has increased its portfolio weightings in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Japan.</p>

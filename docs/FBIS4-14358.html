			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["AL-AHALI Opinion" column: "We Are Not A Gate To Tighten </F> The Siege of Iraq"]    [Text] We have condemned the U.S. aggression against the  Port of al-'Aqabah and considered it a manifestation of the  comprehensive hostile policy against the whole region. This  falls within the framework of the attempts aimed at imposing a  new regional order under U.S. tutelage and hegemony. We also  cannot find an excuse for entrenching -- with our approval --  this aggression against our national sovereignty under the  pretext of conducting land inspection.    We want an answer to this simple question: Is there a  decision to monitor, besiege, or inspect Jordan? We know there  is no decision in this regard; and the UN Sanctions Committee  says there is no such decision. The Americans are the ones who  are imposing the siege, and the evidence is clear. The talks to  lift the siege are being held with U.S. envoys -- the last of  whom was Secretary of State Christopher -- not with Butrus-Ghali  or with the president of the Security Council as the Iraqi  brothers are doing.    We wanted the government to champion the opinion of the  people, not only the interests of some importers and merchants  who are harmed by U.S. piracy. We were ready to fight together  in one trench to confront the U.S. aggression against Jordan.  The government's view, however, was different. It opted for  the policy of ostrich in front of the U.S. hyena, thereby  ignoring the view of the people and their political forces as  well as the good reputation of our country on the international  level.    Warren Christopher's statements in London aroused anger and  resentment because he linked these measures with tightening the  siege of Iraq. Do they want Jordan to become a barrier in the  face of Iraq or a gate to ease the burdens of the unjust siege  imposed on the people who have always been generous with Jordan,  Syria, and Palestine and who watered the soil of these countries  with the blood of their martyrs?    The policy of weakness and hiding heads in the sand will  only  lead to more humiliation and disgrace. We are not like that and  we will not be like that. We will continue to resist the policy  of capitulation and normalization. We will never agree to  seeing Jordan become a passageway for U.S.-Israeli peace  regardless of the sacrifices.</p>

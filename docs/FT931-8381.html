			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Mr Kohl faces the squeeze for Germany, its neighbours and the world. The German government is still far from bringing about a self-sustaining recovery in the east. Reunification-induced inflationary pressures have caused the Bundesbank to keep short-term interest rates high since 1991, depressing economies across Europe. The terms on which east German liabilities were converted in 1990, coupled with east Germans' desire for west German incomes, have much increased public financing needs. East Germany has become the hole in the heart of the European economy. Unless repaired, the damage will spread. A long European recession would deliver the coup de grace to the Maastricht process. Additionally, it could fatally undermine the Community's single market. Already it seems unlikely that Germany will fulfil the fiscal conditions set at Maastricht for economic and monetary union later in the decade. Germany's slowdown has made corrective policies more difficult, yet more necessary. The Bonn government expects zero growth for Germany as a whole this year. The country has been living beyond its means. It now ranks seventh in the EC in terms of GDP per head. The 3 per cent wage rise agreed earlier this month for public sector employees shows some willingness to tighten belts. Many large west German manufacturing companies have been made uncompetitive by excessive wage rises and the D-Mark's EMS revaluation. It would be realistic for workers in the west to prepare for several years of real wage stagnation. Labour costs East German unit labour costs are 80 per cent above the west German level. This has accelerated the industrial collapse east of the Elbe - a significant factor behind the demand for large transfers from Bonn. Solving the wage problem is an essential way of reducing the drain from east Germany on public finances. Now that east German wage tariffs are 73 per cent of those in the west, any further catch-up can take place only over a long period. The preferable approach would be to offer east German employers a wage subsidy to maintain employment at relatively low wages. If east German workers insist on maintaining the drive to equalise wages by 1994-95, Bonn must make clear its response will be to cut subsidies for depressed eastern industries. Unless wage costs are cut, the Treuhand's difficulties with privatisation will grow. Budgetary cuts Next, Bonn must extend its medium-term budgetary cuts. Expenditure reductions agreed so far do not match the need for radically overhauling spending priorities. Overall federal expenditure totals for 1995-96 are now 5 per cent higher than the finance ministry proposed last summer. And the government's budgetary arithmetic is based on highly optimistic assumptions about GDP growth after 1994. The government must also tap additional revenue sources. Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants to delay further income tax increases until 1995. Holding back from a tax increase this year makes sense. Ruling one out for 1994 does not. The government should also take a far more imaginative line over privatisation. None of these suggestions is easy to enact. Reunification strains have eroded traditional German policy consensus. So far, the Bundesbank's international credibility has allowed Germany to finance very large borrowing at relatively low long-term interest rates. But, unless Germany takes adequate measures, the financial markets will demand corrective steps. Debt of the size now being acquired by the public sector represents a heavy mortgage. Action will require an accord with the opposition Social Democrats, who, because of their majority in the Bundesrat, have an effective veto over tax legislation. Mr Kohl has been making heavy weather of trying to spread the burdens of unity through negotiations on his 'solidarity pact'. He must now recognise that room for manoeuvre, already small, could soon disappear. If Germany's economic imbalances persist, the clouds over Mr Kohl's own future will grow. But they will be small compared with the risk of storms over Europe.</p>

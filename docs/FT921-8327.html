			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Big energy users seek nuclear cap LARGE consumers of electricity will today ask Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, to cut their bills by capping the subsidy they pay to the nuclear industry. A group of large customers, including Blue Circle Cement and United Engineering Steel, has already threatened to stop paying the subsidy, which represents 11 per cent of their electricity bills, in April. The Major Energy Users Council is meeting Mr Wakeham in the first of a series of talks intended to resolve the row over the rise in large consumers' bills since the electricity industry was privatised in 1990. Council representatives said that capping the subsidy was one way of getting bills down to the level enjoyed by their European competitors. The large users indicated that refusing to pay the levy was a tactic to show they believed that the government, which collects the levy, was to blame for the high bills, rather than the generators. Council members said the group was disturbed that the price at which Nuclear Electric was offering power - about 2.6p a unit - was being used by National Power and PowerGen as a benchmark to determine the price at which they would sell to large users.</p>

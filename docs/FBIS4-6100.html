			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Taiichiro Kobayashi, Michiko Kawamata, SANDE </F> MAINICHI reporters: "300 Single-Seat Constituency, 200  Proportional Representative Winners Predicted"]    [Text] Following enactment of the four political  reform bills, the greatest concern of the Diet members is how  they can each survive in the 300 small electoral districts  nationwide. Can the coalition ruling parties cooperate in the  elections, given the outburst of disharmony over the people's  welfare tax proposal? Who are the potential newcomers in the  vacant districts? The battle has already begun.

"Others" within  the ruling parties include those candidates of the "Reform Society" who are  not currently members of the coalition, but who will become unified  candidates of the coalition parties during elections. The "Others" of the  opposition are LDP-related independents.    <H5>  New Party Forces Lure LDP Dietmen Individually </H5>   In a single-seat constituency electoral district, a party is  officially permitted to field only one candidate. In the LDP's  case, Dietmen who are based in the same district could be  eliminated from designation as official candidates. For example,  in Akita Prefecture which will have three electoral districts,  there are currently five LDP Dietmen. Unless two of them move to  proportional districts or switch to other parties, they will not  survive.    Dietman Tadao Sato who seeks his fourth election in the  Akita  first district--a new electoral district--explains his position  as follows: "At this stage, I will not consider leaving the  party in advance. However, if I fail to receive official party  endorsement, I will probably have to decide on forming a new  party. If intraparty endorsement of the LDP fails to make  progress, I may refuse official endorsement by the LDP."    The case of Dietman Koji Sakamoto who plans to run from the  Fukushima fifth district is similar. "I will watch the  allocation by party headquarters at this point. However, not  only in Fukushima but elsewhere also, it is doubtful whether  those who have fought bitterly against each other can adjust  smoothly and cooperate. The split of the LDP is inevitable."    Both Dietmen deny any overtures from the other parties.  However, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Sakigake  [Harbinger] parties that seek expansion are secretly competing  to recruit LDP Dietmen. One Shinseito affiliate boasts: "Just  you watch. We will get 20 from the LDP."

General Secretary Yuichi Ichikawa of Komeito  made a speech at the Central Executive Committee meeting on  party expansion on 9 February, and he promoted a concept of  "formation by the coalition parties of a new-new party with a  single party name." Certainly, if it is possible, it would be  the best strategy vis-a-vis the LDP, but its realization is  extremely difficult. In the large cities of Tokyo, Kanagawa, and  Osaka where the new parties garnered massive victories in the  previous election, the ruling party candidates will butt heads  against each other here and there. Moreover, under the new  electoral district system with the recognition of an overlapping  among candidates, candidacy in the electoral district will be  directly linked to the overlaying of proportional votes.  Therefore, each party cannot simply yield ground.    This was compounded by the fracturing within the ruling  parties that surfaced over the people's welfare tax proposal.  The general election is likely to take place with a split right  down the middle between the bloc that aggressively promotes the  proposal--which includes Shinseito and Komeito, and the opposing  bloc which includes Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and  the cautious Sakigake party. Also, Japan New Party [JNP] headed  by Prime Minister Hosokawa could become the "mowing ground" for  the two blocs.

However, in the actual  election, there is a strong possibility of a tripolar structure  consisting of the LDP, the Shinseito/Komeito, and the  SDPJ/Sakigake. Of course, it is absolutely impossible to predict  how the post-election composition of the administration will  turn out.    Meanwhile, it is likely that many of the new candidates in  the single-seat constituencies will be switch-overs by local  government heads and members of the prefectural and municipal  assemblies. In the case of Tokushima Prefecture, the name of  former Governor Shinzo Miki is rumored as an LDP candidate from  the third distict, and the name of former Tokushima City Mayor  Toshiharu Miki has also emerged in the first district. In the  Fukuoka third district, Mikito Kusuda, mayor of Chikushino City,  is seen as a strong runner from Shinseito. Also, in Tokyo,  Osaka, and Fukuoka where there are many blank districts for the  LDP, multiple numbers of local assemblymen appear likely to run  as candidates. "Under the single-seat constituencies electoral  district system," the power of the branch organization will  become stronger than the prefectural organization, and an  election on a neighborhood-unit basis will become inevitable"  (LDP Dietman Shunichi Yamaguchi).    In addition to seeking out such local politicians, each  party  is also scouting nationally known newscasters and star talent as  proportional district candidates to win floating votes. Yoichi  Masugoe, a political scientist, and newscaster Hatae are  reportedly being induced to run from Shinseito and Japan New  Party respectively. Highly popular Taro Kimura and Shigeru Roki  reportedly have more than one party vying for them.    A general election could be held as early as next year.  Aside  from the question of whether the quality of the candidates will  improve, a rise in the voting rate appear certain.</p>

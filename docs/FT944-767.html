			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Issuers play on French volatility Highly-structured French franc deals dominated the eurobond market yesterday, as issuers moved to take advantage of increased volatility in the French bond market. French short-term bond market rates, in particular, have been volatile in recent months, over uncertainty surrounding next year's presidential election. Depfa, Germany's largest mortgage bank, launched two FFr1bn offerings of two-year floating-rate notes (FRNs), both with a cap on the maximum coupon payable. Societe Generale Acceptance (SGA), a special purpose vehicle which taps international capital markets through a Dollars 10bn medium-term note programme, launched a FFr1.5bn offering of three-year FRNs, which also have a restriction on the maximum coupon payable. The SGA notes pay a coupon of 150 basis points above the three-month Paris interbank offered rate (Pibor) only if the Pibor is within a 100 basis point range, calculated using the average of the Pibor spot and future rates. Capping the coupon in this way means the notes can generate a higher margin above Pibor than would have been the case without a cap. This increases the notes' attractiveness to investors. The first Depfa tranche offered 50 basis points over three-month Pibor with a maximum coupon of 7.7 per cent. The second tranche, targeted more at investors who think French interest rates are set to rise further, offered 30 basis points above Pibor up to a maximum coupon of 8 per cent. The Depfa transactions, part of the proceeds from which were swapped into floating-rate D-Marks and the remainder kept in French francs, were driven mainly by French institutional interest, Depfa said. However, the deals also met interest from German banks and institutions, and funds in the Benelux countries, Switzerland and the UK. The deals bring Depfa's borrowing programme for 1994 to a close. It has borrowed an equivalent of DM18bn this year, Dollars 5bn of this on the eurobond market, Mr Frank Reuhland, treasurer, said. The Societe Generale offering was sold to investors in the Benelux and Switzerland and to funds in London.</p>

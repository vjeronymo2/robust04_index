			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (63): The tigers are still growing - East Asia / Victor Mallet describes the region's success story It is as hard to meet pessimistic economists in east Asia as it is to find negative economic growth rates. If success is measured in gross domestic product, developing Asian countries have been and continue to be pre-eminently successful examples of how to manage high-speed industrial revolutions. According to the Asian Development Bank, per capita income in developing Asia grew at an average rate of 4.4 per cent a year between 1970 and 1992, compared with 1 per cent in Latin America and virtually nil in Africa. Last year, growth in the developing Asian economies was almost 10 times as high as in Africa and more than twice as high as in Latin America or the Middle East. There is no sign that growth is slowing. Cambodia is mired in a messy civil war, but the communist-run economies of Vietnam and Laos are being liberalised and are expanding. Economists predict that growth in China will moderate after the double-digit expansion of the past two years, but average GDP growth in the four south-east Asian economies of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore should rise to more than 8 per cent this year from 7.8 per cent in 1993 and 6.9 per cent in 1992. Even the Philippines and Burma, Asia's laggards, are recovering. Behind the rosy statistics lie some extraordinarily rapid industrial and social changes. Retailing, for example, is being transformed in south-east Asia. Giant, western-style shopping malls - Seacon Square, said to be the largest mall in Asia, was opened in Bangkok in August - are starting to replace markets and small shops. As international communications improve and Asian countries industrialise at an ever-increasing speed, Asians are leap-frogging whole stages of development experienced in previous industrial revolutions. Some people use cellular telephones before they know what it is to have a fixed telephone. Exports of rice and tapioca are replaced by exports of microchips, allowing western companies to exploit niche markets by exporting to Asia intermediate industrial goods. Asia's success has spawned a clutch of reports seeking to explain what Asia is doing right and what other regions of the world might emulate. The findings are not particularly startling: successful Asian countries have encouraged foreign investment, been fiscally responsible, and kept inflation low; their citizens save much of their income and do not have too many children. Predicting which factors might limit Asian growth in the future is more problematic. Several Asian countries lack the transport and communications infrastructure required to support their increasingly modern industrial economies, but such difficulties will probably be overcome in time with the help of money from foreign investors and fast-growing local capital markets; even Thailand, which has been notoriously lax in developing its infrastructure, is building new roads and is now installing millions of new telephone lines, although work on a mass transit system for congested Bangkok has yet to begin. The environmental damage caused by population growth and uncontrolled pollution and commercial exploitation could be another factor limiting Asian growth, especially since several of the region's economies still depend heavily on exports of natural products such as timber and fish. Environmentalists say the recent growth rates of high-performing Asian economies would be several percentage points lower if the benefits from asset-stripping of environmental resources were excluded from the figures. Another problem is the shortage of skilled labour that is already increasing costs in some fast-growing Asian countries, and the lack of home-grown technical skills. And although intra-Asian trade and investment are increasing, the worsening mood of Asia's international trading partners in the US and Europe could yet turn out to be the most important determinant of Asian growth rates. As the World Bank noted in a report* published in July, east Asia's exports have risen more than thirtyfold in the past quarter of a century to about Dollars 850bn, increasing the east Asian share of all world exports to 21 per cent from seven per cent. The result of this - industrialised countries' imports from east Asia have been rising by 15 to 20 per cent a year without their receiving greatly improved access to Asian markets in return - is a series of probably unsustainable Asian trade surpluses and rising trade tension between the US on the one hand and China and Japan on the other. The World Bank recommends that Asian exporters, for their own good, should therefore accelerate the liberalisation of their trade regimes. Import tariffs, for example, should be halved, bearing in mind that countries such as China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have sometimes been protecting manufacturing with effective rates of more than 40 per cent. Much of the industry protected for nationalistic reasons is not domestic. In Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, the ADB says, foreign companies account for more than half of manufactured exports. 'Import protection is no longer justified by the old infant-industry arguments,' the World Bank report says. 'Many of the protected industries are no longer infants, and much of the protection is costly.' A number of Asian governments have already embarked on a new round of tariff-cutting and liberalising of foreign investment laws. Economists in Asia, for whom optimism has become a way of life, are betting that the region's dragons and tigers will once again adapt successfully to the international climate and that GDP will continue to grow both in absolute and in per capita terms. * East Asia's Trade and Investment: Regional and Global Gains from Liberalisation.</p>

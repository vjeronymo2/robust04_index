Sklyarov: "Entrepreneurs Cannot Do Without  Government Aid"]    [Text] Last year, as we know, the Fund to Support Business  and the Development of Competition was created by an edict of  the Russian government for the purpose of organizing and  rendering real aid by the government to small business. Quite  possibly, the fund has not yet been operating long enough, but  readers of EKONOMICHESKAYA GAZETA and entrepreneurs are  persistently posing questions regarding what the fund has  already done, why the results of its work are not evident,  whether there is any reason to count on it, and others. At the  request of the editors, some of these questions will be answered  today by N. Petrov, acting general director of the Fund to  Support Business and the Development of Competition.    [Sklyarov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, first of all we would like  to hear from you about what results the Fund to Support Business  began the year with. What was it able to accomplish and what did  it fail to accomplish in 1993?    [Petrov] You know that the path leading to the creation of  the fund was long and tortuous. It was only on 1 April of last  year that finally a resolution was issued concerning its  formation, after which much time and effort was spent on purely  organizational measures -- the search for facilities,  confirmation of the state schedule and fund budget, hiring of  specialists, and so forth. Nevertheless, the fund's supervisory  council began active work immediately, thereby facilitating a  solution to organizational-methodological questions. It was  especially important to establish a mechanism for rendering  credit-financial aid in order to implement regional programs to  support business and specific entrepreneurial projects. Among  our achievements of last year we can include the fact that we  have already put this mechanism into action by providing credit  for over two dozen business projects.    Now, about the things that we failed to accomplish. The main  difficulties in implementing the fund's goals have to do with  limited financial resources allocated to the fund from the  republic budget. It is no secret that in 1993 we were to receive  25 billion rubles. But then in connection with making the budget  more precise this sum was decreased to 15.9 billion rubles. In  real terms as of the end of last year we received only 7.5  billion rubles. In assessing these resources please keep the  inflationary process in mind. In other words, we were not able  to support business in a volume of at least those 25 billion  that businessmen were counting on. I say "at least" because in  late 1993 the fund had accumulated select (i.e., deserving of  state financial support) programs and projects totalling a sum  of over 400 billion rubles.    [Sklyarov] Yes, it is not a happy picture. What are the  fund's prospects this year with regard to finances? I have in  mind the needs as well as the possibilities for receiving assets.    [Petrov] As concerns last year's debt to the fund from the  budget, this sum has been established at 7.8 billion rubles. We  are making attempts to obtain it, but realistically we can hope  for only 5 billion. Naturally, the fund's need for budget  allocations are much greater this year. We have added them up,  and the results have been included in the draft, "Programs of  Federal Measures for Government Support of Small Business in  1994-1995," which was submitted to the government for  examination.    What sums figure into this document? The fund is requesting  19 billion rubles in 1994 in order to implement measures to  create an infrastructure that will support business (the  formation of a normative base, a financial infrastructure,  systems for providing information to small businesses, for  training and retraining of personnel, and so forth). In other  words, this sum is needed to create and begin the support  mechanism on the necessary level. The second part of the  program, which is related to the direct implementation of  regional plans and programs to which the fund has decided to  contribute financing, is assessed at slightly less than 588  billion rubles. But this is a general total and requires  clarification. According to the resolution on the Fund to  Support Business and the Development of Competition, our share  in financing regional projects and programs cannot exceed 50  percent of their cost. Thus the 588 billion rubles consist of  the following according to source of financing: 153.8 billion  rubles -- the assets of the businessmen themselves; 170.2  billion -- from local budgets; 65.1 billion -- expected income  in an amount equalling 5 percent of privatized federal property;  7.7 billion -- planned income from invested fund assets; 3.5  billion -- expected clear income from the sale of bonds, which  we are preparing to issue; and finally, 206.56 billion rubles --  planned allocations directly from the republic budget.    [Sklyarov] The sum is actually not that large if we compare  it to those trillions of rubles that the government intends to  pour into the giant branches. But if we compare it to last  year's 25 billion, of which the fund received just a trifle,  then realistically how can you expect to receive a sum that is  tenfold larger?    [Petrov] There is hope. I can tell you that on 3 February  the  government examined the draft for the federal program to support  business, which I have already mentioned. This year that was the  first program to be fully approved by the government. Of course,  Minfin [Ministry of Finance] raised considerable objections  regarding the figures. I want to clearly state that we plan to  allocate 206.56 billion rubles from the budget for partial  financing by the fund of regional programs and projects. In  response to Minfin's objections, Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin  stated, "We must find the assets. Businessmen cannot do without  government support."    [Sklyarov] These are pretty words. The government has not  been lacking in such words before...    [Petrov] How can I answer here? Where money is invested is  determined, naturally, by the government's politics and not by  words...    [Sklyarov] All right, let us try to be optimistic and let us  imagine that the fund has received these 200 billion. Now we  have the question of effectiveness of use. How dependable is the  mechanism for bringing the assets to specific businessmen? We  know, for example, that considerable amounts of government money  allocated to support farmers reached the land in a very thinned  out form.    [Petrov] You see, our fund's goal is much broader than  simply  putting money into specific business programs and projects. This  money must be returned to us, and in a somewhat increased  quantity. By share participation in financing we are not simply  giving away assets; we are investing them and providing credit.  Yes, the fund has a non-commercial structure; our credit is  issued at a percentage that for the times may seem symbolic to  some. Sometimes our credit may be percentage-free. But repayment  conditions are immutable. This is one of the basic principles of  fund operations. And believe me, we are not at all interested in  "loosing" the money that is allocated by us, or in having it  thrown to the wind, especially since the situation involving the  receipt of budget allocations by the fund are far from what is  desired.    Who specifically controls the allocation and movement of our  credit and how? It all begins with a careful selection of  programs and projects submitted to the fund. This is carefully  overseen by the fund's supervisory council, consisting, as we  know, of representatives of several ministries and committees.  At this stage the main task is to select projects that  correspond to government economic priorities, that are precisely  worked out and well-justified, that are capable of providing an  adequately rapid return, that facilitate the production of goods  and services needed by the market, and that are capable of  repaying our credit. Further, the fund's general bank agent,  Mezhekonomsberbank [International Economic Savings Bank] and its  local bank agents carry out direct operations to credit and  control the use of these assets.    [Sklyarov] And who in the chain of "general bank  agent--regional bank agents" guarantees credit and is  responsible for its repayment?    [Petrov] This depends on the credit scheme, of which there  are four. Regional programs and projects are usually financed in  the following manner. Mezhekonomsberbank, acting at our fund's  behest, provides interbank credit to its bank agent, and the  latter concludes a credit contract directly with the credit  recipient. In this case the bank agent guarantees the issuance  and repayment of credit with Mezhekonomsberbank as the fund's  representative. In the second scheme Mezhekonomsberbank itself  becomes the bank agent for projects selected by the fund. It  then becomes responsible for credit repayment and we guarantee  issuance of credit. The third scheme is similar to this but  differs in that with the fund's guarantee Mezhekonomsberbank  issues credit from its own assets. The last scheme has to do  with the fact that the fund can transfer a portion of its assets  to the general bank agent for trust administration, establishing  only the direction of financial projects. In this case all  credit responsibility is placed on the bank. But we are not yet  utilizing this variant because the fund does not have sufficient  assets at its disposal.    [Sklyarov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, the press has been critical  of the fact that of last year's 7.5 billion rubles received by  the fund, you directed 2 billion into Mezhekonomsberbank's  charter fund instead of crediting these assets to businessmen.  What can you say about this?    [Petrov] Are these expenditures justified? Let us take a  look. By moving into the bank's charter capital as one of the  main founders, the fund will thereby considerably expand its  financial possibilities, since the bank takes upon itself  obligations that will enable it to do the following: to provide  bank guarantees to small enterprises for obtaining credit in  commercial banks, to increase assets for providing credit to  small business using assets of the general bank agent itself, to  administer the bank business support system, and finally, to  receive a dividend from investment capital and in the form of  income for bank guarantees provided to small business, thus  increasing the fund's financial resources. I can tell you, for  example, that according to the average monthly balance in our  Mezhekonomsberbank current account, the fund receives an income  that is double that of the bank's regular clients.    It is all well and good to provide credit for business  projects and programs. But world experience proved long ago that  effective government support of small business and its extensive  development are impossible without the creation of the  corresponding infrastructure, an integral part of which is  credit-financial, insurance and leasing organizations. Since  there is no one but our fund to deal with this problem on a  federal level, we will continue to seek and invest assets in  infrastructure development.    [Sklayrov] I think that you yourself have heard criticism  from businessmen that the fund operates secretly, that it is  difficult to receive an answer from you regarding why you accept  or reject a particular project for financing and  correspondingly, regarding where fund assets go.    [Petrov] I have already mentioned the criteria for the  selection of projects. I should note that most businessmen  simply submit poor quality materials to the fund. It happens  that they request considerable sums without explaining how they  intend to spend them. Naturally, we do not even look at such  requests. In addition, I think you will agree that regardless of  the financial possibilities of our fund there will always be  businessmen who are "insulted" as well as those who "are lucky  enough" to receive our support. We will always have to make  choices regarding which projects to give preference to.    [Sklyarov] Could you mention some small businesses which  have  already been "lucky enough" to receive aid from you?    [Petrov] There are no secrets here. This includes Kaluga's  "Progress" TOO [limited liability partnership], to which we gave  credit to create a mini-bakery. "Alfa" AO [joint-stock company]  of Belorechensk, Krasnodar Kray, which has production and  storage facilities, received credit to procure equipment for  producing soy milk and other soy products, including livestock  feed. Penza's "Karteks" AO, which has experience in  manufacturing equipment for mini-mills and churns, was allocated  capital to begin manufacturing potato-processing complexes. In  the city of Zheleznodorozhnyy, Moscow Oblast, "Uchprofprom" TOO  received our credit to produce furniture for schools and  children's institutions. We provided capital to "Kredo" AO of  Zlatoust, Chelyabinsk Oblast, to manufacture bactericidal  irradiation equipment used in medicine as well as in livestock  raising.    We can spend a great deal of time enumerating recipients of  fund support. I will say only that as of late January of this  year we have already provided credit for 24 projects totalling  approximately 5 billion rubles.    [Sklyarov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, how do you feel about  creating a type of advisory council for the fund, made up of  representatives of public associations, small businessmen,  scientific experts and specialists? Perhaps this would diffuse  mistrust and criticism among businessmen with regard to the fund?    [Petrov] The resolution on the Fund to Support Business and  the Development of Competition that was confirmed by the  government does not call for this at all. But we are keeping the  creation of such an organ in mind. How to implement it is  another matter. This is not as simple as it seems. You know that  in Russia we have countless numbers of all kinds of unions,  associations and organizations for small businesses, many of  which are phony structures that do not represent any MP [small  business]. But all of them demand government support, especially  financial. All of them are pulling the blanket up over  themselves. This is why as of now we do not see how we can  create a public organ within the fund and keep our joint work  constructive.    I think that right now we must simply more broadly inform  the  public and business circles about the fund's operations. I hope  that EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN will help us in this.    [Sklyarov] Don't worry about this, as long as your side  continues to have an interest in doing this. Thank you for the  interview.</p>

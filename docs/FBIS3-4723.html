			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 25 (YONHAP) -- South Korea registered a  current-account surplus in 1993 for the first time in four  years. Nonetheless, the prospects for the coming year are not  necessarily bright because imports are expected to increase  sharply as economic growth speeds up and increasing foreign fund  inflows will strengthen the won's value on the foreign exchange  market.    Together with anticipated high inflation, these factors will  in turn blunt the competitive edge of Korean products on world  markets. In addition, the yen's continued strength, which has  helped sharpen the competitive edge of Korean exports, remains  uncertain in the coming year.    The Bank of Korea on Friday reported a current-account  surplus of 450.3 million U.S. dollars for 1993, a striking  reversal from the deficit of 4.528 billion dollars recorded the  year before. A favorable trade balance and decreased  remittances abroad thanks to the real-name financial transaction  system are credited for the turnaround.    The surplus was the first since the 5.054 billion dollars  recorded in 1989. In the four years from 1986, the nation had  enjoyed a favorable balance of international payments thanks to  the three lows -- low oil prices, low wages and a weak won. In  the ensuing three years, however, South Korea suffered  current-account deficits due chiefly to high wages and failure  in industrial restructuring, with deficits of 2.179 billion  dollars in 1990 and 8,727 million dollars in 1991.    In 1993, exports rose 7.8 percent to 81.023 billion dollars  on a balance-of-payments basis and imports edged up 2.1 percent  to 78, 946 million dollars to produce a surplus of 2,077 million  dollars, compared with a deficit of 2,146 million dollars in  1992. The favorable trade balance was attributed to a two-digit  increase in exports of heavy and chemical industry products and  an upturn in light industry exports.    The transfer account also recorded a surplus of 712 million  dollars, up from 232 million dollars in 1992: Outward  remittances fell from 1,744 million dollars in 1992 to 1,569  million dollars as a result of the real-name financial  transaction system, while inward remittances rose from 1,817  million dollars to 1,825 million dollars. But invisible trade,  including insurance and transportation, continued to suffer a  deficit last year, though the amount fell from 2,614 million  dollars in 1992 to 2,339 million dollars.    The transportation account incurred a deficit of 3.029  billion dollars, while travel and investment-yield accounts  suffered deficits of 589 million dollars and 1,339 million  dollars, respectively.    So Pyong-su, a research economist at the Bank of Korea,  predicted a current account surplus of up to 1 billion dollars  this year, saying shipments of light industry goods and exports  to advanced countries are emerging from the doldrums.    Increasing inflows of foreign capital on the strength of the  economy's growth pace are feared to cause the won to appreciate  in the foreign exchange market and this, together with uncertain  price movements, makes it hard to make a reasonably accurate  prediction for the coming year, he added.    In capital transactions, a surplus of 6,751 million dollars  was registered thanks to rises in foreign fund inflows for stock  investment, in overseas issues of corporate bonds and other  debts and in short-term trade credit.    The central bank's foreign exchange holdings rose 3.11  billion dollars to 20.26 billion dollars last year from 1992.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Arts: Irina Arkhipova - Recital The veteran Bolshoi mezzosoprano, Irina Arkhipova, was already a Soviet star in the 1950s. (You can hear her Carmen recorded live at the Bolshoi in 1959, in a performance sung all in Russian save for Mario del Monaco, who sings Don Jose in Italian.) She has long been an international star, and in the international repertory; I well remember her incisive Azucena in a 1975 Covent Garden Trovatore. Her gleaming voice, its rapid vibrato so characteristic of a tradition widespread in Soviet postwar singing, can be heard in many recordings, especially of music by the late 19th-century Russian masters. Today, when the voice has lost much of its force and edge, she is still an authoritative artist. On Friday, accompanied by Ivari Ilya at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, she sang an all-Russian recital with her particular combination of calm and attack. Swathed in heavy purple, with an ugly bow at her breast that looked like an embalmed wren, she stood and delivered, with a simple minimum of airs and graces. The vibrato is slower these days, the voice greyer, and she does not really sing louder than mezzoforte. And she needs music - neither too taxing nor too undemanding - that is a proper vehicle for her gifts. At first, in five songs by Gretchaninov, she made no great impression, and the songs appeared to be merely stock sentimentality and run-of-the-mill Russian soul. But she made greater interpretative inroads into five songs by Arensky. Especially in 'A sky of blinding blue,' 'Was it so long ago to magical sounds' and 'The garden is all in bloom,' she revealed how variously she can still deploy her tones. Always an assured mistress of phrasing, she constantly contrasts firm attack with sure note-to-note portamento to expressive effect. It was no surprise that she was at her best in nine Tchaikovsky songs. Tchaikovsky not only wrote more sensitively for the voice than other Russian composers, he was also a more natural communicator. The two jewels of Friday's recital were in complete contrast: the amorous serenade 'In the bright light of dawn' and the desolate 'Once more, as before, alone'. The rapture of the one and the hopelessness of the other emerged with riveting intensity. Arkhipova has the complete simplicity of the true grand manner, and its easy range of nuance. She showed it again in the first of her two encores - the Countess's scene from The Queen of Spades. Disdain, pride and age all coloured her every utterance; and then, as she recalled Boieldieu's 'Je crains de lui,' she went straight for the erotic affliction that so marks this opera. Bitterly and hauntedly she sang it the first time; tenderly but resignedly the next.</p>

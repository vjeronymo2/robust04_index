			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lebanese Forces [LF] Commander Samir Ja'ja' said at  a news conference that certain security and military units  raided two LF headquarters in Zuq Mikha'il and the al-Nubin Club  center which they had raided two days ago and forced the  officials there to leave the buildings. He said that after  contacts with a number of officials, we opted to keep silent for  a while and to allow quiet diplomacy to resolve the issue so  that it may not be misinterpreted. We maintained this stance  because we believe that through dialogue, understanding, and  discussions we may find serious solutions to all problems,  whereas other means would lead nowhere.    Ja'ja' said that certain state officials began about 10 days  ago to point the finger at the LF as responsible for the bombing  of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church and other bombings. He wondered  if it is possible to try a case before a court hearing even  begins. He pointed out that the recent statement issued by the  Internal Security Forces Directorate looks as if the explosive  charge was prepared at the LF main headquarters. He asked: If  this is true, is it possible to occupy the center? He said that  the case should be referred to the judiciary to hear the case  and hand down a verdict, because accusing people falsely is  inadmissible.    Ja'ja' stressed that the LF, as always, will side with  justice to the end. He pointed out that the LF has offered  10,000 martyrs in defense of churches in all Lebanese areas, and  wondered if it is reasonable for the LF to bomb a church  anywhere.    Ja'ja' noted that what is happening these days may be the  last link in a chain before suppressing political freedoms in  Lebanon. He said: As for me, the situation is very clear.  Every time a security incident occurs, it is used as a pretext  to take further security measures to apply more pressure on the  opposition parties, individuals, and politicians instead of  hunting down the perpetrators.    He wonders if political opposition is not allowed in  Lebanon.  If it is not allowed, he said, let them say so clearly so that  everyone will shoulder his responsibilities. He added: We set  forth our basic demand at the first news conference we held  after the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church: We want to  learn who bombed the church. He hoped that the state would find  the perpetrators. He said that the judiciary will decide this;  otherwise, why do countries take judicial measures in such  cases? He said: We truly wish that the case be referred to the  judiciary to hand down its verdict.    Ja'ja' said that the bombing of the church led to the  deployment of security forces in LF centers and surrounding  Ghidras [LF headquarters], although the investigations for the  past 10 days have not led to the bombers. He called for finding  the culprits responsible for the crime of bombing the church and  proceeding with judicial measures to find the culprits.</p>

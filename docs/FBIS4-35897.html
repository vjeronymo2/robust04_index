			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zuhayr Qusaybati: "Talabani Tells AL-HAYAH: </F> Revolutionary Guard Backing Barzani and Hizballah Forces"]    [Excerpts] London -- Clashes have broken out in north Iraq  again. Jalal Talabani, secretary general of the Patriotic Union  of Kurdistan [PUK], has told AL-HAYAH that the Iranian  Revolutionary Guard is supporting the Kurdistan Democratic Party  [KDP], the Islamic Movement, and the Revolutionary Hizballah,  which is led by Adham Barzani, with artillery and rocket  bombardment. He told AL-HAYAH over the telephone from his  residence in Damascus that Turkey has opened the border between  Zakho and the    A spokesman for the KDP (led by Mas'ud Barzani) has rejected  the accusation that the party is tacitly allying with the  Islamic Movement. He accused the forces of Talabani's party of  launching "three attacks on KDP positions on Tuesday  night/Wednesday morning, thus violating the cease-fire" signed  between Talabani's party and Mas'ud's party.    Talabani said that the KDP violated the agreement and  attacked Halshu [as transliterated] in Qal'at Dizah (north Iraq)  from the Iranian area of Sar Dasht on Wednesday, supported by  the Islamic Movement and Revolutionary Hizballah. The  Revolutionary Guard offered artillery and rocket support. He  added that KDP forces "launched an attack last Monday in the  al-Jabal al-Ahmar area, Kalaw Qasim [as transliterated], and  Bani Haris, and that the attack was repulsed."    He pointed out that "Iranian intervention" in the fighting  in  the Iraqi-Iranian border areas "is now clear. We have requested  authorities in Tehran to stop sending groups into our areas, but  to no avail." [passage omitted]    Talabani accused Barzani's party of preventing the delivery  of food and medical supplies from Zakho to Irbil,  al-Sulaymaniyah, and Karkuk. He said that he had addressed "an  appeal to Barzani to prevent the violation of the cease-fire  agreement," [passage omitted]    In the same context Hushyar Zibari, member of the KDP  Political Bureau and the Kurdish administration's representative  in Britain, has denied that "the Revolutionary Guard has  infiltrated into Iraqi Kurdistan." Zibari told AL-HAYAH over  the telephone from Washington yesterday that linking Iran and  Islamic movements with the issue (fighting) is like throwing  dust in the eyes." He said: "We challenge the Patriotic Union  to show us any of the Revolutionary Guard elements said to have  been captured." He described the fears that Talabani might be  attacked as "delusions which do not justify delaying his return"  to north Iraq. He stressed that Barzani "telephoned Talabani  and sent him messages asking him to speed up his return and  guaranteeing his safety, but he (Talabani) always changes his  mind." [passage omitted]</p>

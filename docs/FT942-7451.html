The company is forecasting turnover of R795m and earnings of R32.6m for the current year. In a calculation based on 45.1m shares in issue, audited pro forma earnings for the year to March were 64 cents a share. Net asset value was 384 cents a share. Argus Holdings and JCI directors will retire from the Argus Newspapers board prior to the listing and Mr Liam Healy and Mr James Parkinson, managing director and financial director of Independent, will join the board.</p>

			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Business turns to a Mercosur sunrise: David Pilling weighs Argentina's prospects in a customs union about to take effect The jitters afflicting currency and share markets have yet to undermine Argentine confidence that the most important economic event in the near view is Mercosur - the customs union that will from Sunday weld Argentina's market to that of Brazil, as well as to those of Paraguay and Uruguay. Brazil, a market of 150m and Argentina's largest trading partner, is witnessing a 'vigorous recovery of demand', thanks to the initial success of the Real currency plan, says Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentine economy minister. Meanwhile, consumption in Argentina is levelling off. 'The macro-economic asymmetry (with Brazil) has completely changed,' he says. When Mercosur was born in 1991, Brazil was in near-hyperinflationary recession while Argentine consumer demand was booming, the minister says. Now the reverse is so, providing a welcome boost to Argentine exports, which are already showing signs of picking up strongly. The shift might just be enough to ease what many foreign investors regard as a crucial weakness of Argentina's restructured economy - its vast trade deficit, set to top Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.5bn) this year. 'Without doubt, Mercosur will start to be an important motor of growth,' says Ms Debora Giorgi, an economist at Alpha, an economic consultancy. Alpha expects that, in 1995, Argentine exports to Brazil will leap by Dollars 1.4bn to about Dollars 4.2bn, and that Argentina's trade deficit with its giant northern neighbour - this year expected to be Dollars 1.1bn - will be wiped out. In 1996, Alpha says, exports to Brazil will surge again, to Dollars 6.1bn. Baring Securities expects the 'Brazilian effect' to help reverse the trend of Argentina's widening trade gap. Next year, Barings is predicting, the overall deficit will shrink by Dollars 500m to about Dollars 5.0bn. Argentine exports expected to do best, according to Alpha, are natural gas, wheat, flour, sunflower oil, milk products, cars and autoparts, textiles, leather goods and fish. Provinces on the Brazilian border, many of which are among Argentina's poorest, as well as the milk and wheat-producing zones of Santa Fe, Cordoba and Buenos Aires further south, should receive a particular fillip, it says. There is already evidence (largely anecdotal) of a year-end surge in exports to Brazil, produced largely, says the Broda economic consultant, by a 37 per cent appreciation of the Real against Argentina's dollar-pegged peso. This gives Argentina what Broda calls a 'phenomenal trading advantage', helped further by the leap in Brazilian consumer demand thanks to the slaying of hyperinflation. Mr Marcos Devoto, a food analyst at Santander Investment, gives the example of Argentine cheese producers who cannot buy enough milk to supply the resurgent Brazilian market. Customs officials on the frontier are reported unable to keep pace with the rush. Mr Devoto says that Brazil today is experiencing what happened in Argentina in 1991 when the destruction of hyperinflation unleashed pent-up consumer demand. The impact of the formal start of Mercosur itself is expected to be less dramatic. Although free trade for the majority of goods within the Mercosur bloc will start on Sunday, in practice most items already face only minimal tariffs after recent reductions. 'There will not be an explosion in January,' says Mr Cavallo. 'It's a continuation of what was begun in 1991.' One change that could have a marginally negative impact on Argentine hopes to raise competitiveness - and hence exports - is the end of duty-free imports of capital goods. Argentina, which has tried to encourage its dilapidated industry to re-equip with modern machinery, must now bow to the demands of Mercosur's common external tariff, in particular to the wishes of Brazil. Because Brazil wants to protect its own capital goods industry, Argentina has been forced to agree to a gradual increase of tariffs on such items to 14 per cent by 2001. Even so, Argentine companies show every sign of having taken advantage of their opportunity. Capital goods imports went up by 60 per cent to Dollars 3.3bn in the first seven months of 1994 against the equivalent period of 1993. Partly because of this, the government expects exports to increase by 20 per cent next year. Some companies have also been thinking ahead, in terms of taking advantage of new Mercosur-driven opportunities. Cargill, the multinational commodity trader with important operations in Brazil and Paraguay (in Argentina, too, where it is the biggest food exporter), is 'already evaluating ways of exploiting the synergies,' according to Mr Hugo Krajnc, public affairs manager. He believes, however, that traditional wisdom, which regards Argentina as naturally strong in the food sector and Brazil as the obvious regional centre for mass-produced consumer items, may be flawed. 'Without (the distortionary effects of) inflation, the real competitive advantage may turn out to be quite different,' he says. Most analysts agree that some Argentine companies will suffer and that the need for greater competitiveness may throw more people out of work. Unemployment is already high. 'The profound productive transformation being set in motion by Mercosur could be painful for many,' says Alpha. Brazilian industrial muscle will force Argentine companies to specialise in their areas of strength, it adds. 'All this integration is definitely likely to reallocate industry,' says Mr Krajnc at Cargill. 'The end of this film has not been seen yet.'  --------------------------------------       ARGENTINE EXPORTS TO BRAZIL          millions of USDollars  -------------------------------------- 1988                             608 1989                           1,124 1990                           1,423 1991                           1,489 1992                           1,671 1993                           2,791 1994 (estimate)                2,800 1995 (prediction)              4,200 1996 (prediction)              6,100  -------------------------------------- Source: Indec, Alpha  --------------------------------------</p>

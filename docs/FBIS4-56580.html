			<p>BFN     [Text] Senator Bernard Sansaricq says he is against any  form of armed intervention in the crisis. In the opinion of the  president of the unofficial office of the upper chamber, who  calls for the formation of a competent government aimed at  getting the country out of the deadlock, the solution must be  Haitian. The Clinton administration is divided as to the  strategy to adopt concerning the Haitian crisis, according to  Sansaricq, who claims Republican support for implementation of  Article 149. The statements by former U.S. President George Bush  bear witness to that.    Article 149 is the only solution to the crisis, according to  Sen. Sansaricq, who condemns possible reinforcement of the  sanctions on top of an already difficult situation. The embargo  has already caused irreparable damage to the country: 50,000  deaths, according to the Grand'Anse senator, who appeals to the  conscience and patriotism of the Haitian head of state for the  lifting of the sanctions. Let us listen to Bernard Sansaricq.    [Begin Sansaricq recording, in Creole] There may be a  military intervention in Haiti. This has been requested by  several U.S. senators and several members of the Black Caucus in  the United States. It is with this objective... [pauses] For  example, the recent visit to Haiti of Reverend Thomas Ferguson,  who is a Black Caucus member from the Republican Party, clearly  indicates that there are several sectors within the U.S.  Government; there are sectors, especially the Republican Party,  that support what we are doing in the Senate of the Republic.    President Bush made a statement yesterday. What he said was  very eloquent. He told President Clinton: Let Haiti be Haiti.  [previous four words in English] Let Haiti be what it is, let  Haitians find the solution to the problem by themselves. Let us  Haitians take the necessary steps to solve the problem by  ourselves.

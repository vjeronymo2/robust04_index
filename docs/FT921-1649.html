			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Japanese group to buy County Hall A CONTRACT for the sale of County Hall, the empty headquarters of the former Greater London Council, to a Japanese company, will be signed today, Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, announced yesterday. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said yesterday he was 'outraged' that the London Residuary Body (LRB), the organisation responsible for winding up the affairs of the GLC since its 1986 abolition, intends to sell County Hall to Shirayama Corporation, a private Japanese company, for development into a hotel and leisure centre. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said yesterday that the sale 'will signal that the government has given up hopes of winning the election'. He added: 'It appears to be sabotage against a future Labour government's hopes to keep the building in the public sector.' Mr Heseltine said: 'The LRB has a duty to secure the best price it can for the assets of the former GLC and Ilea (Inner London Education Authority). I was aware that the negotiations were reaching a conclusion, but I decided that it would not be approriate for me to intervene.' He stressed that the contract contained an option which would allow the next government not to proceed to completion. The LRB offered the buildings, on the south bank of the Thames near Westminster Bridge, for sale in 1990 after following the abolition of Ilea, County Hall's last tenant. The London School of Economics, which is believed to have offered about Pounds 100m for the main building and three smaller neighbouring buildings, said yesterday: 'We were assured by the Department of the Environment that nothing would be finalised until after the election'. Planning permission is available for the site only if all four buildings are developed. Shirayama is believed to be interested only in the main building, for which it is understood to have bid Pounds 60m. Mr Mark Fisher, Labour arts spokesman, recently welcomed the LSE's plans for County Hall. 'It is important that we regard the use of the site as a matter of public gain and not private profit,' he said. Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, has also been sympathetic to a sale of the buildings to the LSE. But Sir Godfrey Taylor, chairman of the LRB, is understood to have favoured a sale to the private sector. Proceeds from any sale will be redistributed amongst London's boroughs. Shirayama has seven employees and is capitalised at Y100m (Pounds 43m). It owns land in Osaka and in 1989 acquired a Madrid hotel for Pounds 48m from Bass. It participated in a previous bid for County Hall.</p>

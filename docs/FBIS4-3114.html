			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- The main headaches for  Beijingers these days are how to rein-in the influx of  outsiders, and control dogs and the rising prices.    At a recent meeting of the municipal people's congress,  participants raised some 300 queries, mostly on these three "hot  issues".    Sources here said that the prices of daily necessities have  recently risen at an unexpected rate in the capital.    Talking about prices, Mayor Li Qiyan said that freeing  prices  by no means implies giving up control. On the contrary, active  and forceful steps must be taken to keep prices down, including  economic, legal and necessary administrative measures.    He said that while efforts should be made to ensure the  supply of farm and sideline products, such as grain, vegetables,  meat, eggs and milk, emphasis has to be placed on distribution  and circulation to ensure market supplies.    A reserve system for major sideline products and a market  risk fund must be set up in order to steady the price of daily  necessities whenever they go too high, he added.    Any change in the market price should be closely monitored  by  using a price analysis system, the mayor said, adding that  regulations concerning profiteering must be established.    Meanwhile, with the deepening of the country's reform and  opening to the outside world, more and more job hunters and  business people from every part of the country, especially from  the vast rural areas, are pouring in the capital city hoping to  make their fortunes.    This causes a lot of problems in the aspects of public  security, birth control and traffic that upset the local  residents, who used to enjoy a peaceful life.    According to a senior justice official, there are nearly two  million outsiders in Beijing now, forming some non-Beijinger  ghettos in the districts, such as "Zhejiang village" and "Henan  village".    The official said that a handful of these outsiders have  turned to crime.    A survey conducted in 1993 shows that outsiders accounted  for  as high as 80 percent of the total criminal offenders in the  city.    But, the official said, the outsiders on the whole play an  important role in the capital's construction.    They are mainly engaged in the catering trade, repairs,  garment making, baby-sitting and nursing, and cleaning, he said,  adding that they have made great contributions to enlivening the  capital's markets and making life more comfortable for the city  dwellers.    Speaking of the control and management of outsiders, Deputy  Mayor Meng Xuenong said that there is an urgent need to  establish an effective registration system for outsiders.    The number must be put under strict control in terms of the  city's capacity of administration and the demand of the labor  market, he said.    A more unusual problem for residents of the capital is dogs.    Nowadays, more and more families tend to keep pets, dogs in  particular.    However, the dogs also disturb the normal life of  Beijingers,  a local resident said, biting people and causing disputes.    Statistics show that dogs injured more than 30,000 people in  the city last year.    A suggestion for solving this problem put forward by the  deputies to the municipal peoples' congress is to register and  immunize pet dogs. Fierce dogs should be banned completely,  they said.    To ensure that Beijingers live and work better in a better  environment, Deputy Mayor Zhang Baifa said the municipal  government will put these problems on its agenda for this year's  comprehensive urban management.</p>

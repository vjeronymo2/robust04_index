			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Arts: Sex, death on the fringe - Edinburgh SEX AND death were already to the fore in the first bunch of plays the Traverse presented during this Edinburgh Festival. They are more so in the five plays that have now joined the Traverse repertory. In Brad Fraser's The Ugly Man, they are conjoined. Fraser is the Canadian author of Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love (an award-winner recently seen at the Hampstead theatre); The Ugly Man, which is shown here by the Canadian troupe One Yellow Rabbit, is his modern-day version of The Changeling, re-set on a farm in the mid-west. And camped up. The original Changeling point about the heroine's gathering hunger for depravity is underlined here with schematic clarity - but Fraser has added a gay subtext, and he has sex scenes on stage. Whereas The Changeling is straight melodrama, The Ugly Man plays melodrama for laughs - slightly creepy laughs. Which could work brilliantly, but needs playing more pithy than most of the Yellow Rabbit performance give it. Blue Night in the Heart of the West, by James Stock, first shown in London in 1991, tells a weird story about a Scotman's journey to Nevada and the crazed web of incest and morbidity that trap him there. Well, maybe it was high time to put the Henry James scenario (American innocents caught in decadent Europe) into reverse. And it is a hoot, after the urgent but wordless open-air scene of sexual intercourse that began the play, to hear the man (his trousers still down) address the woman as 'Mom'. But I could see no overall point to this psychosexual horror story. Its jokes, its horrors, its psychological revelations all seemed incidental, and I never knew where the play's core lay. Crossfire (1989), by Michael Azama and translated from his French by Nigel Gearing, is presented by Paines Plough. It is all about death, and in particular the innocent victims of political killings (war etc), seen just before and after the moment of their demise. Anna Furse directed. I found that the play consisted of either seemingly natural dialogue paced with zero spontaneity or utterly unspontaneous dialogue delivered with creepily natural pacing; and, after an hour of stony boredom, I used another Fringe event as my genuine excuse to leave. Call Me Susan, by Jean Findlay, is all about prostitutes, and manages to be exceptionally dull, pretentious and phoney for all its 70 minutes. Mainly it involves two high-class prostitutes talking about the trade in bored, sub-Socratic dialogues. In between these droning conversations (badly spoken by Kate Beswick and Findlay herself), you hear the taped voices of real-life European prostitutes. You cannot believe how deadly this fascinating subject becomes; but take my word for it. Enough of sex, enough of death. Bloodstream, by Andrew Buckland and presented by Mouthpiece and the Market Theatre Company (South Africa), has neither. Though I began by finding it trite and unoriginal, it gradually had me happily hooked. It is a cartoon piece of green agitprop about the man who is about to cut down the last tree on earth; it is also a journey-through-the-body adventure comedy, told largely in mime, about two rebel bloodcells' quest to reach (and change) the woodcutter's mind. No, nothing about this is especially novel or profoundly adult. Andrew Buckland and Lionel Newton are, however, performers of such zest, impishness, virtuosity and commitment that they become irresistible. Their's is a Moving Picture Mime Show style, full of 'kersplosh' sound effects as they swim through, or impersonate parts of, the human physique; but they also have lively, neatly satiric, text, loaded with a relentless supply of puns (the body politic, cardiac arrest). Bloodstream is agitprop as cartoon fun: a surprising and welcome combination amid an otherwise lurid and morbid scene. The Ugly Man, Blue Night in the Heart of the West, Crossfire, Call Me Susan, and Bloodstream all continue at the Traverse until September 4.</p>

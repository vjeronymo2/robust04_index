			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD held early gains on the London bullion market and pushed above initial resistance at Dollars 331 a troy ounce in late trade, but was expected to find Dollars 332 a much tougher barrier. Dealers said the market had rallied on stop-loss buying by weak shorts and some covering ahead of today's European options expiry. The dollar's soft tone and a report that China's central bank had bought a large portion of the huge Dutch gold sales in 1992 were also supportive. Chinese buying lifted the COPPER market out of its recent neutral range on the LME. The trend was aided by option buying and talk that there was likely to be a strike at Enami's Ventanas smelter after today's strike vote. The rise took three-month metal above resistance around Dollars 2,250 a tonne, with final business at Dollars 2,258, up Dollars 30. The London COCOA market was depressed partly by chart-based selling in New York, although the weakness of sterling and signs of industry demand helped to limit losses. Compiled from Reuters</p>

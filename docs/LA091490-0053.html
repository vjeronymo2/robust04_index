			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DRAWING BOARDS;  </P> <P> SURF'S UP AT BENEFIT FOR GROUP AIDING SANTA MONICA BAY  </P> <P> Not canvas, not clay, the medium was the surfboard, and the message was: Heal  the Bay.  </P> <P> More than 100 artists, including Lita Albuquerque, Peter Max, William Wegman,  Laddie John Dill and Joni Mitchell, were asked to create original works on  surfboards to benefit the nonprofit group, dedicated to saving Santa Monica  Bay.  </P> <P> At Monday night's opening, surfboards of every description -- luminous,  ominous, sensual, whimsical, wheeled and even crucified -- leaned or hung on  the walls of Santa Monica's James Corcoran Gallery.  </P> <P> It was an extraordinary quiver, as wave-riders call a collection of boards, and  it drew more than 500 visitors, 65 of whom paid $50 for a chance to win one of  the more or less functional art objects.  </P> <P> Like so many Westside openings, it was like a movie -- a movie with a lousy  plot but a really great cast.  </P> <P> "Is Justine here?" someone asked, alluding to actress and environmentalist  Justine Bateman. Justine wasn't there, but actor Raul Julia was, touring the  exhibit with artist friend Muramasa Kudo, whose board features a beautiful  swimmer, an octopus and an exhortation, in Japanese calligraphy, to clean up  the seas. Julia is concerned about the oceans, he said, though he has never  actually climbed atop a surfboard and ridden a wave. "Water skiing is as close  as I ever got."  </P> <P> With his splendid head of blond hair, actor and former child evangelist Marjoe  Gortner drew almost as many stares as the startling board by Tim Smith labeled  "Jesus Christ, Surfer Star."  </P> <P> "He looks like a lion tamer," one woman whispered as Gortner circled the  gallery.  </P> <P> Surfers, artists, activists and people who were some of each converged at the  opening, unified by their alarm over the worsening quality of Southern  California beaches, the ones the whole world dreams about.  </P> <P> Long after most Westside infants had been tucked in, a few toured the gallery,  riding a parental hip.  </P> <P> "What are these children doing up?" an observer asked.  </P> <P> "Art babies," another explained.  </P> <P> "This is such a worthy cause," said actor Michael Nouri, who contributed a  board inspired by a Masai warrior's shield. "When I can't go swimming after  it's rained, in a body of water that is so beautiful, there's something wrong.  It's a microcosm of what's going on all over the world."  </P> <P> Actor Russ Tamblyn and wife Bonnie both contributed to the show.  </P> <P> She is an illustrator, and her board was a tribute to her late mother, a  painter. In a poignant bit of recycling, Bonnie Tamblyn used her mother's  paints to depict the goddess Gaia embracing the earth. "I got to journey again  with my Mom," she said of the project.  </P> <P> A star of David Lynch's TV phenomenon "Twin Peaks," Russ Tamblyn said he had  begun painting in earnest in 1964. Until then, he said, "I was too busy  dancing." Tamblyn said he was influenced by artists George Herms (another  contributor) and the late Wallace Berman, who worked in the early '60s in  Topanga Canyon. "I had been a Sunday painter before that. After that, every day  became Sunday."  </P> <P> Like the boys and girls on the beach in their Bodygloves, the artists could opt  for various shapes for their boards. Tamblyn chose a symmetrical board, on  which he repeated an image of an old man in a boat nursing a white-winged bird.  He had seen the basic board in a book. When he discovered it was called a Lynch  double-ender, he decided "it's definitely the one for me."  </P> <P> Observer Peter McAlevey mused about the significance of the show. This wasn't  just another gathering of the pretty people, sipping gourmet water and free  vodka and pretending to be fascinated by the work on the walls. McAlevey, a  30-something vice president for production with Stonebridge Entertainment, said  surfing is one of the ruling metaphors of our times.  </P> <P> "Surfing is to our generation what the West or the frontier or outer space was  to an earlier generation. It's emblematic of the better world that could  exist."  </P></p>

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / The sun also rises in Colindale: Neil Buckley finds philosophy at the heart of Europe's first Japanese shopping mall IT IS not just a range of products from octopus tempura to kimonos that sets apart the Yaohan Plaza, the first Japanese shopping centre in Europe, from home-grown competitors. For the Yaohan Corporation, creators of the Pounds 50m centre which officially opens today in the somewhat unlikely location of Colindale, north-west London, claims its business is underpinned by philosophical teachings. Mr Kazuo Wada, its chairman, is an adherent of Seicho no ie, or the Human Enlightenment Movement which espouses beliefs combining elements of Buddhism, Christianity and Shintoism, and emphasises the infinite potential of people if they co-operate to create harmony. Yaohan's mission is 'to serve customers all over the world with gratitude'. It is certainly aiming to serve the shoppers of north London with products they may never have seen before. One part of the complex is a 60,000 sq ft retail development (the size of the biggest UK food superstores) operated by Yaohan, including a complete Japanese supermarket, and a 200-seat oriental food court selling everying from sushi to Chinese dim sum. For UK customers not sure what to do with miso (fermented bean paste, used for soups or flavouring), wasabi (strong Japanese horseradish) or daikon (large white radishes), there are recipe cards in English, and regular classes in Japanese cuisine. About 70 per cent of goods will be imported from Japan, although some Japanese vegetables may be grown in Europe. The other part of the complex is a 82,000 sq ft mall with units rented out to tenants including Japanese bookshops, travel agencies, a beauty parlour and an optician's, a London-Tokyo property agency and the UK's biggest computer game centre, operated by Sega. Yaohan's main target is London's 30,000-strong Japanese population. Mr Toshio Tajima, UK managing director, says research has shown there are 10,000 Japanese families in its target area, each spending about Pounds 3,000 a year on their groceries. Yaohan aims to pick up 50 per cent of that spending in its supermarket - Pounds 15m a year. It also expects to pick up a fifth of the estimated Pounds 30m spent on groceries by London's other Asian and Far Eastern communities, or Pounds 6m. The shopping mall is forecast to have an annual turnover of Pounds 19m, making Pounds 40m for the whole complex. The company hopes to attract not just the oriental population. 'We do see ourselves as ambassadors,' Mr Tajima says. 'We want to introduce Japanese culture to local residents - starting with food.' Yaohan began in 1930, supplying hotels in the resort town of Atami, near Tokyo. It started retailing in 1956 but decided in the early 1970s that high opening costs and intense competition in Japan made it sensible to look abroad. A successful Yaohan store in Singapore in 1974 became the foundation to create the biggest store chain in south-east Asia. It also operates stores in the US. If London is successful, it hopes soon to persuade French customers to swap their crepes for okonomiyaki in Paris, and Germans to swap bratwurst for sashimi in Dusseldorf.</p>

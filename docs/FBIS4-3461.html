			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 20 (XINHUA) -- An international  syndicate consisting of six foreign banks and a Chinese bank  will provide a loan of 36 million U.S. dollars for a project to  manufacture polypropylene in China.    The loan is being made by the China Dalian West Pacific  Petrochemical Company (WEPEC), a joint-venture of China, France  and Hong Kong.    The agreement was signed at the Great Hall of the People  here  today.

The loan was arranged and lead-managed by the Shanghai  branch  of the ABN Amro Bank of the Netherlands. Other participants  include banks from Australia, Germany, Singapore, Italy, the  Middle East and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank of China.    Among those present at today's signing ceremony were Gu  Xiulian, China's minister of chemical industry, D.J. Van Houten,  Dutch ambassador to China, and Igno van Waesberghe, regional  manager for North East Asia of ABN Amro Bank.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Councils may try new governing structures LOCAL AUTHORITIES in England are to be allowed to experiment with different models of government and to grant councillors greater allowances to do it, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, announced yesterday. The proposals come from a joint working party involving representatives of all the local authority associations, the government and aca - demics. Councils have been deliberately left without a fixed model and instead have been invited to experiment with different structures. The proposals include: Replacing the existing committee structure with a more 'executive' mode of government. Creating deliberative committees drawn only from the ruling party, or ruling coalition. Further decentralisation of decision-taking. New rights of review and scrutiny of decisions for councillors. Enhanced roles for councillors outside the executive. The proposals are intended to allow 'backbench' councillors a scrutiny role similar to that of parliamentary select committees. Proposals for directly elected mayors, mooted by Mr Michael Heseltine when he launched the review as environment secretary in 1991, have been removed from the agenda. The allowances system will be amended so that central government lays down only a basic minimum. Mr Gummer said that this would attract more people to seek election and allow broader accountability. The leaders of all the local gov-ernment associations - the Labour-controlled Association of County Councils and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, and the Conservative-controlled Association of District Councils - welcomed the proposals. They were addressed by Mr Gummer at a conference on the plans at Westminster, and in a joint statement said: 'The report offers a loose framework within which new approaches can be tried out, and is a welcome alternative to government enforcement of change. 'The recognition that allowances to members need to be improved, with more discretion for authorities, is long overdue.' But Mr Gummer received a hostile reception at the conference when answering councillors' questions. Responding to questions about the removal of schools from local education authority control, he said: 'I'm fed up with local authorities who talk about 'our schools'. I think it should be local people making decisions. 'If I'm going to fight for subsidiarity for local government it won't be helped by people who say they want to get their hands back on things which can run themselves.'

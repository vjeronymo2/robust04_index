He said: At present, in the struggle against  anti-human affairs and the creation of an independent movement,  the Islamic Republic has gained valuable and long-term  experience which could become a model for the freindly and  peaceloving countries of the world.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: Iran's foreign policy does not  pursue any other objective but prosperity for the oppressed  nations and the promotion of Islam, and is not contaminated with  those selfish policies currently practised in the arrogant world.    Referring to the Hebron mosque incident, the president said:  Since the formation of Zionism in the world, there has been more  wars, economic pressure, destruction of man-made and natural  resources, and more instances of harm to popular regimes and  revolutionary states. This issue must be investigated and  studied by diplomats so as to adopt a proper stand against it.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed confidence that the Islamic  ummah, through extensive participation in the international  Jerusalem Day rallies, will demonstrate another proper response  in the face of this horrific crime.    At the start of this meeting Foreign Minister Velayati  presented a report on special courses for training foreign  diplomats.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Mitterrand in Sarajevo: Message to Europe and France PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand, with his surprise flight from the European Community summit in Lisbon to Sarajevo, intended to make a spectacular gesture of support and solidarity for the suffering people of Bosnia-Hercegovina, his aides said yesterday. The most immediate practical purpose of his dramatic visit was to clear the way for the arrival at Sarajevo of two French Transall C-160 transport aircraft, loaded with medicines, rations and other humanitarian supplies, which took off from Toulouse and Orleans yesterday afternoon. But there seems no doubt that the French president was also seeking to deliver a strong political message to his own domestic audience, to offset the prevailing impression that the outside world is impotent to halt the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. Like other European leaders, Mr Mitterrand has become distressed at the bombardment of the Bosnian capital and the loss of life. 'This catches us by the throat,' he said in Lisbon on Saturday, and called for a strong reaction by the European Community. On paper the Community leaders did produce a strong reaction, with a declaration which explicitly laid most of the blame for the Yugoslav crisis on the Serbs, and held out the possibility of the use of military force, if only in the pursuit of humanitarian aims. In declaratory terms, this statement represented a marked shift from the traditional French line, which has tended to oppose any categoric condemnation of Serbia, and sought to stress the priority of diplomatic negotiations. But French officials are concerned that the new firm tone of the EC communique may not sufficiently impress French public opinion, at a critical moment in the run-up to the Maastricht referendum in September. In particular they are worried that the EC may appear almost completely impotent in the face of the Yugoslav crisis, despite the Maastricht Treaty's declared ambitions to develop a common European foreign and security policy. At his closing press conference in Lisbon on Saturday, Mr Mitterrand rejected the implication that the Community was failing to live up to its new ambitions. The Maastricht Treaty had not yet been ratified, he insisted, so the EC had not yet assumed its new competences in the field of foreign and security policy. The French political establishment reacted to his surprise trip with confusion and ambivalence. Mr Jean-Francois Deniau, of the centre-right UDF group, said his initiative was 'rather good', but it was not the president's job to distribute aspirins. Mr Bernard Stasi of the Centrist party said 'Bravo]', but Mr Francis Bayrou, secretary general of the UDF, said the president should not have taken an individual initiative. Mr Mitterrand's plan to fly to Sarajevo was not in fact a sudden impulse, it emerged yesterday. He kept it a secret from the other European leaders, and even from most of his own officials, until the closing minutes of the Lisbon summit. But the idea had been taking shape in his mind since earlier in the week. It firmed last Thursday, after he met the French philosopher Mr Bernard-Henri Levy, who passed on to him a personal appeal for help from Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. This is not the first time President Mitterrand has made a surprise dash into dangerous territory, for the purpose of delivering a strong political message. In 1983 he made an equally spectacular trip to Beirut, after the bomb attacks against French and American forces in Lebanon, as a gesture of moral support.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Ivanchikov under the rubric "Dead Ends </F> of the CIS": "If Ukraine Does Not Get Russian Gas, Nobody Else  Will"]    [Text] As we plunge into the ocean of international  intrigue, we should always be mindful of the eventual reefs and  shoals. Russia has already hit one such reef. The impact was  quite painful.    The decision to resume the delivery of Russian gas to Kiev  would have been made even had the recent negotiations in Moscow  between a government delegation from Ukraine and the Gazprom  management not resulted in any specific agreements. The Russian  side did not have any other way out of this situation. There are  a few reasons for that. An export product pipeline to the West  runs through Ukrainian territory. As soon as the Russian side  reduced the delivery of fuel to Ukrainian customers, the latter  began to use "gray" exports more vigorously. Besides, being  aware that theft cannot go on for a long time, they pumped so  much fuel into gas storage facilities, just in case, that it  will suffice for the entire spring and summer period and more.    The largest German consumer of Russian gas, the Ruhrgas AG  concern, warned as if in passing, at the beginning of the  Ukrainian-Russian "gas war," that Ukraine may tap into export  flows and begin to take export gas for its consumers. For this  reason, Ruhrgas AG has taken measures to offset possible losses  due to reduced gas deliveries to German consumers. This  statement came in as the first alarm call for Gazprom.    In general, Kiev displayed enviable composure when faced  with  the "cut off the gas to Ukraine" situation. The president of  Ukraine, who was paying an official visit to the United States,  declared that suspension of deliveries of Russian gas would not  only bring about the complete stoppage of Ukrainian industry but  would also seriously complicate the execution of agreements on  the removal of strategic missiles to Russia.    It was no accident at all that the moment at which Moscow  chose to reduce deliveries of gas to Ukraine coincided in time  with Mr. Kravchuk's visit to Washington. The Russian side, which  cannot get the upper hand in the conflict with the obstinate  Ukrainians, would want to internationalize the conflict in the  hope that the world community would influence Ukraine and force  it to make concessions. However, no official response to this  action of Russia followed in the United States. It was rather  the other way around. It was quite symptomatic that Washington  allocated Mr. Kravchuk $350 million in credit, despite the fact  that Kiev has long had the poor reputation of a deadbeat  defaulter. In diplomatic parlance, this is called moral support.    There is no state program for development of the fuel and  energy complex in Ukraine. Why? Because it does not fit the  arrangement whereby the International Monetary Fund extends $1.5  billion in credit to Ukraine. On the eve of Kravchuk's overseas  visit, American newspapers quoted a high-ranking Western  diplomat: "They (meaning the leadership of Ukraine) have been  told specifically that assistance should not be given to state  enterprises that are going under." Another quote: "The  Government of Ukraine has acknowledged that it has sharply  increased financial assistance to state enterprises; this may  become an obstacle in the path of the extension of Western loans  which Ukraine badly needs." According to some projections by  American special services, "the recession in Ukraine amplified  by regional confrontation may bring about civil war and  disintegration of the republic." A vicious circle emerges. If  the economy of Ukraine falls into the abyss--and in the absence  of foreign credit and investment it definitely will--the  situation will be in line with the scenario of the American  special services. If the Ukrainian leadership does not finance  state enterprises, stagnation in industry is unavoidable, which  will be followed by a social explosion and possibly civil war.  Does Russia need a civil war on the territory of an immediate  neighbor, which on top of this has nuclear weapons?    It is known that decisions to suspend delivery of energy  resources are always political. Therefore, Gazprom could not  have made it independently, without supreme sanction. The  reconnaissance in force indicated that the suspension of gas  deliveries to Ukraine promises Russia nothing but a headache.    The Moscow agreements, which were hastily concluded  (literally a few days after making the decision to reduce  deliveries), may, if they are honored by the Ukrainian side,  encourage certain hopes for stability in the form of joint  ownership of underground storage facilities and main gas  pipelines on the territory of Ukraine. (This occurred in  Estonia, where Gazprom owns 30 percent of Estgaz.) Besides, the  so-called Turkmen scenario has also been activated (an analog to  the expected agreement between Kiev and Ashkhabad [Ashgabat])  whereby Ukrainian debts will be paid by counterdeliveries of  merchandise and equipment, including for main gas pipelines.  However, Gazprom, which should become the owner of at least  one-half of the property of enterprises converted to joint-stock  operations, may be bitterly disappointed because foreign  property in Ukraine is not protected by legislation. This is why  the chief of the Russian Gazprom, Rem Vyakhirev, admitted after  the negotiations that these agreements are not all that  advantageous for Ukraine. Despite the fact that Ukrainian Deputy  Prime Minister Valentin Landik stated peremptorily that come  April all consumers of Russian gas will switch to prepayments,  the temptation to go on stealing is too great.    After all, it has reached the point where managers at many  enterprises have denied access to their compounds to Ukrgazprom  representatives who were supposed to disconnect hundreds of  nonpayers from the gas distribution network.    This whole Russian-Ukrainian "gas war" also has an "Asian  front," or more precisely, a Turkestan front, which for some  reason is not mentioned. After all, Turkmenia [Turkmenistan],  which failed to receive $844 million for gas delivered to  Ukraine, does not wish to resume deliveries for now. The  economic aspect of this decision is clear, but a political  aspect also exists.    It appears that the confidence of the Turkmenbashi [Leader  of  the Turkmen] in transforming his republic into the first  economic tiger of Central Asia has begun to diminish, although  the official propaganda of Ashkhabad continues to instill in  citizens the notion of the prompt prosperity of the land.  However, miracles do not happen. A look at the yardstick of the  currency market of Turkmenia would suffice to ascertain this.  The real ratio of the manat to the Russian ruble is as follows:  At the bazaar, 1 manat may be purchased for 45-50 rubles, which  is several dozen times less than the officially established  rate. For this reason they will be forced sooner or later to  agree to painful measures aimed at cutting back budgetary  expenditures there. The Turkmenbashi, as the father of the  nation for at least the next decade, will have to explain to his  subjects why his government is forced to resort to unpopular  measures while carefully avoiding the combination of words  "shock treatment." The insolvency of Ukraine may be one of the  central arguments in such an explanation. Since the "Turkestan  front" is located in the southern backyard of Russia, the latter  has resolved to close it down. According to some data, the  AvtoVAZ [Volga Automotive Plant] (?!), which is experiencing  great financial difficulties itself, is buying the Ukrainian  fuel debt from Turkmenia. While they are going through the  motions, the Russian Gazprom undertook to make up 80 percent of  the loss to Ukraine from the shortfall in the delivery of  Turkmen gas out of its own resources.    We will not have to wait long for a new turn of events: The  deadlines for the payment by Ukraine of the financial segment of  the debt, which was coordinated in the classified part of the  protocol of the Moscow meeting, must be determined in April.    In any event, at present Russia is doomed to deliver  gas to its nearest Slavic neighbor and suffer financial losses  in the process if it does not want to pay for a civil war in  Ukraine tomorrow. Such are the disturbing lessons of the  post-Soviet political economy.</p>

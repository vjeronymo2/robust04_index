			<p>BFN     [Text] The capital of Cuanza Norte is now calm following  clashes over the past few days. The government forces expelled  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  soldiers from the outskirts of the city to a radius of about 70  km. During the follow up operations, 400 Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FALA] soldiers were killed and others fled  in disarray. Our correspondent reports from the area:    The UNITA rebels are dispersed, that is why they stopped  shelling the city with long range weapons. The Angolan Armed  Forces, National Police, and civilian defense are successfully  conducting the follow up operations with the aim of widening the  defense cordon for a radius of action over 30 km of the city so  that the population may search for food in secure conditions.</p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Private-sector pay 'beating inflation' THE FALL in private-sector pay settlements appears to have ended with awards bottoming out well ahead of the inflation rate, in spite of government hopes that pay growth would continue to slow, Incomes Data Services says. In its analysis of wages published today the pay research group says that nearly two-thirds of private-sector pay deals over the past three months have been in the range of 2 per cent to 3.9 per cent, compared with less than half in the previous three months. The proportion of pay pauses and freezes is declining - none was recorded in June and only four were recorded last month compared with 35 in January. The proportion of settlements resulting in freezes fell from 5.3 per cent in the February-April period to 3.6 per cent in the latest three months. IDS says in its quarterly executive pay award survey that rises for managers are also bottoming out, running at an average of just over 3 per cent in the May to July period, the same as in the previous three months. Nearly 40 per cent of awards were between 3 per cent and 3.9 per cent. The median increase in managerial pay awards was slightly under 3 per cent while managerial salary pauses and freezes fell from 18.8 per cent during the second quarter of the year to 8.5 per cent for the three months ending in July. IDS says: 'This steadying of management awards may indicate that that pay pressures on companies are easing as a result of improved economic expectations.' The IDS analysis of pay awards across the economy shows 'the vast majority' of private-sector pay deals over the summer were 'well ahead of the rate of inflation', which was 1.4 per cent last month. Examples of relatively large settlements include merit rises averaging 4.75 per cent at Scottish Equitable. In the public sector most workers are settling within the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit, although a few local authorities have awarded higher rises through performance-related deals. 'It is clear that the government's 1.5 per cent limit is generally sticking,' says IDS. However, Unison, the biggest public-sector union, is to ballot more than 500,000 white-collar council staff this week over the government's 1.5 per cent limit. They include social workers, librarians, planners, as well as those employed in housing, careers and school administrative offices. They are to be asked to vote for an initial six days of strike action over a six-week period starting on October 4. Mr Alan Jinkinson, Unison's general secretary, said: 'This ballot is about the right of our members to have their pay determined by free collective bargaining and not by government diktat.' Voting will take place between August 26 and September 24 and the result will be announced on September 27. IDS Report No 647, IDS, 193 St John Street, London EC1.</p>

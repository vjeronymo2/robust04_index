			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F> Serbian Krajina, by Dragoljub Stankic in Knin on 22 March --  recorded]    [Text] [Stankic] Could you give us the first comments on  the negotiations in Zagreb so far?    [Martic] Well, we left for these negotiations with a clear  aim. First of all, to establish a halt of [changes thought] to  stop all hostilities, therefore, to establish peace, then to  decide about the territory that has been temporarily occupied by  Croatia in the January aggression in 1993 and in September. We  also wanted to talk about the dumping of nuclear waste on the  territory of western Slavonia, which is also occupied at the  moment.    As things stand so far, I think that we cannot be satisfied  as talks have taken another direction. Croatia obviously wants  to impose itself on our delegation there with a degree of  threat. It says that (?these are the stands) of both the United  States and Russia, something that we do not believe. As our  delegation in Zagreb reported to us, the Croatian delegation is  now demanding that all our formations disarm themselves and the  like. We certainly cannot accept that, but we will still remain  at the negotiations to take advantage of all opportunities to  reach peace.    [Stankic] What do you think about these demonstrations that  are now held in front of the Russian Embassy in Zagreb? We  heard new reports: There are a lot of people there who are  demonstrating.    [Martic] I consider that to be a method of pressure on our  delegation so that, under this horrible pressure, they would  give in and sign that paper. However, the people from our  delegation are firm, stable, and know exactly to what limits  they can go and why they have left. Nobody, including them, can  sign something like that.    [Stankic] [words indistinct] all kinds of pressures on the  Serb delegation and obviously this pressure on Serbs. It seems  that this is how they would treat the Serbs in Croatia if they  remained in a sort of autonomy.    [Martic] Well, you have both asked the question and provided  the answer yourself.    [Stankic] Finally, let us say what your expectations are?  How will these negotiations end?    [Martic] Well, I nevertheless expect Russian diplomacy to  take more initiative here and to really comply to what it said  when it invited us to go to the Zagreb negotiations and that is  to establish all hostilities [as heard].    [Stankic] Let us return once again to the negotiations in  Zagreb and the Serb side's platform. This is the problem of the  occupied regions in Krajina and the problem of western Slavonia.    [Martic] As for the occupied territories, the answer is  known. We have had agreements before, when Croatia signed that  it would withdraw from the occupied territories, but they soon  refuted all the agreements they signed and have not respected  them.    [Stankic] How do you, Mr. President, see the final solution  in these regions?    [Martic] I expect that, in future, we shall hold  negotiations at the International Conference on the former  Yugoslavia. I expect us to find solutions there. However,  whatever direction the situation may develop, we cannot go lower  than our [word indistinct] and that is the people's right to  self-determination. We have a parliament, a government, and a  president and these are legally elected institutions [words  indistinct]. We also have the people, who certainly will not  and cannot allow our territory to be returned to Croatia.  However, we shall allow this last referendum to be held before  the international public -- the people should express its own  will about with whom it wants to live. We cannot withdraw from  this principle of self-determination.</p>

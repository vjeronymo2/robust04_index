			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Beijing opposed to cabinet posts for Hong Kong Democrats CHINA yesterday made its most direct intervention yet in the politics of Hong Kong when a senior official said Beijing would oppose the appointment of any member of Mr Martin Lee's United Democrats to the colony's Executive Council, or cabinet. Mr Guo Feng Min, the Chinese head of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), said in Beijing yesterday that such appointments would not be conducive to the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Mr Guo was speaking after the 23rd meeting of the JLG, a meeting which was noteworthy for the Chinese departing from the agenda to remind Britain that the Basic Law - the Chinese-drafted constitution for Hong Kong after 1997 - would not be amended before the handover to provide for more directly elected seats to the colony's legislature. Mr Guo's remarks were an attempt to limit the room for manoeuvre by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor-designate, before he arrives in the colony on July 9. Mr Patten was widely expected to bring Mr Lee and some of his colleagues into his cabinet. The Democrats represent most of the democratically elected politicians in the colonial legislature following last September's elections. But Mr Guo's remarks make plain what many have long suspected: that Beijing sees no role in Hong Kong's political life for the Democrats, whose involvement in anti-Chinese government activities after the June 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising has made Beijing deeply suspicious. Last night, the Hong Kong government issued a brief riposte. A spokesman said that 'appointments to the Executive Council were entirely a matter at the discretion of the governor.' China's intervention in local politics came on the day when four members of Hong Kong's cabinet broke ranks with the government and issued a paper calling for cuts to one of the core projects in Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport development. The decision by the four, all members of a conservative grouping known as the Co-operative Resources Centre, will give added comfort to Beijing which is arguing with Britain about the cost of the airport. This week's meeting of the JLG produced no sign of when and where China proposes to meet Britain to discuss the issue of airport finance. Mr Allen Lee, Mrs Celina Chow, Mrs Rita Fan and Mr Edward Ho joined 16 other members of the CRC to call for cuts of HKDollars 5.5bn (Pounds 380m) in the cost of construction of a railway that is planned to link the urban areas of Hong Kong with the colony's new airport at Chek Lap Kok. Their proposals would cut the cost of the railway from HKDollars 22.2bn to around HKDollars 17bn in March 1991 prices. Their call marks a reversal by the four who, as members of the governor's cabinet, approved the financing plans for the airport and related projects earlier this year. Mr Ho is also a director of the MTRC, the government-owned entity which has contracted to build and finance the railway. Their break with government policy throws into question their continuing membership of the cabinet. It also undermines the position of those who have been objecting to Mr Martin Lee's membership of the cabinet on the grounds of his refusal to observe 'collective responsibility'. The government said it would study the CRC's paper and consult the MTRC as to its feasibility. An MTRC executive said last night that the changes proposed would damage the financial viability of the project.</p>

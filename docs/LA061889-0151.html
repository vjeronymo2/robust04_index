			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEMP SAYS LOYALTY TO REAGAN CURBS CRITICISM OF HUD  </P> <P> Housing Secretary Jack Kemp conceded Saturday that being a Ronald Reagan  supporter has made him less willing to blame his predecessor publicly for years  of abuse now being uncovered within his department.  </P> <P> Noting the partisan ethics controversies swirling in the nation's capital, Kemp  turned aside repeated attempts in an interview to get him to fault Samuel R.  Pierce Jr., head of the Housing and Urban Development Department under  President Reagan.  </P> <P> "There were problems, there was mismanagement, there were programs that were  abused and there was political influence going on a lot longer than just the  eight (Reagan) years," Kemp said on CNN's "Evans and Novak" program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cites 'Systemic Flaw'  </P> <P> "There was a systemic flaw that had to be corrected," he said, using a phrase  he then emphasized several times. "I am outraged at what I have found at HUD  but, again, I am going to put the blame as much as possible on those systemic  problems that were allowed to exist."  </P> <P> Pressed on the question of responsibility at the top, however, the former  congressman said: "I'm not trying to shift the blame, but I don't want to get  into name-calling. . . . This is an atmosphere in which some people would like  to use it in a partisan way, and I'm a Republican, a strong supporter of the  Reagan Administration."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Years of Abuse Found  </P> <P> News reports and congressional hearings have begun to uncover years of abuse,  fraud and embezzlement in HUD programs.  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh issued orders last week for investigations at every  local HUD office in the nation, searching for millions of dollars lost,  diverted or stolen in recent years.  </P> <P> Kemp said on the CNN program: "Where there are criminal acts, they will be  fully prosecuted. Where the system is flawed, I will correct that system. . . .  "  </P></p>

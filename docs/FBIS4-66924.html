			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dominique Garraud: "Mitterrand: `After Me, No </F> More Nuclear Tests'"]    [Excerpts] Yesterday, the head of state reaffirmed his  primacy regarding defense matters by issuing a statement  opposing any resumption of nuclear tests. In his opinion, the  next president of the Republic will have to maintain the  moratorium, for "France will not want to offend the world."    Francois Mitterrand has an acute sense of provocation.  Yesterday, in an unprecedented move, the head of state gathered  in the banqueting hall of the Elysee [presidential palace] 200  people directly concerned with the nuclear deterrent, including  army commanders, industrialists, scientists, members of  Parliament, and ministers. With the exception of Jean-Pierre  Chevenement, all his former defense ministers were there, as  well as current Defense Minister Francois Leotard. However,  there was no Edouard Balladur, who was elsewhere, officially for  obscure reasons regarding the use of time. [passage omitted]    As the guardian of a De Gaullian dogma regarding deterrence,  Francois Mitterrand reaffirmed the pillars thereof: "The key  aim of deterrence is to avoid war by safeguarding the integrity  of national territory and ensuring the defense of our vital  interests," he professed. As for the notion of the "final  warning" which emerged in the sixties, it is a "terminal  warning" which must not be led astray and become some kind of  "nuclear artillery."    Looking at Francois Leotard, the head of state proved  menacing on the subject of the government's majority. "Mr.  Defense Minister, you intend to tell the National Assembly that  it should provide itself with the means of response or attack  against the weak or crazy. Should we use nuclear weapons  outside our territory or apart from our vital interests? Must  we rally to the adherents of the surgical, or even decapitating,  nuclear strike? And why not a nuclear gun? To me that would  seem to be a major heresy. There is no way I will accept it.  And if an amendment in this sense came to be adopted, it would  lead to a major conflict which the French people would have to  decide on." Clearly, he was threatening to dissolve the  Assembly.    The paradox is that this risk would appear to be  infinitesmal. While Edouard Balladur remains very discreet on  these issues, Francois Leotard will mark his opposition to any  measure that would result in nuclear weapons becoming an  everyday feature. And in the Assembly, the committed proponents  of decapitating nuclear strikes, led by RPR [Rally for the  Republic] member Jacques Baumel, can be counted on the fingers  of one hand.    By stating his views ceremoniously, Francois Mitterrand  reiterated that nothing concerning the policy of nuclear  deterrence can be done without him. In passing, he will  certainly trigger several skirmishes within the government's  majority against the excessive lenience supposedly shown by  Edouard Balladur toward the president.    The provocative aspect of Francois Mitterrand's speech is  not  insignificant just before the parliamentary debate on defense  issues. However, yesterday's exercise will go much further than  the end of the upcoming parliamentary debate. "The movement  calling for nuclear disarmament is healthy," said Francois  Mitterrand, voicing his support for a renewal of the nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and a "universal, verifiable"  treaty banning tests. And that will not necessarily be the  vision of the next president of the Republic, especially if his  name is Jacques Chirac.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Deficits stifling initiatives: Bundesbank's Issing warns of threat to economic growth THE world's public sector finances are in no state to support collaborative efforts to promote economic growth, Mr Otmar Issing, a senior Bundesbank director, said yesterday. The rhetoric might appeal to the media, but strategies such as the European Community's growth initiative, agreed at the Edinburgh summit last December, led all too easily to 'loose money policies' - mainly with borrowed funds, he told a private meeting in Frankfurt. A new 'programmes era' appeared to have dawned, with worldwide calls for joint initiatives. The European project, for example, proposed the application of 'all available' budget policy measures, a European investment fund and new loan facilities for the European Investment Bank. But if expansive fiscal policies were capable of promoting sustained growth, the question had to be asked why this way was still not being resolutely pursued, Mr Issing said. 'The sobering answer is to be found in the lamentable state of public finances.' Budget imbalances had worsened last year, partly because opportunities for consolidation during better times had not been taken, he claimed. Average EC deficits and debt ratios increased to 5.5 per cent and 63 per cent respectively of gross domestic product in 1992. New peaks would be reached this year when, apart from Luxembourg, all member states would be further than ever from meeting the convergence criteria laid down for economic and monetary union (Emu). To avoid possible misunderstandings, Mr Issing said he was not against policies directed at common interests. However, he wanted to warn against 'high expectations and illusions'. In a renewed defence of the Bundesbank's much-criticised strategy, he also warned against using interest rates and monetary policy as political instruments to rouse flagging economies. Referring indirectly to frequent reminders offered to the Bundesbank that it had an overall economic responsibility and that interest rate cuts were needed to promote growth, he said that the more lending rates were used as political instruments, the more stability suffered. 'More liquidity instead of more capital would enter circulation.' In the end, monetary policy would have fulfilled its intended role but finance and pay policy would probably have not, Mr Issing claimed. In a thinly-veiled warning to his German audience, he said those who set most store by stable money would suffer most. Monetary policy would lose its credibility and a core economic asset would have been gambled away. After three recent reductions, Bundesbank policy-makers are rapidly using up their current room for manoeuvre on official interest rates, and are tending increasingly in speeches and policy statements to turn up the pressure on government and pay negotiators. The central bank's annual report was sharply critical of recent budget shuffles which instead of cutting public spending added the equivalent of 2 per cent of gross national product to German tax and welfare contributions.</p>

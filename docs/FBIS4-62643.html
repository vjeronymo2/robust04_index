			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Karlov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 17 May -- While being in possession of  powerful technologies and facilities for processing and  recycling toxic waste, the West, nevertheless, prefers to export  this waste to other countries in Africa, South America, East  Europe, or the CIS, which do not have such facilities. This is  not an economic move but a purposeful political action in order  to save themselves from the harmful anthropogenic effects of the  waste. The West sees Russia as the preferred candidate for a  world garbage dump, Valeriy Timofeyev, representative of the  Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service, said today at a  meeting of the interdepartmental commission for ecological  safety of the Russian Security Council.    Judging by the report made by Aleksey Poryadin, first deputy  minister for the protection of environment and natural  resources, there are causes for concern. Russia produces  annually about 7,000 million tonnes of waste, of which only  2,000 million (28 percent) are then used in the national  economy. To date, 1,600 million tonnes of toxic waste have  accumulated in the country. The situation that has come about  in Russia with the formation, use, de-activation, storage, and  burying of waste results in irreversible damage to the natural  environment and poses a real threat to the health of Russian  people.    Russia already has "waste storages" that can cause  ecological  catastrophes, but despite this, the import of foreign toxic  substances to this country continues. There is an increasingly  clear tendency to conclude deals on importing and recycling  dangerous waste under the guise of foreign economic projects on  recycling raw materials to extract valuable substances or on  giving humanitarian aid.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Company reports on 'green' action urged COMPANIES should be required to publish details of their environmental policies and their performance in meeting 'green' objectives, a group of accountants and industrialists said yesterday. A report published by the environment research group of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales says the Stock Exchange and the Financial Reporting Council should consider formally encouraging companies to provide environmental information. It says any environmental factors affecting a company's policy and activities, or having a financial impact, should be regularly accounted for. The report does not reflect the official policy of the institute but Mr Ian Plaistowe, its president, says in a foreword he will ask that its governing council consider the proposals and make recommendations. The research group includes the corporate chief economist at Imperial Chemical Industries, the government's assistant auditor-general, and several business and academic accountants. The report says that as part of the annual reporting cycle a company should publish details such as the nature and amount of expenditure on environmental objectives, and the name of the director responsible for environmental activities. It says the Accounting Standards Board should consider a financial reporting standard on environmental issues, and the Auditing Practices Board should discuss producing guidelines on environmental audits.

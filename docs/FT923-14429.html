			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Tunnel sleeper trains approved BRITISH RAIL'S plans to run sleeper trains through the Channel tunnel were given provisional approval by the European Commission. The EC's competition directorate indicated that it was prepared to let the services go ahead provided BR and its partners did not attempt to bar other train operators from setting up in competition. From 1995, trains will leave Glasgow, Plymouth and Swansea each night for Paris and Brussels. There will also be trains from London to Dortmund, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, with nightly return services. The trains are to be operated in conjunction with the national railways of France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.</p>

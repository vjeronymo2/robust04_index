			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (11): Financial sclerosis - Health care is lesss impressive than it seems MISS Yoko Hirokawa, a 19 year old student, is one of many Japanese patients who have received liver transplant operations in Australia. She went there because of the lack of fresh organs to be used in transplants. This is due to the Japanese law which refuses to define brain-dead persons, the principal source of transplant organs, as legally dead. However, although parliament is discussing a redefinition of death to allow organ transplants in Japan, the country's healthcare system may stand in the way of such innovative treatments. Miss Hirokawa had her operation only after raising ADollars 140,000 through donations and loans not covered by Japan's insurance. Such costs mean that even when transplants are approved in Japan, only those who can afford such services will be treated. The Japanese system assures broad access to care as well as low fees through cost sharing and government negotiated fees for services and supplies. However, rigid cost control methods cause mounting frustration for patients. In theory, all Japanese are covered either through company plans or national health insurance. In the US, on the other hand, 13 to 15 per cent of citizens have no health insurance at any one time. At present, 31.4 per cent of health care costs in Japan are met by central and municipal governments, 56.3 per cent by the premium payers, which includes employers, and 12.1 per cent by the patient. Comparing Japan's longevity and infant mortality rates with those in the US, the Japanese system may seem superior. In Japan, the life expectancy for men is 76 years and for women 82 years, compared with 72 for men and 78.8 for women in the US. The infant mortality rate is 4.6 per 1,000 live births in Japan, exactly half the US rate. However, a visit to a Japanese hospital for treatment reveals the negative side of this apparently impressive health system. The hospital is probably dingy and the patient will have to wait for over an hour in a crowded waiting room before seeing a doctor. There is little interaction between patient and doctor. Instead, the patient will be dismissed with a long list of drugs, prescribed with scant explanation of his illness or of the nature of the medication. Such procedures stem partly from the heavy cost controls which militate against new procedures and technology. The fee structure is determined in detail every two years by the Central Social Medical Care Council in the light of financial reviews of hospitals and clinics and the types and frequency of medical treatment. This helps to prevent sharp increases in costs, but also tends to stultify medical services. According to Pat Murdo, analyst at Japan Economic Institute in Washington DC, the council curbs costs by delaying approval to pay for new procedures and technologies. The delays have the advantage of ensuring that the government has time to ensure the effectiveness of new techniques. But critics fear that delays in diffusing new methods work to the detriment of patients who cannot afford to pay privately for life-saving treatments. Emphasis on cheaper primary treatment also helps doctors to identify symptoms before they turn into serious ailments. But such controls result in low quality service which most patients face - long waiting lists and limited communication with the physician. Meanwhile, as doctors are reimbursed for the drugs that they prescribe, they tend to overdispense. In 1991, drug costs in Japan comprised 42.7 per cent of total medical costs; in the UK they were only 11.7 per cent and in the US only 9.3 per cent. At the same time, recent efforts by the Ministry of Health and Welfare to cut official costs of older, less innovative drugs have resulted in the prescription of new drugs, especially antibiotics. The rigid reimbursement system also fails to address the wage increases and demands for shorter working hour by medical staff. Iroren - the Japan Federation of Medical Workers' Unions - asserts that medical staff are 'overburdened and scarcely able to maintain normal life and health' due to restrictions in the growth of health care costs. In Japan, there are 33.6 nurses to 100 beds, compared with 40.2 in the UK and 55.1 in the US. According to Iroren, 60 per cent of health workers work more than six night shifts a month, with the medical staff working an average of nine night shifts. Further technological advances in treatment and the ageing of the population may eventually prove too much for the health system.</p>

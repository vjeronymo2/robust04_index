			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Letter: R&amp;D needs of different sectors Sir, David Sawers' article, 'Blind faith in R&amp;D' (September 2), questions the perceived wisdom that R&amp;D investment is an important measure of future manufacturing competitiveness. The R&amp;D intensity necessary to maintain competitiveness varies markedly between manufacturing sectors. Aggregate inter-country comparisons, as presented in the article, disguise variations in importance of specific manufacturing sectors and of their differing R&amp;D requirements. Moreover, for sectors like chemicals, automotive and electronics, underinvestment in R&amp;D (albeit in conjunction with other factors) does have significant economic consequences. Between 1980 and 1988 the industrial output in electronics and electrical goods, within the US, Japan and EC combined, increased at an annual rate of 6 per cent in contrast with the UK's 3 per cent. UK companies, despite having a 4 per cent share in industrialised world electrical and electronics output, choose to spend less than 3 per cent of all world R&amp;D in this sector. This form of analysis supports the contention that focusing on industrial R&amp;D investment, in conjunction with the mechanisms for its subsequent exploitation, is a key element of any governmental industrial policy.

			<p>BFN     [Text] In today's open session of the Majles, Mr. Rohani,  the deputy speaker of the Islamic Consultative Majles described  the onslaught of the Serbs against Gorazde as yet more evidence  of the lies and deceit of international circles and the United  Nations. He condemned the silence and time-wasting of the  Security Council in response to the Serbs' aggression and said:  Of all the resolutions passed by this council, only the  resolution imposing an arms embargo on the Muslims of  Bosnia-Herzegovina is being implemented. This in itself  encourages the Serbs to further carry on with their aggression  and blood shedding.    On the downing of two U.S. helicopters by the fighters of  the  same country in northern Iraq, he said that this would lead to  instability and insecurity for all the countries of the region  and added that the downing was a result of America's domineering  policies.</p>

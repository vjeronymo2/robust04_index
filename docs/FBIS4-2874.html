			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Xu Yongqing (1776 0516 7230) and KEJI </F> RIBAO reporter Wei Hongkai (7614 3163 0418)]    [Text] Washington, 12 Apr (XINHUA) -- The one-day sixth  meeting of the Sino-U.S. Joint Commission on Scientific and  Technological Cooperation ended here today. Senior officials  from both sides in charge of scientific and technological  affairs reviewed the achievements scored in the past 15 years  since the 1979 signing of the "Agreement Between the Chinese and  U.S. Governments on Scientific and Technological Cooperation."  They also discussed new prospects for strengthening or  expanding scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation.    At the meeting, Song Jian, co-chairman of the meeting,  Chinese state councilor, and minister of the State Science and  Technology Commission, and John Gibbons, assistant to the  president for science and technology and director of the Office  of Science and Technology Policy, fully affirmed the tremendous  achievements scored in scientific and technological cooperation  between the two countries. They also signed a joint communique  of this meeting as well as a "Clean Coal Appendix" to the  "Sino-U.S. Protocol on Cooperation in Fossil Energy" and renewed  the "Sino-U.S. Protocol on Cooperation in Marine Science and  Technology."    Following the meeting, Song Jiang pointed out in a speech:  This meeting has created new conditions for future Sino-U.S.  scientific and technological cooperation. He then said: The  fruitful cooperation between China and the United States  according to 29 protocols in this regard has yielded some major,  inspiring results. Such cooperation is not only of great  significance for the two countries' scientific and technological  circles but has played an important role in promoting economic  development and scientific progress and enhances the friendship  of people in the two countries. He expressed the belief that  with the meeting's decision on the common objectives for the  expanded scale and scope of scientific and technological  cooperation, the cooperation between scientific, technological,  and economic circles in China and the United States would  certainly develop toward ever higher aims and in ever broader  fields.    Gibbons said in his speech: There are many opportunities in  Sino-U.S. scientific and technological cooperation. So it is  necessary to promote such cooperation. He then pointed out:  The Clinton administration holds that maintaining a stable  relationship with a strong and prosperous China is very much in  the interests of the United States. He said: As a Chinese  proverb goes, a thousand-mile journey is started by taking the  first step. China and the United States have taken the first  step together toward in-depth cooperation at the joint  commission meeting.    According to Chinese science and technology delegation  members attending the meeting, as one of the important  activities in Sino- U.S. relations, this meeting stressed that  both sides should expand their cooperation in the development of  cancer and AIDS medicines, environmental protection, the  exploitation and effective use of energy, and in  high-temperature superconducting materials and rare- earth  elements. From now on, Sino-U.S. scientific and technological  cooperation will focus on these four fields.    Four representatives from the American Pharmaceutical  Association, the Council of Environmental Industry, the Power  Research Institute, and the Auto Engineers Association briefed  the meeting this afternoon on opportunities for expanding the  scientific and technological cooperation between Chinese and  U.S. industries. They earnestly hoped for expanding scientific  and technological cooperation between the two governments to  enterprises.    The "Agreement Between the Chinese and U.S. Governments on  Scientific and Technological Cooperation" was signed by  then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and U.S. President Carter in  1979. Within the framework of this agreement, the two sides  signed 29 protocols in education, agriculture, space technology,  high-energy physics, industrial science and technology  management, scientific and technological intelligence,  metrology, atmosphere, oceanography, public health, hydropower,  earthquake, earth science, environmental protection, basic  science, construction and urban planning, surface water, nuclear  safety, nuclear physics, aviation, transportation and  communication, statistics, fossil energy, topography,  telecommunications, railways, protection of nature, nonferrous  metals, and land management. Within the bounds of these  protocols, relevant Chinese and U.S. Government departments have  undertaken more than 1,000 projects for scientific and  technological cooperation and over 10,000 people have exchanged  visits over the past 15 years.    According to the "Agreement Between the Chinese and U.S.  Governments on Scientific and Technological Cooperation," the  Sino- U.S. Joint Commission on Scientific and Technological  Cooperation, which guides the agreement's implementation, holds  a meetings once every two years in the capitals of the two  countries by turns.</p>

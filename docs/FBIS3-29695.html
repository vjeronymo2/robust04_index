Speaking at the Army Golf Course on 19 February about the  intrusion by Cambodian soldiers at An Ma Pass, the army chief  said should there be any new intrusions, the army will deal with  them strictly. He said the incident at An Ma Pass was not  serious because there were no houses there. Concerning the  problem of the abduction of Thai villagers by Khmer bandits, he  said he had instructed border units to deal with the problem  harshly. He said: If they are rough with us, the army will be  tough with them, no matter if they are civilians or soldiers.  The army had been mild with them because they were considered  friends. They have no reason to accuse us of supporting the  Khmer Rouge.    Gen. Wimon said Thailand suffered numerous losses from  clashes between the government and Khmer Rouge forces. Thailand  wants to see the fighting stop because it has brought  difficulties to both soldiers and civilians on the Thai side.</p>

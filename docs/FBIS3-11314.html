Luis  Fernando Ramirez, the current labor minister, was the secret ace  Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana held  up his sleeve as his candidate for the vice presidency.  Pastrana, who said he did not feel pressured by the Liberal  Party's Samper-de la Calle ticket, said Ramirez' appointment did  not show sectarianism but was a true key to the furtherance of  social and labor programs.    [Begin recording] [Pastrana] I have no doubt whatsoever  about  such a noble and loyal traveling companion. We perceive even  more clearly our future victory. [end recording]    Luis Fernando Ramirez Acuna, who was born in Santander and  is  35 years old, was selected as the star minister in the Gaviria  cabinet last year. He stood out for his struggle to get  Congress to approve the Social Security Law. He has been the  tax revenue director twice, and he soberly accepted the vice  presidential postulation today.    [Begin recording] [Ramirez] I am honored to be the running  mate of Andres Pastrana, the man Colombians are awaiting to  manage the country's future. I hope with your and all  Colombians' cooperation this country will continue on the path  to growth, progress, and optimism, the path offered by our  ticket. Today, I have the great honor of accepting to accompany  Andres Pastrana, and I do so with great pride. Thank you. [end  recording]</p>

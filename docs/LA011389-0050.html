			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SPRING VALLEY  </P> <P> A Spring Valley man already charged with killing a former Los Angeles Rams  football player during an attempted robbery in La Mesa was charged Thursday  with a second murder.  </P> <P> George Ray Cunnington, 27, pleaded not guilty to the new charge of killing  Robert Hetmer, 51, of Spring Valley several hours before the Nov. 18 slaying of  Rey Nicholas Phillinganes, 23.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Robinson told the court that his office is considering  filing special-circumstances allegations, which could lead to the death penalty  for Cunnington if he is convicted. The grounds for the special circumstances  would be that multiple victims were killed and that the Phillinganes slaying  occurred during an attempted robbery.  </P> <P> San Diego Municipal Judge Charles Patrick ordered bail to remain at $1 million.  A preliminary hearing was set for March 31.  </P> <P> Robinson said Cunnington had lived with Hetmer for several weeks before the  shooting. He said the house was ransacked.  </P> <P> Phillinganes was in his car when a gunman approached him, tapped on the window  with the gun and then shot him in the chest.  </P></p>

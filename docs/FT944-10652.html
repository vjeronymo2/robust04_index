			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (14): Elfec is a special case - Small privatisations No fewer than 72 Bolivian state-owned companies out of a total of 160 will come under the hammer in the next few months. Companies controlled by the armed forces or local municipalities, and those directly dependent on ministries remain untouched for the time being. 'The companies to be privatised are small to medium-sized so the transaction costs involved make capitalising them unfeasible,' says Mr Jorge Harriague, director of Bolivia's privatisation programme, the low-profile complement to the government's ambitious capitalisation project. 'Their economic impact may be pretty marginal, but we have to privatise fast and get the state out of commercial activities once and for all.' Companies to be offered to private investors in straight sell-offs range from run-down hotels to dairy plants, from animal feeds processing factories to a small airline. The most expensive carries a price tag of about Dollars 12m, but many are virtually bankrupt and have book values of less than Dollars 1m apiece. The whole package could fetch between Dollars 45m and Dollars 55m, according to Mr Harriague. Investor interest centres on half a dozen promising concerns. Hilanderia Santa Cruz, a yarn producer which cost Dollars 50m to build, and a sugar mill in Bermejo, top the list. The dairy plants in Santa Cruz, Cochabamba and La Paz, plus two cement factories in Sucre and Tarija, are also expected to be keenly contested. Bolivian privatisation commenced under the previous administration of Jaime Paz Zamora when 24 public companies dependent on the regional development corporations were sold by auction. The modest proceeds - some Dollars 20m - went, as the law requires, into social spending. Nine others were simply liquidated. No sales have been made so far under the Sanchez de Lozada government. A special case is Elfec, the relatively efficient state-controlled Cochabamba power distribution company. Ninety per cent of Elfec's shares, worth some Dollars 32m, is scheduled for flotation on the London and La Paz stock exchanges in the next few months. 'This will help kick-start the capitalisation programme; it's a significant milestone in the development of Bolivia's capital markets,' says Mr Peter Earl, a director of the Fieldstone Group of London, one of the architects of the Elfec offer. Elfec has had private shareholders ever since it was founded in 1908 by the Bolivian Suarez family. Ende, the state electric energy producer en route to capitalisation, presently holds 70 per cent of Elfec. The Cochabamba municipality holds a further 22 per cent; smaller municipalities 4 per cent; and the remainder is split among some 2,000 shareholders. Ende and the city of Cochabamba are expected to dispose of the bulk of their holdings. Cochabamba's city fathers plan to use the cash to embark upon a long-delayed but increasingly urgent Misicuni project: to bore a tunnel through the Andes and bring water from the Amazonian side of the cordillera to the thirsty Cochabamba valley.</p>

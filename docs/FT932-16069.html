			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market Report GOLD traded most of the day in a very narrow range on the London bullion market, apparently expecting a lead from Comex. But New York opened weaker before some commission house buying held it at the Dollars 340 a troy ounce support point in early trading. One trader noted that the market was particularly nervous after several weeks of inactivity - 'as soon as there is a move, everybody tries to cover.' London gold, silver and platinum prices ended slighlty lower. OIL markets were also nervous after Kuwait said it would produce more than its quota if other Opec countries continued to do so. The postponement of weekly API stocks data until today helped to rob the market of direction. On the LME copper's fall put NICKEL, ZINC and ALUMINIUM under pressure. Three-month aluminium fell to a 16-month lows of Dollars 1,126 a tonne, the 18,100-tonne rise in LME stocks underlining fundamental oversupply. Zinc's decline was cushioned by the recent production cuts in Mexico and Canada. London robusta COFFEE turned morning losses into gains as New York seemed content to head higher despite no fresh news. Compiled from Reuters</p>

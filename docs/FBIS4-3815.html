			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Premier Lien Chan expressed his opinions on the  Chientao Hu [Qiandao Hu] incident at the Legislative Yuan on 22  April. He said: Introspection is a motivating force for social  progress. In handling the Chientao Hu case, the government was  not overly emotional and did not try to turn it into a political  event. What the government wanted was to find out the truth and  make the truth public.    Huang Kun-hui, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,  said: Communist China can reduce the damage done to cross-strait  relations only by conducting a thoroughgoing investigation of  the Chientao Hu tragedy.    Lien Chan said: The government believes that there is  nothing more important than human life and that we should not  conduct investigations into the Chientao Hu case in a  perfunctory way. A modern country should handle things in a  modern way. Therefore, after the Chientao Hu tragedy occurred,  the government issued a forceful statement urging Communist  China to conduct a thoroughgoing investigation. During this  period, outsiders expressed their general opinions as well as  specific positions on this case. However, the government still  maintains a careful, positive, and conscientious--not simply  accusatory--attitude toward the incident.    He said that, right from the very beginning, the government  has maintained an extremely correct attitude. In response to  the questions raised by people entertaining particular stands,  he said: We cannot be ambiguous about this incident or shift our  focus somewhere else. Shifting focus is a very serious matter  which will affect the future of the country.    Huang Kun-hui said: What we needed was to get the truth  out. But Communist China tried to cover up the incident by  embargoing news reports and fabricating information. They did  not treat the victims' families in a reasonable way. All of  these actions, of course, led to dissatisfaction on our part.  As for the 1990 tragedy in which illegal mainland immigrants  died of suffocation on a boat while being repatriated, direct  responsibility did not lie with our side. However, we did  conduct an investigation and we told the mainland of the  occurrence of the incident on our own initiative. In addition,  we did pay a reasonable amount of compensation. In order to  prevent such an accident occurring again, we later signed a  repatriation agreement with the Mainland on Chinmen Island.    Meanwhile, Ku Chen-fu, chairman of the SEF, said on 22  April:  If Communist China makes public the Chientao Hu tragedy as soon  as possible without any cover-up, gives reasonable compensation  to the victims' families, and provides reasonable explanations  for the people of the whole country, then the communications  between the two sides can be reopened. Ku Chen-fu said that it  is necessary for all of us to judge whether or not the  information revealed by Communist China is correct. Ku Chen-fu  also urged Communist China not to [word indistinct] or  procrastinate.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Unita takes Huambo GOVERNMENT troops have surrendered Huambo, Angola's second-biggest city, to Unita rebels after a two-month battle, military officials said yesterday, AP reports from Luanda. Defeat in Huambo, 329 miles south-east of Luanda, is a serious setback for the government, which committed tens of thousands of troops to the battle. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said the government would seek foreign military help to subdue the rebel army, which has taken control of three-quarters of the country. Immediately after claiming control of the city, the rebels announced they would resume peace talks if the government stopped bombing Huambo. An armed band has attacked the camp of UN ceasefire monitors in the Cabinda enclave, north of Luanda. No one was injured, but all monitors will be evacuated from the region. UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has denounced the 'outrageous harassment' of the UN teams.</p>

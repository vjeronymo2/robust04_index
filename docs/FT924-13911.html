			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Volvo confirms it is near to decision on closing plants VOLVO, Sweden's leading car corporation, confirmed yesterday it will decide next month on closure of two of its three assembly plants in the country with the potential loss of 1,630 jobs. The step reflects Volvo's severe overcapacity in a shrinking car market. The plants have been operating at half capacity for some months. Their shutdown would concentrate production in Sweden in Gothenburg. A decision to close the two other plants, at Kalmar and Uddevalla, would produce an annual saving of between SKr300m-SKr400m (Pounds 42m). It was mainly due to the idealism of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's executive president, that the plants were created as showcase examples of the company's commitment to a production revolution. This involved the abandonment by Volvo of the traditional mass-assembly method of assembling cars in 1974 when it opened the new plant at Kalmar. Multi-skilled assembly-work teams were introduced and backed by computer technology in the provision of supplies. The Uddevalla plant was opened only in May 1989 at a cost of SKr1.5bn and quickly became a focus for international attention as Volvo claimed it was a complete break with the Henry Ford way of car production. It produces the 940 model at the moment. Yesterday Volvo also announced it was making a further cut of 12,000 in its car production programme for next year in response to the continuing decline in sales. This follows a decision taken two weeks ago to reduce production at the company's Ghent plant in Belgium by 4,000. Volvo said that a joint investigation was being carried out with the Swedish trade unions on the future of the Kalmar and Uddevalla plants. This will be completed early next month and then presented to the Volvo board for its final decision. It seems unlikely that either plant will remain open for much longer. Volvo insisted yesterday that any decision to close Kalmar and Uddevalla stemmed from over-capacity problems and not poor productivity or other troubles at the two plants. Yesterday's announcement from Volvo comes as no surprise. Only last week Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman and chief executive of Renault, Volvo's French partner, warned that there had to be a 'a profound restructuring' of the Swedish carmaker which would be 'painful but necessary'. In August Volvo reported a SKr103m loss (after financial items) for the first half of the year and it has continued to suffer from declining sales in the vital North American market. By the end of this year the company will have cut its annual cost level by about SKr5.2bn since 1990. The latest announcement is in addition to its earlier cost reductions.</p>

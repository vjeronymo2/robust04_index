			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / How to Spend It: At last, the no-knife face-lift - Until now women who hoped for a younger face had to be rich - and brave. Surgery was the only option. Lucia van der Post looks at a British invention, the non-surgical face-lift - painless, more affordable and non-invasive THOSE of you who are accustomed to seeing nothing but the professionally perfect faces of full-time models on the page may wonder what somebody normal, somebody much more like you and me, is doing here. She is Alice West, who has bravely agreed to show her own warm, lived-in, unmade-up face as it was before (on the left) and after (on the right) she embarked on a course of treatments that purport to do, non-surgically, for the face what a cosmetic surgeon does with the knife. Here, say its proponents, is the first real alternative to surgery, the first non-surgical face-lift. To most of us, rendered sceptical by the frequent and often conflicting claims of the cosmetic industry, this sounds rather too good to be true. Creams come and go, machines come and go, but lines, wrinkles, sagging and all the other ills that flesh is heir to tend to survive them all. To be fair, the literature put out by the team behind Perfector (the treatment that Alice West was given) does not talk of miracles. Rather it says it offers 'a completely relaxing, natural way to delay the ageing process.' Or 'a uniquely holistic face lift, toning and tightening the underlying muscles and therefore the skin.' So what exactly is Perfector? It is a smallish machine, not much bigger than an office computer. The treatment is based on sending micro-current impulses through the skin to the underlying muscle and tissue, where it speeds up circulation of the blood and lymph, leaving the skin better-toned and firmer. An extremely low voltage is applied via two hand-held cotton-tipped electrodes which are guided by the (trained) operator to stimulate the areas being treated. Micro-current techniques have been used for some time in the medical world, particularly in the rehabilitation of stroke patients, but are only just beginning to be used in the beauty world. The good news is that the treatment is entirely non-invasive and, at between Pounds 360 and Pounds 540 for the full works, it is also a lot cheaper than a full-scale surgical face-lift. I had one hour's treatment and it was as restful and peaceful as having a facial or a massage anywhere else. I certainly had the impression that I looked fresher, better-slept, more rested after it and - probably more to the point - so did my exceedingly sceptical husband. For the full effect to be seen, the whole 'face-lift' to be perfected, a course of two one-hour treatments a week for six weeks is recommended. After that a top-up once a month or so should help keep the damage at bay. Heather Kirby is a journalist who says she went along full of worldly cynicism ('Oh, yes, pull the other one,' she thought) but stayed to have the full course and is very impressed. 'First they did half my face. Then they showed me a mirror and I could see a difference, so I begged them to get on with the other half. Most of my friends say 'goodness, you look good, what have you done?' When I say I've had a face-lift their mouths drop open. My sister was so impressed that she insisted on taking me out into the garden to see me in the light. She was still impressed. I think it is a brilliant half-way house between doing nothing and surgery. It is very relaxing, it doesn't hurt and above all that Mrs Thatcher hound-dog look that I had when I woke up in the morning has gone.' Stella Mansfield, a 48-year-old divorcee, has also tried the treatments. 'I go regularly to the B Beautiful Salon in Romford in Essex for leg waxing. One day Nuala Briggs, who owns it, suggested that I try the treatment. I have never got on well with facials because I don't have blackheads or open pores but after one go with Perfector I wanted to have the full set of treatments. I didn't tell anybody what I was doing but all my friends started saying that I looked so well - they said my skin glowed so much I must be having an affair]' Though Perfector is primarily used on the face it is said to do wonders for stretch-marks and flabby muscles elsewhere. The treatments cost between Pounds 30 and Pounds 45 a session, depending on salon. For details of the nearest salon offering the treatments ring 0628-532007.</p>

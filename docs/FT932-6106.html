			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: It's better being wealthy in winter - Even the rich have to make do with jars of truffles at this time of year IT CANNOT be so much fun being rich during the summer. True, you can take off to those exclusive resorts which take pains to exclude the hoi polloi, but from a gourmand's point of view, far too much is cheap. This is not the case in winter, when the poor man's money goes on fuel. Not for him the pungent game birds of the autumnal shoots, the precious truffle unearthed from the frozen soil, the tropical fruits flown in from farmers basking in the sun on the other side of the globe. In the summer we may all live a little off the fat of the land: cheap strawberries, fresh asparagus, peas and beans; there is spring lamb on the butchers' stalls; the first gooey cheeses appear in the market made from the milk of cows, ewes and goats nurtured on grass for the first time that year; even wild salmon comes down in price so that it begins to nudge the farmed stuff and tempts the brave man to splash out on the real thing. Some things are actually free. Even in London bramble bushes yield delicious blackberries and for those with a keen eye there are masses of wild mushrooms to be gathered in the woods. A few things, however, remain gruesomely expensive. One of these is caviar. The most expensive caviar is beluga and in May the first of these little whales are culled in the Caspian Sea. In the old days they were transported across the Baltic on ships and reached Britain more than a fortnight later. Now the best stuff arrives in refrigerated lorries or is bought in Germany: the main market for both Russian and Iranian roes. This year, for the first time ever, W G White had its first beluga flown in for a lavish press breakfast at the Dorchester Hotel in London. The importance of this gesture is to convince an increasingly sceptical market that these expensive eggs are still worth the price. There has been a lot of talk of pollution in the Caspian and with the break up of the Soviet Union there has been an awful lot more dodgy caviar shipped to Britain in the bags of Polish sailors and Iranian airline pilots. How good the caviar was in the first place is open to question, but a more important issue is how well it was stored. The best caviar was always sold to the main dealers for hard currency. Only the second quality was sold on the domestic market. There is also an obvious need to keep fresh fish in perfect condition if the consumer is not to place his health at risk. With much of the caviar currently on offer this is not proven. Buy from reputable dealers only. Foie gras is another rich man's pleasure and one which is often mentioned in the same breath as caviar. This was also seasonal: you extracted the liver when you killed the goose - at Christmas. Foie gras is easier to obtain out of season these days: firms such as Georges Bruck in Strasbourg and Rougie in the Landes provide goose and duck foie gras both in tins and in fresh terrines. The UK is still well behind France, however, in the availability of fresh foie gras. Few but the very top shops go to the trouble of making their own terrines. Foie gras brings truffles to mind, but truffles are also seasonal. The first whites are dug up after the November frosts in Piedmont. The blacks come in around Christmas. The season is a short one, and it is over by the spring. Even the rich have to make do with jars of truffles at this time of the year, which generally lack the inimitable pungency of the fresh tubers. Your best bet is to buy frozen. Of course wild mushrooms are an alternative, but for the meaty cep you will have to wait for the autumn. You may find consolation in girolles (or chanterelles) for the time being. These are at their best during the summer months providing the weather is not too dry. And still the shopping basket is only half full. Acorn-fed, Iberian black pig ham is at last available in London, something which the Spaniards used to keep very much to themselves. You may buy the great poultry of the French Bresse, but you will have to wait until Christmas before you may find a capon. Minute phials of balsamic vinegar change hands for fantastic prices and some of these make their way over here. Olive oils are scented with white truffles and ceps. Miniscule pots of saffron contain the stigmas of thousands of crocuses. There are still gulls' eggs to be had, although you will have to hurry as the season is drawing to a close. And Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee? Or single domaine Darjeeling tea? Yes, there are still a few paltry pleasures to be had in the summer while you muse on the greater glories that come with the shortening days. Caviar: W G White will supply direct (tel: 081-992-8764) or from Harrods or Fortnum &amp; Mason. A meagre 50 gm pot will cost Pounds 68 from Harrods and Pounds 78 from Fortnum. Harvey Nichols obtains its caviar from Princesse d'Isenbourg and charges Pounds 45.79 for 50 gms of beluga. The same caviar may be ordered direct for Pounds 3 less (081-960-3600). The most expensive foie gras in Britain is Rougie's Mille Feuille goose liver with 6 per cent truffles at Pounds 70.50 for 400 gms. This is available from both Harrods and Harvey Nichols. Harvey Nichols does fresh foie gras from Rougie at Pounds 50.40 per lb. Harrods and La Boucherie Lamartine (071-730-3037) make their own terrines: Harrods' costs Pounds 14.95 a quarter, Lamartine's Pounds 48 per lb. Both sell uncooked livers should you wish to make your own. Frozen truffles can be bought from Harrods (one week's notice) for Pounds 28 per oz - otherwise you will have to buy jars. Lamartine's are Pounds 85 for six blacks. Fresh girolles are Pounds 18 per lb from Harrods, fresh morels Pounds 6.50 a quarter from Harvey Nichols. Black pig ham is Pounds 13.75 a quarter from Harvey Nichols, Bresse poultry Pounds 6.35 per lb from the same source or Pounds 5.50 from Harrods. Last Christmas a 7lb Bresse capon cost one Harvey Nichols customer Pounds 150. Harvey Nichols sells 100 ml bottles of 12-year-old balsamic vinegar for Pounds 32.45, Harrods has some strange German wine vinegars including an Eiswein vinegar at Pounds 36.90 for 25ml. Truffle oil costs Pounds 4.95 for 55ml from Harvey Nichols. Saffron is Pounds 1 a gm from Princesse d' Isenbourg, which flavours its foie gras with it - to interesting effect. Gulls eggs are 95p each from Harrods. Blue Mountain coffee is Pounds 18 per lb from Harvey Nichols and Bloomfield Darjeeling costs Pounds 9.90 a quarter from Harrods.</p>

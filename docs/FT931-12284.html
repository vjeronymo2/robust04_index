			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Outgoing EIB president issues warning MR ERNST-GUNTHER Broeder, outgoing president of the European Investment Bank, yesterday issued a warning against those tempted to turn the bank into a soft-loan organisation to promote growth inside the European Community. Presenting annual results for 1992, which showed an 11 per cent increase in EIB lending to Ecu17bn (Pounds 13.75bn), Mr Broeder, acknowledged political pressure to use the bank to promote growth. But he said the EIB's new lending criteria, agreed at the EC summit last month, should not be at the expense of the bank's credit rating in the capital markets. "It is essential that the EIB remain a bank,' Mr Broeder said, 'rather than an instrument to provide equity and capital.' A German economist and bank executive, Mr Broeder is to retire in April after almost nine years. He is to be succeeded by Sir Brian Unwin, former chairman of Customs and Excise in the UK. The EIB has faced some criticism inside the European Commission for being sleepy and too cautious in its assessment of risk. But its ability to raise money - Ecus 13 bn in 1992 - in the capital markets at attractive rates, gives it a key role in the EC growth package aimed to enhance capital investment. The EIB said yesterday that the first tranches of the special Ecu5bn lending facility agreed in Edinburgh should be available for specific projects in telecommunications, energy and transport by late-March or early-April. The Ecu5bn would be spread over two years among the 12 EC member states. The EIB will set up a European investment fund by the end of the year, with a subscribed capital of Ecu2bn, to act as a catalyst for infrastructure projects and to help small and medium-sized business. The EIB is talking to 60-70 commercial banks about participation, though the final number is likely to be smaller. These banks will take 30 per cent of the capital. The EIB is to take 40 per cent and the European Commission 40 per cent.</p>

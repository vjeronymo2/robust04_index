			<p>BFN     [Text] Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis spent today on a  working visit to Paris where he met French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. They  consulted on Latvian-Russian relations and on the agreements  initialled on the withdrawal of the Russian Army.    France proposed that Latvia use the so-called Balladur plan  -- the European security and stability pact, to tackle these  problems. The inauguration of the pact is scheduled to take  place in Paris at the end of May. The pact provides for the  involvement of third countries in tackling neighborly relations  between two countries. Latvia has supported the Balladur plan.  However, specific problems which Latvia would wish to tackle in  the framework of the plan are still under discussion.    Russia's attitude to the Balladur plan is not yet clear.  Foreign Minister Juppe expressed the idea that France may play  a mediating role at the Latvian-Russian talks.</p>

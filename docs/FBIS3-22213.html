			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: ``No One Wants To Be Guilty of an Ecological </F> Catastrophe'']    [Text] Academicians Sergey Zalygin, Dmitriy  Likhachev, and Aleksandr Yanshin published in our newspaper an  extremely sharp article, entitled ``Environment of Extinction''  ([No.] 200, 20 October 1993]. The authors considered it to be  their task to point out the primary causes of the ecological  blind alley -- the actions of the economic ministries during the  years of the ``great construction projects'' that destroyed the  environment (primarily, the activities of Minvodkhoz [Ministry  of Water Management] when the project for diverting the northern  and Siberian rivers was being created). They also see their task  in revealing the facts in the history that has led us down the  ecological blind alley.    Many readers are in total agreement with the authors of the  article and write to us that ``Minvodkhoz, together with certain  scientists, inflicted colossal damage on our country. That  damage consists of the completely wasted tens of billions of  rubles from the state budget at that time; the ruination of  agriculture in many regions where millions of hectares of land  that had been `improved' by water reclamation were written off;  and the party leaders' crimes that they committed hand in hand  with the people in water management.'' They also write, ``The  water management partocracy is an as yet unrevealed and gloomy  page in our economic and political history, and the role of the  scientists in this secret system is a unique phenomenon that,  sooner or later, will be deciphered.''    At the same time, Candidate of Technical Sciences V.  Aleksenko takes a negative attitude toward the academicians'  pessimistic position. She feels that ``the resolution of the  problem of the ecological crisis must be a party program of the  social-democratic movement at the present-day stage. The way out  of the ecological crisis has a concrete and accessible  solution.'' But she ends her letter by saying, ``Despite all the  offensive words said by me with respect to the authors of the  article `Environment of Extinction,' their criticism of the  state ecological service, and their brave opposition to the  official structures, evoke a tremendous amount of respect and  contribute to the awareness of social and ecological tasks.''    However, in their article the academicians do not simply  ``oppose the official structures.'' In their article they give  the names of specific people with whom, over the course of many  years, they discussed the river diversion project. And that,  naturally, evokes the sharp objections of those who were  mentioned. In particular, the employees of Ministry of Ecology.    It is necessary to speak separately about a letter to the  editor that was writtebjects n by F. V. Voropayev, corresponding  member of RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences], who since 1977 has  headed the Scientific Council for Problems of the Caspian Sea.  He considers the article to be direct libel against himself, his  council, and the AN [Academy of Sciences] Institute of Water  Problems, where he was the director until recently. He demands  the publication of his reply. We are printing it in abridged  form.    ``The statement concerning the 'assimilation' of millions of  rubles by the council is an insinuation that is intended for the  uninformed readers. The council is a public organization that is  not financed by the state. The council has not sold and does not  sell information on the Caspian to Iran. The Russian Federation  has a treaty of scientific-technical cooperation with the  Islamic Republic of Iran, in accordance with which certain joint  work is carried out. At such time each contracting side makes  its own expenditures. No one has ever transferred funds, or  transfers them now. This is firmly established in the  cooperation documents... Other ridiculous assertions are  those stating that the scientists at the Institute of Water  Problems were the initiators, originators, and developers of the  projects to divert part of the river runoff (emphasis  added). In particular, this is attested to by the decisions of  USSR Gosplan's State Expert Commission for reviewing the TEO  [technical and economic substantiation] of the diversion of part  of the runoff of the northern rivers to the drainage area of the  Volga River. I was the deputy chairman of the commission to  review the TEO, and a number of scientists from the Institute of  Water Problems were members. According to our recommendations,  the TEO was declined in 1980... As a result of what has been  stated, I demand an immediate refutation of the article and the  accusations from the newspaper's editorial office and the  authors for having insulted the honor and dignity of a scientist  and citizen. Otherwise I shall be forced to take court action.''    The editorial office has acquainted the authors of the  article ``Environment of Extinction'' with the objections made  by Corresponding Member G. V. Voropayev. In response to his  request they provide the following answer. In particular,  concerning the council's monetary operations:    ``We must admit the insufficient precision of the  formulations addressed to the Council on Problems of the Caspian  Sea,'' the academicians write. ``The fact of the matter is that  the Scientific Council on Problems of the Caspian Sea was  created in the Institute of Water Problems, of the Academy of  Sciences; it was financed by that institute; it consisted  chiefly of its employees; and was headed by the director of that  institute, V. Voropayev. It is therefore difficult to separate  the activities of the council from the activities of the  institute. It is possible that certain shortcomings addressed to  G. V. Voropayev as the council chairman should pertain to his  activities as the director of the institute.''    The authors go on to mention the history of the river  diversion and, in this regard, they are completely incapable of  agreeing with G. V. Voropayev's version. They prove, by  quotations taken from a number of works over a period of many  years, that it was precisely he who was the initiator of the  diversion project, but that he was covered by the efforts of  other individuals.    In 1976 G. V. Voropayev wrote to VODNYYE RESURSY magazine  (No. 3, pp 4-6): ``It is proposed to carry out the water supply  of the southern rayons at the expense of the more complete use  of local resources and the bringing in of the runoff of the  country's northern slope (drainage areas of the Kara, White, and  Barents seas), that is, at the expense of territorial  redistribution on a large scale.'' He emphasized that ``the  unity of water management ties on a countrywide scale is  becoming especially obvious in the version of runoff  redistribution that was developed by the USSR Academy of  Sciences Institute of Water Problems.''    We have been sent a Xerox copy of the book by G. V.  Voropayev  and A. A. Bostandzhoglo, ``Problema izyatiya, perebroski i  raspredeleniya chasti stoka sibirskikh rek dlya rayonov Zapadnoy  Sibiri, Urala, Sredney Azii i Kazakhstana'' [Problem of  Withdrawing, Diverting, and Distributing Part of the Runoff of  Siberian Rivers For Rayons of West Siberia, the Urals, Central  Asia, and Kazakhstan]. The publisher is USSR Academy of Sciences  Institute of Water Problems, 1984 (For Official Use Only). In  these ``closed'' works we read on page 40, ``The development of  the national economy determines the desirability of constructing  a system among drainage areas for diverting the runoff of the  Danube River into the Dniepr drainage area; the carrying out of  a series of operations to divert part of the runoff of the  northern rivers into the Volga drainage area; and the  construction of the Volga-Urals and Volga-Don canals to use the  diverted runoff in the Northern Caucasus for irrigation.  Scientific research and feasibility studies that have been  conducted have substantiated the desirability of diverting part  of the runoff of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia and  Kazakhstan in the volume of the first phase (27.2 cubic  kilometers).'' The chapter entitled ``Conclusion'' states even  more decisively: ``Computations have demonstrated the economic  effectiveness of the measures being considered for diverting  part of the runoff of Siberian rivers and the profitability of  the complex within the normative limits.'' The authorship of the  diversion project also does not cause any doubts. The statement  is made that ``the approval of the TEO of the Asian diversion  and the scientific research on the problem has become a stage  that has summed up the results of many years of  scientific-research and surveying-design work that was carried  out by the USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of Water Problems  and Soyuzgiprovodkhoz [All-Union State Planning, Surveying and  Scientific Research Institute of Water Management  Construction].''    In their letter to the editor, the authors of the article  ``Environment of Extinction'' recall that, ``On 18 July 1986, at  a session of the presidium of USSR Sovmin [Council of  Ministers], success was achieved in stopping the insane work to  divert the runoff. N. F. Vasilyev, minister of water management,  considered the diversion of the runoff to be the only measure  for saving the Caspian and the Aral Sea and a chief measure for  developing agriculture, and he demanded the immediate expansion  of earth-moving operations also on the Ob River and the area  between the Volga and the Sukhona rivers. G. V. Voropayev  defended the project even more fiercely than the minister did.  Stenographic reports still exist, and there are many witnesses  to this who are still alive. But G. V. Voropayev still did not  calm down. Soon his article `The Project Will Live' appeared in  newspapers, and in 1988, in an article in VODNYYE RESURSY (No.  1, pp 5-13) that was written jointly with D. Ya. Radkevich, he  asserted the very same position.''    Meanwhile G. V. Voropayev considers specifically his  constancy to be ethical. ``I do not change,'' he writes, ``my  opinions to fit the political situation. I continue to work as a  scientist on the same problems that I did ten years, and 40  years, ago.'' In addition, he assumes that ``Environment of  Extinction'' was conceived as a personal attack: ``The article  was timed for a period when the nomination of candidates for  election as members of the Academy of Science was coming to an  end. Similar statements by the same authors did their `job' in  the past, as was noted during the discussion of these questions  at the Russian Academy of Sciences. That statement also 'started  things working' today. At a number of official agencies that  statement served as guidance during the making of decisions  pertaining to the activities of our collective. The authors hope  that it will continue to 'do its job.' S. P. Zalygin and A. L.  Yanshin for many years asserted their impunity with regard to  their libelous statements. The high positions occupied by both  of them protected them against criticism and responsibility. But  those protections are collapsing, and now it is becoming more  obvious who is who.''    Nevertheless, in our view, it is currently important not to  delve into the problem of ``who is who,'' but to recall that, in  the history of the river diversion, the final dot has been  placed by the nation's powerful movement that has banned the  disfigurement of the land. People have wanted, and want now, to  have an environment in which they live, rather than become  extinct. Therein lies the crux of the problem.</p>

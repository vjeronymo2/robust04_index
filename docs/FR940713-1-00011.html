Additionally, a mandatory linespeed reduction would be required. The linespeed would be reduced to the extent necessary to ensure process control in preventing/eliminating all feces and for such duration until it is determined by FSIS that the process can be maintained in compliance with the no visible fecal contamination standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If any reprocessed bird is found with fecal contamination, the on-line/off-line inspector will require all birds remaining in the reprocessed lot to be returned to the establishment's reprocessing station for rework. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any finding of fecal contamination during a Finished Product Standard check would require an immediate linespeed reduction and reprocessing of the contaminated carcass. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Antimicrobial Treatments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In spite of the best efforts to reduce or eliminate visible contamination through the measures that this proposal would require, poultry would still harbor bacteria. The numbers of these invisible contaminants can only be reduced through antimicrobial treatments. With this proposed rulemaking, the Agency would require, for the first time, that poultry slaughtering establishments provide antimicrobial interventions before the carcasses enter the chilling system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, in addition to changing post-mortem inspection staffing and procedures and reinspection criteria, this proposed rulemaking would mandate the use of an approved antimicrobial treatment for poultry. The treatments could be applied at any point preceding the chilling operation. Many establishments would already be in compliance with this provision of the proposed regulations because they routinely apply a 20-ppm chlorinated spray at the final wash. Spoilage and pathogenic bacteria naturally reside on the surface of raw poultry. It has been assumed that a certain level of bacteria present on carcass surfaces was unavoidable due to the inherent characteristics of animals and raw poultry meat and the nature of the slaughter and processing operation. Consequently, organoleptic inspection procedures were designed to detect obvious carcass diseases or abnormalities. FSIS is expanding its inspection activities to address increasing concern by the scientific community and the public about the threat of foodborne illness from consumption of meat and poultry products. Pathogens of concern in poultry include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Campylobacter,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which are frequently carried on raw poultry. These bacteria cannot be detected by sight, smell, or taste. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Salmonellae, found in the intestinal tract and waste of most warm-blooded animals, are the most important cause of bacterial foodborne illness with a 0.1 percent case fatality rate and highest average cost per case. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Foods of animal origin, particularly meat and poultry, are considered to be the primary source of human salmonellosis. The organisms are present in the skin and feathers of live birds whose carcasses can also become contaminated during slaughter from intestinal tract contents of otherwise healthy animals. Cross contamination of cooked foods from raw meat and poultry, kitchen utensils, or surfaces has been frequently described as a cause of salmonellosis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Agricultural Outlook, Economic Research Service, USDA, AO&hyph;197 (June 1993), pp. 32&hyph;36.

CDC defined an outbreak as an incident in which two or more persons experience a similar illness and food is implicated. The etiology was unknown in the majority of outbreaks. Among outbreaks in which etiology was determined, bacterial pathogens caused the largest number of outbreaks (66 percent) and cases (92 percent). During the five-year interval, meat and poultry accounted for approximately 16 percent of the bacterial disease outbreaks.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was the most frequently reported pathogen each year. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> MMWR (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report), Vol. 39/No. SS&hyph;1: ``CDC Surveillance Summaries, March 1990.''

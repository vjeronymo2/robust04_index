			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / VW chief tries to soothe Spanish: Piech to stress the need for rationalisation at Seat subsidiary VOLKSWAGEN'S chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, will travel to Spain tomorrow in an attempt to soothe political and union fears over the outcome of the crisis at the group's local subsidiary, Seat. Although he is not prepared to offer any further cash aid beyond the recent DM1.5bn (Dollars 920m) emergency injection, he will attempt to convince political leaders of an urgent need for rationalisation. Seat expects a deficit of DM1.25bn this year, and even if demand for cars improves, further substantial losses are inevitable next year without change, group officials said. The aim of the visit was to find a solution acceptable to all sides, a spokesman said last night after a VW board meeting. A company statement added that no decisions had yet been taken over the future of Seat's factories and there was no question of the company losing its independence 'as a brand within the group'. It was necessary to bring Seat up to internationally competitive standards, especially in terms of employment levels. Spanish media have charged VW with imperialism and trying to protect German jobs at the expense of Seat workers. Yesterday's newspapers carried reports that VW wanted to move key decision-making responsibilities from Spain to VW headquarters in Germany. The outcry started last week after the resignation of Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, the Seat chairman. He lost his job after being told by the VW board that his rationalisation plans, including around 5,000 job cuts, were 'too soft'. Mr Piech is due to meet leaders of national and regional governments in Madrid and Catalonia, and have further talks with union officials anxious about the future of the Seat site in the Zona Franca, Barcelona, which employs about 10,500 people. Mr Piech, who will travel with Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the group's Spanish-born production director, was yesterday warned to keep his promise that unions would be involved in decision-making. Mr Enrique Montoya, a leader of the UGT union, who met Mr Piech last Friday, said he believed the union voice would be heard. But if decisions were taken without union participation, there would be 'protests of unprecedented intensity', he added.</p>

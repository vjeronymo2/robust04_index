			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: MIM covers all the options on Queensland deposit MIM HOLDINGS, the Australian resources group, yesterday underlined its determination to acquire a substantial stake in the Ernest Henry copper-gold deposit in north-west Queensland by announcing a second conditional deal to buy the mining leases. The Ernest Henry deposit was discovered in 1991 by a joint venture between Western Mining Corporation and Hunter Resources on a group of six leases owned by Savage Resources, a small coal and exploration company. The deposit has indicated reserves of 69m tonnes of mineralisation at an average grade of 1.6 per cent of copper and 0.8 grammes per tonne of gold. However, its ownership is disputed between Savage Resources and the joint venture partners. MIM announced earlier this month that it had agreed to buy Hunter Resources' 30 per cent interest in the Ernest Henry deposit and the adjacent Mount Fort Constantine area in the event that the Queensland courts ruled against Savage. Under the second deal, announced yesterday, MIM would acquire 51 per cent of the deposit for ADollars 92.5m (Pounds 43.5m) if the courts ruled in favour of Savage Resources, or ADollars 14m for Savage's royalty rights if WMC and Hunter Resources are awarded ownership. Alternatively, the agreement provides for a range of royalty and equity transfers to MIM if the dispute between Savage and the joint venturers is settled out of court. Mr Norm Fussell, MIM's managing director, said that the group wanted to secure a substantial position in Ernest Henry as part of its basic strategic objective of expanding copper production, especially in its north-west Queensland base. The Ernest Henry deposit and the highly-prospective Mount Fort Constantine area are close to MIM's Mount Isa base, where the group has extensive mining and copper smelting facilities. In a separate announcement, MIM said that it would acquire the 13.5 per cent of the Oaky Creek export coking coal join venture that it does not already own from Hoogovens Delfstoffen of The Netherlands and Empresa Nacional Siderurgica of Spain.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES CLAIMS FORMER POST AS COACH AT VENTURA  </P> <P> Unlike many coaches, Dick James does not believe that the Division I level  always provides the best of coaching opportunities in college football.  </P> <P> Therefore James, Ventura College's only head football coach in the 1970s,  decided to forgo the big time at Stanford for the chance to return to Ventura  last year as an assistant. And, after Phil Passno resigned last week, James  reclaimed the head coaching position he left in 1979 to become Stanford's  offensive line coach.  </P> <P> "I have mixed emotions," James said. "I've been in this business long enough to  see some very fine coaches step down, and that is difficult. But I'm also happy  with the opportunity to lead a program."  </P> <P> James led the Pirates to a 58-40 record and two Western State Conference  championships from 1970-79 before moving on to Stanford.  </P> <P> "It was a great opportunity to get into the next level of coaching," James said  of his ascension to the major-college ranks. "At the time, it was the right  thing to do because you want to grow and develop professionally."  </P> <P> James, 49, was Stanford's offensive line coach until 1983 and was the  recruiting coordinator from 1983-87. He has worked with such players as John  Elway, Darrin Nelson, and Brad Muster, all of whom play in the NFL.  </P> <P> "I'm grateful of those opportunities," James said. "I really enjoyed working  with such quality people."  </P> <P> James, however, did not enjoy his administrative position as recruiting  coordinator, much less the hectic schedule and its attendant frequent-flier  mileage.  </P> <P> "I see myself as a teacher and a coach, and it was evident after five years of  administrative work that I wanted to get back on the field," James said. "It  was a chance to come home."  </P> <P> James did that, taking over last season as Ventura's offensive coordinator. He  was the offensive line coach this season, but when Passno resigned Dec. 4 after  leading Ventura to a 7-4 record and its second bowl-game berth in seven years,  James was immediately promoted.  </P> <P> "We looked strictly at him," Ventura Athletic Director Jerry Dunlap said. "We  wanted continuity in the program."  </P> <P> James has already begun visiting high schools, organizing his coaching staff  and developing strength and fitness programs. He said that he would have been  content as an assistant but is pleased to again be in charge of a program.  </P> <P> "I really enjoy the community and the level of football," he said. "There are  some constructive things you can do to help at this level."  </P> <P> Ventura won two WSC championships during Passno's tenure and won a  school-record seven consecutive games at the start of this season. Passno, who  was 38-33 at Ventura, will remain on the physical education staff and might  continue to coach football if a position is appealing to him.  </P> <P> "I'm at a point in my career when I'm not interested in just doing anything,"  Passno said.  </P></p>

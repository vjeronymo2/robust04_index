			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Disney starts talks with banks Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday began negotiations over the emergency financial restructuring of Euro Disney at a meeting with its European subsidiary's banks in Paris. The banks demanded at the meeting that the US group, which owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney, should play a fuller part in the restructuring. They proposed a number of concessions that Walt Disney might make: notably reducing its entitlement to royalties on the income from admissions, catering and merchandise at the EuroDisneyland theme park. Walt Disney repeated its warnings that unless the banks agree to an outline deal by March 31, it will withdraw its financial support for Euro Disney. The European company, which is burdened by heavy losses and debts, has since the start of this year been financially dependent on its US parent and, without its backing, would be forced to close. The banks are still awaiting the completion of a full audit on Euro Disney's financial position that they have commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick and is scheduled for completion by February 22. However, they estimate that Euro Disney will need a capital injection of FFr12bn to FFr13bn, to reduce its FFr20.3bn (USDollars 3.41bn) net debt to a more manageable level. This figure is slightly higher than the FFr10bn injection proposed last autumn by Walt Disney. The US group had suggested raising the money through the combination of a rights issue and debt-for-equity swap. The banks yesterday proposed examining a more complex solution with a bigger role for Walt Disney.</p>

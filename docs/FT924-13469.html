			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (8): US battle ahead - Baby Bells ring the changes THE US telecommunications industry is in the throes of a revolution as technology, competition, takeovers and deregulation change the face of the sector. Probably the single most important issue facing the industry over the next few years is the fate of the Baby Bells, the seven huge local telephone companies which were created out of the court-ordered break-up of American Telephone and Telegraph in 1984. The break-up left the rump of AT&amp;T as a long-distance and international telephone carrier and telecommunications manufacturer, while its local telephone operations were carved up into the Baby Bell companies. They now dominate the provision of local services, although in many parts of the US independent companies, such as GTE, are the sole provider. The result in the long-distance market has been fierce competition, with AT&amp;T challenged by upstart rivals such as MCI, now the second largest long-distance carrier, and Sprint. AT&amp;T has been forced to become much more aggressive in its marketing, pricing and customer relations. It still accounts for some 65 per cent of the long-distance market, which is worth about Dollars 55bn, and seems to have stopped the erosion of its position. AT&amp;T has also moved aggressively to position itself for the expected convergence of computer and communications technology through its 1991 takeover of NCR, the fifth largest computer manufacturer in the US, which was merged with AT&amp;T's own struggling computer business. A year after the deal, which was widely regarded as a high-risk strategy for AT&amp;T, given the computer industry's history of failed mergers, the two sides claim integration has gone remarkably smoothly. Because the US local markets were regarded as 'natural monopolies', the court which broke up AT&amp;T judged that the Baby Bells needed to be prevented from throwing their weight around in other telecommunications markets. They were therefore banned from equipment manufacturing, information services and the long-distance market. Ever since then the Baby Bells have campaigned to get into these markets and last year they won an important victory when the courts allowed them to enter certain parts of the potentially vast information services industry. New technology, particularly the emergence of fibre optic cable as a more efficient carrier of signals than the traditional copper wire, means that a huge battle is shaping up over which companies will provide information services to the American 21st century home - cable television operators, the local telephone companies or other, independent providers. The telecommunications companies won an important round in the battle last summer when the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the communications industry, gave the go-ahead for the telephone companies to transmit television programmes to homes over telephone lines. However, the FCC maintained a ban on the phone companies owning a significant stake in producers of programmes and the phone companies are in no position to take immediate advantage of the green light, since the local network remains almost wholly wired with copper, which is not good for transmitting video signals. The cable industry, furthermore, is also protected from competition from local telephone companies by a 1984 act. However, even as the Baby Bells are seeking new fields to conquer, their own monopolies are under threat as never before. Whereas they could once enjoy a quiet life collecting monthly fees for telephone services from a captive clientele, and big commissions for linking up calls to long-distance carriers, they now have to cope with: Wireless technologies, such as cellular telephones and Personal Communications Networks, which are likely to take a substantial proportion of business away from the wired networks. Cellular telephone penetration of the US market is still growing rapidly, in spite of recession, while extensive tests of PCN systems are under way across the US. GTE, for example, recently announced the largest market trial of two new PCN systems, to take place in Florida's Tampa Bay area. However, the Baby Bells are to a considerable extent protected from this competition, since they are also among the largest cellular operators, having been handed one of two local cellular licences by the government when these were handed out. They have also been active in a takeover wave which has been rationalising the patchwork of cellular operators left by the original licensing process. So-called 'by-pass operators' which use fibre optic cable to link business customers to the long-distance carriers, by-passing the local companies. In a big step towards ending the local monopolies, the FCC last month voted to allow these upstarts to link up directly to the local telephone company as well. It also proposed letting rivals use the telephone companies' networks to reach all customers. Cable television operators, increasingly concerned about telephone companies entering their industry, have been taking the battle to the enemy and experimenting with telephone traffic. Faced with this onslaught, the Baby Bells have been trying to reshape themselves. Jobs are being cut, top executives are suddenly retiring. Mr Victor Schnee, an analyst and long-time critic of the Baby Bells, argues that the local telephone system is like the Soviet empire in 1989, just waiting to break apart. In his recent book, 'The End of the Local Monopolies', he argues that 'in the not-too-distant future there will be alternative networks everywhere they are allowed . . . 'In short, the entire industry will turn inside out, to focus on a primary goal it has always ignored - delivering something of value to customers - rather than on creating networks and extracting profit from customers based on artificial scarcity supported by government.' The Baby Bells may take issue with some of Mr Schnee's arguments, but they all know that some sort of upheaval is on the way. The question is, which ones will adopt the best strategies to cope with this change?</p>

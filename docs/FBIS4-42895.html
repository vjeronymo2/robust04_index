			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dr Lorenz Schomerus, ministerial director in the </F> FRG Ministry of Finance: "The Framework for the New World  Economy--Where Do We Go After Marrakech?"]    [Text] The eighth round of the multilateral trade  negotiations between 125 GATT partners, the Uruguay Round, was  formally concluded in Marrakech a few weeks ago. With the  proviso of ratification, Federal Economics Minister Guenter  Rexrodt signed the Final Act for Germany, the treaty on  establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the  agreement on the public procurement system; Sir Leon Brittan  signed for the European Union [EU]. The results achieved are a  very essential contribution to the further liberalization of  world trade. At the same time, this conclusion also lastingly  strengthens the credibility of an open, predictable and  dependable multilateral trade system as well as confidence--so  very important in the present economic situation--in the growth  and job creation effectiveness of international trade.    The spread of the final results, as well as the spectrum of  prospective tasks after the Marrakech conference, cover a very  wide range and require differentiated consideration. Above all,  it now concerns rapidly implemented ratification procedures in  the national parliaments of the member states. This step is  necessary since the Final Act of the Uruguay Round, comprising  over 20,000 pages, touches not only upon Community [EU], but  also upon national jurisdictions of the Federal Government and  the laender. Only subsequently, forseeably by 1 January 1995,  can the important general conditions for a dynamic economic  development and for global growth impulses be further improved  by the agreed-upon regulations, such as     -  an average  30-percent lowering of tariffs on market access for industrial  goods,    -  the agreement on protection of intellectual property,    -  the  new subsidy and antidumping clauses,    -  reduction of nontariff  trade obstacles, and    -  founding a World Trade Organization as the  new institutional and legal framework of multilateral trade  relations.     On all other issues, not yet--or not yet  completely--resolved  through agreements, such as audiovisual and financing services,  basic telecommunications, ocean traffic, steel, and civilian  aviation, subsequent negotiations will have to be conducted  within the framework of the new WTO.    In addition, there is the large sector of entirely new and  ever more complex tasks, due to the growing integration of the  economies of the member states in world trade, for the time  after Marrakech. They must be resolved within the framework of  the WTO as the future permanent forum for multilateral trade  negotiations, as the place for implementation of integrated  arbitration proceedings, and as the institution for cooperation  with international organizations (IMF, World Bank).    Even during the Uruguay Round negotiations, which lasted for  a period of seven years, several sides demanded inclusion of  additional issues, such as the problem of interfacing trade and  environment. Both areas are linked to each other in many ways  since, for example, the production and transport of goods, and  their global export and import often are not environmentally  neutral. Vice versa, environmental protection policies, often  with direct intervention, have a restrictive effect on  international trade. Environmental standards in international  agreements, which could bring relief, to this day are very  little in harmony. That is why it is now urgently necessary to  deepen the analysis of this problem to develop generally  accepted substantial guidelines, which will also take into  consideration the special sensitivities of developing countries.  The WTO, in the wide-ranging framework of its functions and in  the preamble of the agreement, which expressly embodies the goal  of protecting the environment, possesses a solid foundation for  this work. Precisely for this purpose, a permanent WTO  commission was established in Marrakech, whose members are  recruited from experts of the trade and environment sectors.  <H5>  Now Come Social Clauses </H5>   Without a doubt, the question of linkage between trade and  social standards, primarily discussed in U.N. agencies, will  soon also be on the agenda of trade policy bodies. This already  became clear in Marrakech, above all because of the insistence  of the United States for incorporation of a social clause in  GATT or WTO, respectively. The Federal Government recognized the  urgency of defusing this tense situation, but warned at the  minister conference in Marrakech against rash steps.    The discussion of social standards will not be easy to  conduct. Fundamental economic interests of the developing  countries are affected. Demands for social standards are met  with suspicion, especially by developing countries. They suspect  that the often demanded import measures and obligation to mark  the origin of goods in reality are protectionist aims of  industrial countries to the detriment of their advantages of  location. Such shortsighted, misunderstood protective interests  would rob developing countries of the gains in prosperity and  growth resulting--especially for them--from increased global  trade, and which are the important, even decisive, basis and  prerequisite for better working conditions and higher social  standards in those countries.    Introduction of social standards cannot be forced on  developing countries by threatening import measures, which, with  regard to the groups affected (children, prisoners, etc.),  probably would have little effect. Thus it is better to link the  purposeful liberalization of global trade with an open--and  mutually understanding--political discussion with the developing  countries on improved work and social standards in order to move  these countries to constructive cooperation. In principle, the  WTO is open to dealing with this problem. However, with a view  to a fruitful discussion, one should avoid the mistake of  completely excluding the bodies originally in charge of dealing  with these issues, just because a new organization has been  created. The work of the WTO can only build meaningfully on the  expertise and clarity developed by U.N. agencies and the ILO  [International Labor Organization]. Also, the overall work of  the WTO must not be dominated or especially not paralyzed by  this subject.    Past GATT practice, and also the negotiations in the Uruguay  Round, have shown that not all trade-related problems can be  covered by existing trade policy regulations. With the  increasing internationalization of entrepreneurial activity and  the globalization of the markets, the overlapping of policies on  trade and competition on the international scene has grown.  Competition-distorting practices such as managed trade, export  cartels, laser beaming and structural barriers, either by  enterprises or governments, or by the interplay of both, also  have trade-restrictive effects which considerably limit access  to markets.    Vice versa, the application of "legal" trade policy tools  such as antidumping or countervailing subsidy measures also can  have a distorting and trade-restrictive impact if used in a  manner impairing competition. Political pressure, such as  reacting with trade policy measures to such distortions in  competition, can easily arise in such a situation and lead to  making GATT agreements and concessions worthless. To avoid this,  an international organization on competition as a regulative  framework for global activities seems the most sensible solution  for this problem. An agreement should be achieved as soon as  possible on the "whether and how" of a possible integration in  the WTO.    The integrating goals of the Uruguay Round, and hence the  direction of multilateral trade relations, are confronted with  every kind of protectionism. A comprehensive liberalization of  world markets, particularly also with regard to the newly  adopted areas of services and intellectual property, has a real  chance only in open markets. Integration of the countries of  East Europe also will succeed only with open markets. Naturally,  under the pretext of the job argument, it would be easier at the  moment to close the markets to cheap Eastern imports, whether in  the EU or in Germany. It must be remembered that all countries  in the Community have assumed political responsibility for the  economic recovery in the East.  <H5>  Open Up the Markets </H5>   In this context, monetary transfers are indispensable and  justified in the short term. In the longer term, however, they  contradict the logic of the market economy, and they are not  bearable in view of the resulting burdens on the economies,  especially that of Germany, which additionally has to cope with  the economic restructuring of the new laender. They affect the  economy and consumers in the form of higher taxes and levies, in  their final impact endangering jobs from the other side. Hence  opening markets for products is the only adequate possibility to  promote economic stability in the reform countries, to  meaningfully support the structural adjustment process and  integration into the multilateral trade system, based on  division of labor.    But opening the markets also means including regional  federations such as ASEAN, NAFTA, APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation], and EU, already liberalized as free trade zones.  GATT, or the WTO as the active organ of multilateral  negotiations, can build on these successful regional integration  processes when it is a matter of implementing further  integration efforts. At the same time, one must not ignore the  dangers resulting from these agreements with regard to bloc  formation, sealing off regional markets, etc. Thus the WTO, in  interaction with these federations, will also face the task of  finding ways for their further integration into the multilateral  trade system.</p>

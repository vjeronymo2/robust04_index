			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Program sales cause late Dow reversal Wall Street A late burst of program selling left US stocks in negative territory yesterday in spite of solid gains in the bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished a net 3.70 easier at 3,768.52 after surrendering a 16-point gain in the final minutes of the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.25 at 458.88 and NYSE volume was moderate at 259m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite inched 0.75 ahead to 442.59 and the Nasdaq composite improved 1.05 to 743.43. Until minutes before the close, most share prices were well above their opening levels. There was no fresh economic news, giving investors time to reflect on supportive comments made by three of the Federal Reserve's five governors. An article in The New York Times quoted the officials as saying that inflation was now in check, suggesting the central bank would not make another move to lift short-term rates in the near future. The prospect of low inflation and a stable monetary policy allowed the bond market to extend a rally that began on Friday with the release of data on May employment conditions. The benchmark 30-year bond was ending the day with moderate gains, a direction paralleled by most share prices until the session's final minutes. Consumer products and food groups were actively traded. Philip Morris advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 50 7/8 and Sara Lee, which announced a worldwide restructuring, rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 23 3/8 . Pepsico dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 34 5/8 , just above its 52-week low of Dollars 34 1/2 . Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its recommended list and cut its earnings estimate for the company, based on a disappointing performance by Pepsico's restaurant division. Merger news was stirring up the communications sector. Sprint was marked down Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 38 after suspending talks on a possible link-up with Electronic Data Systems, the data- processing arm of General Motors. EDS, which is traded as class 'E' shares of its parent, dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 35. Meanwhile, Times Mirror fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 32 3/4 on news that it agreed to sell its cable television operations to Cox Enterprises for Dollars 2.3bn. Cox shares are not publicly traded. In the computer sector, International Business Machines gained Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 62 5/8 on reports that its margins had improved recently. Compaq Computer finished Dollars 1 down at Dollars 110 3/4 after climbing as much as Dollars 3 3/8 during the session. In electronics retailing, CompUSA shed Dollars 2 3/8 , or nearly 23 per cent, to Dollars 9 1/2 , a 52-week low for the stock. Janney Montgomery Scott recommended a sell following the company's warning of a possible fourth-quarter loss. The Nasdaq advanced in spite of weakness in several key issues. Lotus Development declined Dollars 2 to Dollars 56 1/4 and Oracle slipped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 36 3/8.</p>

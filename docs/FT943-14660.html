			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Olivetti in link with US document distributor Docunet, a California-based company developing a system for electronic distribution of travel and other documents, has linked with Olivetti, the Italian computer group, and three other partners to build a network of touch-screen self-service machines in the US. Over the next three years, the Italian company will supply Docunet with 6,000 machines, capable of delivering travel documents or theatre tickets instantly to customers in shopping malls, office buildings or airports. The agreement will be worth about Dollars 96m to Olivetti, the Italian company said. It also said it would buy a stake in Docunet but did not say how large. The agreement announced yesterday will also involve EDS, the computer services company owned by General Motors, which is to provide the network to link the machines. Bell Atlantic, the telecommunications group, and Chemical Bank of the US will also take part in the scheme, helping to market Docunet machines on the east coast of the US. Two agreements have already been signed with the Giant Food stores chain in the Washington area, and with the Ralphs supermarket chain in southern California, to install new machines in 170 shops by the end of the year. Docunet said it had already signed agreements with American Airlines and USAir, to issue tickets through the Docunet system. 'Certain large US (travel) agencies - US Travel, Thomas Cook, Travel One, Giselle's and Travelogue - intend to issue tickets through Docunet,' the company added. The system is the latest evidence of the growing use of 'information superhighways' in the US. The machines are likely to resemble automatic cash machines, and operate with credit cards or cash.</p>

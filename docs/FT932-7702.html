			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Ferguson doubles to Pounds 9.7m as managing director resigns FERGUSON International Holdings, the printing and publishing group, almost doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.7m in the year to February 28. The advance from Pounds 4.9m was thanks partly to flattering comparisons under the FRS 3 accounting rules. The company, whose shares closed up 18p at 323p, also announced the resignation by 'mutual consent' of Mr Michael Saint as group managing director. Having managed the refocusing of the company over the past three years, Mr Saint said it was time to move on. A successor would be announced later, the company said. Underlying profit growth was 28 per cent after stripping out exceptional costs for the closure of loss-making operations, disposals and restructuring. These were a net Pounds 849,000 this time and Pounds 3.3m a year earlier. Operating profits on continuing activities rose 25 per cent to Pounds 11.4m. Interest charges fell to Pounds 777,000 (Pounds 1.1m) while gearing was reduced to 15.1 per cent (25.1 per cent). The clothing hangers division was the only one to show a fall in operating profits to Pounds 2.47m (Pounds 2.63m) on improved turnover of Pounds 31.5m (Pounds 31.1m). The company's biggest business, labels, improved margins and contributed Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 4.4m) on turnover of Pounds 58.1m (Pounds 51.8m). Communications components improved profits to Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.56m) on turnover of Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 16.8m). Printing and publishing raised its input to Pounds 533,000 (Pounds 493,000) on turnover of Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 10.5m) and took a small loss on discontinued operations. Turnover from continuing operations rose to Pounds 121m (Pounds 110m). The proposed unchanged final dividend of 8.25p maintains the total at 12.5p, out of earnings per share of 19.5p (16.5p)</p>

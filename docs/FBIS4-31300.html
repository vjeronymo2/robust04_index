			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The UN Security Council is currently considering  introducing sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea. [passage omitted]    In connection with the Czech Republic's membership in the UN  Security Council, Czech radio has asked Ambassador Karel  Kovanda, our country's permanent representative to the executive  body of the international community, what the Czech position is  on the adoption of the sanctions.    [Begin Kovanda recording] The possibility of introducing  sanctions against North Korea is a very complicated matter. On  the one hand, the issue is that some countries do not at all  regard sanctions as a good instrument of international politics.  North Korea itself has said on several occasions that it would  respond to possible sanctions as a declaration of war. One of  the countries that never believes in sanctions and never accedes  to them is China, which almost always abstains from each  resolution regarding sanctions. So far, China has been very  much against any indications of sanctions on the part of the UN  Security Council.    The next development will depend on the behind-the-scene  discussions between the Big Five, the five permanenent members.  The main role will be played here by the United States and  China. The side role, outside the UN Security Council, is being  played by Japan and South Korea. I dare say that, in this  matter, the Czech Republic will very unanimously support any  measures to which the U.S. mission to the UN Security Council  decides to resort. [end recording]</p>

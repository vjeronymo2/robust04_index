			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Sport: Smiles in the sunshine state - Tennis It was a poignant moment in the deserted stadium that bright Florida afternoon last January. 'Here dad, you'd better hit the first ball, you've waited long enough]' Trey Buchholz tossed the balls across the net to his father, Butch, who caught them and swung his racket to inaugurate a new era at The Crandon Park Tennis Centre in Key Biscayne. If the former US No 1 was smiling with quiet satisfaction, one could understand it. For him, this was the realisation of a 30-year dream. It was also the end of a five-year legal struggle against the Matheson family (who had sold the 900-acre site to Dade County in 1940) and local opponents who were worried that the construction of a 14,000 seat stadium would bring a host of noisy sporting events and concerts to disturb the area's tranquillity. The political and environmental battle has cost millions in legal fees. Butch and his brother Cliff owe more than Dollars 2m while Dade County has run up an even larger bill. 'But it was worth it,' Buchholz insists. 'Back in the 1960s when I was part of (Jack) Kramer's professional group that was outlawed by the amateur game we used to sit around and look to the day when all the amateurs and pros would be competing together in a great tournament managed by the players. While our stage in those days was either a hangar or an old exhibition building, we dreamt of one day staging a fifth Grand Slam played in a super stadium somewhere.' It is a pleasure to report that the dream has been realised. Gone are the makeshift tents and trailers that have housed players, media and officials since that first Lipton Championship back in 1985 at the Laver Resort in Delray Beach. In their place, on a site that was once a rubbish dump, has risen a Dollars 20m state-of-the-art facility containing comfortable quarters for everyone, including the public, who have been attending this year's 10-day tournament in record numbers. Furthermore, for the remaining 50 weeks of the year the public will be able to book the courts at Crandon Park for their own private battles. The tournament, a partnership between the ATP Tour, the Women's Tennis Association, Dade County and the Buchholz brothers, may not be the fifth Grand Slam but it offers prize money of Dollars 3.3m. Sponsorship provides 60 per cent of the income, the sale of boxes and ordinary tickets generates 30 per cent. Television rights, retail sales, concession income, programme advertising and sales provide the balance. An independent Economic Impact Study, conducted by the University of Miami and the Miami Convention Bureau, has estimated that The Lipton, with its attendance of more than 200,000, generates Dollars 103m in annual income for the South Florida area. A new dimension has been added to the venue by the establishment of the USTA's National Training Department at the site under the direction of Ron Woods and former Wimbledon and US Open champion, Stan Smith. The director of coaching is former Tour player Nick Saviano who I have admired for his dedication in instilling a professional approach among the young American players he has guided on overseas trips. 'We have a perfect setting here,' says Saviano. 'Eventually there will be four red clay courts like the ones in Europe, four green American clay courts, plus two grass and 17 hard courts. We shall at last be able to prepare our players properly, wherever they are bound.' Saviano recognises that the young Americans have fallen behind the rest of the world. 'There was a time when the top Americans in their age groups were automatically as good as anyone in the world. That is no longer the case.' This week Andre Agassi has been setting the pace. His straight sets wins over two former world No 1s, Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, have confirmed the effectiveness of the wrist surgery that he resorted to after an injury plagued year in 1993. 'We are assessing it week by week', he said. The on-court Agassi certainly looks sharp and fast, more like the man who so delighted us at Wimbledon in 1992. 'It's definitely coming along much quicker than I expected', he said. 'My fitness speaks for itself.' The Agassi '94 should prove a very tasty vintage.</p>

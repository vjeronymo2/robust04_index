			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 23 Apr (INA) -- The international symposium  on human rights for women has emphasized that the international  community should adhere to an agreement on children's rights and  avoid discrimination between children.    In a statement issued today at the end of its meetings in  Baghdad, the symposium denounced the serious violations of  international laws and humanity that are committed against  children and women, especially during armed conflicts. The  statement said that discrimination and the unfair treatment of  women represent basic injustices and violations of the human  rights accepted by all international charters and norms.    The statement condemned using food and medicine as a tool  for  political pressures on world peoples to influence their  political choices and to undermine their right to freely choose  their future and their political and economic systems away from  external intervention.    The symposium welcomed the UN General Assembly adoption of a  declaration on ending violence against women in the public and  private sectors and to stop all forms of trade in women.    The symposium emphasized that countries should join the  agreement on eliminating discrimination against women and abide  by its rules in their national legislation and in implementation  of these rules.    The symposium recommended giving priority to funds that are  allotted for covering the needs of women and children over  repayment of foreign debts when introducing infrastructural  adaptation measures the World Bank imposes on Third World  countries.    The symposium emphasized its faith in the principles of the  UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and  its commitment to the objectives of the Nairobi strategy on  improving women's conditions by the year 2000 and on equality  and development.    The international symposium on human rights for women, which  was held in Baghdad on 20-22 April, was attended by 22 Arab and  foreign countries.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General Applicability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendments to part 121 would apply to all certificate holders operating under part 121 and to certain certificate holders operating under part 135 who would be required to comply with the part 121 training qualification requirements. The proposed requirements would also apply to certain part 135 certificate holders if they apply for and receive FAA authorization to comply with the part 121 training and qualification requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Commuter Operations Conducted Under Part 135 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part 135 commuter operations serving small and medium sized communities carry millions of passengers every year. The Regional Airline Association (RAA), whose membership consists primarily of commuter air carriers, estimates that more than 61 million passengers will be carried by RAA member airlines in 1997. Comprehensive training requirements, including CRM training, are important to the safety of these operations. Part 121 training would benefit these operations because it provides more emphasis on training, whereas current part 135 rules rely more heavily on the testing and checking requirements set forth in subparts G and H of part 135. Part 121 also allows greater use of simulators resulting in two benefits: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Under &sect;121.407(c), simulator training can be substituted for repetitive proficiency checks (&sect;121.441) and certain recency requirements (&sect;121.439). This allows for greater flexibility and a more effective mix of training and checking activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Simulator training may include hazardous scenarios that would be imprudent to be included in inflight training. This also increases pilot proficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendments to &sect;&sect;121.431, 135.3, 135.241, 135.291, and 135.321(a) require the following certificate holders conducting commuter operations under part 135 to comply with the training, checking, and qualification requirements of part 121, subparts N and O, in place of the requirements of subparts E, G, and H of part 135: (1) Those that conduct commuter operations with airplanes for which two pilots are required by aircraft type certification rules, and (2) those that conduct commuter operations with airplanes having a passenger seating configuration, excluding any pilot seat, of 10 seats or more. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``commuter operations'' will apply to both intrastate and interstate operations with the frequency of operations set forth in the definition of ``Commuter Air Carrier'' in SFAR 38&hyph;2. Thus, intrastate operations as described above with a frequency of operations described in SFAR 38&hyph;2's definition of ``commuter air carrier'' would also be subject to the proposals in this NPRM. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

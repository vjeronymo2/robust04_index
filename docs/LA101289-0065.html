			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> CRUDE PLOT SHIFTS BUT NICE CARS ON 'CAMPION'  </P> <P> Public television launches a new "Mystery!" season tonight, but the results are  mixed, even for die-hard fans of British crime fiction.  </P> <P> The mild-mannered snooping of blue-nosed detective Albert Campion, played with  twitty charm by English actor Peter Davison, is fetching, and the British 1930s  countryside setting is a cozy respite from urban crime zones. But the opening  two-parter, "Campion: A Case of the Late Pig" (at 9 tonight on Channels 28 and  15, with the concluding episode airing next Thursday) is meandering to the  point of distraction.  </P> <P> The plot twists are stagy, even crude. More interesting are the nifty  roadsters, the manors, the tweeds, the evening wear (people dress for dinner)  and the geranium urns. One of those pots is a weapon.  </P> <P> The show anticipates a series in which style and tone seem far superior to  content. Having never read a Margery Allingham thriller, four of which were  adapted into "Mystery's" eight weekly installments (two episodes to a story), I  can't guage what justice or injustice was done to the late British novelist.  But the debuting two episodes squander their modest pearls on a script (by Jill  Hyem) leaden with red herrings.  </P> <P> Seeking the killer of an unbeloved, old school chum aptly known as Pig,  Davison's Campion cuts a Clark Kent-like figure with his round eye glasses and  his awkward sex appeal.  </P> <P> An actress with the melodic name of Dilys Laye delivers a bouquet of a  performance as a frilly hostess of chirpy sophistication; in fact, she almost  steals the hour. Brian Glover is the hero's pugnacious valet.  </P> <P> During the hokey capture of the murderer and the protagonist's unabashed  explanation of the plot convolutions (concluding the second episode next week),  director Robert Chetwyn loses his grip entirely. Even Hitchcock could not have  salvaged this amateur ending.  </P></p>

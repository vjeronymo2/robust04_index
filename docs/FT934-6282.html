			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 1.8% as Hong Kong halts slide Arbitrage-linked selling and margin unwinding depressed share prices, and the Nikkei average fell 1.8 per cent to a nine-month low, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 lost 317.73 at 17,067.11, after setting a day's high of 17,544.85 in the morning and a low in the afternoon of 16,993.90. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 27.79, or 1.9 per cent, to 1,466.04. In London, later, Mr Nicholas Knight, the Nomura strategist, re-examined his worst case scenario for the Nikkei and revised it down to 12,000. Equities gained ground in early trading on a rise in the futures market. However, as futures prices lost steam, profit-taking, arbitrage selling and margin unwinding overwhelmed buying by life assurers and tokkin, or specified money trusts. Traders said life insurers were trying to support the Nikkei above the 17,000 level to sustain their unrealised profits on shareholdings. Meanwhile, corporate investors unloaded stocks to establish profits before share prices fell further. Volume came to 270m shares, against 284m. Declines led rises by 872 to 158, with 130 issues unchanged. In London, however, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 3.15 at 1,186.62. East Japan Railway dipped Y4,000 to Y436,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y15,000 to Y730,000. Foreign investors sold automobile stocks, and Toyota Motor receded Y30 to Y1,740 and Honda Motor Y70 to Y1,310. High-technology issues also lost ground, Sony weakening Y100 to Y4,650, Hitachi Y17 to Y773 and NEC Y38 to Y822. Financials were lower on arbitrage selling linked to the Topix index. Fuji Bank dropped Y110 to Y2,120 and Sumitomo Bank Y130 to Y2,170. Gas companies, which reported firm earnings after lower fuel costs, thanks to the stronger yen, were among the day's few gainers. Tokyo Gas, which saw its interim pre-tax profits surge by more than 200 per cent, added Y4 at Y470. Steels rallied after recent heavy selling. Kawasaki Steel put on Y4 at Y317. Hohsui, a fishing concern, climbed Y80 to Y490 on rumours of a speculative buy recommendation from an unknown source. In Osaka, the OSE average declined for the third day in a row, falling 298.19 to 19,183.26 in volume of 19.7m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, lost Y400 to Y6,500. Roundup A firmer tone emerged in many Pacific Rim markets after the weakness of the previous two sessions. HONG KONG saw a halt to its six-day losing streak as the market closed 2.2 per cent higher, buoyed by moderate bargain hunting and futures linked demand as concern eased over the outlook for US interest rates. The Hang Seng index gained 202.04 at 9,238.06. Hutchison Whampoa surged HKDollars 2.50, or 8.33 per cent, to HKDollars 32.50 amid speculation that the company is planning a convertible bond issue. AUSTRALIA was supported by bargain hunting, after Tuesday's falls, and an improving futures market and the All Ordinaries index improved 22.8 to 2,032.4 in ADollars 421.9m turnover. Boral's manufacturing arm, Azon, made its debut at a 12-cent premium to its ADollars 2.00 issue price. It ended at ADollars 2.15. SEOUL saw waves of strong buying focused on highly capitalised stocks swamp profit-taking in asset situations, taking the composite index forward 11.08 to 828.98. BANGKOK staged a decisive rebound, spurred by active buying by mutual funds. The market index closed 16.43 higher at 1,321.67 in turnover of Bt12.7bn. SINGAPORE edged ahead, the Straits Times Industrial index firming 4.10 to 2,080.79 and paring Tuesday's 20-point loss. TAIWAN finished lower on a late wave of selling triggered by news that Hsu Li-nung, a leading member of the ruling Nationalist Party, was defecting to the New Party ahead of Saturday's local government elections. The weighted index moved narrowly for most of the session but closed 44.87 down at 4,189.88, off a low of 4,177.31. MANILA was mixed, with profit-takers dominating early trade and bargain hunters coming in during the last hour. The composite index ended 16.40 off at 2,372.40. KUALA LUMPUR improved after two days of losses, the composite index gaining 3.42 at 970.30. SHANGHAI's China B shares were hit by profit-taking, while SHENZHEN Bs staged a rebound. The Standard Chartered Securities Shanghai B-share index was 2.76, or 3.7 per cent, lower at 71.23, while the SC Securities Shenzhen B-share index added 1.81, or 2.2 per cent, at 82.71 after the 6.2 per cent decline of the previous two sessions. KARACHI closed lower on a correction that took the KSE index 10.99 down to 1,704.93 after the sharp rise of the previous month.</p>

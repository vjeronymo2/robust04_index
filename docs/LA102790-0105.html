			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP  </P> <P> In another Northwest Valley Conference game:  </P> <P> Chatsworth 24, Cleveland 20 -- Chatsworth chalked up its first league victory  behind the running of tailback Rayna Stewart, who rushed for a game-high 126  yards in 18 carries.  </P> <P> Quarterback Brandon Ruedy completed five of 13 passes for 59 yards and two  touchdowns for Chatsworth (2-4, 1-3).  </P> <P> Cleveland quarterback David Erhardt returned after missing two games because of  a separated shoulder. He completed 14 of 24 for 179 yards and one touchdown,  and also scored on a one-yard run.  </P> <P> Erhardt couldn't overcome the Cavaliers' mistakes, however. Cleveland was  penalized 14 times for 163 yards.  </P> <P> Cleveland (0-5-1, 0-4) trailed, 14-0, in the first quarter when Erhardt entered  the game. The Cavaliers were forced to punt on that possession, but they scored  on the ensuing one, capped by Erhardt's one-yard run.  </P> <P> Ibn Bilal gained 83 yards in 12 carries for Cleveland, and caught two passes  for 20 yards and a touchdown -- a 21-yarder with 2:21 left.

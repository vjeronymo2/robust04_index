			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERVICE WITH A SCOWL  </P> <P> The good news is that Lee Green's article, "Service With a Scowl" (March 5),  made me laugh more than once as I read of his encounters with various rude  retailers. The bad news is he's right. A polite consumer doesn't stand a chance  against abrasive retailers. Thus, one is forced to resort to similar behavior  to survive. And so, the vicious circle continues; rude retailers create rude  consumers, and on and on. Prof. Jerald Jellison could have helped by offering  some suggestions on how to effectively diffuse such hostile confrontation  between consumers and retailers. Then, maybe, we would have a "kinder, gentler"  marketplace.  </P> <P> MARY JO SHELTON-DUTCHER  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

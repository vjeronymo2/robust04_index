			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Shulin (0491 2579 2651): "How Young People Viewed </F> Society in 1993"]    [Text] From October 1992 to May 1993, a survey and  analysis on current ideological and political conditions among  young people was jointly carried out by the China Youth Research  Center and the School of Political Studies for Young Chinese; by  youth research centers in the provinces and municipalities of  Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shandong, Liaoning, and Lianyun  Port; and by the Guangxi Communist Youth League [CYL] School and  Sichuan's Pioneer Radio Factory.    The objects of the survey were students, scientific and  technological personnel, teachers, CYL cadres, and young people  in other professions whose ages ranged from 18 to 35. Emphasis  was placed on young people who have high educational attainments.    The issues revealed by the survey are now analyzed as  follows:  <H5>  1. Political Attitudes Become Stable </H5>   Among respondents to the questionnaires, those who said they  "care" or "care very much" about the 14th party congress  accounted for 42.6 percent and 46.5 percent respectively, and  the total was 89.1 percent. Those who said they "do not care"  accounted for only 1.4 percent. Those who said they "support"  and "fully support" the resolutions adopted by the 14th Party  Congress accounted for 37.9 percent and 37.4 percent  respectively, and those who said they "obey the party's  decisions" accounted for 17.9 percent, so the total for those  who gave a positive and enthusiastic response accounted for 93.2  percent, while 6.8 percent of the respondents said they would  "have to think about it."    Another survey by questionnaire aimed at university students  shows:    When a questionnaire-type survey was extended to a wider  scope of young people, asking their opinions on China's current  political situation, the results showed:    Those who thought the political situation was stable or  relatively stable accounted for 88.7 percent, those who thought  it was not adequately stable accounted for only 9.5 percent, and  those who did not care accounted for only 1.8 percent. Looking  at their professions, we can find that teachers and students in  particular tended to view the political situation as stable or  relatively stable, as 90.3 percent and 89.6 percent of them  respectively said so; the percentage of scientists and  technicians who said so was lower at 76.7 percent. Among those  who thought the political situation was not stable enough, young  graduate students in particular thought this way, as 18.5  percent of them said so.    Before and after the spring festival of 1992, a "red sun  craze" emerged in the whole country. Responses by young people  to questions concerning this phenomenon were: 1) respect for  the leader of the revolution (23.1 percent); 2) new idolatry  (7.9 percent); 3) trying to be fashionable (21.2 percent); 4)  nostalgia (18.7 percent); 5) dissatisfied with the current  situation (15.4 percent); and 6) hard to tell (13.7 percent).    What is the status of the party's four cardinal principles  in  the new period, which centers on economic construction? Among  young people, 80.5 percent said "they must be upheld," 14  percent said "some areas must be upheld," and 2.1 percent said  "there is no need for them to be upheld." A survey in October  1988 asked a question which read: "In your opinion, is it  necessary to uphold the four cardinal principles in order to  carry out reform?" Among those who answered only 28.7 percent  said "it is very necessary," and a majority of them chose "it is  necessary but must not become rigid" (53.56 percent). Those who  said "it is not necessary" and "it does not matter" accounted  for 7.61 percent.  <H5>  2. Optimistic About Economic Reform </H5>   Answering a question on the way for our country's economic  reform, 42.5 percent of respondents advocated strengthening the  market economy, and 36.4 percent advocated putting the market in  the main position and planning in a supplementary position.  Persons showing a positive attitude by choosing these two  answers accounted for 78.9 percent, while those advocating the  planned economy accounted for 21.3 percent.    Regarding publicity given by the mass media to the great  tide  of reform, most young people thought it was conducive to  emancipating the mind (42.1 percent) and attracting foreign  capital (29 percent), and the total was 71.1 percent.    As for the market economy mechanism itself, no one was  against it.    Concerning the newly announced reform measures, the result  of  the survey exceeded all expectations by showing that most young  people were optimistic about them.    We then came to the issue of adjusting and increasing goods  prices. In an 1988 survey of ideological conditions among young  people throughout the country, 92.75 percent of the respondents  to the questionnaires thought that panic buying at that time was  caused by a loss of control over price reform and the people's  inability to adapt to the lifting of restrictions on prices,  65.71 percent thought that restrictions on prices must be lifted  on condition wages are increased correspondingly, and among the  "10 most worried about problems," young people put "random price  increases" in first position, as 63.79 percent of them said  so.    But this kind of response changed during the recent  survey. The questionnaires tried to find out the reason for  calmness among the people in light of recent increases in  transportation and fuel prices by the state, and the result was:  Among the respondents, 43.6 percent said they "realize that  this is required by the development of a socialist market  economy," 31.1 percent said their "ability to withstand price  adjustments has increased," while 21.2 percent chose the  unenthusiastic answer that "there is no method even if one is  dissatisfied," and 4.1 percent said the increases "bred  discontent."    We then came to the issue of not assigning jobs to  university  graduates. This was an issue which emerged in 1988 and caused  controversy. In the past, most university graduates have been  opposed to the implementation of this policy, saying that it  would lead to unhealthy practices such as going through the back  door. But the recent survey showed some changes. Among those  responding to the question of "how would you evaluate the  state's policy of not assigning jobs to university graduates,"  37.4 percent said it "can arouse enthusiasm for study among  students," 26.2 percent said the policy would "boost the  unhealthy practice of going through the back door," 26 percent  said the policy "is a policy not applicable at this time because  of a lack of conditions," and 10.5 percent said "it is hard to  say." Here we can see that among young people, the proportion  of those who support the reform is higher; of the three rival  opinions, the one with an optimistic attitude had the edge.  <H5>  3. Hate Corruption and Call for Reform </H5>   Young people's grievances against social problems mainly  originates from corrupt phenomena among party and government  personnel. This situation is basically similar to the results  of the 1988 survey.    A question in the questionnaires asked: "What is your  assessment of the extent of the emerging phenomenon of  corruption?" Of the respondents, 89.3 percent thought the  corruption phenomenon at this time is very serious or rather  serious, and this was an absolute majority; on the other hand,  only 2.9 percent said that it was not serious, only 1.4 percent  said that it did not matter or they did not care about it, and  6.4 percent said that it was hard to tell. These three answers  accounted for only 10.7 percent. Arranged in order of the  degree of hatred, the five kinds of evil social phenomena hated  most by young people are: bureaucracy, abuse of power for  private interest, corruption and bribery, dissolute lifestyles,  and others.    Among the four choices for the statement that "the crux of  our country's reform of the political system is," most  respondents chose "eliminating corruption and establishing  democratic decisionmaking and democratic supervisory  mechanisms," which accounted for 50.3 percent of answers, while  the second most popular choice was "separation of the party and  government, separation of government and enterprises, and  streamlining government and delegating power to lower levels,"  which accounted for 41.1 percent. In the 1988 survey, the most  popular answer to the same question was "separation of party and  government (47.8 percent), and the second most popular choice  was "democratic decisionmaking" (30.15 percent), while the  radical advocacy of "stripping them of their special privileges"  ranked fifth among seven crucial measures.    One question asked: "What do you think is the most important  factor harming the stable situation in the socialist country?"  In order of popularity, the 10 choices are ranked as follows:  1) a backward economy and low living standards; 2) the legal  system is not sound and the social order is chaotic; 3) a poor  law and order situation; 4) lackluster efforts to combat  corruption; 5) price increases; 6) unfair distribution; 7) timid  reform and opening up; 8) agitation by foreign reactionary  forces; 9) influence from contemporary Western trends of  thought; and 10) unstable policies.    When comparing the process of reform of the political system  with the process of reform of the economic system in our  country, most young people thought that reform of political  system had lagged behind reform of the economic system (57.7  percent), while the other three choices made up 42.3 percent.  <H3>  4. Young People Are More Chaotic in Areas of Ideology and  Theory </H3>   Within the questionnaire there was a question which asked  about the "situation of faith in socialism among most of the  young people around you," and the survey showed:    Only 7.7 percent said they had firm faith, while 14.2  percent  said they had no faith, and both were small proportions. Most  young people were in the condition of "having faith, but also  puzzled."    Analyzing by level of educational attainment, we may see  that  graduate students are the most pronounced in saying that they  "have no faith," as 27.3 percent of them at this level said so,  and 5.4 percent of undergraduates and students at higher  learning institutes also said this. However, only 6.3 percent  of those at the middle-school level said this, and this is far  lower than the rate at the graduate-student level. Analyzing by  profession, we may see that 9.3 percent of scientists and  technicians said they "have no faith," and this is the highest  percentage; 6 percent of teachers and students said they had no  faith; and only 1.6 percent of CYL cadres said they "have no  faith," and this was the lowest percentage.    In the questionnaire, one question read: "Listed below are  various kinds of understanding of patriotism. Which would you  tend to pick? The result was: 37 percent of respondents thought  that "to be patriotic, one must love socialism"; 38.2 percent  thought that "to be patriotic, one does not necessarily have to  love socialism"; and 24.8 percent thought that "to be patriotic,  one at least is not opposed to socialism." The first two  choices were more pronounced.    We then came to the socialist market economy. During  conversations and discussions, we discovered that quite a number  of young people thought that socialism with Chinese  characteristics is in fact capitalism with Chinese  characteristics.    Within the questionnaire, a question read: "In your opinion,  how does China's democracy look when compared with capitalist  countries?" Of the respondents, 28.3 percent thought that  "China's democratic system was better," 7.8 percent thought that  "the democratic system in capitalist countries was better," and  a majority, 57.6 percent, thought that "each has its own  advantages and disadvantages."    The questionnaire also asked about the essence of the great  changes in the former Soviet Union and East Europe, and 57.3  percent of respondents thought that these changes were peaceful  evolution caused by capitalism, 21.4 percent thought that the  changes were the "roads of reform chosen by the various  countries themselves," and 11.8 percent attributed the changes  to the failure of the socialist system.    "What is the main reason, in your opinion, for the several  student movements since reform?" The answers were as follows:  "Caused by social problems" was chosen by many people  (accounting for 41.6 percent), while 15.9 percent of young  people thought that student movements were a way to express  themselves, and 7.5 percent thought that student movements were  an embodiment of patriotism. Those who thought that the student  movements were influenced by the trend of bourgeois liberation  thoughts accounted for 27.4 percent, and those who thought young  students were not mature enough and prone to cause trouble  accounted for 7.7 percent. An analysis based on the level of  educational attainment shows that the graduate-student level was  the most pronounced in assessing the student movements with an  affirmative attitude (94.8 percent), and this attitude dropped a  bit among undergraduates and students in higher learning  institutes (65.9 percent). An analysis based on profession  shows that more scientific and technological personnel and  teachers hold an affirmative attitude toward the student  movements, making up 73.7 percent and 69.3 percent respectively.  The percentage among students dropped a bit to 62.9 percent.    In the past, in the area of assessing student movements,  there has been a similar tendency of affirmation. Within the  questionnaire, a question asked about the cause of the 1985  student movement, and 47.8 percent of respondents said it was  caused by "dissatisfaction with the unhealthy trend at that  time"; 18.5 percent said "it was patriotic, opposing the  resurrection of Japanese militarism"; 22.6 percent said "it was  instigated by people who have ulterior motives"; and 11 percent  thought it was caused by the "inability to adapt to the reform,  opening up, and new situation." Those who gave an affirmative  assessment accounted for 66.3 percent, and those who gave a  negative assessment accounted for 33.7 percent.    When asked "what is the major worry in your life," most  young  people chose "too low income" among the seven available choices.  Other choices were ranked in order of popularity as follows: a  lack of housing, poor interpersonal relations, not being able to  apply what you have learned, difficulty in getting married and  in love affairs, not having any way to give play to one's  talents, and difficulty in going out of the country. In the  1988 survey, the "low income" answer ranked in fifth position,  and the other four choices ranked in order of popularity were:  random price increases, leaders treating people unfairly,  dissatisfaction with current job, and a lack of good  recreational venues.    In the survey, a question asked: "What, in your opinion, is  the goal which is most difficult to reach in the process of  catching up with and surpassing the four little dragons of  Asia?" Those who chose "level of educational development"  accounted for 48.5 percent, 26.2 percent chose "level of  economic development," 15.4 percent chose "level of social  morals," and 9.9 percent chose the "level of science and  technology." Here we can see that young people are very  pessimistic about the current situation and future of education.  Primary and secondary education, especially primary and  secondary education in rural areas, is in many aspects worse  than in the period shortly after the liberation. The road to  university education for peasant children is becoming narrower  and narrower. There is a shortage of funds for universities to  the extent that university presidents have no mood to grasp  teaching, but spend their energy mainly on creating channels of  income.    As for going to university with one's own money or the real  possibility that one must go to university by paying one's own  fees in the future, quite a number of university students and  their parents said they could not bear. When answering the  question: "What is your view on going to university by your own  expense," 43.9 percent of respondents said they "could not bear  it," 37.5 percent said they "could bear it," and 18.6 percent  said they "do not care."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hiroyuki Kawaguchi, senior researcher, Yomiuri </F> Shimbun Research Center]    [Excerpts] Masanori Tanimoto, a candidate recommended by  the leading coalition parties, won a gubernatorial election in  Ishikawa Prefecture on 27 March, where the leading coalition  parties and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] crashed against  each other for the first time following the collapse of the  "1955 structure." Uniform local elections are scheduled to take  place next spring, and an election for the upper house next  summer. The recent election revealed what could be expected in  showdowns in a series of future local elections and the next  general election based on the system of small electoral  districts.    According to the election results, Tanimoto received 288,085  votes, winning over Hiroshi Ishikawa, a candidate recommended by  the LDP, by a narrow margin of about 10,000 votes. Takashi  Shimizu, chairman of the Prefectural Medical Association and a  Communist-inclined independent, received only 48,417 votes.  <H5>  A New Governor for the First Time in 31 Years </H5>   For the people in Ishikawa Prefecture, the gubernatorial  election came about quite unexpectedly, for the death of  Governor Yoichi Nakanishi in a hospital (on 2 February) brought  a drastic change in the situation.    Nakanishi in fact had occupied the top position in  prefectural politics for 31 years since 1963. He planned to  retire upon completion of his recent term in office. Maneuvering  behind the scenes for new gubernatorial candidates was well in  progress. But who could have predicted that the governor's death  would open the curtain for election campaigns?    There is a unique conservative political climate in Ishikawa  Prefecture that disfavors conflicts. Also, a heavy residue  remained from the gubernatorial election three years ago, the  so-called "Mori-Oku war of representatives." If possible,  therefore, the people must have hoped for an election without  any waves. But, then, why did the central-government-style  showdown ensue, pitting Hiroshi Ishikawa, a Dietman from the  upper house backed by the LDP, against Masanori Tanimoto, a  former vice governor backed by the leading coalition parties?    In a sense, the nationwide trend in favor of change has also  reached the conservative prefecture of Ishikawa. The situation  seems to have been influenced by the change of power in the  central government, which sent shock waves throughout Japan last  year, and also by the system of small electoral districts to be  introduced in the near future.    However, we should not overlook the fact that both the  demonic aspect of elections and the political climate peculiar  to Ishikawa pushed the candidates and their associates into a  maelstrom of conflicting interests, and, as a result, the  structure of a showdown gradually became apparent. The  gubernatorial election in Ishikawa showed clear evidence that  the politics in Japan was changing at the grassroots level.    Here is a vivid example that shows the conservative climate  in Ishikawa Prefecture. Five Dietmen are elected from the  prefecture: Yoshio Mori (LDP secretary general) from the first  district, Keiwa Okuda (chairman of the lower house Committee on  Rules and Administration and a member of Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party]), Yuzuru Shimazaki (chairman of the lower house  Committee on Education and a member of the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ]), Misoji Sakamoto (former chief cabinet  secretary and a member of the LDP) from the second district, and  Tsutomu Kawara (former director general of the Defense Agency  and a member of the LDP). This roster of five individuals became  complete by 1972, and hasn't changed at all since then. No other  prefecture shares this experience.    A similar situation exists in the business sector of the  prefecture. Taro Miya (chairman of Daiwa Department Store) has  been president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in  Kanazawa since 1974.    Incidentally, former Governor Nakanishi became a vice  governor, being reassigned from a chief of the Accounting  Section at the Ministry of Home Affairs in June 1961. In  February 1963 he ran for the governorship and won a  gubernatorial election for the first time. Having been reelected  every time since then, he won an election for the eighth time in  February 1991, the most wins in the nation, and in July 1992 he  broke the record of the longest tenure as governor held by the  late Ryozo Okuda, former governor of Nara.    As a reason for his feat, some people point out the art of  self-protection, a tradition since the Kaga clan. But, a reason  should be traced to the regional character. Even today, the  locals refer to those from other prefectures as "people from  afar."    Furthermore, the recent election was influenced heavily by  the serious residue of the gubernatorial election three years  ago, in which Eitaro Sugiyama, the then vice governor,  challenged Nakanishi, who was fighting to get elected for the  eighth time, developing the campaign into a mud-slinging contest  that divided the prefecture into two sides. Nakanishi had  support from Okuda and Kawara; Sugiyama from Mori and the then  opposition parties. This gubernatorial race was called the  "Mori-Oku war of representatives." In the end, Nakanishi gained  support from Miya, president of the Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, and won the election by a narrow margin. After the  election, however, the situation developed into numerous acts of  revenge, ranging from demotion of the opposing officials of the  prefecture to "withholding of job contracts" from the  construction companies that were in opposition.  <H5>  The Surge of Power To Stimulate Change [passage </H5> omitted]    Kanazawa has an expression: The "Kanazawa Monroe Doctrine,"  signifying its "closed" nature. I've also heard an unfamiliar  word, "Kokabukai," quite often. This word will be explained  later, but it is likely to become an attribute for "change" in  Kanazawa.    Even until now, there has been some indication of change in  Ishikawa Prefecture, the "LDP's kingdom." In the upper house  election five years ago, which was said to have "moved the  mountains," Takashi Kurimori of Rengo [Japanese Private-Sector  Trade Union Confederation] defeated Hitoshi Shimazaki of the  LDP. Again, Shimazaki was a veteran statesman with a 19-year  political career, having served as justice minister. His defeat  was a prelude to change in the LDP kingdom.    However, a determining factor for the showdown in the recent  gubernatorial election was the breakup of the Takeshita faction  -- here, Okuda joined the forces creating Shinseito. The LDP had  allocated its constituency in the first district for the lower  house, clearly according to the native towns of its members --  Okuda to Kanazawa City and Mori to the South Kaga region.    The first time I heard the unfamiliar word, "Kokabukai," was  while having quite an ordinary conversation with a housewife. I  repeated, "Kokabukai?" And, then, she asked me in turn, "Don't  you know that?" I was flabbergasted. "Kokabukai" is a group of  associations organized, like dragnets, according the 51  districts of elementary schools in Kanazawa. It is the LDP's  network for gathering votes. It usually tries to promote a  feeling of unity between the LDP and the voters; its members  participate in various events sponsored by the LDP, sometimes in  busloads. Its name is being used as a proper noun, and its  superb ability to gather votes has been proved in various  elections in the past.    Once the LDP's two seats in the first district for the lower  house became established, allocation of constituents was  finalized by a tacit understanding. Naturally, Kanazawa's  "Kokabukai" was became Okuda's supporters' association. As a  result, when Shinseito was formed, Okuda took the LDP's enormous  constituency in Kanazawa, the chief city of the prefecture.    The LDP couldn't stomach this. The "Mori-Oku war" escalated,  and its effect was felt in the recent gubernatorial election. In  addition, as a coalition was formed in the central government, a  liaison committee for the leading coalition parties at the  prefectural level was established by the SDPJ, Shinseito,  Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and the United  Social Democratic Party [USDP].  <H5>  Beating the Trump Card for Unified Candidacy </H5>   Because of these circumstances and clashes, Misoji Sakamoto,  chairman of the LDP's prefectural organization, took action  quickly as soon as Governor Nakanishi was hospitalized on 4  October last year.    He sounded out Keiwa Okuda of Shinseito regarding possible  candidates for a future governor, saying, "We must avoid any  vacuum in our prefectural politics." At that time, he had a  reason to have absolute confidence in backing a unified  candidate. He knew well the close human relationship between  Okuda and Ishikawa, even when Hiroshi Ishikawa, who is a member  of the upper house and was recommended by the LDP in the recent  election, was named as a candidate three years ago.    "Itchu-Yonko" -- "Kanazawa First Middle School and Fourth  Higher School under the old educational system" -- is considered  as the elite path in Kanazawa. Sakamoto, Ishikawa, and Okuda are  all from this elite path. Ishikawa and Okuda in particular are  only one year apart, and "they have been close in a personal,  trusting relationship from their childhood days." Also, Okuda  became a Dietman from a local politician as a successor to the  late Eiichi Sakata, former agriculture minister and a don in the  political circles of the prefecture. Ishikawa had a kinship with  Sakata.    As such, Okuda and Ishikawa are connected in many ways.  Also,  Ishikawa is a local, and after having served as a vice minister  of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, he  became a member of the upper house (in a proportional district)  with support from the LDP. As a matter of course, he is deeply  involved in prefectural politics, and has connections with  Dietmen and other important people in the prefecture. Therefore,  it is reasonable for Sakamoto to believe that "in any event,  Okuda will support Ishikawa."    When he sounded out Okuda, Sakamoto explained in earnest the  importance of backing a unified candidate: "There won't be any  changes in policies. And, a power struggle that divides the  prefecture into two camps will only cause troubles to the people  in our prefecture. We shouldn't repeat that sort of thing. Also,  we shouldn't bring the political conflicts of the central  government into our local politics."    As expected, Okuda is said to have responded at that time,  saying, "Would you recommend Mr. Ishikawa (as our unified  candidate)?" In light of the mood against conflict permeating  the prefecture and the close human relationship between the two  individuals, it seemed that "the issue was resolved."    However, following the death of Governor Nakanishi on 2  February, the situation gradually changed. As a statesman from  the prefectural medical association, a young mayor, a famous  village headman, and others showed their interests in running  for governorship, and Ishikawa's name began to be mentioned as  the LDP's official candidate, a sense of crisis developed within  Shinseito and the SDPJ.    Hiroshi Kanahara, the acting chairman of Shinseito's  prefectural federation, was busy trying to make over "Kokabukai"  into an organization to support Okuda. Many people sent a  message to him, saying, "If we remain submissive to the LDP and  don't fight, our organization will become moribund." Okuda began  to waver a little, also. Because of this, he didn't accept any  requests for press or TV interviews, saying, "I need to form a  clear view of the situation first."    Reflecting on this, Takeshi Ikeda, chairman of the SDPJ's  prefectural headquarters that is part of the conference for  representatives of the liaison committee for the leading  coalition parties, says, "We were also under pressure from  below. We had to do something, but we didn't know what to do."  He adds: "Then, we thought it necessary first to find out what  the people in our prefecture were thinking. We came up with an  idea of surveying public opinion by randomly selecting  individuals, and asked our office to study the cost and other  aspects of conducting such a survey." In the meantime, Yutaka  Kurihara, vice chairman, submitted this idea to the executive  committee of the liaison committee, which in turn began to take  action in earnest for the gubernatorial election.  <H5>  A Symposium That Changed the Course </H5>   The liaison committee for the leading coalition parties,  however, is in a sense only "glasswork" like the central  government, a [fragile] collection of disparate groups. As a  result of outspoken discussions, it was decided as a compromise,  based on the proposal for a survey of public opinion, that they  would convene a "symposium to discuss an ideal governor for  Ishikawa Prefecture" on 12 February, and that they would  concurrently conduct a questionnaire survey of those attending.  They were to approach seven panelists individually, and they  contacted the LDP and obtained its consent.    In retrospect, however, this rather ordinary idea of having  a  symposium and a questionnaire survey turned out to be an  important watershed in determining the course of selecting a  gubernatorial candidate. It snowed heavily on the day of the  symposium, but despite the worry about its effect on attendance,  about 600 people gathered. During the symposium, various  opinions were actively exchanged: "I don't consider it  reasonable to follow the past practice of selecting candidates  at the central government level"; "How about calling for  candidates publicly"; and so on. There were also many people who  wanted to speak during the question and answer period. The  moderator was amazed.    The response rate for the questionnaire survey was  excellent;  480 people responded. What pleased the people from the leading  coalition parties most were the contents of the response: To the  question, "How do you like the relationship between the governor  and the prefecture to be?" 46.1 percent of the respondents  answered that "We have to seek a qualified individual anywhere,  not just from within our prefecture." This was well beyond the  response rate of 39.6 percent for the response that "The  governor should be a person who was born and raised in the  prefecture, and who is taking an active part in the prefectural  affairs." Also, to the question on "the candidate's stance on  party affiliation," 47.4 percent of the respondents answered  that "the candidate as a person is more important than his party  affiliation." This was well above the response rate of 26.1  percent for the answer, "The candidate can belong to any party  as long as he can carry out the prefectural politics justly and  fairly."    Are these responses the result of an influence left by the  former governor, who was from outside the prefecture and had  prevailed in the prefectural politics for 31 years? It could be  a strategic victory if the leading coalition parties were  considering at that time to support Vice Governor Masanori  Tanimoto, who shared a similar background. Tanimoto was from  Hyogo Prefecture, and was transferred from his position as a  section chief at the Ministry of Home Affairs to serve as vice  governor -- he had been on his new post for only two years and  three months.    On the other hand, the survey results were rather mortifying  for Ishikawa, who is a local and a member of the LDP and the  upper house. They gave the leading coalition parties a  justifiable reason "to oppose Mr. Ishikawa." They also made it  impossible for the LDP to openly contradict this reason.    Were this symposium and the questionnaire survey contrived  in  any way? To answer this question, I met one of the panelists,  Yoshiko Hayakawa, and asked her candidly, "Did you receive any  requests as to what you might say?" She responded rather  vacantly: "Probably, it was four days before [the symposium]  when Mr. Ikeda (chairman of the SDPJ's prefectural committee)  telephoned me. I said to him, `As I'm a lone wolf (a conference  interpreter), I may start saying something totally unexpected.'  Then, he said, `You can say whatever you want.' So, I accepted  the invitation."    To be sure, there were some leading questions in the  questionnaire survey. Judging from the stories told by the  officials of the leading coalition parties, however, selection  of candidates had not been negotiated among the parties at that  time. In fact, the situation was that the entire process of  candidate selection had not yet reached the stage of  negotiation. Ironically, this tardiness, compared to the LDP's  swift action, was later to become an important guidepost as well.    For a moment, let's move the stage back to Tokyo. As the  deadline for notification [of candidates] was approaching, the  LDP members probably felt that there was not much time left. On  14 February, Sakamoto asked Okuda, Shimazaki, and Kurimori--all  are members of the Diet from the leading coalition parties--to  gather in the Diet building and formally asked for their  cooperation to decide on a unified candidate. He asked them also  to begin selecting a candidate at the beginning of the following  week.    It has been said that no particular candidates were  mentioned  during the meeting. However, Sakamoto said with full confidence:  "Those who gathered today are all honest people. Although they  didn't name any candidates, they will be able to come to terms  with each other easily." Okuda, on the other hand, let his  doubts be known, saying, "Will we be able to overcome all  hurdles? I don't think it is that easy."    In the final analysis, this meeting in Tokyo triggered a  breakup. Komeito, the DSP, and the SDPJ in succession issued a  statement of "rejection of unified candidacy," saying, "In light  of the policy line drawn from the symposium of prefectural  citizens, we cannot accept a Dietman candidate chosen in Tokyo."  In other words, the meeting provided the leading coalition  parties with another "justifiable reason" to "oppose selection  of a candidate at the central level."    Of course, the political motive of each party is obvious.  Yuzuru Shimazaki, a Dietman from the SDPJ, made an honest  confession: "If Mr. Okuda of Shinseito bands together with the  LDP in Tokyo, our side will become stripped. Therefore, we tried  to place our first priority on the framework of the leading  coalition parties." Beaming, he said, "Honestly, I was surprised  to discover that more than 45 percent of the respondents to the  questionnaire survey conducted at the symposium felt it  unnecessary for their governor to be from their own prefecture."  He added further, "Times have changed, but the LDP refuses to  become an opposition party, just as we are failing to become  leading parties. We are no longer in the era when candidates for  governor were chosen at the central government level." He  probably wanted to emphasize the importance of the selection  process itself.  <H5>  The LDP Took Decisive Action </H5>   Okuda didn't make his stance clear even around that time.  Keigo Ishimoto, the general secretary of the LDP's prefectural  federation, vented his frustration: "I can't stand the teasing  tactics any longer. If we keep going like this, our federation  will break apart internally." At last on 21 February, the LDP  took decisive action by holding a large-scale meeting in Tokyo  with Diet members and the executives of the prefectural  federation. They decided to ask Ishikawa to run for governor. At  the same time, they also proposed to the leading coalition  parties to make a joint recommendation.    To this, Ishikawa replied curtly, "I'll give it serious  consideration." He didn't make his intention clear. As  "unification" [of candidacy] was a condition agreed upon during  the previous sounding, he might have felt somehow that "the  promise was not kept."    Tsutomu Kawara, an LDP Dietman, explains: "Our procedure  might have been deficient. We should have made our points clear  in our public speeches why we needed Mr. Ishikawa now and why we  had to make adjustments. To the members of the SDPJ, Shinseito,  Komeito, and the DSP who had been affected by the action taken  by the coalition government, we gave them a chance to enjoy  their get-together." As a result, the leading coalition parties  issued a statement of denunciation and immediately held a  liaison conference to select an opposing candidate.    They came up with five possible candidates, including a  college professor, a high-ranking government official, and a  vice governor. In the end, Tanimoto was judged to be "an ideal  candidate for governor at the present time." On 24 February, the  leading coalition parties made an official request to Tanimoto  to run for governor. However, Tanimoto replied simply, "I  consider it a very important request," and continued his duty as  acting governor.    By this time, Ishikawa made up his mind clearly to run for  governorship, saying, "It is regrettable that unification was  not achieved." According to a person within the LDP, a wavering  Ishikawa finally made the decision because he was pressured by  his local supporters who said, "You once were a vice minister.  If you are sideswiped by a section chief (i.e., Mr. Tanimoto),  you won't be able to walk about the town of Kanazawa at ease."    Even around this time, a dominant opinion within the LDP was  that "Mr. Tanimoto will probably not accept the request." As the  LDP holds the majority of seats in the prefectural assembly in  Ishikawa, "even if he [Tanimoto] wins, he will have a hellish  time dealing with the assembly."    However, Okuda indicated his intention to back Tanimoto  during the rally for establishment of Shinseito in Mikawa on 27  February: "I would like to recommend the second-highest ranking  individual, who has a promising future, rather than someone who  was once a grand champion." This left no room for further  negotiation. Tanimoto also made it clear that he would step  forward as a candidate.    Kanahara of Shinseito, who served as campaign manager for  Tanimoto, says, "Mr. Tanimoto must have been shocked when we  asked him to become a candidate. I'm so glad that he decided to  run." Tanimoto speaks of the reason for his decision sparingly:  "Because my wife let me make up my mind...." As he had been  governing the prefectural politics since Nakanishi was  hospitalized in October last year, he probably decided to bet on  the attractiveness of the governorship, rather than on the  hellish future of dealing with the assembly.    For Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary general, it was the worst  outcome. Considering his relationship with Okuda, he delegated  all negotiations to Sakamoto, chairman of the prefectural  federation. He remained as a standby, saying, "I'll come forward  if there is any chance for readjustment at the last minute." He  lost this chance forever. But, as soon as he foresaw the coming  fight, he didn't let his fighting spirit go unnoticed: "The  belligerent attitude three years ago killed the governor  (Nakanishi). This time again, they are trying to use the  gubernatorial election as a means to expand their political  power. I can't let that happen."    It was only on 7 March that Okuda finally decided to  disclose  his thoughts on the [election] process. At the office of the  lower house Committee on Rules and Administration, he said as  follows, choosing his words carefully:    "Mr. Ishikawa is my long-time friend. His character,  personality, knowledge, and his intention to remain in Ishikawa  Prefecture till the end -- all this considered, I still think  he's best suited as governor. But, Mr. Tanimoto is also a very  capable man. In any event, politics at the central government  has been changing, and this change is pressing on us also.  Throughout the prefectural assembly and supporters'  associations, there has been a rise of the fighting spirit  [against the LDP]. I myself made a difficult decision, thinking  about how tightly the leading coalition parties could unite  during this election. If things didn't go quite right, the  solidarity would prove not to be genuine."    No doubt, he must have agonized over his deep personal  relationship with Ishikawa. On the other hand, however, he  seriously considered protecting the supporters'  organization--restructuring it as the Shinseito  organization--and solidifying the leading coalition parties for  elections under the system of small electoral districts. He  [Okuda] is shrewd--at the time of the breakup of the Tanaka  faction, he organized the middle-of-the-roaders and eventually  went for Noboru Takeshita, and he later joined Shinseito after  the breakup of the Takeshita faction. He already finished  transforming all of the 51 "Kokabukai" in Kanazawa City into the  "Shinseito Kokabukai," establishing "Shinseito Kanazawa."  Probably because of this, he said with confidence, "If the LDP  loses this election, its organization will become very shaky."  <H5>  The Lineup, Vying for the System of Small Electoral Districts </H5>   Countering this, however, the LDP had also established its  own "LDP Kokabukai" in every school district, although far less  in membership. As a result, "Kokabukai," the famous word in  Kanazawa City, is no longer a proper noun. As a harbinger of a  series of political restructuring at the central government,  this type of restructuring of local organizations is likely to  spread quickly throughout the nation.    Also, as soon as it was known that the election battle would  take place, the LDP came up with a series of strategic measures  based on the assumption of introduction of the system of small  electoral districts. First, it brought forward a strategy to  draw upon the full power of Dietmen by creating a tripartite  system of campaign headquarters in Kanazawa, Kaga, and Noto.  This system is sure to become a national model for future  elections of governors and members of the upper house.    Here, the leading coalition parties are having a difficult  time. Ikeda of the SDPJ made a grave comment: "In gubernatorial  elections, we have experienced a joint ride many times, so I  don't see any problems here. But, it won't be that easy in a  small electoral district. The results of the recent election  will become a good reference point in selecting candidates for  small districts. If they gobble up good districts only, like  assigning Mr. Okuda to the new first district, and the SDPJ to  somewhere else, we won't be able to stand it. We'll have to talk  seriously when the time comes."    Yet, he added: "The recent election is a touchstone. As we  have to win at any cost, we are not thinking about the future.  Rengo decided for the first time to initiate a drive for  campaign contribution of 500 yen [per person]." In future  elections in small districts, this kind of activity should  become increasingly common.    During the gathering of its Hakui branch office members to  encourage the candidate at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry  Hall in Hakui, the LDP, which monopolizes two seats in Noto,  orchestrated a stage performance of having Sakamoto and Kawara  welcome and shake hands with Ishikawa for the first time in  front of the supporters. At this, the supporters applauded.    Although it used to be said that "the worst enemy of an LDP  Dietman in a medium-constituency district is another LDP  Dietman," the two [Sakamoto and Kawara] rode amicably in the  same loudspeaker car. Seemingly embarrassed, however, Sakamoto  feigned ignorance and said, "The gubernatorial election is our  cause. If you don't agree with this cause, you'll be considered  an enemy." On the other hand, Kawara explained the fact of the  matter honestly: "We don't know who will be chosen (as a  candidate for the new small third district), but we decided to  establish a trusting relationship among the interested parties."    Once chosen as a candidate in a small district, how  completely you take the political foundation of the other  Dietman from the same party will become a determining factor in  winning the election. Therefore, we will be likely to see this  kind of scene all over the nation. [passage omitted]    The ceremonies at both camps in the morning of the  notification date on 10 March were quite befitting as an  oncoming battle between the leading coalition parties and the  LDP. At the Tanimoto camp, an encouraging telegram from the  prime minister was read aloud, boosting spirits: "This will have  an important effect on the future of the coalition government as  well. We must win for sure. Just as we changed the central  government, we must also change local governments."    At the Ishikawa camp, all Dietmen from the prefecture were  present. In addition, three members of the upper house, who are  Ishikawa's colleagues and from outside the prefecture, including  Hiroshi Miyazawa, showed up at the ceremony and electrified the  supporters.    An election campaign, however, can be quite a cruel  experience for certain individuals. As there is no predicting  the eventual outcome of the election, many heads of local  governments, including mayors of cities, towns, and villages,  were confused and determined to remain silent. Almost tearfully,  therefore, Kanazawa Mayor Tamotsu Yamaide, who has a support  base of the "big alliance" between the LDP and the coalition  parties, had to make "opening remarks for both ceremonies."  First, at the ceremony for candidate Tanimoto at Ishikawa  Gokoku Shrine, he praised the candidate: "I had the pleasure of  working with Mr. Tanimoto. He understands the pains at the local  government level. He is a wonderful man." Then, 40 minutes later  at the ceremony for candidate Ishikawa at Oyama Shrine, he began  similarly, showing his solicitude in a desperate attempt: "Mr.  Ishikawa has experience in national politics. I'm sure he will  satisfy our expectations. He is a wonderful man."  <H5>  Double Recommendation in Desperation </H5>   Possibly, businessmen in the prefecture were much more  desperate than others. As their position was not clear even on  the notification day, I requested telephone interviews to the  offices of President Miya of Kanazawa Chamber of Commerce and  Industry; Vice President Toshio Magara, president of Magara  Construction; and so on. Every one of their offices responded:  "He is on a business trip."    The mystery was solved when I saw the list of supporters for  each candidate. Both lists for Tanimoto and Ishikawa contained  the names of leading businessmen in the prefecture, including  Miya, Magara, Chairman Heiji Etsuma (president of Tsudagoma  Industries) of the Prefectural Management Association, and  Executive Secretary Rioji Shibuya (chairman of Shibuya  Industries) of the Kanazawa branch of the Keizai Doyukai [Japan  Association of Corporate Executives]. In short, they all made a  double recommendation.    One of the leading businessmen in the prefecture, whom I  finally managed to interview that night, confided: "The reason  we were troubled by the recent election is not only that the  outcome was difficult to predict, but also that we know both  candidates very well. Also, due to the recession, we couldn't  make contributions, and knowing what had happened in the  election three years ago, we were afraid to speak up. We simply  remained as observers. We couldn't comment [on the election].  `Being out on a business trip' has been a tacit agreement among  us. I also am supposed to be `on a business trip' since  yesterday."    The election battle increased in intensity as each of the  two  camps continued to invite big figures from the central  government. Voting day finally arrived. Despite Ishikawa's last  spurt, the candidate from the leading coalition parties won the  election. As soon as the election results became known, I  remembered various materials I had collected for this article,  and couldn't stop thinking about the future with a gloomy  feeling, wondering if this election would leave a heavy residue  again. [passage omitted]    When will the Japanese people reason out "political fights"  as "political fights," enabling both friends and foes to "wine  and dine at the same table"? If they can't do that, a small  electoral district--one man, one district--will always be a hell.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Alcatel slides 12% putting pressure on French equities Individual stories played a major part in trading yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. Alcatel was the main story in PARIS as investors reacted nervously to comments by Mr Pierre Suard, the chairman, that turnover and profits would fall this year. Brokers' downgrades followed and the shares were suspended during the session limit down, before closing off FFr110 or 12.2 per cent at FFr792. A low of FFr787 was recorded as volume reached some 3.8m shares. The effect on the CAC-40 index was to leave it down 49.43 or 2 per cent at 2,281.90. Turnover was heavy at FFr9.2bn. In contrast Thomson-CSF gained from switching out of Alcatel, with the shares rising FFr11.30 or 5.8 per cent to FFr206.90. FRANKFURT slipped back further as worries over the future of Metallgesellschaft affected sentiment and the slide in Alcatel affected Siemens stock. At the official close the DAX index was quoted down 19.57 at 2,209.18, but in after hours trading selling took hold to drive the Ibis calculated index down 45.70 to 2,182.36. Turnover was DM11bn. News that Norddeutsche Landesbank, one of industrial group's main creditor banks, was unwilling to accept the rescue package by yesterday's 5pm deadline, hit overall sentiment. Deutsche Bank, the main shareholder, which has criticised the stance of NordLB fared badly, down DM10.70 to DM851.50 at the close, and then sliding to DM839.00 in the after market. Daimler, another shareholder, fell DM7.50 to DM849.00, and to DMDM834 in the post. Metallgesellschaft lost DM10 to DM226, then to DM223 in the after market. Siemens dipped ahead of today's expected announcement of results with analysts anticipating disappointing news. The shares fell DM19 to DM762.50, before ending the post-bourse session at DM751.50. AMSTERDAM also saw a downturn as the AEX index slipped 7.66 or 1.8 per cent to 416.35 following sharp falls in a number of the major issues: Royal Dutch off Fl 1.70 at Fl 208.00, Unilever down Fl 4.50 at Fl 219.30 and Elsevier down Fl 4.90 at Fl 177.70 for instance. Further switching was seen out of Akzo and into DSM as the former lost Fl 4.90 to Fl 203.00 and the latter rose Fl 1.80 to Fl 112.30. MILAN was distracted by the day's fast moving and constantly changing political developments as the government faced up to the long awaited vote of confidence. The Comit index added 3.26 to 605.39 with the mood again restrained by the absence of a firm date for the general election. Montedison again saw huge volume of 47.9m shares, slipping L6.30 to L922.40 as the market awaited the outcome of the rights issue which closed on Monday. Olivetti shed L6.30 to L2,047 on news that ENI had joined forces with Fiat and Fininvest to bid for the second license for Italy's mobile telephone network. ZURICH finished easier but up from earlier lows with the SMI index 27.6 down to 2,999.0. SBC bearers, the most actively-traded share, fell SFr6 to SFr507 after Tuesday's strong gains. Winterthur shed SFr26 to SFr833 and Swiss Re was SFr12 lower at SFr720. Recently strong cyclical shares recorded losses. BBC Brown Boveri fell SFr33 to SFr1,132, and Alusuisse bearers were SFr24 lower at the day's low of SFr620. Foreign selling again pressured SMH, the watchmaker, leaving the registered shares SFr10 lower at SFr191. MADRID was left lower by profit-taking and the early fall on Wall Street, and the general index shed 2.55 to 330.84, with constructions and electrical stocks hardest hit. Banks were stable, still soothed by Tuesday's comments by Mr Mario Conde, the former chairman of Banesto. Banco Central Hispano added Pta15 to Pta3,260 while Banco Santander added Pta50 to Pta6,590. STOCKHOLM closed lower for the first time in 1994 mainly on profit-taking and awaiting the outcome of today's Riksbank council meeting. The Affarsvarlden general index dropped 13.2 to 1,495.3. Volvo B bucked the trend to jump SKr8 to SKr585, with the climb attributed to positive analyses and car statistics. Ericsson B tumbled SKr8 to SKr353 on Wall Street declines. OSLO lost out as investors took short term profits on recent gains. The all share index fell 6.08 to 641.23 in turnover of NKr784.4m. Shipping shares bore the brunt of the falls but financials moved ahead on hopes of lower interest rates and good dividends from smaller companies. BRUSSELS reversed early gains and the Bel-20 index lost 5.12 to 1,489.91. Turnover was BFr2.4bn. Clabecq added BFr60 to BFr840 on improved earnings prospects.

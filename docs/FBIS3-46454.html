Qiao is the first top NPC leader to visit West Europe since  New China was founded in 1949, and also another significant  visit abroad following his five-ASEAN nation tour last year.    Sources from the NPC said: "The visit marks that the  relationship between China and these three countries have  entered a new stage of the all-round development."    During the visit, Qiao had talks and meetings on more than  20  separate occasions with the three countries' presidents,  government and parliament leaders and exchanged views with them  on bilateral ties, parliament-to-parliament exchanges and  cooperation in particular, international or regional situation  as well as issues of common concern.    "They have reached consensus on a wide range of issues, thus  promoting mutual understanding and friendship and laying a sound  basis for developing bilateral ties in depth, the sources said,  adding that "the visit has achieved anticipated results."    During the talks and meetings, the leaders between China and  the three countries all set their eyes on their future  relationship.    All of them agreed that furthering and enhancing the  existing  good ties between China and the three countries will not only  benefit the both, but also play an unmeasurable roles in  safeguarding the world peace and stability.    China and Germany are two important and influential  countries  in the world.    During the visit, the leaders of the two countries had the  full confidence in the prospects for bilateral ties.    Qiao stressed that in developing Sino-German ties, the two  countries should not only set their eyes on the 90s in this  century, but also toward the next century.    He said it is imperative to handle such relationship with a  strategic sight and develop long-term and stable friendly ties  and cooperation between the two countries stradling across the  next century on the basis of mutual respect and trust, seeking  common ground while reserving differences and equality and  mutual benefit.    Switzerland is one of the first Western countries to  establish diplomatic ties with China.    The two sides shared a common view that vigorous and dynamic  economy in China will create more favorable conditions for the  expansion of the all-round development of bilateral relations.    The Swiss side showed great interest in conducting economic  cooperation with China.    Austria which is regarded as the "home of music" has enjoyed  special and good relations with China.    Qiao noted during the visit that both China and Austria are  in the different period for development. There still exists a  gap between the two countries in economic growth. But it does  not affect bilateral ties, and on the contrary makes them attach  greater importance to their friedship and ties in the future.    The past few years have seen rapid development of bilateral  economic ties and trade.    Statistics show that from January to November last year, the  volume of trade between China on the one hand, Germany,  Switzerland and Austria on the other amounted respectively to  8.34 billion U.S. dollars, 1.08 billion U.S. dollars and 364  million U.S. dollars, representing increases of 64.3 percent,  91.6 percent and 5.9 percent respectively compared with the same  period of 1992.    By the end of last June, the number of the German-invested  enterprises in China rose to 386 with a total investment of  1.365 billion U.S. dollars.    Switzerland invested a total of 210 million U.S. dollars in  88 enterprises in China.    Qiao's visit to these three countries opened a broad  prospect  for such economic ties and trade.    During the visit, Qiao Shi also held working talks with top  parliamentary leaders of the three countries, exchanged with  them experiences on the parliament work, thus playing a positive  role in strengthening cooperation and exchanges between the NPC  and the three parliaments.    Qiao formally invited Rita Suessmuth, president of the  National Assembly of Germany, to visit China and welcomed  Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock to China too.    Qiao also announced the establishment of a China-Germany  friendship group for parliamentary members.    Qiao also reaffirmed China's consistent stand on the issues  of human rights and Tibet. The central government's policy  toward dalai lama remains unchanged, he said.    "Dalai Lama is welcome to Tibet. Every issue that we can  talk about, except the issue of `Tibet independence'," he said.  [sentence as received]    On the issue of human rights, Qiao said it is imperative to  integrate with every country's reality while talking about this  issue.    Qiao expounded this issue to the leaders of the three  countries by using China's modern history.    He said: "It is an arduous task for us to solve the problems  of clothing, food, housing, transportation, education and  employment in China which has a population of 1.1 billion."    The aim of safeguarding state sovereignty and maintaining  its  domestic stability by the Chinese Government is to continuously  guarantee its reform and opening up. "The fundamental way to  ensure the Chinese people to enjoy the human rights is to  concentrate our efforts on developing economy and productive  forces, raise our comprehensive national strength and improve  the people's living standards," Qiao said.    Both Qiao and the leaders of the three countries held that  the direct dialogues between them on the relevant issues of  common concern is beneficial to promoting mutual understanding  and trust on the basis of seeking common ground while reserving  differences.    Looking toward the future, it is believed that Qiao's visit  to the three countries will exert a great influence on the  promoting closer relationship between China and the three  countries.</p>

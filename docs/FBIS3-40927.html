			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "M-Trust" program: Video report by unnamed </F> correspondent; figures in brackets denote broadcast time in GMT  in hours, minutes, and seconds]    [Excerpts] [131957] [Correspondent over aerial shot of  region] In December, on the eve of the New Year, the  governments of Russia and Kazakhstan finally decided on a way of  preserving the vital operational capacity of the unique Baykonur  Space Center complex. A recent press conference held at the  Russian Space Agency was devoted to explaining the problems  which have beset the multibillion industrial and scientific  giant's 40-year history, and which are set to dog its present  and its future. Baykonur started out as an isolated entity deep  in the steppe heartland. Today, however, it is a whole state  comprising impressive constructions, power-consuming plants,  assembly buildings, and the city of Leninsk. Alongside the  complex's famous No. 2 launchpad, the starting point for  satellite launches, Gagarin's spaceflight, and indeed that of  the cosmonauts currently in orbit -- that is, alongside this  living legend other launchpads have been constructed, including  sites for the Proton and Energiya rockets. Many kilometers of  cable worth billions of rubles have been invested in this site.  And state-of-the-art technology is used in the rockets, the  payloads, in work carried out in orbit, and in the help  proffered from Earth. So Baykonur's separation from Russia's  multifaceted space sector would result in a loss of resources  and a dissipation of personnel and profitable contracts. The  point being that the new super-complex being developed on the  basis of Plesetsk is going to take between eight and 10 years to  build. [passage omitted]    [132204] [Correspondent resumes over video of servicemen  sitting on a bench] At the moment, Baykonur keeps going  basically by dint of the fact that 28,000 Russian servicemen are  there to operate it. For this reason it is hard to imagine any  kind of commercial mechanism succeeding, be it a firm or a  corporation. Frankly, to totally demilitarize Baykonur and  replace military with civilian experts overnight would spell  disaster. And talk of generating sufficient revenue on site for  the giant Baykonur-Leninsk complex to pay its own way is little  short of ridiculous. Russia is going to rent the entire complex  from Kazakhstan, financially compensate for the ecological  damage, and clear the 400,000 hectares of proving ground of  scrap metal. However, this will not entail the billions of  dollars which are being alluded to but will be done with due  consideration for the overall state of accounts between Russia  and Kazakhstan. Finally, at a time when 37 percent of Russia's  space budget goes on maintaining the Mir space station, our  participation in the new international space project -- the  "Alpha" Station -- will create new jobs for tens of thousands of  people and a billion dollars in profits in the next four years  alone. Not to mention the production of new spacesuits in  conjunction with the Germans, and of collapsible modules for  India -- in fact, contracts have been concluded with 20 states  in all. And all this represents technology, profit, and  prosperity.

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / World Trade News: EC must solve oilseeds row soon, says Hills THE European Community has to come up with a quick solution to the oilseeds row if it wants to avoid US retaliation, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, said yesterday. 'Our timetable on this oilseeds dispute is immediate, indeed it is yesterday. We are well overdue to have a solution there,' Mrs Hills declared. 'I'm certainly hopeful Europe will find a solution, because we have no choice, we will have to take action if we don't (agree) in the very near future.' Washington says its soyabean growers had been hurt by EC subsidies, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) has twice ruled in its favour despite a revamp of the EC system after the first ruling. The US has drawn up a list of EC food and drink imports worth Dollars 1bn (Pounds 502m) on which it says it will impose prohibitive duties if it does not get satisfaction. On Monday, the American Soyabean Association (ASA), urged Mrs Hills to proceed immediately to implement retaliatory action against the EC. 'We do not make this recommendation lightly,' said Mr Steve Yoder, president of the ASA. 'Unfortunately, EC unwillingness to make substantive reforms in its internal oilseeds subsidy regime has left our industries no other options.' Lack of progress against the EC oilseeds regime after five years undermined confidence in rule enforcement under Gatt, he added. The row is being handled under a Gatt disputes procedure which allows 60 days to find a solution that may include compensation. The deadline expired last week but Washington has so far not published its list of retaliatory duties. Failure to find a solution could undermine the standing of Gatt as a troubleshooter, Mrs Hills said yesterday. 'If panel reports are to be treated with such disdain, and there is not to be a credible response, you really have a lack of credibility,' she said. 'If we don't have a decent disputes settlement mechanism, it really puts tremendous pressure on nations to stand by Gatt. I don't think that is what Europe wants, I surely hope that is not what Europe wants.'</p>

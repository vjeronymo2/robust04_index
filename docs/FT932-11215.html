			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: SE Banken firm in heavy trade SHARES in Scandinaviska Enskilda Banken yesterday stood at more than twice their value of a week ago as market sentiment that the worst of Sweden's banking crisis may be over fuelled more heavy trading in the stock of the country's biggest, but loss-burdened, bank. SE Banken's most-traded A shares closed last night at SKr16.50, down slightly from Monday's close of SKr17 on profit-taking, but still far ahead of their level last Tuesday of SKr7.60. Although the surge in price of the past two trading days was checked, the number of shares traded - 10.4m - was 24 per cent ahead of Monday's volume. The dramatic rally was touched off when Mr Bjorn Svedberg, the chief executive, told the bank's annual meeting on April 27 that first-quarter operating results before loan losses would show an improvement. This hint of recovery after last year's full-year operating loss of SKr5.37bn (Dollars 705m) was followed by an announcement from Svenska Handelsbanken that it would show a first-quarter profit, with lower-than-expected loan losses, and a fall in first-quarter losses at Gota Bank. Analysts said the combination of a brighter outlook for the banks and the low price of SE Banken shares set off the rally. But they warned there were still high risks attached to the banking sector, which would continue to carry high loan losses this year and next. SE Banken, apparently itself concerned that the market turnround may be premature, repeated advice to investors that it considered the outlook for its shares to be 'uncertain'.</p>

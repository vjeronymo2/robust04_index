			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REBOUND ON WALL STREET;  </P> <P> BROKERS;  </P> <P> CAUTIOUS START GIVES WAY TO SIGHS OF RELIEF  </P> <P> The message was hardly reassuring.  </P> <P> "The seat-belt light is flashing and on the trading desk is a bottle of Maalox  and a copy of the New Testament. We're ready," Larry Wachtel, the voice of  Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., broadcast at 6 a.m. Monday over intercoms in  the brokerage's branches.  </P> <P> As Wachtel's voice crackled over speakers on the 13th floor of the downtown Los  Angeles headquarters of Prudential-Bache, apprehensive brokers listened  intently. "Our initial impression is that it's going to be rocky but not nearly  as bad as 'Meltdown Monday.' " He referred to Oct. 19, 1987 -- Black Monday --  when the stock market plummeted 508 points.  </P> <P> Thinking of that Monday two years ago, the 42 brokers waited tensely. An eerie  quiet settled over the office as the market began its descent -- the Dow Jones  industrial index dropping 24 points in the first 10 minutes.  </P> <P> "Institutions are standing 100% on the sidelines; they are trying to get a feel  of the stock market," explained Bernard Kassover, a senior vice president and a  23-year veteran at Prudential-Bache, as he shuffled pink order sheets and  peered intently at the flashing green numbers on his computer screen.  </P> <P> By the end of the first half hour of trading, the Dow index was down 36 points.  But Kassover, who expected the indicator to plummet 100 points within the first  30 minutes, was relieved that the market was acting rationally.  </P> <P> "No hysterics -- it's nothing like two years ago. This is almost a normal day,  but it could change in 30 seconds. Everybody is waiting for the next man to  act."  </P> <P> Indeed, 15 minutes later, the market was down 64 points. "It's getting worse,  and a lot of stocks haven't opened yet," said Kassover as he placed a call to  Prudential's international desk to get the London price on BAT Industries for a  client. "People are confused. People are trying to get a handle on things. When  it settles down, buyers will come back."  </P> <P> Kassover was on the phone soothing clients and doing a lot of hand-holding to  get them to ride out the market's volatility. He had worked Sunday to prepare  for Monday, putting in some sell orders for clients. Still, he arrived at the  office on Monday at 4:30 a.m. -- half an hour earlier than usual.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, down the hall, Y. Clifford Tanaka and his son, Jonathan, were also  taking calls. Only one of their clients, a new one, had decided to liquidate  his portfolio Friday. The others were hanging in there.  </P> <P> By the end of the first hour, the market had recovered to a plus-30 position.  By 7:30 a.m., John W. Eisele, vice president and resident manager, was on the  loudspeaker. "The selling panic has turned to buying . . . decide on the price  you want to buy."  </P> <P> "It's not a selling panic," said the elder Tanaka. "Aw, dad, he is just trying  to rally the troops," responded his son.  </P> <P> Slowly, the buy orders began coming in, eventually outnumbering the sell orders  as the day progressed. Wire operators couldn't field the orders fast enough.  One was for a $10,000 buy of Retirement Planning Funds of America Inc., an  equity fund. Another was for 100-share purchases of Johnson &amp; Johnson,  Citicorp and Philip Morris. Another was for Disney at $115 a share.  </P> <P> By 9 a.m., a lull settled in, but volume continued heavy. Kassover clients  called in to chat. One, from Long Island, N.Y., asked, "Bernie, you OK?"  Kassover was thankful for their concern.  </P> <P> Tanaka reports that clients are making "switches," pulling money out of one  stock but buying another.  </P> <P> In the conference room, scrawled in blue marker, were the highlights from the  morning call. "Focus on utility, income stocks. Fire sale: buy franchise cos.,  WMT (Walmart), Disney, also yield securities. Chinese word for crisis also  means opportunity. Don't panic -- buy value."  </P> <P> As the hours wore on, trading drifted up and down but stayed mostly on the plus  side. Donald J. Trump withdrew his offer for AMR Corp., but it did not bring  the disruption to the market that occurred Friday when United Airlines  announced that it could not obtain financing for its employee-led buyout.  </P> <P> As noon approached, and it appeared that no market crisis was in sight, brokers  began to relax and chat. A favorite visit was to the office of Kassover's  associate, Jeffrey D. Daggett, for free gum balls from a red machine sitting  atop a small refrigerator.  </P> <P> "I hope Donald Trump took a bath on that," said one visitor, referring to the  AMR Corp. deal. "They should sue him," said another. "The greater game is  taking a position and withdrawing and then making a lot of money, almost like  insider trading," said another.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, orders were coming in at a rate two-thirds greater than normal and  double Friday's rate. Eisele was estimating a Monday trade volume between $15  million to $20 million for his office.  </P> <P> As the market wound down, brokers were anxious for the close. Five minutes  before the close, Kassover popped open a can of 7-Up and poured it in his blue  mug. As the market closed, he took a gulp from his mug slugged "1 Boss Bernie"  and sighed: "I'm relieved."  </P></p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Gorman denounces Pounds 1m homes report Conservative MP Mrs Teresa Gorman last night denounced a newspaper report that she had made Pounds 1m in transactions from two Westminster council houses. The report in today's Daily Mirror claims that she bought the homes, in Lord North Street, from the council for Pounds 55,000. It says she sold one last year for Pounds 445,000 and that the other one, in which she lives, is worth about Pounds 500,000. Mrs Gorman, MP for Billericay, said the report was 'a sordid attempt' to make a mountain out of a molehill. 'The situation is that we bought this house - it was two houses knocked into one - on a 14-year lease in 1975. I cannot remember what we paid for it. 'A few years later we were offered the freehold of the house, as were the occupants of all the houses around here. 'We spent a lot of money making it habitable. It was in an awful state. We bought the freehold and have lived in the house ever since. A year or two ago, because it was too big for our requirements, we reconverted it back at considerable expense to two houses, as it had been up to the 1920s. 'Last year we sold No 13 for Pounds 445,000 and I suppose the one we have lived in for 20 years and still live in is worth about the same. But to suggest that I have made Pounds 1m out of it is utterly and totally absurd.'</p>

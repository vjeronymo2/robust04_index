			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nuri Kayis: "Automobile Factories Will </F> Manufacture Arms"]    [Text] Ankara--The industrial establishments in the private  sector, which are in a difficult situation as a result of the  economic crisis in Turkey, will manufacture arms, ammunition,  military vehicles, equipment, and spare parts for the Turkish  Armed Forces. That will enable them to alleviate the effects of  the economic crisis. Meanwhile, the effects of a possible  embargo on Turkey will be nullified. The National Assembly  Committee on Industry and Technology has quickly approved the  draft law that will enable the private sector establishments to  meet the needs of the military forces.    According to the draft law, the Ministry of National  Defense,  the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and the General Staff will  determine the establishments that can manufacture arms with  minor changes in their structure. Protocols will be signed with  them later, and the government will provide them with financial  resources. The draft law has been drawn up by the Ministry of  National Defense and approved by the Council of Ministers.  Several industrial sectors, including the establishments that  manufacture vehicles, household effects, and electronic  equipment, will be geared to manufacture every kind of equipment  the military forces require when the National Assembly enacts  the draft law.  <H5>  Golhan's Statement </H5>   Minister of National Defense Mehmet Golhan has said: "The  country must be in a position to meet all its needs from its  national resources in order to render any embargo by foreign  countries at critical times ineffective." Meanwhile, Azimet  Koyluoglu, chairman of the National Assembly Committee on  Industry and Technology, said the following: "The new  arrangement was required to support the establishments in the  private sector and contribute toward the country's defense. The  automobile factories in Bosnia have been converted into  arms-producing establishments because of the war in that  country. They have shouldered a significant responsibility in  the effort the Muslim people are making to defend their  homeland. We live in peace. However, we have to plan what we  may have to do in case of war."    The section, which outlined the reasons for the draft law,  said in part the following: "Turkey acquires its arms, military  equipment, and spare parts from foreign sources. However, it  may not be able to acquire its needs from the same sources in  the event of a mobilization or war. Therefore, the possibility  of having the arms and equipment Turkey requires manufactured in  the country should be studied. Meeting the needs of the  military forces from Turkey's industrial establishments will  reactivate the national industry sector and create an  opportunity for the country to save foreign currency."</p>

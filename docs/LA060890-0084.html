			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH BOB  </P> <P> MAN VS. MICROCHIP  </P> <P> Perhaps, I should have gone to my brother for the money from the beginning  rather than The Times.  </P> <P> His mythical bills are obviously a little luckier.  </P> <P> Indian Wind, the first bet I made Thursday, ran second, but was moved up to  first on a controversial stewards' decision. On second thought, how could any  decision that puts my horse on top be controversial? He paid $5.40, so my  profit was $85.  </P> <P> A race later, Vince's Dancer won clear at $6.20, so I collected another $155,  meaning I'm $190 in the black after one day. You know, I'm beginning to like  this job a lot better.  </P> <P> Hoping to keep the streak going, I'll bet $40 to win on Rejim in the eighth.  </P> <P> Bob's Beginning Bankroll $2,000  </P> <P> Thursday's Profit $190  </P> <P> Current Bankroll $2,190  </P> <P> As for my computer counterpart, its pick in the fifth, Reassured, won rather  handily and paid $6.60, returning a profit of $57.50. In the seventh, it picked  Dakotah Thunder, who ran fifth, reducing its profit to $32.50.  </P> <P> The computer wants to bet $40 to win today on Por D.J. in the fifth.  </P> <P> I wish the computer well, it'll need it.  </P> <P> Computer's Beginning Bankroll $2,000  </P> <P> Thursday's Profit $32.50  </P> <P> Current Bankroll $2,032.50  </P></p>

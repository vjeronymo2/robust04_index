			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Minimalist view of Euro-union: Former finance minister Edouard Balladur voices caution MR Edouard Balladur, the former French finance minister, leans against the mantelpiece in his Parisian office and ponders the Maastricht Treaty on European union. More than a soupcon of scepticism hangs on the lips of the man who, if the right wins next spring's legislative elections, is tipped by many to become France's next prime minister. A technocratic stalwart of France's Gaullist RPR opposition party, Mr Balladur has argued for the treaty's adoption, but he takes a disdainfully minimalist view of its impact. 'I don't think that things will happen in the way described by the treaty. But we will apply the treaty - we will respect our promises.' Even if the treaty surmounts its ratification hurdles, and the EC succeeds in patching up the problems caused by the Danish rejection, Mr Balladur says that European monetary union - planned to take place by 1999 at the latest - is by no means certain. Whatever the language of the treaty, which talks of an 'irreversible' commitment to a single currency run by a European central bank, Mr Balladur emphasises that national parliaments will still have the final say. 'It is said that the process is irreversible. But the countries will have to decide by unanimous voting on the rates of exchange for their currencies against the single currency which will replace them. If this can only be decided unanimously, then the process cannot be irreversible.' During his period as finance minister between 1986 and 1988, Mr Balladur pressed the cause of a joint European central bank. As officials at the Bundesbank have long realised - and Mr Balladur himself now admits - this was all part of a long-running French policy aimed at curbing the power of the German central bank. Maastricht brought the French dream of Emu - European monetary union - within reach. But Mr Balladur says the monetary union aspects of the treaty would reduce the importance of the Bundesbank far less than many Maastricht advocates hope. Partly reflecting improved bilateral links between French and German ministers and central banks, which Mr Balladur helped establish in 1987-88, Franco-German monetary co-operation has been intensified during the last five years. The experience has not, however, made Mr Balladur more responsive to German views. He complains vigorously about the German government's refusal to accept the name 'Ecu' (European Currency Unit) for the planned single European currency. 'I think that the discussion (in Germany) is infantile. I don't see why one should change the name under a German pretext. It's a French word corresponding to an English acronym. I don't want to put the name into question.' Mr Balladur reacts acerbically to German insistence that the European central bank should be located in Frankfurt to compensate the Germans for the loss of the D-Mark. 'I don't want the European central bank to be in Frankfurt. If we look at the question like this, then why shouldn't it be in France?' Additionally, Mr Balladur complains that the cost of German reunification is helping to push up interest rates throughout the whole of Europe. 'If the Germans had reduced their budgetary spending or raised their taxes rather than increasing their indebtedness, German interest rates would be lower than they are today.' Mr Balladur also doles out criticism towards other EC countries. By opting for the direct Maastricht route towards Emu, Mr Balladur believes that the EC has taken the wrong course. Europe would have been better served, Mr Balladur says, by agreeing to proceed towards Emu 'on an experimental basis'. This would have involved a European central bank issuing the Ecu in parallel to and in competition with national EC currencies, leaving national central banks with their powers intact. This is similar to the course of action favoured by Britain in its celebrated 'hard Ecu' proposals put forward in 1990. With the archness of a man accustomed to handing out advice, Mr Balladur claims credit as one of the sponsors of the 'hard Ecu' idea, which he says he suggested to Mr John Major when the latter was Britain's chancellor of the exchequer. If Mr Balladur does, after all, make it to the prime minister's office next year, he and Mr Major may find they have time to exchange views on matters running well beyond the Ecu.</p>

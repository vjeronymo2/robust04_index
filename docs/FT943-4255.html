			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Disposal helps Manders advance to Pounds 18m Mr Roy Amos, chairman of Manders, said yesterday that in a 'transitional' first half the group had moved from the third to the first division in the international coatings and printing inks league. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.3m for the six months to June 30 marked a sharp increase on last time's Pounds 4.92m. However, the latest figure included a Pounds 13.2m profit from the Pounds 55m disposal of the decorative paints division. Stripping out that item and including interest payable of Pounds 446,000 (Pounds 965,000) gives underlying profits only marginally up at Pounds 5.06m. The shares closed down 4p at 349p. In January Manders bought the inks business of Croda International for Pounds 26.7m and in May spent Pounds 38m on Premier Inks of the Netherlands. It also completed the sale of the Mander Centre, its Wolverhampton shopping centre, for Pounds 82m. Mr Roger Akers, chief executive, said that the group, 'now the fastest thing coming up on the rails,' had always been strong technologically. Excluding the recent Pounds 14m acquisition of Morrison-PIM, the group employed 165 chemists from a total of 800 people. Its biggest competitors were now Sun-Dainippon, the US-Japan venture, BASF of Germany and Total of France. Mr Amos confirmed that further expansion in Europe was being sought through acquisition, probably of small or medium-sized companies, although he did not rule out larger targets. At June 30 Manders had cash balances in the UK of Pounds 32m, though the Morrison buy has reduced that figure. Mr Amos said he would be comfortable with gearing of up to about 30 per cent. Margins had suffered in the UK from the change of business mix and would be 1 percentage point lower at 8.5 per cent in 1994. It was hoped they would be lifted via innovative products, such as cold set printing inks of the same quality as heat set. The aim was for a 10 per cent margin within 'a year or so.' Earnings swelled to 32.52p (9.02p) on an FRS 3 basis, but were flat once adjusted. The interim dividend is held at 2.9p.</p>

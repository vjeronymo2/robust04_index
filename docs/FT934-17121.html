			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Advance to Pounds 2m at Horace Clarkson Horace Clarkson, the shipping and insurance broking group, reported an advance in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2m, for the six months to June 30. The increase was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 22.8m. Earnings per share came out at 4.3p (3.5p) and the interim dividend is raised to 0.75p (0.5p) per share. The directors said the shipping business had produced a very satisfactory performance, with profits up by Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.2m, while a decline in the insurance division's brokerage had been partly offset by cost savings. The company also announced the appointments of Mr Alan Brooks and Mr Robert Ward as additional directors. Mr Brooks, previously a director of BPB Industries, will serve in a non-executive capacity while Mr Ward, who was finance director of the shipbroking arm, would succeed Mr Brian Burns as the group's finance director.</p>

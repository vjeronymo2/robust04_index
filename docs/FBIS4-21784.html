			<p>BFN     [Text] The police detained an Israeli citizen on suspicion  that he had murdered an Arab truck driver, Riyad Salimi, from  the village of Idnah in the Hebron area. He fired at him from  an ambush at the Bet Guvrin junction, critically wounding him.  The truck driver died at the Ashqelon Barzilay Hospital. Our  correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that immediately after the  shots the police erected roadblocks and launched searches.  About 30 minutes after the incident, an unknown person called  the Qiryat Gat police station and told the police how to capture  the shooter. Following this person's instructions, the  policemen detained a 42-year-old Israeli who was found in  possession of an Uzi submachine gun and nine magazines. From  his interrogation it was learned that the suspect fired many  bullets at the truck. Our correspondent adds that it is  believed he might have wanted to avenge the death of his brother  who served in the Border Police in the Hebron area. [passage  omitted]</p>

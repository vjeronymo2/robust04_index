The Tibet Autonomous Region, in south-west China, has  allocated 17.35 million yuan (1.99 million U.S. dollars) to be  used mainly as stipends for Tibetan students.    The move was announced by Soinam Daje, deputy secretary  general of the local Tibet Government.    The yearly grant for Tibetan students studying in inland  provinces is being increased from 706 yuan (81.2 U.S. dollars)  to 1,050 yuan (120.7 U.S. dollars), he said.    Many inland and coastal provinces, including Beijing and  Shanghai, have special schools or classes for Tibetan students,  besides schools set up in Tibet itself.    For students studying in local Tibetan schools,  fourth-graders (fourth-year pupils in a primary school) and up,  who since 1984 have received free boarding, lodging and  clothing, will now receive a monthly stipend of 57 to 95 yuan,  the official said.    About 4,000 teachers in Tibet will also benefit from the  extra investment in education, he said.    In addition, he said, a five million yuan (about 570,000  U.S.  dollars) education fund for the region, was set up yesterday.    He said the investment "mostly comes from the central  government, that is to say, from the support of all  nationalities across the country."    He added: "Without the support and aid, it would be  impossible for us to adopt these special measures to develop  education."</p>

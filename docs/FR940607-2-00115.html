			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Each Fund might be deemed an affiliated person of each other Fund under section 2(a)(3) of the Act. Each Fund, by participating in the proposed account, and the Advisors, by managing the proposed account, could be deemed to be a ``joint participant'' in a ``transaction'' within the meaning of section 17(d), and the proposed account could be deemed to be a ``joint enterprise or other joint series issue arrangement'' within the meaning of rule 17d&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The proposed account will not be distinguished from any other account maintained by the Funds with their custodian bank except that monies from the Funds could be deposited in the proposed account on a commingled basis. The sole function of this account will be to provide a convenient way of aggregating what otherwise would be the individual daily transactions for each Fund necessary to manage the daily uninvested cash balances of each Fund. Each Fund will participate in the account on the same basis as every other Fund. The Adviser will have no monetary participation in the account, but will be responsible for investing amounts in the account, establishing control procedures, and ensuring the equal treatment of each Fund. The proposed method of operating the account will not result in any conflicts of interest between any of the Funds, or between a Fund and its Advisor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Funds will benefit from the proposed arrangement because, on any given day and under most market conditions, it is possible to negotiate a rate of return on large repurchase agreements which is greater than the rate of return available for smaller repurchase agreements. In addition, by reducing the number of trade tickets, repurchase transactions will be simplified and the opportunity for errors will be reduced. Each Fund will also benefit from the fact that an institution entering into a very large repurchase agreement is almost always able and willing to increase the amount covered by such agreement near the end of the day, which possibility may not exist with smaller repurchase agreements. Moreover, without a joint account, some Funds may find that they will be unable to invest in repurchase agreements because their respective daily cash balances would not meet the minimum investment requirement for a repurchase agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants assert that granting the requested relief is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the Act. Applicants further assert that participation in the proposed joint account by each Fund would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous that of any other Fund participant and that the participation by the Advisors will be ministerial only. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As express conditions to the granting of the requested relief, applicants agree that the joint repurchase account will operate as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A separate custodian cash account will be established into which each Fund will cause its uninvested net cash balances to be deposited daily. The joint account will not be distinguished from any other accounts maintained by a Fund with its custodian bank except that monies from a Fund will be deposited on a commingled basis. The account will not have any separate existence or have any indicia of a separate legal entity. The sole function of the account will be to provide a convenient way to aggregating individual transactions which would otherwise require daily management by each Fund of its uninvested cash balance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Cash in the account will be invested solely in repurchase agreements with a duration not to exceed one business day and collateralized by suitable U.S. Government securities ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the government of the United States or by any of its agencies or instrumentalities) and satisfying the uniform standards set by the Funds for such investments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. All securities held by the joint account will be valued on an amortized cost basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Each Fund relying upon rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act for valuation of its net assets on the basis of amortized cost will use the average maturity of the repurchase agreements purchased by the Funds participating in the account for the purpose of computing the Fund's average portfolio maturity with respect to the portion of its assets held in such account on that day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

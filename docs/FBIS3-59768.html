			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. has developed  SAT64AW, a titanium alloy that dramatically increases wear  resistance, and has begun a full-fledged effort to develop  commercial demand. The new titanium alloy is called a  carbide-diffused, wear-resistant titanium alloy. It has titanium  carbide as an additive, and the TiC forms fine crystals in the  &bgr; matrix phase, which greatly increases wear resistance. One  drawback of titanium alloys has been their poor wear resistance.  With this new titanium alloy, however, Sumitomo hopes to extend  their usage to automobile engine parts, sea water pump parts,  sliding parts, etc. Therefore, Sumitomo will aggressively strive  to develop new demands for this product.    This new wear-resistant alloy developed by Sumitomo has  titanium carbide added to the common titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V,  an alloy with 6&percnt; aluminum and 4&percnt; vanadium added to  the  titanium. When titanium carbide is added, the titanium alloy  matrix changes from the &agr;-&bgr; phase to the &bgr; phase,  which is  tougher. In addition, the TiC is finely dispersed and forms a  fine crystal structure, so the alloy not only has excellent  strength, but also greatly increased wear resistance. In terms  of wear resistance, Ti-6Al-V4 is not even worthy of comparison,  for the wear resistance of the new alloy equals that of Stellite  No. 6 (a nickel-chrome-cobalt alloy), an alloy with excellent  properties. When we consider the mechanical properties as well,  such as the fact that Stellite has poor ductility, it is clear  that this new alloy can also be used as structural component.    Titanium alloys are known for their high strength, light  weight and excellent corrosion resistance, but they have  drawbacks such as a Young's modulus only half that of steel  materials, obviously poorer wear resistance, and poorer cutting  properties. Therefore, countermeasures to overcome this poor  wear resistance, such as forming a wear-resistant surface layer  with molten molybdenum, have been tried. However, many problems  remain to be solved such as the thickness of the overlay, and so  there has been great demand for the development of a  wear-resistant titanium alloy.    Sumitomo Metal believes that SAT64AW will answer the demand  for wear resistance, and plans to develop new applications for  it such as automobile engine parts, solid cast titanium valves,  etc. In terms of cutting properties, Sumitomo has also developed  smooth-cutting titanium alloys by adding 0.2&percnt; nickel and  0.2-0.6&percnt; mesh metal to Ti-6Al-4V and to Ti-3Al-2.5V,  which is  an alloy with the lower amounts of 3&percnt; aluminum and  2.5&percnt;  vanadium added to the titanium. Together with its wear-resistant  alloy, Sumitomo hopes to expand use of these alloys to  automobile engines and machine parts.</p>

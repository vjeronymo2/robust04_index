			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD: IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BANGLADESH;  </P> <P> PRESIDENT RESIGNS AS STRIKE BEGINS  </P> <P> Bangladesh President Hussain Mohammed Ershad, who seized power in a 1982 coup,  resigned as 100,000 protesters marched through Dhaka at the start of a general  strike called to force him to quit.  </P> <P> Ershad announced that he intends to step down immediately. He called a special  session of Parliament for Saturday to name a vice president who would head a  caretaker government until elections, although diplomats and political  observers questioned whether he would actually relinquish power. Ershad  resigned after all major opposition parties rejected a peace plan he outlined  Monday. In the past week, more than 70 people have been killed and 500 wounded  in clashes between security forces and demonstrators opposed to his rule.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD REACTION TO NORIEGA'S ARREST;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION  </P> <P> The arrest and trial of ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega by the  United States is illegal, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said  in Moscow. "No state has the right to take the law into its own hands," he  said. "That's basically lynch law." He said the trial violates the rights of  Panama and the U.N. principle of nonintervention. "We think that Gen. Noriega  used to be a CIA agent," Gerasimov said. "And as your President Roosevelt said  about (the late Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio) Somoza, he's an SOB, but he's  our SOB. So, this particular SOB was your SOB and then he went astray, and now  you want to capture him."  </P> <P> Latin America  </P> <P> News of Noriega's capture was splashed across the front pages of most Latin  American dailies. However, it was received in silence by most national leaders  there, who are leery of supporting what one official called Washington's role  as a "regional policeman."  </P> <P> Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez said: "It's such a delicate and  serious subject that I would prefer not to comment on it until I've thought it  through and met with my advisers."  </P> <P> Peru expressed "satisfaction over the surrender of Gen. Noriega to United  States justice." However, like most Latin American nations, it refuses to  recognize the U.S.-installed Panamanian government.  </P> <P> The Mexico City daily La Jornada editorialized: "The fate of Noriega has  nothing to do with the existence in the country of the canal, of a puppet  regime imposed by U.S. tanks. . . . Who's next? What country in the region will  be the next victim of the United States army?"  </P> <P> In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega said the United States should immediately  withdraw its troops. "Noriega is already in the power of the Yankees," he said  on government radio. "So, there isn't a single reason for the Yankees to remain  in Panama, not one more moment." Leftist Nicaragua opposed the U.S. invasion.  </P> <P> Europe  </P> <P> In Britain, the Foreign Office said: "We are glad that this problem between the  U.S. and the Vatican has been resolved. Noriega faces criminal charges and we  are naturally pleased that he should be brought to justice." Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher fully backed the U.S. invasion.  </P> <P> In Spain, Foreign Affairs Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez said Noriega's  surrender "appears to be a voluntary decision by Noriega, and that's how I  suppose the Vatican will underscore it. . . . We want Panama to recover its  moral conscience, which has been left enormously perturbed as a result of all  these events." Spain opposed the U.S. invasion.  </P> <P> Asia  </P> <P> Japan's Foreign Ministry said the matter is strictly among the United States,  Panama and the Vatican. Japan has not recognized Panama's new government but  has "an impression" that it is "a remarkable improvement."  </P> <P> In Thailand, a spokesman said: "As drug trafficking affects countries  internationally, we are happy that the accused will be tried fairly in a U.S.  court. . . . I think this will lead to more permanent peace in Panama."  </P></p>

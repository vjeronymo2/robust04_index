			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUELAS BROTHERS WIN MAIN EVENTS;  </P> <P> BOXING: COUNTRY CLUB IN RESEDA HOUSE FIGHTERS MAKE QUICK WORK OF OPPONENTS IN  DEBUTS AS FEATURE PARTICIPANTS.  </P> <P> The brothers Ruelas, the Ten Goose Boxing budding stars who appear to have long  futures in professional boxing, made short work of two opponents in main event  debuts Tuesday night at the Country Club in Reseda.  </P> <P> Featherweight Rafael Ruelas knocked out Ricardo Flores in the first round with  a crunching left hook. Then, after an intermission that was longer than both  fights combined, junior-lightweight Gabriel Ruelas stopped Javier Macias at  1:52 of the second round.  </P> <P> It was quick, neat and impressive. Gabriel, 19, and his brother, Rafael, 18,  earned $2,000 each for the quick victories. And their manager, Dan Goossen,  said he plans to move Gabe up quickly to bigger paydays, starting with a  network TV boxing show early in 1990, with Rafael soon to follow.  </P> <P> Gabriel (18-0) the shorter but slightly stronger of the two, had Macias (12-5)  in trouble and in full retreat by the end of the first round. He stunned Macias  with a right hand midway through the first, but was late in following up,  temporarily allowing Macias to escape.  </P> <P> Ruelas dropped Macias on his back with a right hand that followed a set-up left  jab, but Macias got up. Ruelas, weighing 127 1/2, was a bit wild and out of  control trying to finish Macias, but he finally did so in a neutral corner.  There, with Macias helpless, ringside physician Dr. Robert Karns, stood up and  raised his arms, a signal for referee Robert Byrd to stop the fight.  </P> <P> Rafael Ruelas, who is 12-0 with 10 knockouts, was tagged on the chin with the  first punch of his fight, a sweeping left hook by Flores, who weighed 121 1/2.  </P> <P> But Ruelas, who weighed 124 3/4, quickly established his left jab over his  slower, shorter opponent, and Flores (15-7) wound down quickly in the last half  of the round. The end came shortly after Ruelas rocked Flores with a left hook  and left uppercut on the ropes. Fifteen seconds later, Ruelas got Flores with a  right to the ribs, followed by a near-perfect left hook to the chin.  </P> <P> Flores went down on his back, a clean knockout at 2:49 of the first round.  </P> <P> Goossen said that the brothers may soon move out of their 900-seat home, the  Country Club.  </P> <P> "I'm trying to get them both on a Forum card soon, then I'd like get get Gabe  on a network (United States Boxing Assn.) or (North American Boxing Federation)  title fight early in the year," Goossen said.  </P> <P> On the undercard, Burbank heavyweight Rocky Pepeli knocked out Tyrone Armstrong  of Las Vegas at 2:22 of the first round.  </P></p>

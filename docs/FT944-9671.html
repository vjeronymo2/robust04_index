			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / World Trade News: BT to develop data network - Contracts and Ventures British Telecommunications has been awarded a substantial contract by Microsoft, the world's largest software house, to develop a data communications network in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. The UK group declined yesterday to give the value of the contract but said it ran into many millions of pounds and was one of the largest international contracts the company had won. The network will be used as part of Microsoft's newly announced worldwide on-line information service, The Microsoft Network, which is expected to represent a challenge to existing information providers such as Compuserve and American Online. BT will use Concert, its joint venture with MCI of the US, to provide the basis of the network. Customers with a personal computer running Windows 95 and a modem will be able to connect from anywhere in Europe or Asia/Pacific over the public telephone network to a BT node, and from there to Microsoft in Seattle over Concert's high-speed lines.</p>

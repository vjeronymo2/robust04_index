			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Two-way pull in Dixons A STRONG two-way pull in Dixons saw the shares dip sharply before recovering in late trading as turnover hit a hefty 4.5m. The store group came under early pressure as news broke from a trade press magazine that Tandy Corporation, the leading US electrical retailer, was about to launch a challenge in the UK to Dixons' PC World computer superstore concept. According to the report, Tandy has earmarked a number of sites - each of which is above 25,000 sq ft - to launch its UK operations. Dixons shares weakened sharply, coming off almost 10 at one stage. With a good sense of timing, Dixons was yesterday hosting an analysts visit to a PC World site in Cardiff, and reports drifting back from South Wales in the afternoon were said to be positive, with the company hinting at brighter sales and firm margins. The shares staged a rally and closed just 3 1/2 off at 276 1/2 p.</p>

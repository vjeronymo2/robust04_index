			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: Holy texts in the wink of an Indian eye - The ancient dance form of Kathakali has come to the UK From now until late November, UK audiences have the opportunity to see 'the best artists in the world' - the dancers of the Kala Chethena Kathakali Troupe from Kerala in South India. The words are those of Kalamandalam Barbara Vijayakumar, the troupe's co-director and the only woman and non-Indian ever to have qualified in the art of Chutti - the elaborate make-up which, after a process of application taking about four hours, transforms the actors into the representations of characters from the Mahabharatha and the Ramayana which form the text of this ancient form of dance drama. Barbara Vijayakumar describes the art of Kathakali as 'like a mountain, massive'. It is a mountain she has been scaling for nearly 20 years, having discovered its existence entirely by chance. Dragged reluctantly on the hippy trail to India, she got off at the wrong stop when travelling by train between Cochin and Bangalore. As the train drew off into the distance, a man approached her. 'Come and see our school,' he said. The school she eventually discovered to be the Kerala Kalamandalam, the leading centre for the teaching of this ancient art form. Back home, Barbara, a student at Leeds College of Art, had been developing her own dance drama, based on pure colour and light, and later established her own company of performers, Centre Ocean Stream, which she still runs. A serious problem was the dancers' make-up, which was always 'streaky', never achieving the vivid, pure colours she required. On her arrival at the mysterious 'school' in India, the first thing she saw was women students, exquisitely made up, performing the female classical dance drama known as Mohiniattam. She immediately asked if she could study there - and that was before she had seen Kathakali proper. When she did, the serendipity was complete. Kathakali was for centuries the entertainment of kings and princes who vied with each other to have the most lavish troupes. As royal power waned, and the princes' coffers emptied, Kathakali came under threat and by early this century the art was almost lost. Now funded by the government, it has been revived to become a popular village art form, performed by travelling troupes. 'As the sun sets, drummers go out to announce the performance,' Barbara relates. 'Everyone comes, there is a festival atmosphere. Stalls are set up around the performance area, everyone is coming and going. About nine o'clock, the performers come out, lit with four floodlights with the music broadcast through a horrible sound system with crackly speakers.' Usually, the stage is set up outside the temple. If it is inside, even if Barbara has done the make-up, she, a non-Hindu, cannot enter. For one of the most profound aspects of the Kathakali performance - its role in binding together communities by the representation and repetition of their holy texts - is an experience that a western audience cannot share. The performance of the complete Mahabharatha epic continues for four days. Whole families attend, breaking for snacks, strolls and naps as the action unfolds. Shorter performances run from early evening until dawn, when the evil character is finally vanquished as the sun rises. The present tour, which covers 29 venues in as many days, bravely attempts to take Kathakali of the highest quality to the widest possible UK audience. The troupe, founded in 1987 by Kalamandalam Vijayakumar, Barbara's husband and one of the leading exponents of female roles, includes Kalamandalam Gopi, honoured by the Indian government as one of the greatest exponents of the art, and for many years the Guru (head teacher) of the Kalamandalam school (the name of which is taken by former pupils as a mark of honour). Certainly his performance as Nala is rivetting. He makes this extraordinary being, resplendent in green face and glorious garb, a creature palpably human as well as divine, full of tender emotion and concern for his wife, Damayanti, played with convincing wiles by the excellent Vijayakumar. With the colours of the mask-like make-up establishing the good or evil nature of the characters, their story is told in mime, using a complex range of facial and hand gestures which have developed over centuries into a vocabulary of words and phrases. Perhaps most remarkable is the language of the face - movements of the eyes, eyebrows and mouth give form to every nuance of feeling and are miraculously visible even from the dress circle of the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, where the performance I saw took place. The movements and gestures include fast and furious passages of stamping and leaping, closely related to the drumming and singing of four musicians, which play a key role in setting the emotional atmosphere of each scene. The quality of the performance of both actors and musicians ensures that even with no knowledge of the esoteric stage language, the story comes across clearly. Copious programme notes also help. Part of the charm of the performance is the careful detail - the characters portrayed may be the heroes and heroines of myth, but their emotions and misfortunes - in this case marital happiness undermined by gambling losses (Nala wagers his kingdom on a roll of dice and loses, condemning himself and his wife to exile in the forest) - have a touchingly domestic feel. The affection between Nala and Damayanti is clearly established, and their parting, brought about by the machinations of the terrifying Kali, moving. The most immediate impact, however, is visual. The combined effect of the extraordinary make-up with costumes that are marvels of elaboration  - panniered skirts in layers of white cotton embroidered in red and gold, scarlet jackets under layers of beads and coloured scarves, towering carved wooden headpieces painted red and gold and flashing with coloured stones - makes the stately entrances of these larger-than-life figures, skirts swirling to the thundering drums and clashing cymbals, truly breathtaking. It is worth intercepting this remarkable spectacle as it makes its way around the chilly 'villages' of Britain; history, beauty, spectacle and performance skills of the highest order are always worth experiencing, and these dedicated artists provide them in full measure.

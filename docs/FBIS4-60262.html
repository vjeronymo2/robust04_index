			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi by Hans-Helmut </F> Kohl in Algiers; date not given: "Dialogue With All Those Who  Renounce the Use of Force"]    [Text] The new Algerian Government is trying to get the  political and economic crisis in the country under control with  two recipes: On the one hand, dialogue should be sought "with  all those who renounce the use of force." On the other hand, the  social reason behind the conflict should be tackled with a new  effort. In Algiers, FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU journalist  Hans-Helmut Kohl conducted the following interview with Prime  Minister Mokdad Sifi, who has been in office since 11 April.    [Kohl] People in Europe are following the developments in  Algeria with great concern -- also as far as safety is  concerned. Foreigners are being killed, threatened, and are  leaving the country. What do you want to do and what can you do  about this?    [Sifi] This government is observing two guidelines. First,  we have to eliminate violence. These acts of violence must  stop, and we are making great efforts for this. I think that  the population and objective observers have already noticed a  significant improvement. The struggle to eliminate violence  will continue. On the other hand, there are political,  economic, and social reasons for this evil in our society.    The intensive struggle against violence goes hand in hand  with a policy that consists of addressing all parties and all  sections and groups of the population. Not everything that the  population feels is expressed by the parties. There are social  groups such as the trade unions, employers, and cultural  associations that are of significance by themselves. All these  people have been invited to a dialogue so that we can find out  together how we can return to stability. As far as the economy  is concerned, we have revised a program for improving the  infrastructure, even though this is only a small part of what is  necessary.    [Kohl] Let us stay with politics. You have invited  everybody to participate in the dialogue. What will you do if  your invitation is not accepted and how far are you ready to  take this dialogue? Does it also include the FIS, the Islamic  Salvation Front?    [Sifi] We should understand one thing: The FIS has been  dissolved by a Supreme Court ruling in accordance with the laws  of this country. Now there are movements that support the  social model that was also pursued by the FIS. They think that  their idea is the best. These people may come, but all others  who renounce violence may come, too.    [Kohl] Are there any contacts between the government or the  state president and the arrested FIS leaders Madani and Benhadj?    [Sifi] The state president has made mediating efforts.  Everything has taken place on the basis of the platform that was  worked out in the High State Council with the participation of  many people. There were others who were not included. The  conference emphasized that the path was open for everybody else,  too. It laid down the framework and the objective. The  framework includes all those who renounce violence and respect  the Constitution. Our objective is to achieve economic and  political stability as a precondition for elections. We want to  achieve this as quickly as possible. The platform agreed on a  period of three years. Should stability be achieved before  that, nothing will prevent us from holding the elections earlier.    [Kohl] Will these elections then no longer be held under the  majority voting system but under the proportional representation  system, because the majority voting system benefited the FIS?    [Sifi] That is the problem. The direction that we are going  will depend on the dialogue. The electoral law is part of it.    [Kohl] Are you going to give a precise date for the  elections?    [Sifi] Perhaps not everybody is content. We will see who  will not come. The train will go on. We have to give those who  have not yet boarded the train time to reflect. For this  purpose we have established the National Transition Council  (CNT), which will constitute itself soon. Recently we  instituted the National Economic and Social Council (CNES). All  the issues can be discussed in the CNES and the CNT.    [Kohl] Are you playing to stay in power for awhile?    [Sifi] I will go even further. What other solution can you  offer, what alternative, what is to be done? If you know  something better, why not, even though in my opinion there is  nothing better way than to assemble the people so that we do not  lose even more time.    [Kohl] Still, there are groups who will not participate.    [Sifi] Then things will be done without them. These  organizations are important, but people are more important. The  people want peace.    [Kohl] You have offered dialogue with a time limit?    [Sifi] Of course there are limits.    [Kohl] The accusation has been voiced in Algeria, for  example in the newspapers, that Germany was supporting  fundamentalists, who were not only granted asylum but are even  allowed to demand murders. How do you see the position of the  German authorities?    [Sifi] Germany is a sovereign country. It has the right to  do whatever it wants. People in Germany are worried about what  is going on in Algeria. We would like to give the German  authorities and the German public the possibility to have direct  access to our country so that they do not have to rely on  information provided by international media or all kinds of  experts on Algeria. I think that we can trust that the Germans  will finally find out the truth about our country. Germany and  Algeria have shared interests. Personally, I am convinced that  the Germans will change their opinion not only when they become  more open toward the Algerian Government but when they come here  to see for themselves. Still, I have the impression that German  public opinion does not yet have a true assessment of the  situation here. I can feel that in your questions, too.  Dialogue, particularly in the way it is understood in Germany,  is not dialogue between the government, on the one hand, and a  party, on the other.    [Kohl] Yet, this is what it is seen as -- as dialogue  between the government and the FIS.    [Sifi] No. The government does not back one party or turn  against another. We do not have any preferences.    [Kohl] In your view do political statements in Germany  disturb this process?    [Sifi] Exactly. They have prevented Algeria overcoming the  crisis.    [Kohl] So do you think that Germany should behave  differently?    [Sifi] Yes, absolutely. If the German public were better  informed of the true intentions of the Algerian Government, they  would be convinced of our path and would be more accommodating.    [Kohl] Let us now turn to the economy: Does your government  accept the crucial term privatization? What industries will be  privatized, when and under what conditions?    [Sifi] Here, as in politics, your approach seems to biased.  You never see the whole but only one aspect, which can be a  conclusion but sometimes also the driving force for a certain  development. [sentence as published] Privatization as a simple  term, a slogan, is of no value for us. What we are interested  in is the efficiency of our economy. If the state has to  withdraw from one sphere or another -- I prefer this formulation  -- why not? In Germany there are also public employers. Why do  you not privatize these?    [Kohl] We are just about to privatize our airline.    [Sifi] Very well. Ask the British, and they will tell you  that the Germans are not privatizing enough, and they will add  that the French are lagging even further behind. Everything is  relative. I am not telling the Germans, French, and British  anything. They all have their national economies, and everybody  is trying to be as efficient as possible. When we became  independent we had nothing -- nothing in the private or public  sector. So, something had to be done, and since there was no  private economy, the state had to take things into its hands.  This was necessary. It turned out that the state was unable to  handle everything. So autonomy has to be created in ever more  sectors. We have started, and we will continue.    [Kohl] Give me an example.    [Sifi] Well, take the tourist industry. The state is not  going to invest in any new developments. We are not doing  anything at all in this sector any more. And what we must and  will do is to open up to private national and foreign capital.  Where we need technological partnership we are ready to open  up. I am thinking of cement plants, which need foreign partners.    [Kohl] What about the petrochemical industry?    [Sifi] Do not rush us. We have not analyzed it in detail.  It is not enough to proclaim the slogan and let nothing follow.  We must be able to evaluate all the possibilities. We must not  begin with the simplest things but with what is possible. Time  will come. Now we are not thinking of privatizing the  petrochemical industry, which does not mean that we will not do  so in 10, 15, or 100 years from now -- I do not know. What I do  know is that we are anxious to optimize our economic activities.    [Kohl] To attract foreign capital you have to guarantee  profits.    [Sifi] That is obvious. We can attract foreign capital in  all the sectors if there are shared interests. Yet, without  assessing the possibilities I cannot say that I will simply do  it in one or the other industry. That is not the appropriate  thing for a head of government to do. There have to be vital  Algerian interests for any opening up.    [Kohl] Your recent agreement with the IMF will make the  problems even worse. Do you think that you will be able to  explain this policy to your population? And do you have enough  time for it?    [Sifi] So far, the people have lost confidence in the  government because they were promised a lot. We have explained  the consequences of the agreement, both the negative and the  positive. We have drawn up a program to prevent the shock  therapy that we can witness elsewhere. We will improve the  social network and make sure that the distribution of and access  to goods will improve. At the moment, there is a huge gap  between the real and the official prices. If we increase the  official prices by 50 percent and, at the same time, improve the  distribution of and access to the goods, then we would still  remain beneath the current real prices.    [Kohl] How will you solve the housing shortage?    [Sifi] At the moment we are short of 1.2 million apartments,  based on the statistical assumption of seven people per  apartment. If we wanted five people to share each apartment, we  would need 2 million apartments. This is where we did a bad job  in the past. Now we are trying hard to complete 600,000  unfinished apartments. This will change the concrete living  conditions, which will become noticeable in all the cities.  Moreover, we will permit all Algerians to buy a piece of land,  which was impossible in the past. And the administrative bodies  must change their way of working. They used to take decisions  but there was nobody there to implement them.    [Kohl] As a result of the attacks is it difficult for you to  keep people who work for the state because they are the targets  of such attacks?    [Sifi] Quite a few have left, but most of them have stayed  on. One thing is certain, namely that we can do a much better  job with the same means.    [Kohl] Do you not interpret it as criticism that people  describe you as a technocrat?    [Sifi] On the contrary, I am proud of it. I say it is  better to be a good technocrat than a bad politician.</p>

The Service finds that the petition presents substantial information indicating that listing the species as an endangered or threatened species may be warranted. The Service solicits further information regarding occurrence and distribution of the species and threats to its continued existence and will prepare a 12-month finding. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The finding announced in this notice was made on July 1, 1994.

To the maximum extent practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and the finding is to be published promptly in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> . If the Service finds that a petition presents substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted and the species is not in a current notice of review as a candidate for listing, the Service initiates a status review on that species. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Service to make a finding as to whether or not the petitioned action is warranted within 12 months of receipt of a petition that presents substantial information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Brendan McManus of the Biodiversity Legal Foundation submitted to the Service a petition dated January 15, 1994, to list the Dakota skipper ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperia dacotae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as an endangered or threatened species pursuant to the Act. The petition was received January 21, 1994. The petitioner submitted biological, distributional, and other information in support of the petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperia dacotae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is a Category 2 candidate species (56 FR 58804). In July 1978, the Service proposed listing the species as a threatened species under the Act (USFWS 1978); however, the proposal was withdrawn, due to the 1978 amendments to the Act. A category 2 taxon is one for which information in possession of the Service indicates that proposing to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat are not currently available to support a proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Dakota skipper is a small- to medium-sized hesperine skipper with a wingspan of 2.4 to 3.2 centimeters (cm) (0.9 to 1.3 inches (in)) and hooked antennae. The dorsal surface of the wings ranges from tawny-orange to brown (female with tawny-orange to white spots), while the ventral surface of the wings ranges from yellow-orange to gray-brown. This species has a short, stout body, and a characteristic rapid, skipping flight (Royer and Marrone 1992, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Populations of the Dakota skipper are known to occur in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Manitoba, Canada. In addition, the species was formerly found in Illinois and Iowa. The species is currently known in 16 counties (30 population sites) in Minnesota, 16 counties (28 population sites) in North Dakota, and 11 counties (18 population sites) in South Dakota (Royer and Marrone 1992, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further details regarding the biological status of the species are contained in the administrative finding. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the finding by contacting the office indicated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner contends that the Dakota skipper should be listed as an endangered or threatened species because of the following factors: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Present and threatened destruction, modification, and curtailment of habitat due to loss of suitable grassland habitat; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, since there is no protection for the species or its habitat nationally or within most of the States within the species' range; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Other natural or manmade factors affecting the species' continued existence, including the production of only one egg per adult female per year and the species' inability to adapt to a changing habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1993 (USFWS 1993), the Service concluded that the Dakota skipper may be threatened by the following factors: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Conversion of native tall-grass prairie to other land uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Management practices, including complete burns, pesticide use, grazing, detrimental haying, and wetland enhancement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Habitat alteration and degradation by naturalized alien species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The small number of isolated populations and individuals, which may result in a limited gene pool depressing reproductive vigor and cause the species to be vulnerable to any human-caused or natural environmental disturbance (USFWS 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Overgrazing, inappropriately timed fires and haying, alteration and conversion of prairie habitat to crop production, and invasion of native prairie by naturalized, alien plants are probably the greatest threats to the survival of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> H. dacotae, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which requires undisturbed, virgin prairie habitat to survive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has reviewed the petition, its supporting documents and data, as well as other available information, published and unpublished studies and reports, and agency files. All documents are on file in the office indicated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the best scientific and commercial information available, the Service finds that the petitioner has presented substantial information which indicates that listing of the Dakota skipper as an endangered or threatened species may be warranted. However, the Service is in need of additional information to completely identify the status of the species in all areas of its historic range and to further identify activities that may be contributing to its decline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (6): Chance of growth again - Interview with the Prime Minister MR ESKO AHO, at 39 one of Europe's youngest leaders, has had to steer Finland through a traumatic recession since becoming prime minister in 1991. Active in the rurally-based Centre party since the 1970s, Mr Aho entered parliament in 1983 and became party leader in 1990. He has been criticised for not being tough enough and his future inevitably rests on the fortunes of the economy. He discusses its prospects with Hugh Carnegy WHAT light do you see in the tunnel now for the economy? We have made major structural changes. Throughout the 1980s our exports and industrial output went down, relative to gross domestic product. Finland was only able to preserve its high standard of living by borrowing money from abroad. When my government took over we had to do something about this structural problem. Since then, the share of exports relative to GDP - it was close to 20 per cent in 1991 - has risen to about 33 per cent this year and next year it could be as high as 38 per cent. Also, as far as industrial production is concerned, we have had major changes. That is the reason why I think we have a good chance to return to growth again. Our net foreign debt stands at the equivalent of more than 50 per cent of GDP, but because of that export growth it is going to start to go downwards and next year we expect the balance of payments is going to be in surplus. These are preconditions for solving our other problems. These changes have made possible the recent fall in interest rates, which are now low enough for new investments. This creates possibilities for solving domestic problems and getting some effect also on high unemployment, which is our major political problem. How soon do you anticipate that there will be this pick-up in the domestic economy and what more can you do to encourage it? We have a special interest to stimulate the domestic economy. But the problem is that there are very tight limits for stimulation. We cannot use higher public indebtedness because it will lead to an even worse situation. That is why the main way to stimulate the economy is to push interest rates downwards and to keep them down. I believe that we have the possibility to succeed in that. It depends on domestic decisions - on budget policy, fiscal policy and labour market agreements. Another factor having an impact on that is the European trend and we expect that in the longer term European interest rates are going down. Is there not more you could do, for example some lowering of Finland's very high tax regime? As far as taxes are concerned, the problem is that the deficit in governmental expenditures is very high and we cannot cope with a higher deficit. If we are able to get (wage agreements) which are reasonable in this situation, it would create some possibility to use taxation to stimulate demand, but this margin is not very large. We have also some opportunities to concentrate resources in our budget on new investments. When do you expect unemployment, now around 20 per cent, to peak? It is very difficult to make forecasts because we have not seen this kind of situation before. Simultaneously we have structural problems, with branches like the banking and public sectors having to lay people off, and this depression. But I have the feeling that later this year or at least next year, unemployment will be lower. One of the problems you have run into has been resistance to labour market reforms, such as lowering minimum wage levels for young employees. How difficult is this issue? I have to say that in Finland labour market organisations are very well developed with the kind of agreements which make our labour market very rigid. Our intention has been to lower the threshold for the employment of new people, but we have noticed that labour market organisations, especially the labour unions, have been very much against these kind of changes because they fear they will give companies too much power against unions. I think that is a big mistake because the only way to have a positive effect on unemployment is to make these structures more flexible. We made some agreements last May which made it possible to have some more flexibility in employing young people, but they were not major structural changes. We have not succeeded in that. Would you also like to go further in reducing Finland's extensive and expensive welfare system? We have undertaken several big savings programmes to reach the goal of zero real growth in public expenditure from 1991 to 1995. At the present time we are achieving this target. The problem is that we have some extra costs, especially in the banking sector. We have not been able to cover these costs by savings because, if we had tried that, the downward curve in the economy would have intensified. But the cuts we have made have been very painful, politically. People often remark that Finns have been very tolerant of the recession. There has not been any significant social unrest, despite 20 per cent unemployment. Do you sense that this public understanding of the crisis persists? I have to say that despite many difficulties in realising our programmes - from the political opposition and labour market organisations - today the public discussion is much more reasonable than it has been. The atmosphere in the country is calm - I think most people understand what the situation requires better than was the case in 1991. In 1991 Finland and our population did not know where we were and where we were trying to go. Today I feel that the main goals of economic policy have been accepted more generally than before.</p>

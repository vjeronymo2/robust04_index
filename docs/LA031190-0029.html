			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOING BOO-YAA  </P> <P> Concerning "Rap's Got a Brand New Bag," March 4:  </P> <P> So, the Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. brothers are trying to get it across to other  Pacific Islanders that they are going legit, making money off rap music. ("We  want other Samoan kids to wake up and say, 'Hey man . . . if these big  crazy-looking dudes can stand up on stage and get away from gangs and drugs, so  can I.' ")  </P> <P> Interesting! I guess that's why they were photographed wearing gang rags, with  one member pointing what appears to be a weapon toward the camera lens.  </P> <P> And the word Boo-Yaa represents the sound of a sawed-off shotgun?  </P> <P> Shame, shame, (executive) Kim Buie and Island Records. While Operation Safe  Streets Deputies work hard to de-glamorize gangs, their progress gets erased by  people like you. Anything for money!  </P> <P> MICHAEL D. MAXWELL  </P> <P> and HELEN MAXWELL  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P> <P>  Michael D. Maxwell, a former sheriff's deputy, is deputy director, Department  of Public Safety, Naval Station, Long Beach, and Helen Maxwell is West Coast  correspondent for the National Assn. of Chiefs of Police. (The rap group member  in the photograph actually is pointing a walking stick that he uses because of  an injury.)  </P></p>

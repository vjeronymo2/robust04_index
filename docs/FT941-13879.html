			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Well tuned to Boccherini The Quatuor Mosaques, four young 'period' string-players of unrivalled excellence, is briefly in residence at the Wigmore Hall with a four-day mini-festival devoted to the chamber music of Haydn and Boccherini that should bring happiness to all who sample it. Haydn and the Italian-born, Spain-based Boccherini were contemporaries. Their fame in the later 18th century spread comparably, if differently, wide. Both were hugely prolific. For these reasons and many others besides, numerous parallels between the two have long been drawn by chamber-music historians, invariably to Haydn's greater glory. The bounteous pleasures of Thursday's opening concert were supplied equally by the beauty of the music and the justness of its evaluation - with performers like these, style- and period-conscious not merely in their sound-producing traits but in their effortlessly intimate approach to ensemble performance, there was never any danger of Haydn's greatness obliterating the lesser figure. Two Boccherini string quintets framing the programme, with the Belgian cellist Roel Dieltens as fifth voice, exposed with the most subtle interplay of parts the elegantly musical personality that underlies all of his choicest creations. Today, when charm is a characteristic widely despised and 'aggressive' more often than not an adjective of praise, there is a temptation to scoff at the ripely civilised qualities of a work such as the C major Quintet, Op 28 no. 4. Here, in a reading of exquisite gentleness which constantly searched out the softest, sweetest modes of audience address, the most graceful tones of voice in the singing of Boccherini's delightful melodies, that temptation was immediately banished. The Mosaques encouraged the listener to admire to the full the genial virtuosity of the part-writing, with its delicate evocations of Spanish guitar consorts and intriguing blends of violin texture. And even if the quartet's performance of Haydn's farewell to string-quartet composition, the two-movement 'torso' numbered Op. 103, had earlier raised the listener to an entirely different level of musical experience, it remained possible afterwards to appreciate Boccherini according to his genuine, palpable merits. Wigmore Hall, London W1: series sponsored by Friends of Wigmore Hall; final concert tomorrow evening</p>

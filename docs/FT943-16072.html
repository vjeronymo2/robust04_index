			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Seven sisters slimming Texaco's cost-cutting plan is a sign of just how hard oil companies are having to work to earn a decent return from their assets. Most majors, including Texaco, made returns on capital of 8-10 per cent last year. Economic recovery throughout the industrialised world and the recent rebound in crude prices will boost these returns, but not sufficiently to cover the long-run cost of capital over the economic cycle. So the majors are having to take an axe to their costs. Most, apart from Exxon, the industry's master of cost control, have plenty of fat to trim. Companies became bloated in the 1970s and the early 1980s when crude prices were high. Texaco's package of job cuts, asset write-downs and 'delayering' is designed to cut overheads by Dollars 300m a year, the company's biggest reorganisation since it was forced into Chapter 11 in the late 1980s. Mobil, Chevron and Amoco have all made similar moves to slim down. BP, which is close to reaching its target of cutting operating costs by Dollars 1bn a year, is about to kick into the second phase of its restructuring plan which involves cutting another Dollars 1bn of costs. In the short term, the restructuring wave will deliver improved returns. But in the medium term, competition will prevent cost-cutting translating into wider margins. A leisurely approach to restructuring, such as that adopted by Shell, will not be enough to earn good returns. Only companies that constantly strive to improve efficiency will move ahead. Cost-cutting looks like becoming a permanent industry feature.</p>

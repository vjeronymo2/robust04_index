			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Taylor Woodrow Investor heartbeats are invariably missed when a company announces the retirement of its executive chairman just three weeks before publication of the annual results. In Taylor Woodrow's case, however, it would be surprising if the shares reacted badly to last night's news that Mr Peter Drew will soon be devoting more time to watercolouring. Confirmation that the dividend will be held is reassuring. But the sad reality is that Mr Drew failed to inspire City confidence during his two-year stint at the top, which has coincided with Taylor Woodrow underperforming the market by 63 per cent and the FTA Contracting Sector by 34 per cent. It is not all his fault, but the 58-year-old chartered accountant who is to replace him sounds the sort of chap who might steady the ship.</p>

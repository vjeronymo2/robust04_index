			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Construction Contracts: British embassy building The mountains of Oman provide the backdrop to WIMPEY ALAWI'S Pounds 7.3m contract in Muscat to build a new British Embassy compound (pictured right). The project awarded to Wimpey's subsidiary in the country, will provide 44,000 sq ft of new office accommodation on three storeys together with support buildings. Located on the coast in the diplomatic quarter of Al Khuwair, the design of the building - developed by YRM - features an arcade which envelops the main building providing shade from the sun. The 15-month contract will finish in two phases with the first stage complete by August next year and the remainder handed over two months later. This contract brings the total value of schemes currently under way by Wimpey in the Gulf to Pounds 120m. Other projects include the Pounds 17m redevelopment of Oman's international sea port of Mina Qaboos.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / German officials expel seventeen Romanians German officials placed 17 Romanians on a flight back to Bucharest yesterday after they were denied political asylum, but there were no signs of mass expulsions despite a new agreement between the two countries on refugees, agencies report. A German border police spokesman said it was business as usual, since deportations have taken place even before the pact took effect on Sunday. It requires Romania to take back citizens who have incomplete identity papers, or who have been denied political asylum in Germany but refuse to leave.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ercros to receive Pta6bn from sale of mining unit ERCROS, the chemical group in receivership which is 36 per cent owned by Grupo Torras, the Spanish investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Office, is to sell its Rio Tinto Minera mining unit to Freeport McMoRan, the US minerals group, for Pta6bn (Dollars 54m). Mr Mahmoud al-Nouri, Torras chairman, said Torras had written off the Dollars 800m it had invested to acquire Ercros in the late 1980s and the KIO did not consider itself be 'involved' in the chemical group. Meanwhile, the debt-burdened Torraspapel which is Spain's leading paper producer and is fully-owned by Torras began a series of negotiations with 22 creditor banks aimed at injecting short-term funding into the company. The banks have recently reduced discount lines totalling Pta19bn to Pta5bn. Mr Al-Nouri warned that the banks risked endangering their loans if the negotiations failed. 'They should maintain their credit lines and increase them.' Torras is to loan Pta2bn-worth of KIO funds to Torraspapel, and ICO, Spain's state credit agency, has provided medium and long-term credit lines worth Pta15bn following the presentation of cost-cutting measures by the company. These will reduce its labour force of 8,900 by more than 25 per cent. Mr al-Nouri said that Torras intended to sell the paper group once it was a viable business. In another development involving KIO, a boardroom clash looked likely last night at Ebro, Spain's biggest food group, over Torras' plans to sell the 36 per cent stake that it owns in the company. This disposal is contested by Mr Javier de la Rosa who was owns 12 per cent of the food producer and who resigned as Torras' deputy chairman shortly before Mr al-Nouri was appointed chairman of the holding company in May last year.</p>

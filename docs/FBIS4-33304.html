			<p>BFN     [Text] The Haitian Episcopal Conference has recommended a  meeting between President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide and  General Cedras in order to solve the crisis. Without naming  them, the Haitian bishops invited the protagonists in the crisis  to a frank, courageous dialogue in order to save the country.  This proposal was included in a message issued at the  celebration of Pentecost. Ansy Rose Resignac filed a report:    [Begin Resignac recording] A meeting between the Haitian  leaders in exile in the United States and the military  authorities in Port-au-Prince is, in the eyes of the Haitian  bishops, the only gesture that can save the people. They even go  so far as to present this approach as an imperative, a divine  proposal. The Lord has mandated it, they say in their message.    In an effort to invite the leaders of the two camps to stop  glaring defiantly at each other, the Episcopal Conference cites  as an example the meeting between the Israeli and Palestinian  leaders, between black and white South Africans who just turned  a new page in their country's history through multi-racial,  free, democratic elections. A frank, courageous dialogue is what  the Haitian bishops suggest. They are calling on the  protagonists in the crisis born of the coup d'etat to put their  heads together, to mutually accept each other, and to make a  gesture to save the country from disaster, destruction, and  death. Our people are dying; our country is on the brink of  ruin; a foreign armed intervention is threatening to destroy our  nation. These are several observations that increase the  concerns of the Haitian bishops. They express their pain and  reprobation over everything that is bathing the country with  blood.    In the face of this challenge, can one hesitate about  meeting? Can one refuse to make the gesture on which Haiti's  survival depends?    The Episcopal Conference questions the difficulties of  realizing such a meeting. Is it not because of personal  interests? Have personal or group interests become the  substitute for the common good? Is it not because the will for  protecting international interests paralyzes the pursuit of  national interests? In the Haitian bishops' opinion, in order to  help the country find its stability and dynamism, self-denial,  increased soul, and a burst of evangelical love are necessary.  The time has come, concludes the Episcopal Conference, to  transcend the self and reach out toward others. [end recording]</p>

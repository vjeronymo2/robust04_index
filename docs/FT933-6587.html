			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Deal welcomed The market was cheered by confirmation that building products and printing company MB-Caradon is to acquire RTZ's building and electrical subsidiary Pillar, in a much-heralded Pounds 800m deal. As widely predicted, the acquisition is to be partly funded by a one-for-four rights issue at 260p, to raise Pounds 334m, with the rest of the payment coming from Caradon's existing cash pile. Market watchers have been waiting to see how the proceeds of last April's sale of Caradon's 25.3 per cent stake in Carnaud Metalbox would be used, with many urging the company to cheaply acquire assets. Researchers of the sector said the deal meets that requirement and the shares jumped 32 to a day's peak of 344p in hectic trading, before surrendering some of the advance on profit-taking. The stock finished a net 24 ahead at 336p, with volume reaching 6.8m shares, more than double the daily average. Having released bumper interim figures at the same time, analysts tinkered with full year estimates for 1993 but moved to sharply upgrade 1994 profits forecasts substantially. Mr Howard Seymour at BZW raised his prediction by Pounds 70m, to Pounds 210m, and forecast that earnings per share would rise to 20.4p from a previous estimate of 16.7p. International mining and metals group RTZ moved forward 10 to 712p in trade of 3m shares.</p>

Lockheed Corp., which signed a contract with the Republic of  China [ROC] Air Force in December 1992 for the sale of 150 F-16s  and equipment worth U.S.$5.8 billion over the next six years,  has decided to call a meeting of more than 10 U.S. companies in  March for discussions on technology transfers and other  cooperation with Taiwan in building the F-16 maintenance shop.    According to David Chu, director of the Committee for  Aviation &amp; Space Industry Development under the economics  ministry, the projected depot-level F-16 maintenance shop will  be the first such shop outside the United States.    Chu said a project assessment is expected to be complete  this  year.    If the maintenance shop is built in Taiwan, Chu said, the  shop will not only be used by Taiwan's 150 F-16s, it could also  serve similar types of F-16s owned by South Korea, Singapore,  Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia.    Vice Economics Minister Yang Shih-chien estimated that the  maintenance shop will create an annual U.S.$1 billion worth of  contracts for domestic industry by 2000.    Domestic spare parts makers will reap an additional U.S.$500  million in annual spare parts supply contracts, Yang predicted.</p>

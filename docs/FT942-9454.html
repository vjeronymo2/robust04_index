			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): Swissair ahead - confirmed Anyone who has ever been bumped from a confirmed homebound flight will cheer the news that Swissair is abolishing the annoying requirement to reconfirm return flights from June 1. The alleged purpose of reconfirmation is to give the airline a destination contact number so it can warn passengers of a substantial delay or cancellation of the return flight, although it has never been clear why the absence of such a number should entitle the airline to cancel a confirmed booking. Swissair said it already kept in its reservation system a home contact number for its passengers and often the name of the destination hotel. From now on, it would start asking for a destination contact number when bookings were made so reconfirmation would no longer be necessary. Was the airline worried about 'no-shows'? 'We always worry about no-shows,' a spokesman said. But he doubted that the problem would worsen as a result of the abolition of reconfirmation.</p>

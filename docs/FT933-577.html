			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Muted response to Russia developments Political and other news had little aggregate effect on stock markets last week, leaving the FT-Actuaries World Index to edge slightly lower by Friday. Europe, in the end, gave a muted response to events in Russia, while Mr Nelson Mandela's call on Friday for an end to sanctions had been widely discounted in Johannesburg. Even the Olympic Committee's decision on the host city for the 2000 Games provided only a short-lived fillip to Sydney. Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities says that, by mid-week, the markets had decided that Mr Boris Yeltsin would prevail and that Russia was not facing civil war. There was also an element of 'So what?'. Western banks had already reserved against Russian debt and exports to Russia were providing no great bonanza for western companies. 'Even looking at the worst case of extended civil war, it would not make much difference,' he says. Ms Cathy Savage, in the Nomura Research Institute's weekly review, notes that there was some initial nervousness as Mr Yeltsin abolished the existing Russian parliament. 'But', she adds, 'reassured by Yeltsin's control over the essential instruments of power, the mood has since become more composed, with even an underlying view that this is a necessary political showdown which will eventually place Russia on a firmer, more coherent, footing to pol-itical and economic reform.' Olympics news brought Sydney briefly to life on Friday, with that day's rise accounting for much of the week's gain. However, analysts noted that 70 per cent of the facilities were already in place. South Africa was the biggest loser of the week, in reaction to local selling of industrials, a lack of interest in the golds sector and the strength of the financial rand. However, the market did respond with a 1.7 per cent rise yesterday to international moves, led by the US, to lift sanctions.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change  % change in                % change in local currency**     sterling**  US Dollars**              1 Week  4 Weeks   1 Year   Start of   Start of    Start of                                           1993       1993         1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -2.14    -5.33    +14.20    +19.95     +18.45       +17.47 Belgium      -2.43    -3.68    +16.44    +14.12      +8.70        +7.80 Denmark      -1.04    -1.85    +30.37    +28.19     +21.32       +20.32 Finland      +0.83    -4.22   +147.14    +70.91     +54.86       +53.58 France       -0.05    -3.26    +17.88    +16.48     +13.10       +12.16 Germany      +0.12    -0.89    +22.65    +21.70     +20.56       +19.57 Ireland      -1.28    -5.40    +34.42    +37.26     +20.79       +19.79 Italy        -1.08    -8.73    +80.10    +41.95     +32.55       +31.46 Netherlands  +0.80    -2.78    +21.70    +21.09     +20.05       +19.06 Norway       -1.35    -4.31    +38.38    +26.45     +22.80       +21.78 Spain        -1.12    -7.07    +44.90    +31.73     +15.06       +14.11 Sweden       +2.31    +1.97    +69.13    +29.32     +14.14       +13.20 Switzerland  +2.50    -1.24    +28.60    +19.22     +22.55       +21.53 UK           +0.04    -3.03    +18.04     +7.57      +7.57        +6.68 EUROPE       +0.17    -2.93    +24.69    +16.31     +14.15       +13.20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    +1.27    +0.42    +24.27    +20.93     +15.99       +15.03 Hong Kong    +2.11    +2.02    +27.64    +34.97     +36.07       +34.95 Japan        -1.01    -2.22    +17.11    +23.63     +46.83       +45.62 Malaysia     +1.09    +4.27    +68.47    +50.61     +55.77       +54.48 New Zealand  -0.64    -3.15    +37.60    +29.74     +41.14       +39.99 Singapore    -0.80    +0.14    +55.54    +31.03     +36.40       +35.27 Canada       -0.32    -3.89     +7.08    +10.23      +7.11        +6.22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- USA          -0.24    -0.53     +9.68     +5.08      +5.96        +5.08 Mexico       -0.93    -5.24    +39.62     +1.19      +2.33        +1.49 South Africa -3.54    -7.54    +17.97    +17.43     +26.76       +25.71  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  -0.35    -1.69    +16.47    +13.88     +19.53       +18.55  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on September 24th 1993.

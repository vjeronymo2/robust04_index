			<p>CSO     [Text] Castellon -- Jose Maria Cuevas, president of the  CEOE [Spanish Confederation of Employers Organizations], stated  yesterday, in Castellon, that the Spanish economy has suffered  the consequences of a misguided policy, although he acknowledged  that the "side effects" of the "correction of the wrong course"  are beginning to be felt.    Cuevas noted that a slight recovery of the economy is  perceptible, owing to the rebound in other countries and the  lowering of interest rates in Spain. This change, he said,  "stems more from a recycling of those who implemented the  misguided policy than from a change in the attitude of the  business community."    The CEOE's president announced that its primary objective in  this year's round of collective bargaining will be to slow the  increase in unemployment; the objective must not be wage  increases. He pledged that the CEOE will try to "break the  dynamic" of meeting cost increases by reducing staff. This, he  said, will make wage moderation indispensable.    The Ministry of Economy, for its part, asserts that the  economic recovery is taking root as the year progresses,  although during 1994 the recovery will be based solely on  exports, since the growth of consumption and investment can be  expected to remain practically flat.    The Ministry's most recent report on the economic situation  states that "the signs of a rebound, particularly an industrial  one, are increasing, while the resurgence of domestic demand is  lagging somewhat. This lag is related to the slow return of  confidence on the part of the economic operators."    It adds: "This initial lag is to be considered normal, in  that it reproduces the patterns the Spanish economy has followed  in past recoveries from crises."</p>

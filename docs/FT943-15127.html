			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Spotlight falls on high-deficit countries - Capital &amp; Credit The bear market in bonds took a turn for the worse last week as participants took a closer look at the massive debt burdens and funding pressures weighing on some European governments. This new interest in countries' indebtedness was triggered on July 1 when Skandia, the large Swedish insurance group and a big buyer of government debt, said it was boycotting the Swedish bond market until the politicians found a credible solution to the country's debt problem. This not only sent Sweden's government bonds and currency to new lows for the year, but drew investors' attention to other high-deficit nations - including Belgium, which is nursing the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in Europe. During last year's bond bonanza, worries over stubborn, structural deficits were conveniently masked by heavy buying from foreign - predominantly US - investors, who piled into European bonds on hopes of further falls in interest rates. The high-yielding markets, whose yields were expected to continue converging towards German levels, benefited from these flows. But since early 1994, 'the withdrawal of liquidity has highlighted many of the debt problems that were concealed by last year's heavy liquidity inflows,' says Mr Malcolm Roberts, head of global bond research at UBS. As a result, yield convergence has been reversed in recent months. According to OECD estimates, the Belgian debt-to-GDP ratio this year is likely to be a whopping 146.3 per cent. And while the country is running a primary budget surplus, the cost of servicing its debt is keeping its overall budget deficit at around 5.8 per cent of GDP. While not quite in the Belgian league, Sweden's debt situation is also deteriorating rapidly. The country's gross public debt is set to reach 92.9 per cent of GDP this year, rising to 100.8 per cent next year, the OECD forecasts. Its budget deficit is expected to hit 10.7 per cent of GDP this year, down from last year's 12.9 per cent but still above initial forecasts, as rising interest rates have boosted debt servicing costs. Political uncertainty ahead of Sweden's general election in September and referendum on European Union membership in November is further undermining confidence in its financial markets. In the run-up to the elections, the government is unlikely to take the radical fiscal measures needed to restore confidence. And if the opposition Social Democrats come to power, reliance on one-off income sources, tax increases and attempts to preserve the welfare state would probably heighten market fears, warns Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg Securities. Reliance on foreign capital has made some markets particularly vulnerable to bear market conditions. Some 48 per cent of Sweden's 1993 net borrowing was financed by overseas buying of government bonds or foreign currency borrowing, and heavy foreign sales this year have taken their toll on the bond and currency markets. 'The rating agencies are likely to become a lot more wary of debt junkies in the present situation, which (in Sweden's case) should limit the ability to finance outside the Swedish krona,' warns Mr Mike Gallagher, director of economic research at market analysts IDEA. 'In turn, this increases the reliance on overseas purchases of Swedish krona denominated debt.' While most European currencies have been weakening against the D-Mark, those of high-deficit countries have come under particular pressure. The Swedish krona fell to a new low of SKr5 per D-Mark last week; the Italian lira approached the key L1,000 per D-Mark level as the Berlusconi government continued to delay the publication of its budget plans; and the Belgian franc - usually as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar - fell to around BF20.70 to the D-Mark, from BF20.59 only two weeks earlier. As a result of currency weakness, short-term money market rates in countries with perceived debt or political problems have risen sharply: Swedish three-month money traded at 7.28 per cent on Friday, up from 6.75 per cent two weeks before; Belgian three-month rates rose to 6.88 from 5.5 per cent; and Italian three-month money climbed to 8.31 from 7.25 per cent. However, raising rates to protect the currency is no solution - if anything, it compounds the problem by increasing the debt servicing cost. 'The only way out of the vicious circle is to undertake drastic fiscal tightening,' says Mr Kokko. 'Many governments still don't understand how serious the situation is, and now the markets are trying to force a solution.' While Warburg's analysts expect steady increases in long-term yields to continue, they say this constitutes an important part of the disinflationary process. As such, 'real and nominal yields are rising to the point where they may (1) cause a financial accident; (2) cramp economic recovery; (3) force governments into more disciplined fiscal policy; or (4) bring about some combination of all three'.</p>

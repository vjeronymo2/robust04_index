			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Sedgwick dividend cut after profit fall A SHARP and unexpected deterioration in trading conditions in the US and falling interest rates hit profits at Sedgwick, the UK's second biggest insurance broker, which yesterday cut its interim dividend. Its shares fell 34p to 110p. A payout of 3p compares with an interim dividend of 4p at the half-way stage last year. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 51.7m, down from Pounds 65.3m. Earnings per share fell to 7.4p compared with 10p per share last year. Mr David Rowland, the outgoing chairman, said Sedgwick had kept its dividend at 12p since 1986 when pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 136m. But as profits have fallen steadily since then, Sedgwick has struggled to maintain cover. Mr Rowland attributed the cut to difficulties in trading conditions and further reductions in premium rates, especially in the United States which generates 40 per cent of operating revenues. 'Dividend cuts come about for other reasons than 'disasters in business',' said Mr Rowland, who is expected to take over as chairman of Lloyd's of London next year. Operating income was down by 1 per cent to Pounds 323.3m, with US income down to Pounds 110m from Pounds 113m. 'Rates are continuing to go downwards. It is very, very competitive,' said Mr Quill Healey, chief executive Sedgwick James USA. In London Sedgwick Payne, the specialist reinsurance broking subsidiary, has suffered from the virtual disappearance of the retrocession (the reinsurance of reinsurance) market, following heavy losses in recent years. In spite of an increase in income from financial reinsurances, reinsurance revenues were also down. Expenses remain stubbornly high. Staff numbers were reduced by 89 during the year, but expenses rose to to Pounds 291.1m from Pounds 286.6m. Investment income fell 11 per cent to Pounds 26.3m. US interest rates after hedging were 6.7 per cent compared with 7.6 per cent last year. UK rates after hedging were 11.3 per cent, compared with 13.1 per cent last year. Underwriting losses of Pounds 1.9m at the River Thames Insurance depressed profits earned by associated companies to Pounds 200,000 from Pounds 1.6m. Interest payable increased to Pounds 7m from Pounds 5.4m. Lex, Page 16; More, Page 18</p>

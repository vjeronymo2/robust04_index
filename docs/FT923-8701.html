			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Ewart launches attack on challenger's motives THE BOARD of Ewart, the Belfast-based property company where the largest shareholder has challenged the position of four directors, yesterday accused it of trying to gain effective control without making an offer. The shareholder is Monarch Properties, a private Dublin-based property concern owning 29.2 per cent of Ewart. It has requisitioned an egm for September 4 in Belfast seeking the removal of four Ewart directors and the appointment of two of its nominees. Mr Philip Monahan, who heads Monarch and is already on Ewart's board, would become its deputy chairman if the changes went ahead. In rejecting the proposals, Mr Derek Tughan, chairman of Ewart, alleged that Monarch was heavily borrowed, had a high-risk strategy and would try to push its assets into Ewart. According to Mr Tughan, past attempts to get Ewart to buy Monarch assets included a stud farm near Mr Monahan's residence. Mr Monahan also wrote to Ewart shareholders at the weekend. He said the company was misguided 'to eschew all involvement in Southern Ireland'. He also strongly defended Monarch's record - stressing the avoidance of speculative development - and described its financial position as robust. He said Monarch had no plans to switch assets between the two companies, but this would not be ruled out. Any such moves would have to comply with the takeover code and stock exchange rules.</p>

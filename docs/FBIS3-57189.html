			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General V.I. Yesin, chief of </F> Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff Operations Directorate, by  Aleksandr Dolinin; place and date not given: "Missiles Are Not  Now Targeted at Each Other. But Missilemen's Alert Duty Is Not  Being Abolished"]    [Text] During the U.S. President's recent visit to Russia  documents were signed on the dismantling of Ukrainian missiles,  on the respective nontargeting of Russian and U.S. strategic  nuclear missiles....    All this directly concerns the Strategic Missile Forces,  which constitute the basis of Russia's strategic nuclear forces.  To what extent are their tasks being complicated? Is there no  longer any point to continuous alert duty? Lieutenant General  Viktor Yesin, chief of the Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff  Operations Directorate, answers these and other questions.    [Dolinin] Viktor Ivanovich, will anything change in the  strategic missilemen's service if the intentions to alter the  assigned flight missions [poletnyye zadaniya] are realized?    [Yesin] They will continue on alert duty. The mutually  acceptable accord reached on the nontargeting of missiles means  for us that they will have a "zero" assigned flight mission.  Day-to-day control of nuclear systems will proceed from the  premise that Russia, as defined in its military doctrine,  regards no state as its adversary. We will be threatening no  one, but this in no way rules out the possibility, in a certain  situation, of feeding targets into the missiles' control system  on an order from the supreme commander in chief of the Armed  Forces -- the president of Russia. This possibility remains,  and the meaning and purpose of alert duty are not changing.  Missilemen must always be ready to defend the fatherland.    [Dolinin] In connection with the fact that, in accordance  with the trilateral statement by the presidents of Russia, the  United States, and Ukraine, the RS-22 (SS-24) missiles on  Ukrainian territory will be deactivated over the course of 10  months by removing their warheads, what obligations are imposed  on the Strategic Missile Forces?    [Yesin] In accordance with the agreements reached between  Ukraine and Russia back in 1993, Russia will provide maintenance  and ensure the technical safety of the nuclear warheads being  removed, as well as dismantling them in its own enterprises.    If the Ukrainian side shows an interest, on the conclusion  of  appropriate mutually advantageous agreements it will be possible  to salvage the missiles currently in Ukraine at the already  prepared Russian elimination bases. We have everything  necessary for this.    [Dolinin] What will happen to the missilemen officers in the  event of the elimination of nuclear missile weapons in Ukraine?    [Yesin] Approximately one-third of the officers of the 43d  Missile Army serving in Ukraine evince a desire to be  transferred to Russia. There are places for officers who have  shown themselves to positive advantage during service. There is  a shortage of officers in the Strategic Missile Forces,  particularly in primary posts. Things are more complex with  senior officers. We could take on many, but we cannot at once  provide them with housing. Today there are more than 8,000  members of the Missile Forces without apartments. Not  everything is within our power.    [Dolinin] In accordance with the START I and START II  Treaties, missiles with multiple reentry vehicles are to be  removed from the effective combat strength of the Strategic  Missile Forces. Only single-warhead missiles will remain.  Today these account for only one-third of the missiles on alert  duty. What will make up for the rest?    [Yesin] First, I deem it necessary to point out that  production of missiles with multiple reentry vehicles for the  needs of the Missile Forces has been terminated, and within the  framework of the international accords signed by Russia they  will be taken off alert duty as the warrantied (service) life  expires.    Second, under the START I and START II Treaties the  quantitative makeup of the Strategic Missile Forces grouping  will be reduced. In order to maintain the deterrent potential of  the Strategic Missile Forces at the necessary level for defense  needs, work is under way in the Missile Forces in the context of  life-prolonging technology [po resursosberegayushchey  tekhnologii] to modernize the missile complex with a  single-warhead missile. Colonel General I. Sergeyev, commander  in chief of the Strategic Missile Forces, is devoting very close  attention to this question. On New Year's Eve he chaired a  state commission session with the participation of general and  chief designers. It was pointed out there that we are ensuring  the readiness to begin proving-ground tests of a modernized  single-warhead missile, which is to replace those whose service  life has expired -- those, so to speak, which have grown old  naturally.    ...Given all the objective processes and the existing  difficulties, the future of the Strategic Missile Forces is  predictable, and the life, activity, and combat training of  missilemen are proceeding in a planned manner.</p>

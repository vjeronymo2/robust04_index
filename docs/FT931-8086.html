			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Cookery: Super soups to stir the most jaded palate WHEN I was a child, my father often told me the tale of a menage a trois remembered from his boyhood. The co-habitants were a domestically-minded trio - une feve, un saucisson et une petite souris grise - whose innocent lives centred on the tasks of cooking, shopping and cleaning their little house. They all noticed that the soup always tasted best on days when the sausage was cook. The mouse kept asking why. Eventually, the sausage divulged his secret: he jumped in and out of the soup pan when no one was looking. The mouse was excited by this culinary revelation. When next on kitchen duty, he tried to imitate the sausage, dived into the soup pan and drowned. The bean, heartless old thing, laughed so much that he split his sides - and every bean has a split in its back ever since . . . I was reminded of this tale when thumbing my way through two new books published this month, both on the same subject. The Soup Book, by Brigid Allen (Papermac, Pounds 9.99) is not helped by its cover. A Celebration of Soup, by Lindsey Bareham (Michael Joseph, Pounds 16.99) has far greater instant appeal. The title is more joyous and the cover photograph is seductive in a restrained sort of way. While Allen is lumbered with a worthy, stuck-in-a-time-warp wholefood image, Bareham's bowl of soup has a zesty, contemporary freshness. Bareham has made her mark on the comfort food corner of the cook-book market already with an excellent volume on the potato. This new offering is liable to win her even more friends. It is a rich source of inspiration, a whopping compendium of soup recipes for every occasion, and a mass of information on all aspects of making and serving soup. The recipes are her own, her adaptations of other people's, and some offerings direct from such names as Simon Hopkinson, Shaun Hill and Nico Ladenis. A large section, enough to make a book in its own right, is devoted to garnishes and embellishments. There are breads, of course, and such fun ideas as spooning a cheese souffle mixture on to toast to float on soup to be heated in the oven; plus the latest visual shock tactic in foodie circles: sprinkling gold dust on home-made noodles and floating squares of gold leaf on soups. Bareham believes stock is 'the body and soul of most soups . . . invariably, the secret ingredient that makes so many soups rich, complex in flavour and full-bodied.' Accordingly, a hefty chunk of the book is devoted to a comprehensive run-down on stock-making and a mind-boggling diversity of stock recipes. Cooks, she says, 'divide into those that do and those that don't make stock.' Allen acknowledges that good stock can be valuable in soup-making but she is wary of the stock-pot as a potential tyrant. She points out that the dominance of stock in soup-making is rooted in the meat-based diet of earlier generations, and in household economies geared to the extraction of every last drop of goodness from a carcass. Joints figure relatively rarely on our menus today, They tend to be much smaller and may be boned-out. For earlier generations, maintaining the stock-pot was a sacred duty. Today, it might involve a special trip to the butcher. We are, she argues, more orientated towards vegetable cookery. I would guess that fewer than half the recipes in Allen's book depend on stock. They are grouped under such unusual chapter headings as soups using avocado pear, soups using roast garlic, curried soups, and so on. Recurring flavourings include ginger and chilli. Many mentions of lovage, sorrel, spinach and chard highlight the appeal of the book to cook-gardeners, and there is a useful section on breads. SCALLOP AND POTATO CREAM WITH CORAL (Bareham's recipe. Serves 4) Ingredients: 4 large scallops (cleaned weight about 12 oz); 1 lb potatoes, peeled and diced; 2 small shallots, chopped finely; 2 oz butter; 1 pt hot fish stock;  1/2 pt milk; 2 egg yolks; 3 fl oz double cream; 1 tsp snipped chives. Method: Soften the shallots in 1 1/2 oz butter. Stir in the diced potato, add  1/2 tsp salt and some pepper. Cover and sweat for 15 minutes, stirring thoroughly after the first five minutes. Pour on the hot fish stock, stir, cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until the potatoes are soft. Puree the contents of the pan and sieve it into a clean pan. Separate the white scallop meat from the corals. Dice the white meat and put it in a pan with the cold milk and a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a bare simmer and cook for a couple of minutes, then whisk the contents of the pan into the potato puree. Bring back to a simmer, adjust seasoning and remove the pan from the heat. Beat the egg yolks into the cream, add a ladleful of the soup, then another, then stir the liaison into the pan. Return the pan to the heat and warm through without boiling. Just before serving, melt the remaining  1/2 oz butter and gently saute the scallop corals, either whole, halved or chopped. Pour the soup into warmed bowls and garnish with the coral and chives. RED PEPPER SOUP WITH MUSSELS (Allen's recipe. Serves 4) Ingredients: 2 lb mussels; 4 large red peppers, deseeded; 12 medium-large garlic cloves, peeled; 2 tablespoons olive oil. Method: Clean the mussels and put them into a cast-iron casserole to stew, covered, in their own juices for 15 minutes. In another pan, soften the chopped peppers and sliced garlic in the olive oil, stirring occasionally to make sure they do not brown. After 10-15 minutes, pour on the mussel juices and simmer the peppers and garlic in them for about another 15 minutes, adding 1 1/2 pt water and 1 teaspoon sea salt as soon as the peppers and garlic have begun to absorb the mussel juices. Keep the mussels warm in their shells by leaving the lid firmly on the casserole in which they were cooked. Liquidise the soup either before or after you shell the mussels into it, or eat them separately.</p>

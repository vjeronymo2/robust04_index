			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Interest cuts and gains save Headway Headway turned in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 637,000 for the year ended June 30, compared with Pounds 606,000 for the previous 15 months. The group, which makes garden furniture and sofa beds, partially offset the effects of recession by cutting operating costs, containing capital expenditure, reducing stocks and conserving cash. Disposals reduced borrowings. Following the rights issue last September gearing had been cut from 83 per cent to 6 per cent. Turnover came to Pounds 28.3m (Pounds 40.7m for 15 months). Net interest was Pounds 568,000 (Pounds 1.24m) and there were exceptional credits of Pounds 285,000. Earnings per share worked through at 4.1p (4.3p for the period) and the dividend is again 0.7p on higher capital.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- "We should receive fuller  information on the situation and conduct measures aimed at  preventing or lessening a radioactive leakage from the  Komsomolets submarine," said here on Wednesday Sergey  Khetagurov, deputy minister for civil defence and emergencies,  defining the main task of a Russian expedition to the area of  the sunken submarine to be held next June.    He spoke at a working meeting of several ministries and  departments which will participate in the expedition.    The mission plans to carry out comprehensive monitoring of  the radiation, ecological and biological situation in the area  of the submarine's wreckage with the use of advanced equipment  and to realise several technological operations aimed at  minimising a possible leakage of products of plutonium corrosion  into the environment.    It is also planned to implement a unique operation at a  depth  of 1,700 meters to seal, with special hatches, six ports in the  submarine's bow where there are six missiles, two of which are  with nuclear warheads.    This will decrease the speed of water currents and minimise  the leakage of products of plutonium corrosion. The operation  on installing hatches will be simulated on the sub's specially  built full-scale mockup. Meeting participants noted that there  is no experience of conducting similar operations at such depths.    Khetagurov said in conclusion that the expedition is an  expensive undertaking. Nevertheless, it is necessary for Russia  and the entire international community. Therefore, it should be  carried out at a high technological and organisational level.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 31 (CNA) -- Russia, which maintains  full diplomatic links with Mainland China, will open a  representative office in Taipei before the end of this fall,  [passage indistinct] the Moscow-Taipei Economic and Cultural  Coordination Commission said here Tuesday [31 May].    "The representative office is expected to be inaugurated  very  soon," Aleksey B. Remizov said. "We've discovered a suitable  office here in Taipei."    The commission is authorised to handle private exchange  [words indistinct] Russia and Taiwan in the absence of official  diplomatic ties.    Initially, the representative office will not be authorized  to issue visas directly to Taiwan citizens wanting to visit  Russia. All the visa applications it receives here will be  forwarded to Russia's consulate in Hong Kong for approval,  according to Remizov.    The office will have approximately eight employee, with half  of them locals, Remizov said.    There was earlier talk of setting up the long-awaited  representative office, but none of the reports turned out to be  true due to financial difficulties. "The budget to finance the  establishment of the office was approved about a month ago," an  elated Remizov said.    Remizov, who arrived here last Friday and will stay here for  three weeks is concurrently the president of the privately  funded Scientific-Technical Center [word indistinct] in Russia.    In addition to helping tackle the problems facing the new  representative office, Remizov admitted he is also here to sign  a contract worth US$3 million with Acer Inc., Acton Technology  and Zyxel for the purchase of computer equipment, which will be  used by a Russian governmental organization.    He is optimistic about bilateral economic ties. Two-way  trade between the two countries hit a record US$450 million in  1992, and that's doubled to US$900 million in 1993. The figure  is anticipated to top US$1 billion this year.    Still, he was reluctant to cover the slow progress on the  other spectrum of bilateral ties, repeatedly stressing that  Nikolai I. Ryzkov, the former prime minister of the Soviet  Union, was visiting Taipei to handle that aspect of the  relationship.    Remizov also ruled out the possibility of any arms deals  between Taipei and Moscow, apparently for fear of affecting ties  with Beijing. "The export of weapons from Russia is under tight  control," he emphasized.</p>

At a meeting of the party's policy-making Central  Executive Committee, the officials expressed strong opposition  to a government proposal to rename the consumption tax to  "welfare-purpose" tax and raise the rate from the present 3  percent to 7 percent, the sources said.    Among the opponents was Shun Oide, a party vice chairman,  the  sources said.    The Hosokawa cabinet, launched last August, includes six  ministers from the SDP, the largest of the seven ruling parties.  They are Transport Minister Shigeru Ito, Construction Minister  Kozo Igarashi, Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato, National Land  Agency Director General Kosuke Uehara, Economic Planning Agency  Director General Manae Kubo and Sadao Yamahana, minister in  charge of political reform.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Will species-specific standards and guidelines improve the efficiency of Forest project planning and implementation? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Will the efficiency and effectiveness of the Forest sensitive plant program improve? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the preliminary issues listed above and other issues that may be developed, the Forest Service will identify and consider a range of alternatives for managing sensitive plant species. These alternatives will include a no action alternative (continuing with existing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> direction). Other alternatives to consider may include implementation of species-specific standards and guidelines and/or delisting one or more of the species under consideration. These preliminary alternatives may be revised before the draft EIS is issued as new information is developed or new comments are received: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public participation will be especially important at several points during the analysis. The first point is during the scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from federal, state, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed project. This input will be used in preparation of the draft EIS. The scoping process includes: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Defining the scope of the analysis and nature of the decision to be made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Identifying the issues and determining the significant issues for consideration and analysis within the EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Defining the proper interdisciplinary team make-up. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Determining the effective use of time and money in conducting the analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Identifying potential environmental, technical, and social impacts of the EIS and alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Determining potential cooperating agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Identifying groups or individuals interested or affected by the decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> John Phipps, Forest Supervisor, Eldorado National Forest, is the responsible official. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public review in September 1994. At that time, EPA will publish a notice of availability of the draft EIS in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date that EPA's notice of availability appears in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewers's position and contentions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage, but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Angoon v. Hodel, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final environmental impact statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality. Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the comment period ends on the draft EIS, the comments will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service in preparing the final EIS. The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by January 1994. In the final EIS the Forest Service is required to respond to the comments and responses received (40 CFR 1503.4). The responsible official will consider the comments, responses, and environmental consequences discussed in the draft EIS; and applicable laws, regulations, and policies in making a decision regarding this project. If a decision is made to amend the Land and Resource Management Plan, the responsible official will document the decision and reasons for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to appeal pursuant to 36 CFR part 215. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Dated: July 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=3 --> Rex Baumback, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=3 --> Acting Forest Supervisor, Eldorado National Forest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=3 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18319 Filed 7&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=3 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;11&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

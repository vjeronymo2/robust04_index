He said that in other aspects Russia's plans did not differ  from the plan proposed by the CSCE Minsk group.    Gukasyan said that during his recent meeting in Moscow with  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev they failed to reach  full agreement because the Karabakh side made a number of  important remarks.    However, according to the Karabakh minister, after the  discussion of these remarks with the Russian ambassador at Large  Vladimir Kazimirov, eventually they were taken into account.    Gukasyan expressed hope that the discussion of Russia's plan  with Kazimirov, who left for Yerevan on Friday and then will go  to Stepanakert, would also be held in a constructive atmosphere.    In the meantime, the press secretary of the Armenian  president Aram Abramian said in an interview with Interfax that  Armenia welcomes Russia's peaceful initiative.</p>

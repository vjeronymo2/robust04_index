			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / People: Developing solicitors' business Barrister Stephen Fielding has joined City solicitors Titmuss Sainer &amp; Webb as the partnership's first director of business development. Fielding, who was called to the Bar in 1974, but shortly after went to work in the financial services sector, first as a lawyer to the Building Societies Association then to Midland Bank, says he has not this time been hired as a lawyer but rather for his 'business management capacity'. Titmuss Sainer was one of the first City law firms to establish a marketing department, though it lost Linda Phelan, who had been responsible for setting it up, at the end of last year, and her replacement has also subsequently left. Fielding says his job is 'business development - not just marketing'. This he takes to amount to some input on strategic issues, with the partnership currently engaged in an overhaul of strategy; attention to and promotion of 'the quality of service; and new business acquisition'. Fielding, who is 40 and lists the Church among his interests, is proud of his recent record as deputy chief executive of Midland Bank's personal asset management business. 'It became a very fast-growing part of Midland,' he asserts. Heavily dependent on the branch network, he admits it will be 'much harder work' at Titmuss Sainer.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Auto News Coverage Group] </F>   [Text] Japan's automakers who had prided themselves on  being invincible only a year and a half ago are now facing the  consequences of their excessive investments during the bubble  economy. Amid the effects of the sharp rise of the yen, the  future is uncertain for the companies that are steadily lowering  costs aand restricting the number of personnel.  <H3>  Toyota: Personnel Reshuffle of 20 Percent in the Indirect  Sector; Faced With Measures Concerning Surplus Plants </H3>   Toyota Motor Corp., which was a synonym for the  high-earnings  enterprise, has been doubly impacted by the recession and the  high yen. The company's June 1993 settlement shows a business  profit of 103.629 billion yen, which is a big drop of 23.8  percent from the same period a year before. The forecast for the  June 1994 settlement indicates that the profit from its main  business will decline further by 32.5 percent or 70 billion yen,  and will definitely fall below the 100 billion yen mark.    From the end of last year until this year when the recession  and the high yen overlapped, Toyota evolved such internal  company activities as "emergency VA [value analysis]," "VE  [value engineering]," and the "special VA/VE," and implemented  cost improvements totaling 100 billion yen.    The VA/VE method is a cost-improvement measure generally  adopted by various automakers in recent years, and is a typical  post-bubble cost-lowering step. There are various added-value  factors for autos such as performance, comfort, and endurance.  The aim of the VA/VE process is to analyze each aspect of  performance and quality, reexamining them in detail as to  whether there are any excessive or ineffective parts, and  linking them to cost-cutting.    In the case of Japan's automakers, the ratio of parts made  outside the company has reached 70-80 percent. Consequently,  VA/VE activity naturally is a measure that has been adopted not  only by the main Toyota company, but also by numerous parts  makers.    The slimming down of the indirect sector has also started.  Limiting the period from six months to two years and centering  on the management sector, all sectors including the new sectors  will participate in the operations reform project.    Toyota explains that, rather than indicating that it feels  there is a surplus, it decisively halts work that can be halted.  However, their explanation can be viewed as justifying the  reshuffling that will affect about 20 percent of the personnel.  For Toyota, which has never carried out any temporary transfer  of sales personnel to the dealerships--a practice common among  the other automakers, the act of reshuffling itself exposes  extremely severe management circumstances.    It is also planned to drastically downsize plant and  equipment [P&amp;E] investment. P&amp;E investment in the early  period  (June 1993 period) was initially set at 410 billion yen, but it  was actually reduced by 130 billion to 280 billion yen. It will  also be kept at a similar level for the current period.    Development investment in new cars and technology comprises  50 percent of overall P&amp;E, and such drastic constraints will  undoubtedly impact greatly on future plans for new car  investments.    Personnel cutbacks are not limited to reshuffling in the  management sector. They will also have a major impact on new  hiring of high school male graduates in the production sector.  As of this spring, the plan was to hire 1,000 new graduates, but  it was decided by this fall to pare it down to 500, and notices  to that effect were sent to high schools nationwide. In order to  reduce the hiring of new graduates in the management sector  also, the plan for next spring calls for 1,650 new employees, or  850 less than this year.    Meanwhile, unprecedented moves are seen in the reappraisal  of  the production sector. Regarding the popular passenger-car  Tercel Corsa series, a production system in the form of  consigned production at Toyota's Takaoka plant (Toyoda City,  Aichi Prefecture) and Hino Motor--an affiliated company--had  been maintained previously. However, consignments to Hino Motor  will be terminated at the end of this fiscal year, and will be  concentrated at the Takaoka plant. From Toyota's viewpoint,  consignment to Hino is surplus productivity, and it became  necessary to terminate production at the two plants for  efficient production.    This fall, Toyota will transfer the entire production of the  Mark II from its Motomachi plant (ditto) to its new Kyushu  plant. In accordance with this move, the surplus staff of more  than 100 key employees at the Motomachi plant has been assigned  to the group's chassis makers. Such aftermath effects of the  bubble period are likely to surface in various forms in the  future.  <H3>  Nissan: Second Zama Plant To Close in 1995; Is "Profit at  Zero Growth" Possible? </H3>   Twice this year, Nissan Motor announced a full-fledged  restructuring plan for the purpose of drastically improving its  earnings capacity. The gist of the plan focused on the following  two points. 1) To close its second Zama plant in the spring of  1995, and 2) to lay off 5,000 of its personnel by 1995.    The major aim of the plant closure is "to create a capacity  for adequate earnings at zero growth" (Atsushi Muramatsu, then  vice president). Nissan has five complete-assembly plants  throughout Japan and, by reducing them to four plants,  productivity will change from 2.5 million cars to 2.25 million  cars annually. In order to be profitable with production of 2  million cars, capacity of 2.5 million production will become a  burden. That is the reason for the decision to close the Zama  plant.    The policy for the personnel cutback is based on a decisive  constraint on hiring and not supplementing natural retirements.  Simultaneously, it has also been decided to begin temporary  assignment of indirect personnel to the dealerships. When the  plan was announced, it was intended to lay off 5,000 workers "by  the end of FY95." However, due to the subsequent sharp rise in  the value of the yen, it was moved up by about a year, and  implementation is targeted toward the end of FY94. Nissan's  total employees reached 59,600 at its peak in March 1989 and, if  the cutback plan is enforced, they will total 42,000. The figure  of 42,000 will generally equal the level in 1970.    The hiring of new graduates next spring will also drop  considerably. Although the plan calls for hiring of 200 college  graduates--a 60-percent reduction from the number hired this  spring, the probability is that it will fall below 200. At the  outset, the hiring of 600 new high school graduates was  scheduled for the production sector, but it was decided by this  summer to cut the number by half to 300. Of course, the sharp  yen rise from the spring to this summer provided the backdrop  for the advancement of the cutback plan.    Nissan's restructuring policy is considered to be a typical  reduce and balance policy, but it is actually farther advanced.  The company's production figure for this fiscal year seems  likely to undercut the original estimate by 160,000 cars and  settle at 1.8 million cars. A production level of 1.8 million  cars will result in the lowest record in some 20 years. The aim  of the company's restructuring plan is to "secure profits even  with 2 million cars." However, due to the export slump caused by  the high yen, the actual production level already appears likely  to fall greatly below the original estimate of "2 million cars."    The high yen has resulted in throwing cold water also on the  earnings improvement measure based on bold restructuring. The  company is firming up a decision to sell about 60 billion yen of  its share holdings within this period, and this is based on the  forecast of a deficit resulting from two consecutive periods of  losses due to the high yen. Normally, the sale of shares as a  company's settlement measure is intended with repurchase  following the sale. However, it is likely to merely end in  selling to lessen the company's capital burden.    The company's interest-bearing liabilities exceed 1 trillion  yen, and employees at the Zama plant which approaches closure  say: "Depending on the situation, we may have to resign and look  for jobs elsewhere." The future of the restructuring still seems  unclear.  <H3>  Mazda: "Third Restructuring" Inevitable for Correction of  the Bubble Expansion </H3>   In September 1993, Mazda announced its forecast on the  expanded operating deficit for the March 1994 period, and also  revealed a new restructuring plan. Although the company had  announced a rebuilding measure in May 1993, it was forced to  reexamine the plan in view of the continuing recession and the  sharp rise of the yen.    The company had scheduled a cutback of 1,500 employees  during  the next three years, but it has decided to lay off 3,000  workers by the end of FY96 under the new plan. Although a halt  to the production line was not clear in May, the recent  announcement points to the closure of the third line (U3) in the  Ujina district of the parent company, which is a new mainstay  plant.    The breakdown of the rationalization of personnel includes  1,000 direct employees and 2,000 indirect employees. Among the  indirect employees, in addition to a drastic cut in hiring of  new graduates, temporary assignments to dealerships will be  increased from the present 200 to 1,000 employees. There will be  an additional 650 employees (annually) who will retire. Among  the direct employees, the policy is to cut by half the annual  hiring of about 600, apart from the retirees.    Forming the backdrop of the need for such "supplemental"  restructuring is the unexpected difficulty caused by the sharply  rising yen. At the outset, Mazda had estimated a rate of 112-113  yen to the dollar, but it actually climbed sharply to nearly 100  yen. In the settlement forecast announced in September, the  foreign exchange rate was adjusted to 105 yen to the dollar, and  the early forecast saw an expansion of the operating deficit  from 12 billion yen to 32 billion yen.    The company has a high export ratio of 60 percent, with its  clients concentrated heavily in Europe, centering in Germany.  However, because the recent high yen occurred not only against  the dollar, but also tended to rise sharply against the mark,  export profitability deteriorated and eventually suppressed  earnings.    Mazda's restructuring measure was already being questioned  at  the time of the announcement in May by those concerned as to  "whether it is adequate." The second restructuring measure was  predominantly interpreted as an inevitable step, but the view is  voiced by many that "perhaps even this is inadequate."    The reason is that sales policy and product policy were  based  on the rapid-growth bubble period, and are not able to respond  to zero growth. Mazda has followed an expansionist policy by  establishing a domestic five-channel sales system similar to  Toyota and Nissan, and by introducing a unique model in each of  the channels. However, the reality is that even Nissan faces  difficulty in maintaining five channels. During the past five  years, new models have been introduced successively in each of  the five channels, but their penetration of the general users  has been extremely insufficient, and the notification of car  names cannot be said to be thorough. While massive CM's  [expansion not given] are necessary for penetration among the  users, funds are limited. Also, huge funds are required to  narrow down the once-expanded commercial fronts. In view of this  situation, it is not strange for a third restructuring plan to  emerge.  <H3>  Isuzu: Resources Concentrated in the Truck Sector With  Withdrawal From Passenger Car Production </H3>   Isuzu Motor has decided to withdraw from the passenger car  sector as its ace card for management restructuring. Isuzu's  passenger cars consist of the Gemini, the Aska and the Piazza  models, with the Gemini playing a central role with an  overwhelming number of cars produced and sold. In an inherently  competitive class of autos for the masses, the Gemini was truly  a remarkable car with a unique character as its weapon for  survival. However, amid the post-bubble drop in overall demand,  its sales have nosedived, and it has become a burden on the  company's management.    For Isuzu, "how to deal with the passenger car sector" has  been a major operational challenge during the past several  years. The company fell into a deficit two years ago for the  first time in five years in its October 1991 settlement and,  even amid its restructuring, no clear direction was indicated  regarding the nonprofitability in the passenger car sector. The  company's number of passenger cars was 200,000 in 1985, but it  fell to 72,000 in 1992.    During this period, technological innovation on passenger  cars, including electronification made advances, and development  investment grew unprecedentedly. The inability to win in such  development competition and sales resulted in lowering its  competitiveness in the passenger car sector. However, even amid  the deficit settlements, no revival measures for the passenger  car sector were indicated, and voices of doubt were heard among  those concerned as to "what the company intended to do."    Ultimately, however, it was decided to discard the sector as  a nonprofitable sector and to aim for management reconstruction  under a production system with trucks as the commercial mainstay  vehicles. Many evaluate such a clearcut decision as "far better  than continuing the bloodletting endlessly." The reason is that  withdrawal from the passenger car race not merely has a negative  aspect, but also has various merits.    One positive aspect is that the limited management resources  can be concentrated in the truck sector. In the truck industry,  every company is desperately continuing research and development  in order to clear the medium- and long-term regulations on  diesel exhaust gases. Naturally, plenty of funds become  necessary. However, withdrawal from the passenger car sector is  expected to facilitate coping with exhaust emissions.    Also, passenger cars are directed toward the general  consumers who are the ultimate users and, despite the "hits and  misses," commercial vehicles such as trucks have mostly fixed  users. Therefore, if commerciality in the hardware aspect can be  ensured, it is difficult to fall into a broad decline. In other  words, it is deemed that, compared to passenger cars, management  plans for trucks can be easily formulated. The characteristic of  such products is of course an extremely important element for a  restructuring company like Isuzu which must follow a stabilized  schedule.    The market scale of trucks is smaller than for passenger  cars, and the profitability rate is not high. However, they have  merit as a potentially sound business with little fluctuation.  Although reducing the product lineup has its risks in a certain  sense, the risks are smaller than maintaining a front line that  drains the company's energies. It will probably become the final  gamble for Isuzu, the distinguished automaker.</p>

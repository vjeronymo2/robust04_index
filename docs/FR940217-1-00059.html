			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Of the six creeks providing recharge to Barton Springs, Barton  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Creek has received the most intense development. The TWC has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified nutrients, fecal coliform bacteria, sediment, oil, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grease in Barton Creek, originating from rangeland, golf course  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> runoff, highway construction, and highway runoff (Barbara Britton,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TWC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992). Increases in fecal coliform bacteria,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), turbidity, and algal growth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been documented along Barton Creek between Highway 71 and Loop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 360 and are primarily due to sewage effluent irrigation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction activities in this area (City of Austin 1991; Librach,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1990). Changes in the aquatic invertebrate community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> along this portion of Barton Creek have also been attributed to golf  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> course runoff (Librach,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1990) and insecticide use (Dr.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chris Durden, Texas Memorial Museum,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1991). These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported changes are significant because water quality at Barton  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Springs responds rapidly to changes in the quality of water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributed by Barton Creek. Groundwater originating from Barton  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Creek remains in the aquifer for short periods before discharging at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the springs. Thus, there is little time for dilution or chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breakdown of pollutants before discharging at Barton Springs (Slade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing land use in the recharge and contributing zones has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulted in recurring fecal-group bacteria contamination and high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> turbidity (a measure of suspended solids or sediment) at Barton  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Springs (Slade  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1986). Data suggest that bacteria and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> turbidity at Barton Springs increase significantly during storm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> events. Stormwater runoff has been identified as the major source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of fecal coliform pollution at Barton Springs (City of Austin 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The level of nitrates at Barton Springs has also increased slightly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from about 1.0 mg/l (measured as nitrate nitrogen) prior to 1955 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current level of about 1.5 mg/l (Slade  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1986). Increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nutrients may promote the growth of bacteria, algae, and nuisance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aquatic plants (Slade  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1986), which could reduce the dissolved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxygen available to the salamander. In Barton Springs Pool, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> routine cleaning procedure necessary to remove algal growth may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> itself adversely impact the salamander and its habitat (see further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion later in this section).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> High turbidity at Barton Springs has been attributed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction activity in the Barton Springs segment (Slade  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1986, City of Austin 1991). Sources of turbidity are believed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``primarily limited to 126 square miles [326 square kilometers] of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Barton Creek and immediately adjacent watersheds in the recharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zone'' (City of Austin 1991). Sediments have been observed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emanating directly from the spring outlets in Barton Springs Pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Doyle Mosier, LCRA; Debbie Dorsey, City of Austin Parks and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recreation Department; pers. comms., 1993). Potential problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from increased sediment loads include (1) reduction of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salamander's habitat by covering substrates on which salamanders,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their prey, and/or certain aquatic plants occur; (2) clogging of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salamander's gills, causing asphyxiation (Garton 1977), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smothering of eggs; (3) filling and blocking of underground conduits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restricting groundwater availability and movement; and (4) exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of aquatic life to certain heavy metals and other toxins that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readily bind to sediments. Contaminants that adsorb to the surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of sediments may be transported through the aquifer and later be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> released back into the water column.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aside from high levels of fecal-group bacteria and turbidity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately following storm events, the water quality at Barton  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Springs is considered to be very good (Slade  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1986, City of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Austin 1991). However, only about 3 to 4 percent of the recharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and contributing zones is currently developed (USGS 1992), and both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these areas are under increasing pressure from urbanization (City  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Austin 1988, Veenhuis and Slade 1990). The City of Austin has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected that the Austin metropolitan area will support a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population of about 1.9 million by the year 2020, up from 577,000 in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1982 (City of Austin Planning Department, in Veenhuis and Slade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990). Further development or urbanization in the recharge and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributing zones of the Barton Springs segment is likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase the chance of a major pollution event as well as chronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water quality decline in this area and thus increase the levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutants reaching Barton Creek, other creeks serving as recharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paths, and Barton Springs (see also discussion under Factor D). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USGS (1992) has stated that ``much development is projected for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source area of Barton Springs *&blank;*&blank;*. [Thus] changes in water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Barton Springs *&blank;*&blank;* [are] possible in the near future.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water quality is highly variable throughout the Barton Springs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> segment and waters flowing from Barton Springs represent a mixture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these waters, originating primarily from the six streams crossing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recharge zone. Although much development has occurred along  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barton Creek near Barton Springs, these waters are diluted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recharge waters from less developed watersheds, such as Onion Creek.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Little development has occurred along Onion Creek, which, although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> farthest from the springs, contributes about 34 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recharge waters (Slade  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1986). According to the Capital Area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Planning Council (CAPCO), Hays County experienced ``tremendous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growth'' in the 1980's and has the second highest growth rate in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10-county CAPCO region. Dripping Springs, which is located in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributing zone between Onion Creek and Barton Creek, ``will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely continue to experience a high rate of growth as development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continues along U.S. 290 from the Oak Hill area westward'' (CAPCO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990). As development across these watersheds increases, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability of the aquifer to dilute pollutants will continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease. This decreased ability will likely be further compounded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by increased pumping and/or drought conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

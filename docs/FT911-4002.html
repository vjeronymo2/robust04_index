			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company Profiles): Image change extracted cash from cashmere - Ballantyne ONE of the most famous names in Scottish knitwear. Ballantyne is based in the little town of Innerleithen, in a fold of the hills by the River Tweed in the Borders. For years it produced smart sporting attire under the name Ballantyne Sportswear. But two years ago its image and products were dramatically changed. 'Ballantyne Sportswear conjured up a picture of jogging suits and sneakers, despite its use of cashmere,' says managing director Mr George Peden. 'Ballantyne really should be about cashmere.' The company is now known as Ballantyne Cashmere and has a completely new corporate image, designed by the Mayfair design consultants Landor Associates. Mr Peden, who formerly ran Barrie - like Ballantyne, a knitwear subsidiary of the Edinburgh-based Dawson International - called in leading fashion designers including Alastair Blair and Oscar de la Renta to create a completely new line of cashmere clothes. The new range included sports jackets, dressing gowns and blazers, in contrast to the classic V-neck pullovers of the past. The new ranges, says Mr Peden, have been well received and he believes the company's image change has succeeded. Ballantyne has always exported a substantial amount of its turnover. 'We export about 85 per cent of what we make,' he says, while much of what the company sells in Britain is bought by overseas visitors. Turnover is now around Pounds 27m a year, compared with Pounds 25m two years ago. Mr Peden believes his company's Queen's Award is for a consistently high export performance, rather than a spurt in overseas sales. Ballantyne's change of strategy was, in part, a response to difficult times in the cashmere industry. In common with other knitwear companies, cashmere makers were affected by changing fashions as people opted for woven rather than knitted garments. The price of raw cashmere soared by about 50 per cent in two years as China, where most cashmere comes from, allowed individual farmers to market their own produce - but the quality of Chinese output became highly variable. The decision to upgrade the design of Ballantyne's products reflected the belief that if people were to pay high prices for cashmere, it needed to be very special. 'Textiles are still going through a difficult time but if we hadn't updated our lines and our image, it would have been very hard for us', says Mr Peden. An important part of his strategy has been further to differentiate the Ballantyne brand. Part of this has been done by creating dedicated Ballantyne shops: the first opened in London's Bond Street last April and new shops will open in Paris, New York and Tokyo. Ballantyne's biggest export market is Italy, followed by Switzerland, Japan, France, the US and Germany. Unlike many other Borders knitwear companies, Ballantyne has had no short-time working or redundancies in recent years, although the workforce has declined from 750 in 1989 to 670 today due to natural wastage under a productivity improvement programme. The bulk of the workforce is in an old-fashioned building at Innerleithen with the rest at Bonnyrigg near Edinburgh. Dawson International recently reached a new agreement with China which should led to stabilising the price and improving the quality of Chinese cashmere. Mr Peden says that knitwear is still going through difficult days. 'A lot of our sales are to tourists and many of them stopped flying because of the Gulf war,' he says, though he adds that the situation is beginning to pick up.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER CIA AGENT TO FACE TRIAL ON IRAN-CONTRA TAX CHARGES  </P> <P> A federal judge refused to dismiss tax charges brought against a former CIA  agent, saying that Iran-Contra independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has the  jurisdiction to try the case, officials said Friday.  </P> <P> As a result, the trial of Thomas G. Clines on the four-count indictment will  begin as scheduled on Sept. 4 in Baltimore, said Mary Belcher, spokeswoman for  Walsh's office.  </P> <P> Clines assisted the Nicaraguan Contra arms resupply network run by Richard V.  Secord and Albert A. Hakim and overseen by then-White House aide Oliver L.  North. He helped find a European arms dealer as a source of weapons, helped  arrange for shipping and lined up crews to transport the supplies to the  rebels.  </P> <P> Clines, accused of hiding arms sales profits from the government, was indicted  Feb. 22 on charges of under-reporting his income to the Internal Revenue  Service and failing to report foreign financial accounts to the Treasury  Department. If convicted on all counts, he could face a maximum of 21 years in  prison and $950,000 in fines.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Norman P. Ramsey in Baltimore rejected Clines' requests to  dismiss the charges and to suppress financial records obtained through the use  of a U.S.-Swiss treaty.  </P> <P> Clines' attorney, Paula Junghans, said the tax case was outside the Iran-Contra  prosecutor's jurisdiction because "Mr. Clines has not been charged with  committing any crime by virtue of his participation in the purchase, sale or  transfer of arms . . . nor has he been charged with any crime relating to . . .  support to the Contras."  </P> <P> But Walsh's office argued that "crimes involving the attempt to hide arms sale  profits" are within Walsh's purview. The independent counsel said Clines  "illegally misrepresented . . . on his tax returns the full amount of his arms  sales profits and that he illegally hid from the United States government the  existence of the foreign financial accounts.  </P></p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Highland bags 10% rise midway with help of Famous Grouse Highland Distilleries, the Scotch whisky producer, has bucked the trend of falling profits in the whisky industry with a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 23.4m in the six months to February and a 10 per cent dividend rise. Mr John Goodwin, chairman, said the rise in operating profit - up 2 per cent to Pounds 13.6m - was attributable to the performance of the Famous Grouse brand, which now provides some 45 per cent of group profit before tax. In the UK, Grouse volume was slightly down, but market share was maintained. Market share in Scotland dipped from 24 to 23 per cent, but rose from 11 to 12 per cent in England and Wales, leaving the UK share unchanged at 14 per cent. Highland said the UK price of Grouse was constant, while competitors' prices had fallen. Mr Goodwin said: 'We could easily increase our volume through promotional support and lower prices, but that would do a lot of damage. Our premium price position is of vital importance.' Exports of Famous Grouse, accounting for 40 per cent of the brand, were up 16 per cent by volume and 30 per cent by value. Mr Goodwin said that whereas three years ago exports accounted for only 20 per cent of the total and made no contribution to profit, they had moved steadily into profit since then. The combination of falling sales at home and rising sales abroad meant that overall volume had held steady. Sales of new whisky fillings were down 20 per cent. However, orders for calendar 1994 were up 9 per cent. Sales of mature malt whiskies were up, and volume sales of the Highland Park malt brand were up 23 per cent. Capacity utilisation at the group's distilleries was slightly better at just over 40 per cent. Mr Goodwin said it was difficult to see any change in the overall market in the course of 1994, although he expected a 'fairly modest' turnround in 1995. Interest receivable rose from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 3.2m, with the net cash position moving from a negative Pounds 2.8m to a positive Pounds 14.7m. Income from associates - mostly the related whisky company Robertson &amp; Baxter - was Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 5.8m), with much of the increase attributable to the first-time consolidation of the North British grain distillery. Earnings per share were up 9 per cent at 12.2p (11.2p). The interim dividend has been raised to 1.76p (1.6p).</p>

Early this morning, the six deputies were taken from the  Security Directorate to the Ankara State Security Court under  heavy security. After their files were studied, two judges  interrogated them.    Chief Prosecutor Nusret Demiral later said that Hatip Dicle,  DEP leader and Diyarbakir deputy, did not make a statement at  the Alternate Court, which subsequently ruled to arrest Hatip  Dicle, DEP Diyarbakir Deputy Leyla Zana, DEP Sirnak Deputy Orhan  Dogan, DEP Mus Deputy Sirri Sakik, DEP Mardin Deputy Ahmet Turk,  and independent Sirnak Deputy Mahmut Alinak.    The prosecutor is demanding that the deputies be tried for  violating Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code. The article in  question envisages the death sentence for treason, and for  crimes against the sovereignty and indivisible unity of the  state, country, and nation.</p>

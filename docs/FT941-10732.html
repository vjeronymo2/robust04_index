			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Observer: Adrenalin junkie The odd thing about Ian Martin's decision to get into bed with Wall Street deal-makers Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is that he's not making a clean break with Grand Metropolitan, where he has been chief wheeler-dealer for nearly a decade. Ever since he lost out to George Bull in the race to succeed Sir Allen Sheppard as chief executive, Martin has looked underemployed. He turned down the chairmanship of one Footsie company because it was not enough to keep 'his adrenalin running' and is now hoping to make a lot of money doing what he does best - sorting out underperforming businesses with the help of KKR's wealthy backers. However, he seems to have ruled out any involvement in the food and drink industry he knows so well because he remains a GrandMet employee. Martin is reluctant to be drawn on how long he will remain on the payroll, but hints it will be as long as Sir Allen Sheppard remains chairman. Surely Sir Allen cannot be worried that Martin might make a nuisance of himself by bidding for some of GrandMet's less flattering parts?</p>

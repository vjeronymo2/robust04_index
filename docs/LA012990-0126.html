			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> PASSENGER KILLED IN CAR ACCIDENT  </P> <P> A 20-year-old Buena Park man was killed Sunday when the car he was riding in  struck a van and then flipped several times, authorities said.  </P> <P> Julian Soto died at the scene when the impact threw him partially out the  passenger window and the car landed on top of him, said Sgt. Thomas Campbell of  the Los Angeles County sheriff's Norwalk station.  </P> <P> The driver, Jose Guadalupe Rodriguez, also 20 and of Buena Park, fell asleep at  the wheel and veered into the median of southbound Beach Boulevard, Campbell  said. The jolt caused him to wake up, and he reacted by steering sharply to the  right across two lanes.  </P> <P> The car clipped the rear of a southbound van. Both vehicles began spinning  uncontrollably and then flipped over several times, Campbell said.  </P> <P> Rodriguez was arrested by California Highway Patrol officers on suspicion of  drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter and was was being held at Orange  County Jail.  </P> <P> The driver of the van was taken to Friendly Hills Hospital in La Habra,  suffering back pain.  </P> <P> The 8:30 a.m. accident occurred in an unincorporated area bordering La Mirada  and Fullerton, Campbell said.  </P> <P> The CHP normally handles traffic accidents in unincorporated areas, but the  accident was initially thought to have occurred in La Mirada, which is under  the jurisdiction of the sheriff's Norwalk station, he explained.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on criminal activity and related judicial  actions in Cuba carried on Havana radio and television in  Spanish between 18 and 25 January.    Havana Cuba Vision at 0100 GMT on 18 January reports that in  what police are calling the "Caramel Case," two managers at  Coppelia Ice Cream Palace forced workers to reduce the amount of  the servings and were pilfering one of every two or three vats  of ice cream, which they sold on the black market for 300 pesos.  Workers who protested were fired. This pilfering resulted in the  center having to close early and serving only half its usual  12,000 customers a day. Steps have been taken to remedy the  situation, the result of highly deficient organization.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks in Spanish at 0100 GMT  on 22 January report that the National Revolutionary Police have  arrested seven people in Marianao, Havana, for illegal  acquisition of imported goods, i.e., 60,000 bars of soap  obtained through impersonation of representatives of two bogus  foreign enterprises. The soap was sold on the black market but  an official who refused a 100,000-peso bribe alerted  authorities. Marianao's Unified Vigilance and Protection System  also deserves praise for its role in the arrests. Reporter Jorge  Roco stresses that personal irresponsibility and faulty sale  procedures caused Cuba to lose money instead of profiting,  besides exacerbating the excess currency situation.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 24 January reports that nine  100- pound barrels of margarine oil were stolen from the Siboney  candy store in Playa Municipality by former worker Jose Miguel  Herrera Jimenez and Ricardo Manuel Ruiz Silva, a worker at the  National Geology Institute. During the course of the robbery,  Herrera murdered a night shift worker. An additional 17 people  have been arrested for aiding and abetting the crime. The oil,  officially worth a total of 300 pesos, was sold for 3,000 pesos  a barrel.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 25 January reports that a  Havana  court has tried two men for embezzlement at Bacuranao  Pasteurizing Plant, which lost over 20,000 pesos. The accused,  who have a prior criminal record, worked as port and  distribution chiefs. The investigation revealed that one man  received over 9,000 liters of milk to be sold in the black  market. A police investigator stressed that it is very difficult  to fight crime when those in charge of the people's resources  have criminal records and work in distribution.</p>

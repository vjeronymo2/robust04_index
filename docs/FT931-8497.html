			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Tough task for Hungarian minister THERE may never be an auspicious moment to become Hungarian finance minister but Mr Ivan Szabo is taking over at a particularly critical time. His appointment followed the surprise resignation of Mr Mihaly Kupa, a maverick technocrat who often clashed with other ministers. Mr Szabo, a 59-year-old former engineer and industry minister, inherits an economy bumping along the bottom after a long and deep recession. The collapse of domestic demand and trade with east European neighbours has caused gross domestic product to fall 18 per cent over the three years to 1992. The influx of Dollars 4.8bn in foreign investment since reforms began and the double-digit growth in exports to the European Community have not been enough to power the economy. Faint signs of a recovery in industrial output in the autumn, which had revived hope, have lost momentum. On the day Mr Szabo was named, unemployment figures climbed to a record 13.3 per cent. Also came the embarrassing announcement that inflation rose to an annual 25.9 per cent after a batch of Vat and price rises in January. Political pressure on the new finance minister will mount as elections in 1994 approach. The Hungarian Democratic Forum, the governing conservative party of prime minister Jozsef Antall, languishes around the 10 per cent mark in the opinion polls, blamed for falling living standards. Economic woes, and the public perception that former communists are making fortunes as entrepreneurs, have also boosted the populist far-right. The prime minister hopes that the moderate Mr Szabo will boost his wing of the party and position the Forum to take credit for the economic recovery forecast for later this year. There is however another awkward legacy facing the new finance minister. The International Monetary Fund is maintaining the freeze on a SDR1.14bn (Pounds 1.1bn) credit package until Hungary agrees to cut spending and reduce a budget deficit of Ft197bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in 1992, nearly triple the target level. The finance ministry changed hands the week after an IMF delegation left Budapest unconvinced of the government's commitment to curtail benefits such as family allowances, free health care and education. Mr Szabo moved quickly on his nomination to re-assure observers that fiscal policy would not fundamentally change under his stewardship - indeed that the government had to persist with unpopular measures - and that Hungary would continue to seek agreement with the IMF.</p>

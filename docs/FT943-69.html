			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance (1): Although the present global economic recovery appears to be well on course, it is impossible to look to the future with unqualified optimism. Worries, such as inflation and unemployment, still abound The good news is that the global economy is growing well. But except in the newly industrialising countries of east Asia, few people seem to feel it. Although world output this year is likely to grow faster than at any time since 1989, the recovery from the slow growth and recession of the early 1990s is fraught with uncertainty. Fast and far-reaching changes are everywhere - in international relations, domestic politics, economics and business - unsettling policymakers, entrepreneurs and employees in developed and developing countries alike. A year ago, few commentators in the industrialised world would have bet on there now being a robust upturn in the United States, a well-established recovery in the UK, a strong bounce back from recession in Germany and the first signs of Japan pulling out of its worst economic downturn since the second world war. Outside the industrialised world - defined as the 25 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - the overall picture is even better. A number of developing nations have emerged as the engines of global growth in this decade. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that the developing economies as a group should grow at about twice the rate of the industrialised countries this year and next. New economic powers are emerging that should give the world economy an added boost as it heads into the next millenium. Latin America, although not without problems, has largely pulled free of the debt crisis that made the 1980s that region's 'lost decade'. China may be struggling to control inflation and runaway growth. But it is likely future historians will declare that country's emergence as one of the world's economic power houses to be the economic event of this decade. Economically, the world still stands to reap some benefits from the end of the cold war. One consequence - peace and a democratically-elected government in South Africa - could, with luck and good judgment, open up new vistas of prosperity for that country and the continent as a whole. Events over the past 12 months have made it possible to think of peace and economic co-operation among the countries of the Middle East for the first time since the second world war. But it is impossible to look to the future with unqualified optimism. The collapse of communism has brought problems as well as promise. Worries abound. The present global upswing is proving anything but comfortable. Inflation is a case in point. It appears broadly under control, in spite of a surge in commodity prices. Subdued inflation holds out the hope that growth can be sustained. Yet financial markets are sceptical and thrown into turmoil at the slightest hint of rising prices. While 'tiger' economies such as Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan continue to attract foreign investment and climb up the league tables of international competitiveness, other developing countries continue to be plagued by corruption, famine and civil war. There is the still unresolved problem of unemployment - a tragedy for some 35m people in the industrial countries and countless millions elsewhere. For many in work, there is constant and unsettling change at the workplace as companies restructure and strive to become more efficient. This turmoil in the world of work reflects two forces over which governments and individuals have very little control: globalisation and technological change. The world is shrinking daily as the costs of computing power and telecommunications fall. The multimedia revolution, harnessing the computer, telephone and television, is generating new products and services such as the Internet, which may be the precursor of the much-trumpeted global information superhighways. Multimedia could prove to be as significant in the development of mankind as the harnessing of steam and the development of the railways in the 19th century or the exploitation and spread of electric power in the early years of this century. But new competitors are emerging at a bewildering speed to challenge established companies and ways of conducting business. In a world where knowledge is increasingly perceived as the key to prosperity, giant industrial and commercial corporations can quickly become dinosaurs. The decline of IBM, once a synonym for the world computer industry, is symptomatic of the acceleration of change. In today's world, problem industries are just as likely to be high-tech as they are to be smokestack. Symbolising and promoting the frenetic development of the global economy are the financial markets. The liberalisation of capital markets around the globe and the falling cost of telecommunications have greatly increased their turnover and volatility and their capacity to sway events. A few years ago, an article such as this would have focused almost immediately on the role of governments and economic policymakers as initiators of change. Today, policymakers are lucky if they can avoid being overwhelmed by events. Technological and geopolitical changes have turned many of them into bit players on the world economic stage. Take the case of Alan Greenspan, the powerful chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. True, he caught financial markets on the hop with his decision to nudge short-term US interest rates upwards by a quarter percentage point in February. But what was supposed to be a prudent, well-signalled pre-emptive move that would demonstrate that the US monetary authorities were well in control of the domestic economy had unforeseen consequences. It ushered in months of market instability as bond investors and marketmakers jostled to restructure their holdings with as little loss as possible. The upshot has been an upwards movement of long-term interest rates of far greater significance for the world economy than Mr Greenspan's initial and subsequent monetary tightenings. Because they process the many billions of dollars worth of investments flowing across national borders each day, the markets have become the police, judge and jury of the world economy - a worrying thought given that they tend to view events and policies through the distorting lenses of fear and greed. The collapse of communism - symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall five years ago - was hailed by many as marking the victory of free market liberalism. For Francis Fukuyama, a US academic, it even signified the end of history. Today we know better. Instead of ending history, the end of communism and the cold war merely opened a new chapter, giving rise to new tensions as well as new opportunities. This summer's migration of boat people from Cuba to the US in search of a better life was an example of the forces unleashed by the ending of the old balance of power. The trade dispute pursued with such zeal by the Clinton administration against Japan over Japan's supposedly excessive trade surplus shows how friends can fall out when the common enemy has disappeared. The end of the cold war may yet exacerbate rivalries between the established and newly-industrialing countries by adding a new dimension to the process of globalisation. Globalisation has been one of the more significant developments in the industrialised world over the past 15 years. Driven by the desire of companies to produce and sell goods and services in more markets, it has led to the spread of corporate operations across borders through international investment, trade and collaboration for purposes such as product development, production, sourcing and marketing. According to the OECD, globalisation has entailed 'a turbulent process of birth and death of firms, the rise and fall of whole sectors of activity and the re-allocation of production within, as well as between, regions and countries'. As many as one in 10 jobs a year have been destroyed by this process. But it has also created employment on a similar scale. It is because globalisation has so far taken place mainly within the group of industrialised countries that the destruction and creation of jobs on this scale has been socially and politically acceptable. According to this year's World Investment Report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), multinational companies employ nearly 10 per cent of paid non-farm jobs worldwide. But nearly a fifth of non-farm jobs in the industrialised countries are provided by multinationals. This may not be the case in the future. The fax machine, for example, already allows professionals in India to do routine architectural or audit work for clients in Britain at a fraction of the cost of UK-based companies. Prof Fritz Scharpf of Germany's Max Planck Institute has pointed out that the end of the Soviet Empire and the disappearance of the rival ideology to capitalism has made it safer for companies to invest in low-cost countries without fear of expropriation. Only a small number of developing states have so far emerged to challenge the industrialised economies. According to International Economy, a US magazine, Clinton administration officials have identified a 'big 10' particularly promising developing countries that are growing about twice as fast as the rest of the world. In about five years, South Korea, greater China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), Indonesia, India, South Africa, Turkey, Poland, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina will together account for about the same share of world imports as either Japan or the European Union, they believe. If true, that should be good news for the industrial countries. It should mean more opportunities for their exporters. But, relative to the rest of the world, such changes would reinforce the slow but steady diminution of the industrialised countries' economic strength that has underpinned their status and influence: and this despite their undisputed domination of certain key areas of production such as computers, aircraft and - still - automobiles. IMF figures show that growth in the developing countries (excluding former communist states making the difficult transition to market-based economies) has only once fallen below 4 per cent in the past eight years. Growth in the industrial world has only once risen above 4 per cent in the same period. In June, the OECD upgraded its growth forecasts for its member countries to 2.6 per cent this year and 2.9 per cent in 1995. Although such growth would be a marked improvement on performance in the early 1990s, it will be insufficient on its own to deal with the OECD countries' economic problems and especially with unemployment. At the OECD's annual ministerial meeting in June and at July's Group of Seven summit in Naples, the industrialised countries resolved to embrace innovation and adapt. They agreed to reject protection, encourage enterprise, pursue deregulation and make their labour markets more flexible. As evidence of their determination to tackle unemployment, the OECD countries this summer adopted a report with about 60 specific recommendations to expand job opportunities. These will be used by OECD member states to fashion tailor-made policy programmes with the help of the Paris-based organisation. But the last decade of the 20th century is proving a difficult time for democratically-elected governments in the developed world. No class or group of workers is escaping the effects of structural change. The swollen budget deficits that are the legacy of recession and too many years of rewarding political support with social largesse remain to be tackled. In managing change, ministers and officials have to take unpopular decisions. For that reason, governments often agree to change and then have difficulties implementing it. One example is the Uruguay Round of trade liberalising measures which, after having been signed with great fanfare in Marrakesh, Morocco, in April, still awaits full ratification. For years the developed countries have promised to cut farm subsidies, recognising correctly that they hurt their own taxpayers and consumers and rob poorer developing nations of a comparative advantage. Yet in its latest annual review of farm policies and trade, the OECD estimated that combined transfers to agriculture from consumers and tax payers in its member countries fell by less than 1 per cent to just over USDollars 335bn last year compared with 1992. However, it would be wrong to paint too gloomy a picture of the industrialised world's prospects. The sharp drop of 376,000 in Britain's unemployment since December 1992 could be a sign that labour market reforms, along the lines advocated by the OECD, can be effective. The fall in UK joblessness has been unusually early in the cycle. Germany's stronger than expected upturn this year has confounded those critics who argued that its industries were inflexible and its working practices sclerotic. For the past 30 years, the US has shown itself to be an engine of job creation with the result that unemployment stands at about 6 per cent compared with around 11 per cent in the European Union. But the US surge in employment has not been matched by growth in wages. Between 1978 and 1993 average US real wages stagnated. As the US labour market shows, the economy of the industrialised world is a complex mix of good and bad. The same is true of the developing world where conditions vary greatly from country to country. There are the successes of the rapidly growing east Asian and Latin American economies which have embraced market-based economic policies - often more enthusiastically than the big industrialised economies. On the other hand, resource-rich Russia and the Ukraine are still struggling with the cultural, political and administrative problems of moving from command economy systems to market-based economies. The tribal slaughter in Rwanda, the boat people trying to leave Cuba and Haiti and the conflicts that have brought untold misery in former Soviet republics such as Georgia and Tajikistan are just examples from the many parts of the world which lack the most basic conditions for creating economic well being. Such regional crises are a reminder of how far we are from a 'new world order'. There are also plenty of global problems that governments have been slow to address. This month's UN conference on population and development in Cairo was the first to tackle the subject for a decade. Economic policymakers have yet to consider an international approach to migration although economic factors are usually the cause of people moving from their homes. Often, it seems, the first response of the industrialised countries to the complexities of the global economy has been regional. It was easier for the US administration to negotiate and win Congressional approval for the North American Free Trade Area with Mexico and Canada than it has been to negotiate and obtain backing for the Uruguay Round. Hopes of regional integration continue to cast their spell in the European Union. The 12 months of calm in the European exchange rate mechanism, following its crises of 1992 and 1993 have revived the prospects for Economic and Monetary Union. Nonetheless, in this, the 50th anniversary year of the Bretton Woods agreements setting up the IMF and World Bank, policymakers have realised that they cannot ignore the interdepence of their countries or the international institutions that helped shape the world economy since the second world war. The leaders of the G7 countries have agreed that next year's economic summit in Halifax, Nova Scotia, should review the institutions of global co-operation as a first step towards making global economic management fit better with the realities of the post-cold war world. This, said President Clinton, was 'a commitment to discuss in Halifax what we want the world to look like 20 years from now'. This is a potentially bold move. It may lead to nothing given the strength of national interests. But in view of the doubts surrounding the present economic recovery, world leaders would stand charged with gross neglect if they did not strive to improve the outlook for growth by strengthening economic co-operation.</p>

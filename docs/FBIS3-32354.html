			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Salvadoran Foreign Ministry in no way  authorized the departure of Major Ismael Lopez. It was only  after he had left that the U.S. Embassy informed the Ministry  that Lopez had departed but without specifying how, Salvadoran  Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria told LA PRENSA GRAFICA.  In addition, Salaverria said the U.S. Embassy has been asked to  explain how Lopez left the country.    Salaverria pointed out that the Foreign Ministry has no  jurisdiction over who leaves the country and that this is the  Immigration Department's duty. He said that, according to  international law, Maj. Lopez, who allegedly killed bodyguard  Crescencio Diaz, enjoys diplomatic immunity and that therefore  he will be tried in the United States. "Maj. Lopez' diplomatic  immunity precludes his being interrogated in El Salvador,"  Salaverria said. He also said that the Foreign Ministry had  checked Lopez' diplomatic immunity in the Ministry's files.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Synod told of probe over funds ISSUES concerning the management of the Church of England's funds would be 'examined closely by the Church Commissioners and others concerned,' Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury, said yesterday, Alan Pike writes. 'Over the last few days we have heard criticism of the Church Commissioners' stewardship of resources,' Dr Carey told the church's general synod meeting in York. 'Serious points have been made about the management of funds and about judgments on investments. I want to assure synod that these will be examined closely by the Church Commissioners and others concerned. We haven't lost Pounds 500m.' Dr Carey who, as archbishop of Canterbury, is chairman of the commissioners, added that as someone coming recently to the life of the commissioners he admired their conscientious work.</p>

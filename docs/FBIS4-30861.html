			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jaroslav Kmenta: "The Experts Reject Neutrality"] </F>   [Text] Prague -- Army experts believe that the security of  the state can only be guaranteed by membership in the North  Atlantic Alliance and by incorporation into the Western European  Union [WEU].    The analysis conducted by the Institute for International  Relations -- which will form the basis for the government's  security policy concept -- absolutely discounts the possibility  of the republic becoming a neutral country or of it relying  solely on its own forces and resources for its defense. The  experts also reject involvement in a defensive system made up  only of Central European states.    The advantage of joining just the WEU is, according to  diplomats, the possibility of reacting to situations that  concern only Europe. Despite this, they give priority to  incorporation into NATO, because it -- as opposed to the WEU --  offers a defense system with a functioning military structure.    According to the experts, neutrality is no longer  significant. "Following the cessation of the bipolar world,  there is no one here to be neutral against," said one of the  military officials. Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec has  previously rejected neutrality. He described it as a dangerous  snare. Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has said the same thing. He  rejected neutrality as a hollow concept belonging to the realm  of third ways leading nowhere.    It is apparent from the aforementioned document -- for which  various institutions are now drafting comments -- that the  republic does not consider anyone to be an enemy a priori and  that it has no territorial or other political claims against any  state.</p>

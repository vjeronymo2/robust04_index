			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Bananas Decisions by the Brussels competition authorities routinely influence stock markets. Maastricht deliberations apart, however, the EC will seldom have a better chance to move share prices than over the next two months when reform of the EC's banana import regime moves to the top of the Council of Ministers' agenda. Geest and Fyffes - UK importers with combined market capitalisations of Pounds 450m - will be significant beneficiaries if the present restrictive proposals by the Commission are adopted; Chiquita, Dole and Del Monte, multinationals currently engaged in a fierce price war in Germany and other continental markets, will be big losers if, as many assume, their rearguard action for free trade fails to win the day. There is no single EC market at the moment in bananas. Each member state has its own arrangements, though there are broadly three different systems: protected markets( France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK) primarily supplied by former colonies; freer markets in which banana imports from non-preferred sources are subject to a 20 per cent tariff but no quantitative limits; and Germany, where all bananas enter duty-free. The idea as put forward by Brussels is to secure continued, unhindered access for the guaranteed growers - the likes of the Windward Islands and Guadeloupe - while setting an overall EC quota of 2m tonnes for those now supplying the freer markets, predominantly Latin American (or so-called dollar) producers. Vested interests on both sides are powerful, but the protectionists look to be winning the battle. They have exploited Brussels' knee-jerk anti American instincts - depicting a free market dominated by US multinationals - and convinced policymakers that without a helping hand some of the world's poorest economies will collapse. Geest has played a leading part in the lobbying, and its decision to sink an estimated Pounds 100m into new Costa Rica banana capacity means that the level of its future profits is resting heavily on the outcome. As the proposal stands, besides the safeguarding of its Caribbean supplies the company will be allowed a good crack at importing 'dollar' bananas. Considerable arm twisting may yet be required to convince the liberal majority to go along with the Commission's plans, while Britain's position in the protectionist camp may prove an embarrassment during its EC presidency and at such a critical stage in the Uruguay Round.</p>

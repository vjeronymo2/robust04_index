			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Srinivas Laxman: "Guarded Optimism Greets </F> Ordinance"]    [Text] Bombay, January 30--The repeal of the Air  Corporations Act, 1963, is being viewed with guarded optimism  because aviation executives fear that it could be merely a  cosmetic change.    Certainly, there has been a demand among top echelons of the  nation's aviation industry that the Air Corporations Act be  scrapped as it had ceased to have any relevance.    But, the question being asked today is will its removal mean  that Indian civil aviation will really begin to take to the  skies?    According to them, for the industry to take off in a big way  the outlook of the large militant aviation work force has to  undergo a big change. Otherwise, scrapping of the Act will  simply have no meaning at all.    Though Air-India and Indian Airlines executives described  Saturday night's Presidential promulgation as a new chapter in  the history of Indian civil aviation, the unions predictably  have opposed it.    "We are opposing it," was the response of the general  secretary of the Air Corporations Employees Union (ACEU), Mr R.  Ramanathan.    Mr Ramanathan said that when the matter was before  Parliament  there was absolutely no need for the Presidential proclamation.    He also said that there was a public interest litigation  before the Calcutta high court challenging the validity of the  licenses given to air taxi operators. The matter before the  Calcutta high court would now have no meaning on account of the  Presidential Ordinance, he regretted.    While most of the aviation unions have been against the Act  being scrapped for fear that their jobs would be at stake, only  the Indian Pilots' Guild (IPG), the representative body of  Air-India pilots, has adopted a broad-minded view on this  controversial issue.    Said the IPG president, Captain V.M. Mayadev: "With the  economic scenario in the country undergoing a change, I feel  reforms have to be accepted."    It may be recalled that it was only this organisation--the  IPG--which stated with some amount of reservations of course,  that it would not oppose changes when its members deposed before  the Mahajan Commission in New Delhi last year.    The Act's repeal undoubtedly marks a major setback for the  unions who have all along tried to retain it. They organised  strikes, lunch-hour demonstrations and walk-outs, all of which  proved futile.    To convince them that under the liberalised economic  scenario, the Act had no place proved a herculean task. Now the  unions have lost their battle.    It is felt that they should gracefully accept defeat and  tell  their members the need to accept reforms in their own interest.  The message is that from now on they have to think big and not  be bogged down by narrow personal interests. Otherwise the  Act's repeal will have no meaning.    The unions have really nothing to fear because when the  process of disinvestment begins they too would be given a share.  Which means that they too would have a say in the functioning of  both airlines and thus their interests would be fully protected.    Right now, the two new companies Air-India Limited and  Indian  Airlines Limited--whose offices are registered in New Delhi will  be cent per cent government-owned. [sentence as printed]  Functionally, therefore, one cannot expect any significant  changes at the moment. For the changes to start, the process of  disinvestment would have to be initiated in the next few months.    As a prelude to the Presidential ordinance, the Air-India  and  Indian Airlines boards were reconstituted a fortnight ago. Some  of the new A-I board members are, apart from the chairman and  managing director, Mr Yogesh Deveshwar, Mr P.K. Banerjee, Mr  Brijesh Kumar, Mr Vijay Madan and Mr R. Krishnamurthy.    Speaking to TOINS this morning, Mr Deveshwar said that he  was  happy that the Act had been repealed and he "looked forward to a  new era in civil aviation."    "I would welcome this change," said Mr M.R. Pai, who has  been  championing the cause of air passengers. But, he added that it  should have been done through an Act passed through Parliament  rather than a Presidential Ordinance.    "At the moment the scenario in Indian Airlines was such that  it was run 50 per cent by politics, 25 per cent by bureaucracy,  there was 15 per cent staff militancy and only 10 per cent  professionalism," Mr Pai regretted.    The repeal of the Act has at last legitimised the operations  of the air taxi operators.    From last night following the promulgation of the ordinance,  they ceased to be "air taxi operators," but full-fledged  "airlines." Among the benefits they can now enjoy is that they  would be able to publish their schedules. "We now enjoy a legal  status and we are all very happy," said the managing director of  East West Airlines, Mr T.A. Wahid.    With the operations of these new private airlines having a  legal sanctity, the much-publicised "Open Skies" policy would  have some significance from now on.    On the other hand there is understandable apprehension in  some quarters whether the `Open Skies' policy means a sellout of  our skies to foreign multinational air carriers.    Aviation experts feel that while any form of liberalisation  is welcome, the country's aviation industry should not be taken  over by foreign airlines.</p>

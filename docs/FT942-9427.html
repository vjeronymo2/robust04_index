			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: British Airways British Airways appears to be the main winner of the battle for Orly. As part of yesterday's deal, Britain agreed to study whether access to Heathrow by a number of small French airlines could be improved. But this looks more like a face-saving device for the French than a serious concession by the British. The main point is that France has accepted that BA and its fellow UK airlines, Air UK and British Midland, will have access to Paris's strategically placed southern airport by the end of June at the latest. Even so, the fuss kicked up by Paris before it gave way shows just how hard it will be to pry open the French aviation market. Surrender in this battle does not mean further liberalisation will come easily. The French government is so keen to protect the nearly bankrupt Air France that it can be expected to fight a rearguard action to frustrate BA's further expansion. The next flashpoints are likely to concern Air France's Fr20bn recapitalisation and plans by TAT, BA's French affiliate, to fly from Orly to Toulouse and Marseille. The Fr20bn recapitalisation is probably illegal under the Treaty of Rome as it constitutes state aid but the European Commission is expected to let it through - albeit with conditions - because of France's political clout. Similarly, although the Commission has ordered France to open up flights from Orly to Toulouse and Marseille, Paris is appealing to the European Court of Justice. BA's shareholders have further bumpy rides to endure before they can enjoy the fruits of the airline's Gallic investments.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Tudjman carries fight to UK CROATIA'S president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, last night launched a bitter attack against the neighbouring republic of Serbia, and sections of the federal army, accusing both of bringing Yugoslavia to the verge of disintegration and civil war. He also criticised western governments, in particular Britain, for supporting what he termed, 'the Yugoslav state, which is historically ill-conceived.' Mr Tudjman, who made his remarks last night at the conservative Centre for Policy Studies during a 12-hour trip to London, said Croatia would continue to uphold its independence and would defend itself against any intervention. 'I did not call the people (of Croatia) to rise up against the army. But if the army attacked the Croatian people, then they should defend themselves,' Mr Tudjman explained, countering allegations that he encouraged Croats to protect the republic against the army. A soldier was killed in the Croatian port of Split when thousands of angry Croat demonstrators stormed the army headquarters on Monday. Denying that the Croats has been responsible for that incident, Mr Tudjman said: 'They were provoked by Serbs.' Mr Tudjman, who was sworn in as president last year following the victory of the right-wing Croatian Democratic Union Party in free elections, singled out Mr Blagole Adzic, the army's chief of staff, as the bete noire of democrats. The army, he said, was divided between those senior officers who perceived the role of the military as the people's army of Yugoslavia, and those, like General Adzic, who wanted to maintain 'Serbian hegemony.' 'Two-thirds of the army officers are now Serb,' said Mr Tudjman. Yet despite his sharp criticism, he still believed 'the army will not intervene.' However, his unremitting criticism of the Serbs - whom he described as representing 'another world and another civilisation from the Croats' - implied that any dialogue between Yugoslavia's two largest ethnic groups and republics, was impossible to imagine. Moreover, he said the division of Yugoslavia between the western, and Catholic, republics of Slovenia and Croatia which had been ruled by the Habsburgs, and the eastern, Orthodox and Moslem republics of Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro, which had been under Turkish domination, heightened the sense of the artificiality of 'Yugoslav statehood.'

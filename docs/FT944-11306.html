			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Airbus moves to strengthen links with Chinese market Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft manufacturing consortium, will invest Dollars 25m (Pounds 15.2m) in a new flight crew training centre in Beijing to strengthen its presence in the fast-growing Chinese market. Mr Jean Pierson, managing director of Airbus Industrie, said the agreement signed at the weekend with the China Aviation Supplies Corporation (CASC) was 'only the first step' in a series of such measures planned for the next few years. Airbus Industrie's push follows similar moves by its main competitors, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, both of which have announced steps recently to bolster their position in China. McDonnell Douglas signed an agreement last Friday for the sale of 40 MD-80s and MD-90s to Chinese airlines. Half of those aircraft will be manufactured in China, with US-supplied parts. The Airbus chief executive said the company would also establish a maintenance centre in Beijing to help the Chinese acquire advanced engineering and aircraft servicing skills. Work on the flight training centre is expected to be completed by early 1996. It will be run as a joint venture between CASC and Airbus and will offer similar facilities to those established by the Euro-consortium in Toulouse and Miami. Mr Pierson, who met China's president Jiang Zemin at the weekend, said the consortium would use its 'muscle' with European governments to argue Beijing's case for entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He said Europe should 'spearhead' China's accession to the Gatt. The McDonnell Douglas deal puts greater pressure on Boeing and Airbus to further 'sweeten' deals negotiated with China on the sale of new aircraft. Boeing, in its efforts to preserve its leading position in the Chinese market, signed an agreement in August for the manufacture of the aft section of its 737 twin-engine aircraft in China. The deal is estimated to be worth about Dollars 600m. Airbus, which has sold 35 wide-bodied aircraft to China since 1985, indicated it would compete more aggressively with US manufacturers to increase its share of what is expected to be a vast market for new aircraft in China over the next 15 years. Mr Pierson said Airbus aimed to capture half of new sales compared with the one-third share it had secured in the past five years. Airbus expects China to buy 620 aircraft in the next 15 years at a cost of about Dollars 30bn. That compares with a forecast by Chase Manhattan bank that China's passenger fleet of 350 aircraft will increase fivefold by 2010, requiring the purchase of 1,200 new aircraft worth Dollars 90bn. Boeing predicts sales of 800 aircraft at a cost of Dollars 40bn. China turns up pressure in Gatt talks, Page 6 China survey, Separate section</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shephard hints at 'workfare' options MRS GILLIAN SHEPHARD, the employment secretary, yesterday indicated that she was actively considering extending compulsory obligations on the long-term unemployed. Mrs Shephard was giving evidence - for the third time - to the Commons Select Committee on Employment. The employment secretary was questioned closely by the committee on whether the government intended to introduce 'workfare'. Mrs Shephard said it depended on what was meant by the term workfare. She said she rejected the idea of a monolithic scheme to be extended to all the three million unemployed. 'We are looking at a range of options that will build on what is already in the system,' she said, adding that some of the changes could be profound. It is understood that should the government introduce new compulsory measures for either work experience or training they would be targeted at 18 to 24-year-olds. A plan to continue to pay benefit for a year to anyone out of work for five years after they found a job paying more than Pounds 50 a week was proposed yesterday by Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the social security committee.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Vital statistics stir up controversy: A criticism of competitive tendering for the government's data collection When the Central Statistical Office held an office party recently, its Australian director Mr Bill McLennan was presented with a song. 'Oh market testing, oh market testing - who'll come a-market testing with me?' the staff sang to the tune of 'Waltzing Matilda', with a heavy undertone of irony. Mr McLennan was so amused that he hung the script in his office. But as the CSO becomes the latest Whitehall department to introduce competitive tendering, the issue is adding a note of controversy to its operations. Though the opportunity to compete for data collection has been welcomed by many market research groups, the manner in which the tenders are being organised has provoked criticism that the civil service is acting too conservatively. Meanwhile, the prospect of using private contractors for data collection has provoked concern in the CSO itself about how to guarantee future data security and continuity. These issues are becoming increasingly pertinent, not least because the government-funded CSO is seeking, under Mr McLennan, to introduce a stronger business focus and extend its role beyond simply supplying statistics to the government. Later this month the CSO will announce the results of a tender for the collection of the retail prices index data, the first piece of data collection to be market tested. The data is at present collected by several hundred staff from the Department of Employment, who report about 150,000 prices each month from 180 locations. The department is bidding for the contract, worth about Pounds 1m, along with more than a dozen private-sector bidders. Taylor Nelson AGB, the largest UK market research group, has indicated it is competing, after successfully winning a separate contract to publish and market the CSO's data. Meanwhile the British Market Research Bureau, another large market research group, has also been involved in the process, says Mr Simon Orston, its marketing development director. But though groups such as Taylor Nelson AGB say they welcome market testing, the tender has also generated criticism. Mr Robert Worcester, chairman of MORI, said that although about half MORI's turnover came from government work, his group was not bidding for the contract. 'They are looking for mechanics rather than expertise. What they want to do is use what we consider to be inadequate sampling and keep it business as usual,' he said. Consequently, he believes that if the Department of Employment does win the bid, this 'will be as a result of structure of the brief'. He added: 'The prime minister's speech the other day was full of good intentions (about market testing). The sad thing is that it is being sabotaged by middle-ranking civil servants.' Meanwhile another group, Mintel, said it was 'disappointed' because it was not invited to submit a bid - though it stressed that it would 'love to tender' in future. Officials at the CSO strongly rejected these criticisms, arguing that the tender was advertised and that the CSO was open to reforming the system of data collection. It was considering, they said, the use of hand-held computers to record prices, instead of clipboards. But they admitted that the need to ensure statistical continuity in the series makes it difficult to envisage dramatic change. 'In something as crucial as (awarding the tender for) the RPI we have to be very careful not only about the price but also (about) issues such as security,' a senior official said. And although under current legislation private groups can take part in non-compulsory surveys such as RPI, they are barred from doing compulsory surveys, such as import and export and other business inquiries. However, a deregulation bill that is passing through parliament could change this. Consequently, the CSO plans to introduce competitive tendering for part of its business inquiries next year, and to extend it later. These inquiries are currently conducted by more than 100 CSO staff at Newport, Gwent. These changes would still leave the analysis of the data to the CSO. Nevertheless, the proposals have provoked unease among some government statisticians. A business survey conducted recently by the CSO found that 20 per cent of companies would not supply compulsory information to a private consultancy, partly because of fears about business confidentiality. Introducing private contractors might mean a decline in the response rate, officials say - a problem that could be exacerbated if the contract changes hands every few years. Senior officials at the CSO said they were exploring ways to tackle this problem. But in the meantime it seems that if the market testing proposals do go ahead, the songs at the CSO's next office party may be rather more controversial.</p>

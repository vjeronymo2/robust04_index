			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Ala' al-Mashharawi from Gaza] </F>   [Text] Over 30 officers and soldiers of the Palestine  Liberation Army [PLA] began a hunger strike in the Canada Camp,  located within the borders of the Egyptian town of Rafah,  yesterday to protest the Israeli authorities' decision to ban  them from crossing into the Gaza Strip.    First Lieutenant Husayn Abu-Sulaymah, an official at the  Khan  Yunus post and who managed to enter the Gaza Strip 10 days ago,  said that the Israeli military authorities have prevented them  from entering on the pretext that their names contain errors and  discrepancies, although his brother is one of them.    It is worth noting that the families of the officers and  soldiers can only send greetings and regards to them across the  barbed wire dividing the city of Rafah. The relatives of the  officers and soldiers complained to the National Authority  officials and the Palestinian security men about this step. The  officials have pledged to solve this problem as soon as possible.    The officers and soldiers addressed an appeal to the PLO  leadership to help them cross the Egyptian-Palestinian borders  and reach the homeland.</p>

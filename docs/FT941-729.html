			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Listening in to a divided community: The BBC in Ulster faces the task of maintaining fairness and balance where bad judgment can have serious consequences A phone-in argument over coloured icing on an anniversary cake might not appear to be the stuff of serious radio broadcasting. But in Northern Ireland the BBC knows only too well that trivia can be deadly serious. With a few minutes left of his popular Talk Back programme, presenter Mr David Dunseith is up to his headphones in controversy. A televised report of a party thrown for Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, has shown the cake apparently iced in the Irish Republic's colours. A member of the province's grievously divided community is not amused and sounds off on air. Before long, Mr Mark Durkan, chairman of the SDLP, is on the line to stress that any likeness is unintentional: the SDLP has never used or abused any nation's national flag. In this part of the United Kingdom sensitivities are as acute as political opinions are diverse. Extremes tend to dominate and it often appears that only those who shout loudest get heard. In the middle stands BBC Northern Ireland, recent winner of a Royal Television Society award for serving the province and charged under charter with providing a daily menu of public service broadcasting. One of its prime tasks is to maintain fairness and balance in a society where bad judgment can have potentially grave consequences. 'There is an obvious difficulty in being called the British Broadcasting Corporation in a place like this,' said Mr Robin Walsh, the affable but tough Londonderry-born controller of BBC Northern Ireland. 'One side of the community thinks you should be waving a particular flag. The other suspects you are part of the establishment and not to be trusted.' Mr Walsh's assessment is easily confirmed. At the recent annual conference of Sinn Fein, the BBC was vilified for peddling 'loyalist propaganda'. On the other hand, Mr Jim Wilson, general secretary of the Ulster Unionists, claims many ordinary working-class Protestants believe even the surnames of some local BBC broadcasters lend weight to suspicions of pro-Catholic bias. He also thinks, along with BBC Ulster newsroom 'old boy' Mr Martyn Lewis, that there is 'too much bad news'. A senior RUC man puts it differently: 'I sometimes wonder if there is just too much news broadcasting here altogether. Constant regurgitation is not helpful.' Mr Walsh stresses the corporation's commitment to cover all aspects of life in the province, but believes the thirst for news in Ulster is unquenchable. He accepts, however, that there is a tendency to inflate or overstate its impact and that hyperbole can get the better of any journalist. But he rejects the old notion 'that if everybody moans you must be getting it about right. I think that is trite. If you scratch the surface of the rhetoric I think you find most people believe we are trying to be fair in a tough situation.' Mr Durkan of the SDLP accepts the point, recognising that 'in the cut and thrust of daily deadlines things are not always going to be calibrated too precisely'. 'The thing I am most proud of, 'said Mr Walsh, 'is the manner in which people at the sharp end of highly emotive stories manage to leave their tribal and political affiliations at home.' There is plenty of extra guidance on how to avoid the terminological traps which await newcomers to Ulster politics. Never, say BBC guidelines, refer to IRA 'volunteers' - who knows why they joined? - and avoid offending everyone by referring to the 'mainland'. Mr Walsh's journalists sometimes take much more serious risks: one reporter endured a terrifying, isolated rendezvous with hooded men to hear stories which Mr Walsh believes ultimately led to the Stevens inquiry into alleged collusion between police and loyalist paramilitaries. His staff have been caught in bomb blasts, borne the brunt of angry public reaction to atrocities and occasionally faced direct intimidation from the paramilitaries. There is no shortage of recruits, however, to work in the BBC's only 24-hour newsroom outside London. Against the trend, the BBC locally has invested to beef up its specialist political and security teams. The organisation faces tough competition in the local marketplace. Live at Six on UTV, for example, mounts a highly effective effort to win early evening news viewers and strives hard to inject a more intimate, Ulster flavour into its coverage. All broadcasters in the province share one common problem - the continuing ban on broadcasting the words of representatives of Sinn Fein and extremist paramilitary organisations. Mr Keith Baker, head of news and current affairs, calls it a 'preposterous straitjacket' which creates particular problems for live programmes. But Mr Sam Beattie, chairman of the Police Federation in the province, is angry that broadcasters such as the BBC employ actors to help thwart legislation intended to keep people off the airwaves. He says their actions are naive and help the terrorists' cause. Mr Baker says of the daily editorial decisions which have to be made because of the restrictions: 'We haven't got it wrong yet and I'm not sure what would happen if we did: I suppose an angry phone call from the heritage department.' The Talk Back lines are standing by.</p>

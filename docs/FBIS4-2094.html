			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yvonne Van Der Heijden: "Arbed Subsidiary Paul </F> Wurth To Modernize Chinese Anshan Steelworks"]    [Excerpt] Beijing -- Plans by the Luxembourg-based  engineering company Paul Wurth to help modernize the largest and  oldest iron and steel plant in China have entered their final  stage now that the Luxembourg Government has given its guarantee  for the project, which is worth billions. The last remaining  loose ends will be tied up this month. Paul Wurth is one of the  last remaining European companies to specialize in blast furnace  technology. The Luxembourg-based Arbed subsidiary will supply  the Anshan iron and steel plant in the northeastern province of  Liaoning with the technology it requires to grow into a modern,  efficient steel company. The aim of the modernization is to  boost annual steel production at the mammoth Chinese company,  which employs 200,000 people, to 10 million tonnes. Last year,  the Chinese company produced 7 million tonnes.    The visit to China last month by an economic mission from  Luxembourg, presided over by Luxembourg's Crown Prince Henri,  and comprising representatives from approximately 20 companies,  led by Luxembourg Minister for Economic Affairs Robert Goebbels,  gave the contract a push in the right direction. Minister  Goebbels was given provisional approval for the project by Gan  Ziyu [name as published], vice-chairman of the State Planning  Committee. "Luxembourg has already undertaken a large number of  projects in China, but this one would be the most comprehensive  undertaken to date," said the (Luxembourg) minister,  highlighting the significance of the plans of Arbed subsidiary  Paul Wurth.  <H5>  Technology </H5>   The technological modernization of China's largest and  oldest  steel plant fits in with the government's policy of boosting  steel production significantly by the year 2000. It intends to  do this by restructuring the ownership situation of state  companies or importing high-quality technology. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> SCHOOL OFFICIAL QUITS, CRITICIZES POLICIES  </P> <P> John Perry, assistant superintendent for support services for the Orange  Unified School District, resigned Thursday, but not before criticizing school  board policies and urging the district to aspire "to the greatness it once  enjoyed."  </P> <P> Before Perry made his brief statement before the board, board President Jeff  Holstien thanked him for his two years of service to the district.  </P> <P> "You may want to rescind that commendation," Perry said. "I have a few things  to say."  </P> <P> Perry criticized the district for allowing "union demands" to take priority  over student programs and warned board members that "immediate steps" should be  taken on a retirement benefits plan that threatens to bankrupt the district.  </P> <P> Recent independent studies on district finances showed that a retirement  package guaranteeing lifetime medical coverage could bankrupt the district  within five years. The study showed the board had increased class size to fund  the high cost of health benefits.  </P> <P> "Stop the political deal-making," said Perry in a final recommendation, "and  operate the Orange Unified School District like the $100-million business it is  -- the business of educating the future citizens of this community."  </P> <P> Board members avoided looking at Perry during the presentation. Holstien said  later the criticism had been expected.  </P> <P> Perry's resignation becomes effective July 1, ending a 20-year career as an  Orange County school administrator. No replacement has been named. Perry said  he was leaving the district to take a job in the private sector. MARY HELEN  BERG  </P></p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / A thirst for expansion: Nestle is awaiting Brussels' decision on its takeover of Perrier, which is crucial to its growth strategy From their headquarters in the Swiss lakeside town of Vevey, managers of Nestle, the world's largest food company, look out on a placid picture-postcard view disturbed only by the passing of an occasional paddle steamer. But inside the building, the atmosphere is tense with anticipation. In the next month, the European Commission will decide whether Nestle may complete its FFr15.46bn (Pounds 1.58bn) takeover of Perrier, the French mineral water group acquired after a hard-fought battle with the Italian Agnelli family. The decision is central to Nestle's plans to become at a stroke the world's leading mineral water supplier - it is already the biggest producer of dairy products, chocolate and soluble coffee - and to its ambitions to raise profitability to new levels in the 1990s. 'We feel we must break out of this limitation which has seemed like a sound barrier in the food industry - the idea that a 5 per cent net margin on sales is really very good,' says Mr Reto Dominiconi, finance director and chief architect of the Perrier deal. He thinks 6 per cent is achievable. Perrier, whose profits have been depressed since a benzene scare two years ago, could fit the bill nicely. Industry analysts estimate that, by rationalising Perrier and beefing up its marketing, Nestle could earn operating margins of 20 per cent on mineral water, twice the return on its existing businesses. However, Brussels says the deal could give Nestle and BSN, France's largest food company, a duopoly of the French mineral water market. This is the first time EC merger watchdogs have objected to a deal on duopoly grounds, and Nestle - which is counting on takeovers to fuel much of its growth - fears the case will set a restrictive precedent. Says Mr Domeniconi: 'If they upheld the duopoly position, it would be a very major hurdle to many future acquisitions,' particularly hostile ones. Whatever the outcome of the case, Nestle will remain determined to pursue worldwide expansion by any route it can. Mr Helmut Maucher, chairman, says he sees more growth opportunities in food than at any time in his career. By 2000 he aims to double last year's sales of SFr50.5bn (Pounds 19.3bn), the sixth largest of any publicly quoted European company. Since the German-born Mr Maucher became chief executive in 1981, he has transformed Nestle from a sluggish and sprawling multinational into an aggressive global player by injecting a more decisive management style, impatience for results and a streak of shrewd opportunism. Long a highly acquisitive company, Nestle spent about SFr20bn in the 1980s on takeovers, notably of Carnation in the US and Rowntree in Britain. In the past five years, it has invested on average SFr2bn annually to restructure operations in the US and Europe and expand in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. These moves are now paying off. In the US, Nestle increased sales last year by 5 per cent in a stagnant grocery market, while its European operations, some of which lost money in the 1980s, all traded profitably. Rowntree has flourished, increasing profits and market share. Though traditionally averse to alliances, the Swiss company recently formed two important joint ventures. One, with General Mills of the US, is challenging Kellogg's worldwide leadership in breakfast cereals, and the other, with Coca-Cola, is in canned coffee and tea. In the past year, Nestle has radically reshaped its management structure by grouping activities into strategic business units, which marry geographic and product responsibilities. The aims are faster decisions, more coherent strategy and improved co-ordination of the company's far-flung operations in more than 100 countries. Next year, Mr Ramon Masip, Spanish head of Nestle's European operations, will become chief operating officer, freeing the 64-year-old Mr Maucher to focus more on broad strategy. Mr Maucher, who enjoys personal authority rare in a company of Nestle's size, is already scouting for fresh acquisitions, particularly in the US, where he believes the takeover market may be livelier than in Europe. Nestle's horizons are not limited to food and drink. In the 1970s, pessimism about food manufacturing led it to buy Alcon, a US pharmaceuticals company, and to acquire indirectly 27 per cent of l'Oreal of France, the world's biggest cosmetics manufacturer. An agreement gives Nestle first refusal on the rest of L'Oreal after the death of Mrs Liliane Bettencourt, the French company's largest shareholder. The agreement expires in 1994, and Nestle's exercise of its pre-emptive rights would require French government approval. But Mr Maucher already talks openly of eventually taking full control. Although Nestle claims it can find 'synergies' with Alcon and L'Oreal, Mr Maucher admits these investments stem as much from financial as industrial logic: 'Nestle could live without L'Oreal. It was a fantastic investment . . . why not have a second big egg in a company basket?' He also insists that Nestle's dominant business will remain food manufacturing, and is focusing much attention on developing countries, where he expects future growth to outstrip the mature industrialised markets which provide four-fifths of Nestle's sales. Nestle's role in the third world remains a touchy issue. It has operated there since late last century, and its manufacturing and distribution network is rivalled only by Unilever. But the Swiss company is still haunted by a controversy from the 1970s, when it was accused of promoting baby food sales by urging mothers to abandon breast-feeding. Nonetheless, it believes economic reform and free-market policies have lessened developing countries' hostility to multinationals - and its drive to capture new markets there is moving into high gear. In Latin America, it plans to spend SFr2bn this decade after freezing new investment in the 1980s. It recently entered the ice-cream market in China, where it is also negotiating several other ventures, and is building a network of plants in south-east Asian countries which have agreed to cut tariffs on its products by 90 per cent. At Mr Maucher's insistence, the company is developing a range of 'popularly positioned products' (PPP) which it can produce cheaply in developing countries using local raw materials such as soya. The project will test the success of a recent shake-up of Nestle's research operations. Although these are among the biggest in the food industry, the company has long been accused of being slow to innovate. Some critics argue that its last real world-beater was soluble coffee in 1938. Executives respond that continuous updating and adaptation of existing products pays bigger dividends than searching for blockbuster breakthroughs. However, they also admit that house-cleaning was long overdue at its research laboratories, which had lost touch with the needs of the business. But for all its confident expansionism, Nestle's future growth will depend heavily on maintaining the success of established businesses such as Nescafe. Here, it faces three main challenges: Coffee supplies: although Nestle has benefited from the steep fall in world prices, it is increasingly concerned that production cuts will trigger a sharp price rebound. It is lobbying, so far with little success, for a new international coffee agreement which would stabilise prices. The rise of retailer power: Nestle fears its formidable marketing clout is being eroded as the European grocery trade concentrates into fewer big supermarket groups, which increasingly promote their 'private-label' products in competition with those of branded manufacturers. Mr Peter Brabeck, Nestle's chief marketing strategist, says the product range it sells through large supermarkets is narrowing as they tighten the screw on manufacturer brands. The squeeze, he says, has been made worse by a decline in the effectiveness of mass-media advertising, traditionally the branded manufacturers' main means of communicating with consumers. Mr Brabeck plans to experiment with new distribution channels and marketing methods, such as buyers' clubs and loyalty bonuses. But some colleagues think action by EC competition authorities may be the only long-term check on retailers' growing power. Uneven margins: Nestle earns huge profits and cash from chocolate and soluble coffee. But margins are far less impressive on products such as pet food, yoghurt and ice cream, where Nestle is either not dominant or competes in highly fragmented markets. Mr Maucher says it is hard to find new products which can match Nescafe's profitability. Mr Domeniconi concedes that weaker operations may eventually have to be eliminated or strengthened through acquisition. But Mr Masip says the company can afford to carry them for some time, although he declines to say which are considered 'strategic' long-term businesses: 'I don't think we have a very clear idea ourselves, because this is a moving target.' With annual cash flow of more than SFr4bn and a triple-A credit rating, Nestle has ample resources for further takeovers. Indeed, it has sometimes been accused of buying its way out of mistakes by making high-priced acquisitions, such as the Pounds 2.6bn takeover of Rowntree in 1988, launched after the Swiss company had allowed its own share of the UK chocolate market to slide. Nestle has long relied on issuing equity to fund takeovers and investment, which has kept its balance sheet strong but limited earnings growth. Now it aims to limit cash calls in an effort to boost its price/earnings ratio, so it can use its shares to pay for takeovers without diluting earnings. More than half of Nestle's shares are owned by foreign investors, whom it has diligently courted since the late 1980s by liberalising its share register and disclosing more information. However, voting-right restrictions still protect it against takeover. But in opening up to foreign investors, is Nestle not worried about falling prey to the short-term preoccupations of Anglo-Saxon institutions? Mr Maucher sounds unperturbed. 'I think a lot of those investors will have a portfolio of solid growth security in Nestle shares, and a portfolio of more speculative shares,' he says. 'They cannot keep everything in one basket.'</p>

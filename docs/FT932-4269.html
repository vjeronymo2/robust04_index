			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Defence cuts hold back south-west's recovery DEFENCE CUTS are having a more damaging impact on the south-west of England than anywhere else in the UK and are likely to lead to a slower recovery from the recession, according to a survey of 331 companies in the region. Half of the companies - representing nearly a third of the region's gross domestic product - said they received some defence-related orders. And 28 per cent reported that defence cuts had been significant in limiting their performance. The survey, published yesterday, was produced jointly by the Confederation of British Industry south-western region, accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and the University of the West of England. Over a third of the businesses that supplied goods and services to the defence industry said they needed aid for investment and to develop new markets. Mr Chris Curtis, the CBI's regional director, called for assistance from the European regional development fund. 'The impact of defence cuts in the south-west is akin to the effect on south Wales of the rundown of the coal and steel industries,' he said. Mr Chris Tillett, associate director of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'It came as no surprise that defence cuts were a key concern to south-west business. What is striking, though, was the spread and depth of exposure of south-west firms, and the scale of the knock-on impact.' Dr Derek Braddon, the university's research director in defence economics, said the survey confirmed the worst fears about the scale of job losses and economic shockwaves caused by defence cuts. Already, about 25,000 jobs in the region had been lost in consequence. A forecast two years ago that 40,000 would go by the end of the decade was probably now an underestimate. He said that if Devonport dockyard at Plymouth lost a pending nuclear submarine refitting contract to Rosyth in Scotland, it would be 'a very big disaster' for the south-west. The report finds that overall job prospects in the region are unlikely to improve substantially in the foreseeable future, with 40 per cent of large companies expecting to shed more staff. Even with European aid, growth in employment would be slow. 'Without (aid),the prospects for growth in employment opportunity give rise to considerable concern.' Positioned for Recovery?

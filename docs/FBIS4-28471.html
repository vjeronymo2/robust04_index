			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 10 June Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The NEW YORK TIMES recently reported that Japan is  taking a negative attitude toward UN economic sanctions against  the DPRK (North Korea) over its alleged nuclear weapons  development.    Commenting on this, a top Foreign Ministry official stated  on  9 June that, the report "does not correctly describe the stance  of the Japanese Government." He stressed the Japanese  Government is positively taking part in all international  negotiations to persuade North Korea to accept inspections by  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), including  trilateral talks with the ROK and the United States.</p>

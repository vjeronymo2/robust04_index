			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Nadir hits setback in Polly battle MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, yesterday suffered a blow to his stated intention of regaining control of Polly Peck International companies. A court in the Isle of Man dismissed an appeal claiming that control of an important holding company had been passed to Mr Nadir, the former head of PPI. The move means that administrators to PPI are a step closer to recovering some of the group's assets in Turkey. Mr Mentes Aziz and Mr Fahri Tunalier, directors of Voyager, a subsidiary of PPI based in the Isle of Man, were appealing yesterday against a Manx court ruling made last year. In November the court ruled that a transfer of shares to Mr Nadir from Voyager for Pounds 8m in October 1990 was null and void. The meeting at which the share transfer was agreed had been improperly constituted because one of the company's British directors had not been told about it, the court had decided. Voyager had held the shares in AN Graphics, a Turkish printing and publishing company which the administrators from accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand say is also the beneficial owner of stakes in Vestel, Meyna, Unipac and Askan, PPI's most significant businesses in Turkey. Coopers, however, still faces legal difficulties in asserting its ownership. It said last night that a legal battle was continuing in Turkey over a previous court ruling there that the shares could not be re-registered in the administrators' names until Mr Nadir had been repaid. But Coopers said there was no evidence that the Pounds 8m had ever been received from Mr Nadir in exchange for the AN Graphics shares. Mr David Doyle, Manx advocate for Mr Aziz and Mr Tunalier, told yesterday's appeal court in the Isle of Man that the differences between the administrators and his clients had been settled by agreement. Following the agreement he had filed a motion with the court on June 29 seeking dismissal of the appeal, he said. The appeal deemsters (the judges) accordingly dismissed the appeal and, as requested, made no order as to costs.</p>

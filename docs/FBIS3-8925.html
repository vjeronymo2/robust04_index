			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "Domestic News" column: The </F> Ministry Knows About the Visit From the Press"]    [Text] Prague--The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not  believe that the eventual visit by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to the  Czech Republic, "if it is meant seriously," could favorably  contribute to the development of Czech-Russian relations. This  is said in the ministry statement that was provided yesterday by  the director of its Press Department, Marek Skolil. He added  that the Ministry only learned about Zhirinovskiy's intention to  visit the Czech Republic from the press. According to earlier  comments by the Legal and Consular Section of the Czech Foreign  Ministry, Zhirinovskiy's visit cannot be prevented. He is a  regularly elected deputy of the Russian State Duma, which gives  him a legal right to the diplomatic passport of the Russian  Federation. Not even the newly drafted visa-free travel  agreement between the Czech Republic and the Russian Federation  will change anything on the status of the holders of diplomatic  passports.    According to the Prague Lawyer Firm of Tomas Hofmann, LL.B.,  Zhirinovskiy can come to the Czech Republic without an  invitation. Should he violate any law here, however, he can be  prosecuted like any other person who violates the legally  protected interests of the Czech Republic.</p>

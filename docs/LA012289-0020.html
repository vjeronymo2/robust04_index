			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: QUIBBLES &amp; BITS  </P> <P> Touchstone publicity calls "Bank Job" (due this spring) the directorial debut  of "Stakeout" writer Jim Kouf. Maybe they forgot Kouf directed "Miracles," a  1984 Orion film with Tom Conti and Terri Garr that never even got a national  release?  </P> <P> . . . Producer Michael Shamberg in American Film on distributors who turned  down the chance to finance "A Fish Called Wanda": "Dino De Laurentiis passed  because he thought it wasn't funny, and that's why he's out of business."  </P> <P> . . . Stereotypes, anyone? A casting call for a Carl's Jr. commercial --  involving a meeting of U.N. delegates -- called for Ruskies "with heavy  eyebrows" and "swarthy" Turks. Oh, and Mideast-types dressed as sheiks.  </P></p>

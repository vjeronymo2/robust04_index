			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Arts: The Bolshoy at its best - Andrew Clark admires the company's performance in Lucerne GIANT tone, powerful voices, larger-than-life performances: that sums up the Bolshoy Opera, whose visit to Lucerne this month was the undisputed high point of the festival. It was an extraordinary meeting of opposites - the extravagant Bolshoy style and the undemonstrative orderliness of this neat Swiss city. Even without the visual enhancement of staged productions, the Bolshoy concerts were full of drama and roof-raising sound, more attuned to the company's big Moscow home than Lucerne's modest Kunsthaus. Here was a different tradition - not just well-preserved, but bristling with vitality and excitement. Since the Gorbachev reforms, the Bolshoy has been overshadowed in western eyes by the Kirov, thanks to the St Petersburg company's growing links with Britain's Royal Opera, its recent recordings and the independent reputation established by its artists. The Bolshoy has always seemed the more monolithic institution, known less for personalities than politics and spectacle. It made its British debut in Glasgow and Edinburgh three years ago, but the visit was dogged by technical problems. Lacking a big theatre, Lucerne dispensed with the old-fashioned splendour of the Bolshoy's stagings, and made do with concert performances of Rakhmaninov's Aleko, Tchaikovsky's Iolanta and Yevgeny Onegin. What impressed was not so much the quality of individual singers or instrumental sections, but the overall excellence. These were company performances through-and-through, conducted with no-nonsense authority and balletic energy by the Bolshoy's music director, Alexander Lazarev. The sheer unanimity of ensemble and size of tone were breathtaking. Equally striking was the arrival of a new, younger generation of solo singers: no ageing, spreading sopranos or wobbly basses here. The singers looked their parts, Pavel Chernykh's handsome Onegin as much as Vladimir Matorin's formidably bearded gypsy father in Aleko. They also coloured and projected the words as only Russians can in their native tongue, blending their voices and reactions in the manner of a seasoned ensemble. And these were without exception big voices, part of an historic national tradition, selected for their ability to penetrate the furthest corners of the Bolshoy Theatre. Nowhere else will you find voices of such amplitude today. Pride of place went to Maria Gavrilova, the unflamboyant Semfira in Aleko and dignified Tatyana in Onegin, a classic Russian lirico-spinto soprano with bright, forward tone. Her virile tenor partner in Aleko was Oleg Kulko; in Onegin the sweet-voiced Lensky was Arkady Mishenkin. All the leading baritones, including Nicolai Reshelniak's Aleko, sang with more thrust than warmth; Yuri Vedenyev had the best opportunity of all in the Duke of Burgundy's aria in Iolanta, bringing out its dramatic fervour without a trace of self-indulgence. Irina Bikulova may have lacked the ideal vocal purity for the blind princess Iolanta, but her duet with Vladimir Bogachev's impassioned Vaudemont was suitably open-hearted: these Russian singers are not afraid to express strong emotions. And among the excellent comprimarios, there was a golden-haired, golden-voiced young bass, Maxim Mikhailov, who is clearly destined for greater things. Aleko, a one-act graduation piece drawn from a narrative poem by Pushkin and premiered at the Bolshoy in 1893, benefited least from the concert setting: its episodic musical character really needs the stage colour of the gypsy setting, and it proved a pale companion-piece for Rakhmaninov's Second Symphony. Iolanta, Tchaikovsky's last, shortest and most benign opera, offered less scope for the imagination than Onegin, in which the musical drama easily compensated for the concert setting. The spontaneous standing ovation which the normally sedate Lucerne audience accorded the Onegin cast was fully deserved. Change has come slowly and steadily to the Bolshoy since the fall of communism. The ease with which talented younger singers can rise to the top is one of the more obvious developments. Another is the drop in political interference. According to Vitaly Fomin, the company's commercial director, the Bolshoy is now self-governing and receives its state subsidy direct from the Ministry of Finance, amounting to 70 per cent of the budget. Another five per cent comes from private sponsors - wealthy Russian individuals who have revived the pre-1917 tradition of supporting the arts without expecting something in return. The Bolshoy is also learning to sell itself in the market place. It has signed a deal with Britain's National Video Corporation for films of The Maid of Orleans, A Life for the Tsar and Mlada. It has entered a co-production arrangement with Genoa for Prince Igor, one of two new opera stagings to be shown in Moscow in the coming season (the other is May Night). The touring schedule has increased: the Bolshoy Ballet is currently in Japan; and the orchestra - which has already toured Germany and Switzerland this year, visits Britain this month and the US in October and November. But old habits die hard. The payroll is as big as ever: the Bolshoy still has well over 2500 employees, including a social welfare programme that embraces a kindergarten, hospital and Black Sea health resort. The number of performing artists alone runs to 1000, including more than 70 principal singers. All are salaried staff. Although soloists are given leave for guest contracts in the West, no-one has left the company since the fall of communism - in striking comparison to the Kirov. Such is the proud sense of company identity. The downside is that singers feel no obligation to give a minimum number of performances. 'We hope to settle this problem in the coming season, so that artists know their repertoire-plan in advance, and can organise their foreign work around it' says Fomin. 'But we have no intention of reducing the number of staff. We don't have unnecessary fat, and we appreciate the work of each person in the theatre. This is their home.' The Bolshoy Orchestra, conducted by Alexander Lazarev, plays in 14 British cities over the coming month, including Glasgow tonight, Birmingham (Sept 21/22), London's Barbican Centre (27) and Cardiff (Sept 30 and Oct 4). It also tours the US from Oct 23 to Nov 17.</p>

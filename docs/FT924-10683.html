			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: DG Durham suspended on bid talks The Stock Exchange yesterday suspended dealings in DG Durham, the insurance broker, after the company announced that it was in discussions with a potential buyer. The USM-quoted shares were suspended at 4p, compared to a 1992 high of 11p, giving the company a market capitalisation of Pounds 800,000. 'The company has entered discussions which may lead to an offer being made for the shares of the company and/or to a subscription into its major operating subsidiaries.' Durham reported that pre-tax losses came to Pounds 220,000 in the six months ending June 30 1991. This compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 765,000 in 1990. At the time it said the downturn was due partially to difficult trading conditions in the travel insurance business, in which it is a market leader. Its Lloyd's broking subsidiary was sold earlier this year. A further announcement accompanied by preliminary results for the period to March 31 1992 will be made 'as soon as possible'.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN DRINKING WINE AT ORSO, DO AS THE ROMANS  </P> <P> Is this someone's idea of a joke? Where did this idea come from?  </P> <P> "It's the way they do it in Italy," I have been told, on three occasions, when  restaurants have tried to foist off tiny little water glasses with no stems as  tradition.  </P> <P> Baloney. Fine restaurants in Italy serve wine in real, honest-to-God stemware.  </P> <P> So dining in Orso the other night was another setback to the truth. "It's the  way they do it in Italy," we heard again as the glassware brought to our table  revealed itself to be squat, open-mouth little bowls better suited for finger  washing or for sipping Cognac "neat" after dinner.  </P> <P> But not for wine. And certainly not for wine that needs to be swirled to get  full enjoyment.  </P> <P> But the folks at Orso know better. Moreover, they know that in Italy, the wine  bottles are uncorked and left for you to pour. So that's the way it works at  Orso, too. Isn't that cute? Waiter approaches with wine, shows you label to  approve, and after you've nodded, he pulls the cork, plops the bottle down and  disappears.  </P> <P> What happens if the wine is corked or so badly stored that you want to reject  it? I suppose you wave at your waiter as he whizzes past to serve William  Devane his pizzetta. (Fortunately, our wine was not spoiled.)  </P> <P> The problem with this kind of non-service is its price. At the few Italian  dining spots where I have experienced the water-glass/no-service regime, I have  also paid next to nothing for my meal. These were quite literally roadside  cafes where the wine is $2 a liter.  </P> <P> At Orso, the price of the wine is roughly three times wholesale, or twice  retail. That, I contend, is simply too high for a non-wine-glass, non-service  restaurant.  </P> <P> The list itself, almost all Italian, isn't bad. Some of the better buys in  white wines include 1985 Gavi Villa Scolca at $22; 1987 Antinori Galestro at  $14, and a Frescobaldi Chianti (1985 Castello di Nipozzano) at $19. These are  good wines for the money.  </P> <P> Three red wines worth trying are 1985 Chianti Classico Castello di Cacchiano  ($20); 1986 Bruno Giacosa Barbera D'Alba ($21), and 1986 Luigi Einaudi Nebbiolo  ($20).  </P> <P> But other wines are overpriced, such as the lovely 1987 Blange, an Arneis from  Bruno Ceretto. This spicy and floral wine is $29 here, $15 on most store  shelves. Also, to order the 1978 Lungarotti Rubesco Riserva ($45) and have it  poured into a glass you can't swirl  </P> <P> is a waste of a good aroma.  </P> <P> To state that the prices here are too high for the glassware and service may  seem unfair. Certainly I'm not comparing Orso to some roadside diner outside of  Milan. The food is far better here, but it is annoying to be paying these  prices for such "traditional" service.  </P> <P> The way things are going, some day soon I expect to enter a restaurant, order a  bottle of wine and have the waiter bring it with no glassware at all. He will  tell me that I am supposed to slug it straight from the bottle because, "Hey,  the Romans never used glassware."  </P></p>

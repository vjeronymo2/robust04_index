			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: Office gossip, how the power brokers work and play - Santa Raymond, a practising architect and interior designer, looks at the offices that three movers and shakers have created / Lord Young LORD YOUNG spends much of his working life talking to people in his office in Cable &amp; Wireless's headquarters in Theobald's Road, London. The restoration of this 1950s building by architects Austin-Smith Lord is a model of how to convert an old building into something both memorable and technologically advanced. The architects have succeeded in providing a building which is discreetly opulent but still workmanlike. With only 3 metres between each floor, introducing services and information technology required extensive drilling through beams and a cat's cradle of structural stiffening. The building has sophisticated networks (and fibre-optic cabling) throughout. There are an internal video phone system, E-mail, and three video conferencing rooms. Exchange rooms in the basement keep the place in touch with the company's world-wide telecommunications interests. Lord Young sees his office as an 'environment which relaxes; it does not stand up and hit you.' As his 80-year-old mother exclaimed, it is 'an office with a sofa]' In fact there are two sofas, both covered in aquamarine leather. Young is a tidy, 'clean desk' person, keeping action papers in front of him until they are dealt with and passed on to his secretary next door. 'Papers on the desk are my conscience until I get rid of them.' He does not believe in desks, with drawers where things get put away and forgotten, and in the past has operated without one altogether. Here he has a table, the only problem being that computer cabling forms an unfortunate 'fifth leg'. Young is becoming minimalist - 'individual objects look good' - and dislikes clutter. The few objects displayed include a statuette from the Solomon Islands, a present, to 'ward off enemies and keep away evil.' Two fine painting by Ben Johnson, with their infinite perspective, provide a valuable feeling of depth to the space. 'They expand the horizon and might almost have been painted for the room.' There are photographs of grandchildren, and next door, in the boardroom, an array of cartoons published during his time in government. A red dispatch box on a side table is also a reminder of that time. It is a light room with windows on two walls, double glazed, and with venetian blinds to control glare and to mask an unattractive roofscape. The curtains have a geometric design and contrast with the pale aquamarine walls. Low voltage spots and lamps illuminate the room at night, and though Young would have preferred indirect lighting with dimmers, he finds the system 'all right.' This is a living room in the fullest sense of the word, in which he spends time working: the 'sort of office where you might have a CD player, except that I would listen to music and not work.' It is a modern and functional living room although very different from his homes, both of which are furnished traditionally. He believes the office should be a contrast: that a traditionally furnished office can imply a lack of efficiency, and would be particularly unsuitable for someone operating in his technological world.</p>

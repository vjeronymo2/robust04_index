			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kiril Vulchev] </F>   [Excerpts] Sofia, May 18 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben  Berov submitted structural and personnel changes of his cabinet  to parliament. He did it when taking the vote; the MP's decided  that the first item on today's agenda would be the debate on  last Wednesday's no-confidence vote motion of the parliamentary  Union of Democratic Forces (SDS). The SDS motivation for the  no-confidence vote is "the prime minister's inability to  organize and direct the activities of the government." This is  the sixth no-confidence vote tabled by the parliamentary SDS so  far. [passage omitted]    Following the opening of the debate on the no-confidence  vote, the Prime Minister surprisingly introduced the intended  cabinet changes. He nominated two deputy prime ministers. If  approved by parliament, Assoc. Prof. Rumen Gechev, an economist,  will be a deputy prime minister without portfolio coordinating  the structural adjustment of the country's real economy, helping  in the implementation of the government's general economic  policy, acting as a coordinator for the PHARE [Economic and  Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] Programme and  supervising the utilization of loans for the investments they  are designed for, as well as the allocations of the State Fund  for Reconstruction and Development.    Kiril Tsochev is Prof. Berov's nominee as a deputy prime  minister who will supervise Bulgaria's balance of finances in  connection with the foreign debt deals and the fluctuation of  prices and the lev's exchange rate. This deputy prime minister  will have to work for attracting foreign investments and promote  the government's relations with private business. Mr. Tsochev  will also be the minister of trade. When reporters asked the  MP's who Mr. Tsochev is, nobody seemed to know anything about  him; the prime minister was heard saying in the parliamentary  lobbies that Mr. Tsochev had not been promoted by the BSP  [Bulgarian Socialist Party].    The prime minister asked the MP's to accept Valentin  Karabashev's resignation as minister of trade he filed on April  28. According to Prof. Berov, he and Mr. Karabashev have had  differences over the variant of privatization to be implemented  in Bulgaria since last spring.    The prime minister declared himself to be for the  elimination  of committees because the Constitution adopted in 1991 does not  provide for such institutions. Prof. Berov proposed to set up  two new ministries instead -- of energy and of communications,  and promised to reorganize another three committees without  setting up new ministries to replace them. He nominated Nikita  Shervashidze, so far chairman of the Power Engineering  Committee, as minister of energy, and Krustyu Mirski as minister  of communications, specifying the latter was an expert in this  field.    Prof. Berov proposed to dismiss Minister of Justice Petur  Kornazhev and replace him by NSD [New Alliance for Democracy] MP  Gospodin Atanasov.    If parliament approves the proposed changes, Prof. Berov's  new cabinet will have 19 instead of 17 members, and four  government agencies instead of three.    If his proposals are accepted next week, the prime minister  would like a framework agreement between the government and the  parliamentary forces or the individual MP's supporting it that  will guarantee the adoption of the bankruptcy and the scheme of  composition legislation as well as a bill amending the  Privatization Act by the end of June at the latest. If the  agreement is not signed, the cabinet is going to resign. The  resignation will spoil the foreign debt deal, the mass  privatization project will fail and Bulgaria's economic  development will be seriously troubled, Prof. Berov told the  MP's.    While Prof. Berov was introducing the cabinet changes, the  DPS [Rights and Freedoms Movement] MP's walked out of the  parliamentary hall. Sherife Mustafa of the DPS told BTA that  the DPS MP's were utterly surprised by the personnel changes  which Prime Minister Berov had not discussed with the  parliamentary DPS. According to Mrs. Mustafa, the nomination of  Mr. Gechev as a deputy prime minister is unacceptable for the  DPS because of his BSP affiliation. Holding a joint meeting  later on, the DPS, the NSD and the group of independent MP's  assessed the proposed changes as renunciation of the original  government formula.    The DPS and NSD parliamentary groups came out with a joint  declaration stating they would not vote for Prof. Berov's  cabinet changes. In their opinion, Prof. Berov's are political  appointees rather than experts as was the original formula of  the government. The new formula is actually a coalition  government with the BSP prominently represented in it.    By submitting his project for structural and personnel  cabinet changes at a time when a procedure for debating a  no-confidence vote has already been opened Prime Minister Lyuben  Berov, succumbing to pressure by the BSP, violated the  Constitution, Petya Shopova of the Civil Alliance for the  Republic (GOR), a left-of-centre formation, said after a meeting  of the GOR and DPS parliamentary leaderships.    BSP leader Zhan Videnov said that most of Prof. Berov's  nominees were entirely new for him. The BSP will discuss its  attitude to the submitted cabinet changes at tomorrow's plenum  of the party leadership and the leaders of its parliamentary  group.    Asked if he considers his resignation as a possible option,  the prime minister said he would go if parliament voted no  confidence in him. The no-confidence motion will be put to the  vote after 1800 hours tomorrow because under the Constitution,  24 hours should elapse between the debates and the voting  procedure.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Retreating gold price approaches crunch point THE GOLD price continued to retreat on the London bullion market, reaching fresh seven-year lows of Dollars 326.50 a troy ounce and Dollars 326.10 at yesterday's morning and afternoon fixings. The London close of Dollars 326.05 an ounce marked a fall of Dollars 3.90 so far this week. On the New York Commodity Exchange the active April contract had recovered from a low of Dollars 325.80 to move back above Dollars 326 a troy ounce in late trading. Analysts believe that the US commodity funds will sell heavily if the price retreats below Dollars 325 a troy ounce, taking the market rapidly down to Dollars 320 and possibly lower. There appears, however, to be strong support at Dollars 325 an ounce. If the market manages to sustain prices above Dollars 326 for the rest of the week, it could move back up into its recent trading range of Dollars 327 to Dollars 332 a troy ounce. If the powerful funds were to push the market lower, producers might start panic hedging at around Dollars 320 a troy ounce in order to stave off losses, one analyst suggested yesterday. Market players are also watching events in Russia. If President Boris Yeltsin is undermined by his clash with the Russian parliament, so-called 'safe haven' money is expected to go into the US dollar - and the stronger the dollar, the worse for gold. This week's fall has itself been sparked by the weakness of the South African rand against the dollar, which has enabled producers there to sell forward at a profit.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Sales south of the border seen to be basis for growth SELLING more electricity, particularly south of the Scottish border, will be the key to profit growth for ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric, the two electricity companies announced in their pathfinder flotation prospectus, published yesterday. Pool - or spot market - prices in England and Wales would also be critical in determining the future profitability of the two companies, the prospectus said. Hydro-Electric, the smaller of the two companies, was more forceful than ScottishPower about exporting electricity. Mr Roger Young, chief executive, told a London press conference yesterday: 'Virtually all our profit growth will come from generation and supply.' Since the industry was restructured last March, both companies' electricity sales have increased significantly, the prospectus shows. Hydro-Electric's sales have grown from 7.4m megawatt-hours in the year ending March 1990, to 10.1m MW-hours this financial year. ScottishPower's sales have increased from 19.8m to 21.9m over the same period. In both cases the increase stemmed largely from increased sales outside the companies' area. Hydro-Electric was also more assertive about competing in the electricity market, selling directly to large industrial customers in England and Wales. It has won 11 contracts to supply 39 customers outside its region. ScottishPower, which has been less openly aggressive, won contracts to supply 10 customers outside its area, and has since lost two. It will consider alternatives to direct sales, in particular selling to the pool in England and Wales, the company said. ScottishPower was cautious about the future of prices to large customers, which it believed might fall significantly. If that happened, the company said, it may become uneconomic to supply those customers. Both companies said they expected to make considerable cost savings in the generation business, particularly because they will have lower cost gas-fired generation from mid 1992, when gas from the North Sea Miller field will be available to supply the power station at Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, whose output they share. Mr Young gave a warning that the quantity of Miller gas that would be delivered was one of a number of uncertainties faced by Hydro-Electric. Another risk was the plan by both companies to upgrade the interconnector, which connects the Scottish grid to the National Grid in England and Wales. ScottishPower said it expected demand for electricity to bring some natural growth to its other main business, the transmission and distribution of electricity to end customers. This 'wires' business, which is generally regarded as stable and predictable, represents 70 per cent of ScottishPower's operating profit, but only 45 per cent of Hydro-Electric's, the prospectus disclosed. Hydro-Electric said its distribution business should continue to make a substantial contribution to profits, but it was vulnerable to growing competition from gas. About 52 per cent of end users in the company's area were served by a natural gas network compared with 84 per cent in the UK overall, the company said. Unlike the 12 electricity companies of England and Wales, the distribution businesses of the Scottish companies will not be able automatically to increase revenues by raising prices. The 'x factors' that regulate how much they can increase prices on top of inflation every year are much lower - at 0.2 for each company - than their southern rivals.</p>

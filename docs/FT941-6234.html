			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Electricity costs may hit Elkem smelters Elkem, the Norwegian light metals producer, said yesterday that temporary lay-offs were possible at some of its smelters because domestic spot market prices for electricity had more than doubled to NKr0.48 a kW/hour in the past two days. An official said the company had been considering increasing output at ferro-chrome and ferro-silicon smelters. But it was now reviewing the plan and might have to reduce capacity even for aluminium. Elkem consumes about 8.5bn MW/hours of electricity annually for light-metals production but on an annual basis it buys just 10 per cent of its electricity needs in the spot market. The remainder is supplied under long-term, fixed-rate contracts and from its own generating plants. Norway's electricity market has been undergoing reform during the past couple of years and is considered one of Europe's most liberal. Because of this the government has refused to intervene to stem rising prices. Energy analysts say prices have risen because of the unusually cold weather and speculation that electricity suppliers have not secured large enough trading agreements with neighbouring Sweden and Denmark to cover a shortfall in domestic production. The government said that it would allow the ceilings for imports of electricity to be lifted so that suppliers could cover any shortfall in domestic production. It has also consulted Swedish and Danish authorities on the issue. Average prices for electricity so far this year have been NKr0.18 a KWh, according to government figures, but have shot up in the past two days to around NKr0.48 during the day and NKr0.35.5 in the evening.</p>

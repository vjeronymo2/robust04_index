			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK index futures traded in a tight range in a quiet session devoid of notable features, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,729 and early light demand saw it move ahead moderately to 2,730, which turned out to be the high of the day. June drifted lower thereafter, though two-way business was noted at the lower levels, helping to steady the contract. The weak opening of Wall Street triggered a sizeable amount of selling, sending June lower, and the contract, having traded between 2,700 and 2,728 for most of the session, closed at 2,718. This was down 16 on its previous close and around 8 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 8. Turnover at the official close was just shy of 6,000 lots. Further falls were recorded in after hours' trading, with the June contract retreating to reach 2,706 at one stage. In traded options, turnover was a healthy 32,606 lots, of which 10,007 contracts were traded in the FT-SE 100 option. Asda was once again the top traded stock option as talk of a consortium launching a bid for the food retailer again did the rounds. It traded 3,162 lots. This was followed by BT, which released full-year figures yesterday, at 1,695 contracts. The August 360 puts were particularly busy.</p>

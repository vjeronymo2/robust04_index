			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Feb. 16, IRNA -- The decree pronounced  five years ago by the father of the Islamic revolution, the late  Imam Khomeyni, against the apostate author of The Satanic  Verses, Salman Rushdie, bears no relation whatsoever to the  Bosnian crisis, the Iranian Embassy in Belgrade has pointed out  to Serbian state news agency TANJUG.    TANJUG, in a recent article, tried to distort facts by  saying  the Serbs were being threatened with bombs and missiles by what  it called the "progressive world public which reacted so  strongly in defence of Rushdie", only because they do not fit  into the vision contained in the "Islamic declaration" of  Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic.    Bosnian Serbs face NATO air strikes if they do not withdraw  their artillery from around Sarajevo which they have been  pounding for 22 months now.    Bosnian President Izetbegovic was imprisoned following an  infamous trial of Bosnian Muslims by the former Yugoslav  communist regime, because of his work, the "Islamic declaration".    In a letter to TANJUG's editor-in-chief, the Iranian Embassy  said the author of the text had in a very surprising manner  distinctly related the decree, later confirmed and supported by  the organization of the Islamic countries, to the situation in  Bosnia.    "The author's accusation of `Iranian fundamentalism' is  improper and does not help him in the description of the current  situation in Bosnia and political action taken in this respect,"  the letter said.    The embassy looked forward to correction of the article and  expected TANJUG to publish rational and fact-based comments, the  letter concluded.</p>

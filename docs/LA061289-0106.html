			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COURT DELIVERS JOBS SETBACK TO RIGHTS ADVOCATES;  </P> <P> JUSTICES UPHOLD REVERSE DISCRIMINATION CHALLENGE BY WHITE FIREFIGHTERS  </P> <P> The Supreme Court, in a major setback for affirmative action, today expanded  the ability of white men to challenge court-approved plans giving preferential  treatment to minorities and women in government jobs.  </P> <P> By a 5-4 vote, the justices handed civil rights advocates their latest defeat  in the case of white Birmingham, Ala., firefighters who say they are victims of  reverse discrimination.  </P> <P> The justices said an affirmative action plan agreed to by public officials and  approved in court may be attacked even years later in a new suit by workers who  took no part in the case leading to the original agreement.  </P> <P> Today's ruling marks the third time this year a newly solidified high court  conservative majority has dealt a significant blow to efforts aimed at helping  minorities and women overcome bias.  </P> <P> The court in January ruled that state and local governments generally may not  impose racial quotas for public works projects. On June 5, the justices erected  new barriers for minorities seeking to prove with statistics that they are  relegated to lower paying, less desirable jobs.  </P> <P> Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, dismissed arguments  that the ruling threatens voluntary settlement of minority employment  discrimination claims.  </P> <P> "A voluntary settlement in the form of a (court) consent decree between one  group of employees and their employer cannot possibly settle, voluntarily or  otherwise, the conflicting claims of another group of employees who do not join  in the agreement," he said.  </P> <P> "A judgment or decree among parties to a lawsuit resolves issues as among them,  but it does not conclude the rights of strangers to those proceedings," he  said.  </P> <P> In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said the ruling could have  serious consequences for affirmative action plans agreed to by employers.  </P> <P> The decision "would subject large employers who seek to comply with the law by  remedying past discrimination to a never-ending stream of litigation and  potential liability," Stevens said.  </P> <P> He said the ruling threatens to undo efforts by Birmingham which "has made a  substantial step toward the eradication of the long history of pervasive racial  discrimination that has plagued its fire department."  </P> <P> Stevens was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun and  Thurgood Marshall.  </P> <P> Joining Rehnquist were Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin  Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.  </P></p>

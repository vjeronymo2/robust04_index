			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow 30 April TASS -- Latvian President Guntis  Ulmanis ended his visit to Moscow and left for Riga late on  Saturday.    During the visit Ulmanis and President Boris Yeltsin signed  an agreement to withdraw Russian troops from Latvia by 31 August  1994 and a number of agreements concerning the status of Russian  servicemen in Latvia, members of their families and military  pensioners.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS after the talks Yeltsin said  that "Russian-Latvian documents signed today in the Kremlin were  drawn up with full consent of both sides."    Ulmanis said the reached agreements aim at normalising  relations between the two countries. He stressed he and Yeltsin  reached "full understanding" on all issues included in the  agenda of the talks.    Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs said that the  agreement  on economic cooperation and trade between Russia and Latvia is  also practically ready and will facilitate the soonest possible  implementation of the reached accords. Birkavs expressed the  confidence that the agreement can be signed during Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit to Latvia due to  take place in the second half of May.</p>

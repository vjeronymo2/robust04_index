			<p>BFN     [Text] Lahore, April 14, IRNA -- A senior Majlis deputy  said here Wednesday that the Islamic Iran would not stand the  massacre of Muslims and pressures against them in any part of  the world including Kashmir. Vice-Chairman of Majlis foreign  policy commission Mohammad Javad Larijani who is currently  accompanying Majlis Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri in his tour of  Pakistan, told IRNA that one of the valuable outcomes of  Tehran-Islamabad talks was the speaker's proposal for the  formation of ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization]  inter-parliamentary group.    Representatives have been appointed by the two countries to  follow up agreements reached between the two sides, Larijani  noted, adding "we hope that the organization would be formed by  the next year". Voicing Iran's readiness to cooperate in  bringing an end to Kashmir problem, the Iranian parliamentarian  called for negotiations between the belligerent parties to  settle the dispute. The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that  Kashmiri people should determine their own fate, Larijani  remarked.    Underlining geopolitical and economic importance of the two  countries, Larijani noted that with a total population of 200  million and their access to different parts of Asia, specially  the Indian Ocean, Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, Iran and  Pakistan, should be regarded as core for any regional  arrangement, Larijani concluded.</p>

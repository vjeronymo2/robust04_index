			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Salvador Enguix report: "Valencian PSOE Consolidates </F> Renewalist Blueprint Proposed by Joan Lerma"]    [Excerpt] Valencia -- The seventh congress of the  Valencian Socialists (PSPV-PSOE) ended in Cheste (Valencia)  yesterday with majority support (79.3 percent of the votes in  favor) for the sole list of candidates presented, led by  Secretary General Joan Lerma. The congress consolidated the  "blueprint for renewing and opening up the party" championed by  Lerma with the inclusion of "new faces and new ideas" in the new  Executive Committee. The fact that, contrary to what was  expected, over 20 percent of the delegates abstained from voting  for this Executive Committee was interpreted by Lerma as an  expression of the fact that "in the face of the strong impetus  for renewal being effected by the Valencian Socialists, there  are people who still have their gaze set on the party, not  society, and we will calmly surmount that opposition." In total,  out of the 392 possible votes, 311 were in favor, 64 blank, and  17 invalid.    Lerma, who also had the support of Economy Minister Pedro  Solbes, who took part in the closing session, did not hesitate  to describe the new Executive Committee as "an organization for  the new times and new needs," and did not avoid references to  corruption in his closing speech. In this connection, he stated  that "it is the government that must lead the fight against  corruption, and the response must be vigorous." Speaking with  journalists, Lerma did not hesitate to interpret "the leftward  shift" as "a demand that the progressive forces have a place in  this party." [passage omitted]</p>

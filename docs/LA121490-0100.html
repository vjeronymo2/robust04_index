			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 3 OF HOLLYWOOD'S BEST SILENTS AT BING THEATER  </P> <P> "Restorations, Rarities &amp; Requests" continues at the Los Angeles County  Museum of Art's Bing Theater today and Saturday with three glorious Hollywood  silents. The 1926 "Ben-Hur," which will be shown with its tinted Technicolor  sequences and with organist Gaylord Carter performing the original score,  screens today at 1 p.m. and again at 8 p.m. Douglas Fairbanks' swashbuckling  "The Black Pirate" (1925) will be shown at 1 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Saturday, and  Rudolph Valentino's final film, "The Son of the Sheik" (1926), follows "The  Black Pirate" at 2:20 and 9:20.  </P> <P> After more than 60 years, "Ben-Hur" remains an awesome and moving religious  spectacle. Years in the making, it is at once intimate and immense, telling of  the travails of a young Jerusalem nobleman, Ben-Hur (Ramon Novarro), under  oppressive Roman rule, while in the background the story of Christ (whose face  is never seen) unfolds.  </P> <P> Adapted from Gen. Lew Wallace's 1880 novel, "Ben-Hur" is no more subtle or  complex than an old Classics Comics book. Yet, through Fred Niblo's astute  direction, it attains the visual eloquence of a mime play. Along with a genuine  aura of spirituality, it boasts a justly famous chariot race, a splendid sea  battle and stupendous sets and costumes.  </P> <P> "The Black Pirate," which Douglas Fairbanks Sr. wrote for himself, is the  prototypical pirate picture. It has a villain of the deepest dye, stirring  battles at sea, a high-born lady in distress (beauteous Billie Dove) and, best  of all for Fairbanks fans, a hero who performs feats of daring with  incomparable athletic grace.  </P> <P> As stylish as it is elementary, the film shows off Fairbanks' gift for  spectacular acrobatics, culminating in a slide down a ship's mainsail -- while  slicing it with a knife.  </P> <P> Children are as likely to be enchanted with "The Black Pirate," which the  Museum of Modern Art considers the finest achievement of early two-strip  Technicolor, as their parents or grandparents were. So simple a tale is it that  adults may find themselves feasting more on the remarkable settings (by Karl  Oscar Borg) and costumes (by Dwight Franklin) than on the story line. "The  Black Pirate" boasts several magnificent vessels, including a galleon of  baroque splendor. Incredibly rich in detail, the vessel has the look of  authenticity.  </P> <P> Under Albert Parker's blithe direction, the film moves rapidly. Fairbanks is  thoroughly engaging, Dove is lovely and Donald Crisp is a delight as a hearty,  one-armed old salt who turns good guy in a pinch. As for the Technicolor --  Harry Sharp was the cameraman -- it's almost sepia and gives the film a rich,  burnished glow.  </P> <P> Superior artistically to "The Sheik" (1921), which established Valentino as the  screen's greatest Latin lover, "The Son of the Sheik," which the redoubtable  Frances Marion adapted from the E. M. Hull novel, is a heady, flamboyant tale  of desert passion, easily derided and spoofed today but nonetheless full of  vigor and dash, thanks to George Fitzmaurice's spirited direction.  </P> <P> However, more than the original did, the film unfortunately suggests strongly  the possibility of a man taking a woman forcibly -- and her loving it. As a  period piece the picture is fun but looks bad in the light of women's  liberation.  </P> <P> Anyway, we find Valentino beguiled by a pretty dancing girl (Vilma Banky) with  whom he has oasis trysts, whereas his father, the old sheik (also played by  Valentino) wants to marry off his son to a cousin of his English wife (Agnes  Ayres).  </P> <P> In this pop entertainment from a past era, Valentino remains the eternal symbol  of exotic glamour and romance -- even if Gloria Steinem would be unlikely to  approve.

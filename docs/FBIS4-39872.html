			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who is  paying a working visit to the Transcaucasus republics, arrived  from Yerevan in Tbilisi today. [passage omitted]    Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Eduard  Shevardnadze, the chairman of the Georgian Supreme Council and  head of state, held a one-to-one meeting at the Georgian Cabinet  of Ministers, and were later joined by representatives of the  Russian and Georgian sides.    The meeting discussed issues relating to the settlement of  the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, in particular, the timing and  mechanism for the deployment of CIS peacekeeping forces in the  conflict zone. The sides also discussed terms and conditions for  the operation of the Russian military bases on Georgian  territory.    Eduard Shevardnadze said that the meeting could be regarded  as a new stage in relations between Russia and Georgia. It will  help implement the plan that envisaged the introduction to the  conflict area of CIS peacekeeping forces under UN aegis [as  heard] and the repatriation of refugees and displaced persons.    In the second part of the day, the Russian defense minister  flew to Gudauta to agree the introduction of peacekeeping forces  to the conflict zone with the Abkhaz side.    Before leaving for Gudauta, Pavel Grachev said that the  military aspect of the deployment of Russian peacekeeping forces  in Abkhazia had in effect been completely solved. As regards  the timing of their deployment, that could only be decided at  political level.    The minister said that three motor rifle battalions from the  Leningrad, Volga, and Urals Military Districts were ready to  carry out the peace operation as part of a CIS force. Three  days were needed to transfer them to the conflict zone. Pavel  Grachev also said that the Gudauta-based 345th Parachute  Regiment of the Russian Armed Forces might take part in the  disengagement of forces. In addition to that, said the  minister, it should not be ruled out that three battalions from  the Group of Russian Troops in the Transcaucasus might also  participate in the peace mission in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict  zone. The group commander has already been issued with relevant  instructions.    It is expected that the Russian defense minister will return  to Tbilisi later today to continue the discussion of the details  of the deployment of CIS peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia.</p>

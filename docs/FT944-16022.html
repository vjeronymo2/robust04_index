			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Gospel according to the chancellor: The biggest question for voters in tomorrow's German election is whether to kick Kohl out More than anything else, it has been Helmut Kohl's election in Germany. He has dominated the campaign from start to finish with his extraordinary energy and his tireless electioneering, careering by helicopter or motorcade from meeting to meeting. His booming, nasal voice - cracking with strain over the past 10 days - has preached the gospel according to the chancellor to more than 1m voters. Like a tank that cannot turn, he has ploughed straight on, regardless of demonstrators and downpours, of bad news or good arguments. Fuelled by his apparently unquenchable optimism, and his enormous belief in himself, he has dragged his own popularity, and that of his ruling Christian Democratic Union, to the front of the field. He has driven himself, according to his closest advisers, to the very limit of his immense physical resources. But it is more than that. For Helmut Kohl has not just been the preacher. He has been the issue. The real question for German electors has been the same since this marathon election campaign took off in March: do you want to keep the chancellor, or do you want to kick him out? His bulky shadow has loomed over every one of the 20 polls, from local government elections, through state parliaments, the election of the federal president, the European parliament, and now, at last, the general election tomorrow. Whatever burning issues the opposition Social Democrats and their earnest leader Rudolf Scharping have sought to raise - soaring taxation, the plight of the homeless and unemployed, the unequal burden of unification, nuclear energy, the environment, the drift and incompetence of the Kohl administration - the question has come back to the personality of the man in charge. For Mr Kohl and his campaign strategists, it was a huge gamble. He is quite as much despised in his homeland as he is admired. His personal popularity has never been high. He has always before been elected in spite of himself, not because of himself. But this time, the strategists argued, it had to be different. After 12 years in power, the ruling coalition might lose on issues alone. Only the chancellor could turn the tide. Against all the odds, it looks - with one day still to go - as if he may have done it. If he has, it will not be in spite of what he is, but because of it. Chancellor Kohl is a man of extraordinary contradictions, for all his veneer of earthy directness. He is both incurably provincial, and an international statesman; he is quintessentially German, and yet a passionate European. He is thick-skinned, patient and placid, but sometimes often hyper-sensitive to criticism, truculent and aggressive. His jovial exterior hides a ruthlessness towards his rivals. He is both a faithful friend, and an implacable enemy. He inspires loyalty and despair in his staff in equal measures. He can be embarrassingly emotional, and yet coldly calculating; a thoughtful strategist, yet an incoherent speaker. While his government has been remarkable for its sense of drift, he has exercised a dominant leadership from the top. He represents the establishment, and yet he manages to present himself as anti-establishment, the man of the people. It is the contradictions that make the man, and drive him on. Four years ago, re-elected with a record majority on the wave of euphoria which followed unification, he could have relaxed. 'He knows he has his name in the history books,' a close confidant said at the time. 'He can afford to sit back and bask in the glory.' Today, aged only 64, he has been leader of his party for 21 years, and German chancellor for the past 12. He has become the dominant figure on the international stage. He has seen German unification become a reality. He appears to have done it all. And yet he has thrown himself into this latest election campaign, for a fourth full term in office with an energy and enthusiasm that even his own closest advisers have never seen before. 'I believe he needs to prove to himself, and to the world at large, that the Germans believe in him, and trust him, as the chancellor of German unification,' is how one close observer sums it up. 'He sees it as a plebiscite on his role as the unity chancellor.' Mr Kohl also enjoys having power, and exercising it. He has never made any secret of his boyhood ambition to be chancellor, and the single-mindedness with which he drove towards that goal, in spite of three early rejections in his efforts - twice by his party, and once at the polls. In the past four years, however, the achievement and consolidation of German unification, bound inextricably to his vision of European union, has become his main driving force. On the one hand, he is still passionately committed to his European goal. He does not, by all accounts, entirely trust his potential successors to be as determined in making the European union irreversible. He wants another big step towards integration from the European Union Inter-Governmental Conference scheduled for 1996. On the other, he is determined to disprove his critics over German unification. It was in Halle, in the heartland of east Germany's devastated chemical industry, that he was hit by an egg at a demonstration back in 1991. He lost his temper, and went for the culprit in the crowd. It has never been forgotten. He was mocked for his words, when he said the east would be transformed into a 'blooming landscape'. The reality was mass unemployment and bitterness. The German press said he would never be able to face an east German crowd again. In this election, he has deliberately returned to every single town and village in the east where he went in 1990, promising that vision of a 'blooming landscape'. He has faced the crowds - not so many, to be sure, but still numbering in thousands, not hundreds - and he has admitted his mistakes. 'I was wrong,' he says, 'but only in the time it would take. I am still convinced that you will have a blooming landscape.' The result has been a significant recovery in the standing of his CDU in the east, almost entirely attributable to the efforts of the chancellor. Mr Kohl is also driven by a deep bitterness towards the reformed Communist party, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS). He accuses its members of being the heirs of those who destroyed the Weimar republic, Germany's first attempt at democracy, and paved the way directly for the advent of Adolf Hitler. He calls them 'red-painted fascists'. 'He seems to feel very deeply about the ingratitude of east German electors who, in spite of having won their freedom, still turn round and vote communist,' says Mr Dieter Wonka, political correspondent of the Leipziger Volkszeitung. 'He takes it very personally.' It is in part a counter-productive ploy, which has allowed the PDS to exploit its identity as the one 'home-grown' east German party. The more the westerners attack it, the more voters it seems to pack in. But Mr Kohl does not seem to care. He is concerned not so much to woo his opponents - 'the 60 per cent who won't vote for me anyway' - as to ensure the loyalty of his natural constituency. He is a party man to his toes: a provincial politician who came up the hard way, cultivating the grass roots and building his base, until he reached the top. He despises colleagues who fail to do the same. His greatest enemies have been made not in the opposition, but in the ranks of his own CDU. He has banished potential competitors, such as Professor Kurt Biedenkopf, the intellectual former general-secretary who now rules Saxony, in east Germany, as a second-best to the federal republic; Mr Heiner Geissler, one of the most brilliant advocates on the left of the party and another former general-secretary was abruptly removed by his boss. One reason is Mr Kohl's political ruthlessness. 'Don't be deceived by the joviality,' says a friend. 'This is an iron chancellor inside.' He is also deeply suspicious of all things intellectual, reinforced by the obvious contempt that many intellectuals have for the sometimes inarticulate and clumsy chancellor. In revenge, he cultivates his image as a provincial, the man from the Palatinate. 'Something which is frequently underestimated is his way of putting himself on the other side,' says an admirer. 'He manages to persuade ordinary people that 'it is me and you against the establishment'.' 'He has that in common with President Bill Clinton. He has always had a very critical relationship with the bureaucracy, and with the middle-ranking officials in the party. He is like a general who pushes the officers to one side, and appeals directly to the troops.' His provincialism is also a factor in his passionate belief in European integration, something that he has not diluted, either in the drive for German unification, or in the face of post-Maastricht Euro-scepticism. 'He is a man with few principles, but they are very clear,' as a close adviser says. In every speech he repeats his conviction that 'German unification and European union are two sides of the same coin.' His homeland of the Palatinate is an area of Germany that has been repeatedly devastated by Europe's wars and invasions - in the 30 years' war, in invasions by Louis XIV and Napoleon, and in the second world war. It is a history of which he is acutely conscious, complemented by his own personal upbringing. In private, he tells a story about his own family to prove the point. His mother's brother was called Walter, who died as a soldier in the first world war. His own brother was called Walter, and he died in the second world war. When his eldest son was born, Chancellor Kohl told his mother he wanted to call the boy Walter. 'She begged me not to,' he says. 'She said the name had always been unlucky for us.' But he insisted. He said that it was a commitment, a promise from his generation that they would never let it happen again. His eldest son is called Walter. It is an emotional commitment to the European dream which he found, to his profound disappointment, was not shared - or even understood - by Lady Thatcher. Now Mr Kohl has outlasted Lady Thatcher and, if he wins another term, looks set to outlast Mr Mitterrand. How long will he stay? He says he will not be a candidate again, after 1998, if he wins the election tomorrow. But nobody entirely believes him. As the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper pointed out, he said he would not stand 'after 1998' - not in 1998, when the next election takes place. It was another bit of vintage Kohl, another piece of the ultimate politician, whose rule has ever been: Keep them guessing till the bitter end.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By BELINFORM correspondent Lidiya Peresypkina -- TASS] </F>   [Text] Minsk, Dec 1 -- Specialists have spent three years  working on an updated and amplified chart of cesium-137  contamination of territory in the states of the former Union.  The new chart synthesizes and summarizes data obtained from  gamma-spectrometric analysis of numerous soil samples and  gamma-spectrometric surveys from the air.    ``This updated chart reflects the third post-Chernobyl  period, which began in 1988,'' Yuriy Pokumeyko, head of the  Belarus hydrometeorological service says. ``The radiation  situation is now dominated by cesium-137, strontium-90 and  plutonium-238, -239, - 240, and -241, whose half-life ranges  from a minimum of 12 years to a maximum of almost 25,000 years.  The breakdown, by republics, of contamination by long-life  radionuclides with a density of one curie per square kilometre  and above is now as follows: Belarus -- 23 percent of the  republic's total area, Ukraine -- 5.2 percent, and Russia 0.6  percent. The worst affected areas are Gomel, Mogilev, Zhitomir,  Rovno, Kiev, Bryansk, Tula and Orel oblasts. I wish to point  out that, as far as Russia is concerned, the chart has been  augmented with information about strontium-90 contamination  resulting from the Kyshtym accident in the Urals.''</p>

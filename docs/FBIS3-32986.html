			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Column: "Political Things," by Dora Kramer] </F>   [Text] Not even a potential runoff election contest between  Maluf and Lula promises to generate as much confusion as the  fight already being picked between the PT [Workers Party] and  the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] during these pre-election  months. Things came to the boiling point during the Budget CPI  [Congressional Investigating Committee] and it looks like the  first hot sparks will be thrown off during the constitutional  revision. Then, after April, when the list of candidates will be  virtually finalized, we might see some tall flames. The charge  by Luiz Salomao (PDT, Rio de Janeiro) that an agreement was  worked out between the PT delegation and [former President]  Sarney's contingent in the Congress to keep [Sarney's daughter]  Roseana, on the one hand, and Miguel Arraes, on the other, out  of the hands of the CPI exposed a dispute for space on the Left  that, until then, had been taking shape behind the scenes.    The PT reacted immediately. One of the party  leaders--someone  with real influence within the delegation--added to the official  denials an argument to demolish the theory behind the agreement  when he said: "If we were to make any arrangement with the PFL  [Liberal Front Party], it would not be with the Sarney group; we  would deal directly with Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes, the party's  leader in the Chamber, who has authority over the party's  representatives on the CPI. He would be our authorized  interlocutor."    That is true, although no one from the PT or any other party  that helped to erect the obvious cordon around Roseana and  Arraes has offered a convincing explanation for the successive,  and successful, ploys that kept both of them far away from the  hearing room. In the case of Arraes, we must not forget that the  PDT also has some stake in the matter, since Brizola has not yet  lost hope of seeing the former Pernambuco's name on his slate as  his vice presidential running mate. Given Lula's standing in the  polls, however, even the most loyal brizolistas now  acknowledge the difficulties with this plan.    In an attempt to discredit Salomao--who is being accused in  private conversations of trying to counter the effects of some  unsuccessful actions in the CPI (the testimony by Joao Alves's  former chauffeur, for example)--the PT is thinking about naming  representatives from the party to serve on the CPI that would  investigate the CUT [Sole Workers Center]. Once the appointments  are made, the party would simply let matters take their course.  Probably the effort would not get anywhere, since if a CPI were  set up to investigate the CUT, there would be no way to prevent  CPI's on election campaigns and on contractors, a development  not in the interest of the other parties. That would ruin  everyone's election campaigns.    PT-Sarney agreement aside, the fact is that Lula's and  Brizola's parties are once again getting ready to tussle with  each other because of the presidential succession. For the time  being, the line of attack is almost totally occupied by the PDT.  Old resentments are popping up again. For example, Deputy  Vivaldo Barbosa (PDT-RJ) backs the theory, which he argues  vehemently, that "the PT is handing over the constitutional  revision" in exchange for a 60-day postponement of the CPI on  CUT. Vivaldo says the petistas "have bowed in the  face of the wind gusts of liberalism."    He cites as example past votes on which Lula's party, as the  brizolistas see it, preferred to ally with the enemy.  These include: the laws on patents, information technology,  ports, and the role of foreign capital in privatizations. And  now the PDT is convinced that the PT will ultimately participate  in the revision which, according to the same rationale, will  make changes in the Constitution similar to those proposed by  then-President Fernando Collor in the "super-amendment" that  never got through the Congress. The real danger the  brizolistas run with this approach is that they might  end up attracting more voters to the PT. And it is precisely  among the middle class where Lula has the most difficulty.    But that is a problem of PDT strategy, where what counts  most  is precisely that--pushing the PT toward the Right so as not to  have to share the banners of the Left with it. Of course Brizola  is not stupid; he would not pretend to isolate himself by these  means in some infantile leftist philosophy. In fact, he has  already embarked on a schedule of political consultations and  conversations in a fertile field for harvesting dissidents--the  PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party].    The pedetistas are falling all over themselves to  praise the "nationalist" faction of the PMDB, comprised of such  men as Tarcisio Delgado from Minas Gerais, the PMDB leader in  the Chamber, and Rondonia Senator Amir Lando, who was the  rapporteur on the CPI that investigated PC Farias. They are  also, albeit somewhat timidly, casting sidelong glances in the  direction of Pedro Simon (Rio Grande do Sul). But so far, the  support group the PDT believes it can count on is comprised of  the PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil], General Antonio Carlos  de Andrada Serpa, Celso Brandt, Aureliano Chaves, and Barbosa  Lima Sobrinho. In terms of votes, this cannot be called very  encouraging.</p>

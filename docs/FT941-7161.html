			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Fears of US rate rise send shares sharply down - Market Report Fears that the US Federal Reserve might tighten interest rates again sooner than expected drove the FT-SE Index down by 74.4 points yesterday in its largest one day fall for sixteen months. The setback, which was sparked by substantial losses in bonds as London and continental Europe followed trends in US Federal securities, featured heavy selling of stock index futures rather than of the underlying equities. The favoured support level of 3,300 on the Footsie was swept aside just before noon when traders grew increasingly apprehensive ahead of publication of the latest statistics on US durable goods orders, which Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, appeared to have identified as a significant inflation counter earlier this week. The FT-SE Index closed at 3,267.5, just above the day's worst, but with no effective recovery in either gilts or equities after US markets took a negative view of the durable goods figures. Wall Street was nearly 40 points down as London closed for the day. The wave of interest rate nervousness hit particularly hard in London, where the stock market has virtually factored in another cut in domestic base rates. Traders reminded one another that Mr Nick Knight, the once bullish strategist at Nomura Securities, had warned this week that UK short term interest rates would be above 6 per cent, perhaps approaching 7 per cent by the end of the year. But Seaq volume, at 753.9m shares, was unexceptional, not even matching the 822.4m of the previous session. One leading broker said he had found it very difficult to find even one big institutional seller of either gilts or equities. Nor were strategists agreed on the rationale behind the interest rate fears. 'Not a chance,' said Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon said, when asked if UK short term rates were about to rise. At James Capel, London's leading institutional broker, Mr Paul Walton assured clients that this was 'an opportunity to buy the UK equity market considerably cheaper than it was yesterday.' He also found 'completely unconvincing' suggestions that interest rates are about to rise in Europe. One view was that yesterday was a delayed rationalisation of the correction in UK equities which has been taking place since the Footsie peaked at the beginning of this month. The focus on the stock index future brought hints that hedge funds may have suffered large losses in that market and become forced sellers of bonds and shares. With nervousness over interest rates turning attention towards corporate results, the market was not helped by discouraging on sales and profit pressures from the boardroom of ICI, although shares in the blue chip chemical group held steady following the results. Shell, reporting lower results yesterday, fell sharply and added to the general malaise. The final picture last night was gloomy, with pressure across the range of equities bringing a fall of 51.9 to 3,923 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index. UK traders are still resigned to further tightening of policy by the Federal Reserve at some point, and are also watching Wall Street with some misgiving ahead of the opening of London markets today. But bond markets are expected to continue holding the key to near- term developments in equities.</p>

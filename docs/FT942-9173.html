			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: KPN sticks to the letter on sell-off - Dutch take a novel approach to their telecoms privatisation Telecommunications privatisations are now commonplace. The sale of KPN of the Netherlands, launched yesterday, is the fifth European offering in the past year alone, with up to a dozen more in the pipeline. Asia-Pacific telecoms is at a similar stage, with a few sales done and plenty to come. However, KPN is the first large telecoms privatisation to include a state postal service. Elsewhere, posts and telecommunications have been split in the run-up to privatisation, with posts remaining in the public sector. The inclusion of PTT Post in the KPN sale should cause would-be investors no undue concern. The Dutch post office is one of the few postal organisations in the world that can afford to feel relatively sanguine about the shift away from letters in favour of facsimile transmissions and the new world of mobile communications. PTT Post is one of Europe's few profitable postal operations, contributing nearly a third of KPN's turnover and 15 per cent of its operating profit. It is marketing itself aggressively abroad, and is a pioneer in advanced postal technologies. Its prime aims are to attract greater flows of international business post through the Netherlands and to expand in providing direct-marketing and mailing services to corporate clients. Analysts in the Netherlands recognise the profitability of the country's postal operations and are positive about their inclusion in the privatisation. 'Postal activities produce stability in KPN's earnings performance in a telecoms environment which certainly has potential but could on the other hand be regarded as 'hostile',' stockbrokers CLN Oyens &amp; Van Eeghen said recently. Postal services apart, the KPN privatisation follows a well-trodden path. An initial 30 per cent stake will be floated early next month. The government announced yesterday that up to 138.15m shares will be sold at a price between Fl 46 and Fl 52 each, raising a minimum of Fl 6.35bn (Dollars 3.39bn) for the state and valuing KPN as a whole at more than Fl 18bn. A further sale, taking the government's stake to under 50 per cent, is likely within three years, but at least 30 per cent will remain in state hands for at least 10 years. The Dutch flotation is taking place for broadly the same reasons as those applying across the European Union. The government wants the money, and the state telecoms company wants greater commercial freedom. Competition is intensifying, particularly in the corporate sector, and privately-owned companies are considered to be better placed to endure the onslaught. Although small in international terms, KPN's telecommunications division is well-placed to succeed in the EU's rapidly liberalising telecoms market. With fewer than 50 employees per 10,000 lines, KPN is among the EU's most productive state telecoms companies. Its network is towards the top of the EU league on all measures except the penetration of cellular mobile services. On the international scene, it is already geared up to attack the corporate market through its joint venture Unisource - a partnership of KPN and the state operators of Sweden and Switzerland, with the strong prospect of Telefonica, the Spanish operator, joining soon. Earlier this year Unisource scored a coup when, in alliance with the US giant AT&amp;T, it won a contract to provide a private telecoms network for 30 leading European multinationals - the largest 'outsourcing' contract of its kind in the EU. Its future relationship with AT&amp;T is uncertain, but there is the possibility of a more stable alliance. Given such strengths, most analysts believe KPN will prove a fairly easy sell at the offer price. However, the days are passing when telecoms stocks could be guaranteed to float high above their respective stock exchanges. A glance at BT is a cautionary tale. For the past six months, BT's shares have fallen steadily against the FT-SE All-Share average, and are down by nearly 20 per cent on their relative value a year ago. A contributory factor has been the rapid growth of competition in the UK market. BT commands nearly 90 per cent, but the perception that it will have to relinquish a larger slice of it has spread gloom across the investing community. KPN could find itself in the same boat. The Dutch government has indicated its willingness to license a second national operator with its own infrastructure - likely to be formed from the country's cable industry and its state electricity and rail operators. The new company will not be able to engage in competition with KPN for public voice traffic until 1998 - the EU liberalisation deadline. But if it establishes itself rapidly, it could make inroads into KPN's data and private corporate network business.</p>

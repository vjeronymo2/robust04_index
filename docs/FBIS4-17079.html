			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Vedernikov report under the "Legislators in the </F> Region" rubric: "New Orchestra Members, But Obsolete  Repertoire. Notes from First Session of Orenburg Oblast  Legislative Assembly"]    [Text] Orenburg -- There had been a possibility that the  session might not take place at all. On the same morning the  oblast court might have passed its verdict on an action by V.  Shapovalenko, the president's representative. The latter was  insistently demanding that the elections in eight districts be  deemed invalid. If the court had taken the side of the  president's representative and deemed the decision of the oblast  electoral commission incorrect, the deputies could have  dispersed quietly to their homes. They would have lacked a  quorum. The court adopted truly a decision of Solomon -- to  send to Moscow a question on how to interpret a particular point  in the statute on elections. It is not known when the reply  will come or when the court session will now be held.    Another surprise awaited deputies at the entrance to the  House of Soviets. It was, however, perfectly to be expected.  They had to pass through a "corridor of honor" made up of  students, teachers, and higher educational institution  lecturers. They were standing with placards, sometimes with  highly sarcastic epithets addressed to the local power and the  central power. The deputies must be given their due: They  responded with lightning speed and included this item on the  agenda.    After these tribulations the session nontheless began with a  speech by the chairman of the oblast electoral commission. His  speech contained several interesting points. Among the 36  deputies (11 seats are vacant pending repeat elections) 32 are  Russian, two are Kazakhs, one is a Mordvinian, and one a  Ukrainian. There was not a single representative of the Tatar  nationality, the second largest in the oblast, in the  composition of the assembly. Let us note that on the eve of the  elections the Tatar sociocultural center had raised the question  of granting a quota for the Legislative Assembly. How can we  not recall those times when people in oblast party committee and  soviet executive committee offices calculated, with an accuracy  down to two decimal places, how many workers, peasants, and  women there must be? Incidentally, there is not a single  representative of the hammer and sickle in the present assembly,  nor was there in the lists of candidates. The voters proved  ill-disposed toward women, electing just one representative of  them.    The election of the assembly chairman was no mystery. Senior  Deputy R. Khramov announced that the only candidate was V.  Grigoryev, who until the last day had been chairman of the  oblast soviet. The organizing committee had met the previous  day, attended by six of its seven members. Five voted for  Grigoryev, and one abstained. This was himself.    The calm was shattered by Deputy Yu. Nikiforenko. After  listing the shortcomings of the single nominee, he proposed also  including A. Zelepukhin, leader of the oblast agricultural  administration, in the lists for a secret ballot. An  alternative for the sake of an alternative, you might think. In  our democratic times it would seem a nonsense when a candidate  runs for a post all by himself.    It really was somewhat uncomfortable to see what happened  next. Deputies began simultaneously burning such a lot of  incense in praise of the sole candidate that, if they had really  been doing so, it would not have been possible to make out faces  through the smoke. On the other hand, they told Zelepukhin  without beating about the bush: Step down. Although he had not  yet, in fact, been included on the lists for a secret ballot.    Then the "heavy artillery" was brought up. State Duma  Deputy T. Zlotnikova took the floor. Tamara Vladimirovna  advanced six theses, according to which it was necessary to vote  precisely for Grigoryev. Let us leave aside five of them. The  chief one was that Valeriy Nikolayevich is noted for his great  decency and honesty. This really is so. He does not have a  cottage, such as officials of exalted rank are engaged in  building with poorly concealed enthusiasm, and he has not left  sumptuous apartments to his children. "He still drives a  Zaporozhets," the president's representative, who was sitting  next to me, whispered in my ear. He was talking, of course, of  private motor transport. The State Duma deputy concluded her  speech by saying that, but for Valeriy Nikolayevich's decency  and honesty, he would certainly have gotten into the Federal  Assembly (!!!). I listened and thought: What were the feelings  at this moment of V. Yelagin, senator and head of the oblast  administration, who beat Grigoryev in the struggle for this seat  on the Federal Assembly?    Yelagin concluded the debate. He said that he would be  "pleased to work" with Valeriy Nikolayevich. He added: "Not  over a cup of coffee, of course." He advised the chief of the  oblast agricultural administration to work a little better in  his own post. He emphasized, however, that, whomever the  deputies elected, he would strive for joint constructive work.    Finally Zelepukhin took the floor. He said that he could see  for himself that there was a whole host of work in the agrarian  sector. He reported that this was the reason why he had  declined the recent invitation to Moscow to take up a cozy and  quiet post. Just as he was about to sit down again, he said, as  though suddenly remembering: "Yes, I withdraw my candidacy."  Valeriy Nikolayevich Grigoryev was elected chairman of the  oblast Legislative Assembly in a secret ballot. The sole  candidate got 35 of the 36 votes. Familiar, is it not?    Maybe it was not worth going into such detail about the  first  session of the provincial parliament. But I am afraid that the  oblast Legislative Assembly is doomed to such a scenario by  virtue of its composition. For it is heads of rayon  administrations and leaders of industrial and agricultural  enterprises who form the majority on it. They will assent to  the executive, forgetting about their legislative role. Then  the Orenburg voters will discover in surprise that they have  engaged musicians for the "orchestra" who all play the same  instrument.</p>

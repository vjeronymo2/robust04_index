			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Letter: Pensions - the unacceptable wait Sir, Mr Brian MacMahon, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, tells us that rather than having a compulsory equalisation of pension benefits for men and women it would be better '. . .made on a voluntary and planned basis within an acceptable timescale'. (Letters, April 26). What he is mainly against is compulsory retrospection, which he says is '. . .both impractical and expensive'. He does not explain why retrospection is impractical, and I suspect that his use of the word, except in relation to a limited number of schemes which have kept inadequate records, is simply rhetorical. What is more understandable is the pensions industry's opposition on the grounds of cost. But even here most of the figures I have seen quoted so far for the overall cost have been unreasonably high and in some cases absurd. They seem to have been put forward more as part of a propagandawar than as a serious actuarial assessment. Pension costs are notoriously difficult to pin down. But the impact of the additional costs of equalisation will be much lower than often suggested, for the following reasons: a significant number of schemes have already equalised benefits (see the NAPF's own survey); many of the schemes which have not equalised benefits in theory have done so in practice, for example allowing men to retire early on unreduced benefits; for many schemes, lowering the retirement age for men means significant savings on the cost of death benefits and ill-health pensions; costs canbe spread over a long period and do not all have to be met 'up-front'. Mr MacMahon showed no understanding of unequal benefits now clearly being against the law of the land. He seems to be aligning himself with the protesters against the poll-tax who campaigned under the slogan 'can't pay - won't pay'] When the NAPF say that there should not be any element of compulsory retrospection, it means that it will take 40 years or more before all discrimination in pension schemes is eliminated. This is clearly unacceptable. We can only hope that a more constructive response is forthcoming from the pensions industry.

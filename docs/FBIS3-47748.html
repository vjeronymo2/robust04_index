Kerry, member of the  External Relations Committee of the Senate of the United States  [title as received], who is here for a visit to Vietnam.    Also present at the reception was Deputy Foreign Minister Le  Mai.    During the reception, Senator Kerry highly appreciated the  results of meetings between U.S. delegations and Vietnamese  senior officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and some  offices concerned. He said these meetings were of important  significance aimed at contributing to strengthening the mutual  understanding and promoting the normalization of the  Vietnam-U.S. relations. He noted that on the MIA issue the two  countries had engaged in a process of complete cooperation, and  that cooperation had brought about good results. The Vietnamese  Government and people, he also noted, have tried their best to  cooperate with the U.S. in the search of American servicemen  missing in action in the Vietnam war as well as in the supply of  information on the MIA issue.    For his part, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet appreciated the  positive support of Senator Kerry and many other Americans of  good-will for the normalization of the Vietnam-U.S. relations  for the sake of peace, stability and development in Southeast  Asia, as well as their cooperation in the MIA issue, which, he  said, will contribute to the promotion of their bilateral  relations. The Vietnamese leader reaffirmed that Vietnam's  consistent policy on the MIA issue was to do its best for the  humnitarian purpose. He held that should the MIA issue be  settled well, it would create mutual understanding and trust for  the settlement of other issues relating to the interests of the  two countries.    P.M. Vo Van Kiet asked Mr. Kerry to convey to the U.S.  President Vietnam's viewpoint that it was time for the two  countries to have a new decision on bilateral relations, and the  earlier the Vietnam-U.S. relations are normalized the more  favourable conditions would be created for the development of  the cooperative relations in various fields in conformity with  the interests of the two countries.    The Vietnamese prime minister also asked the U.S. senator to  convey his new year greetings to the U.S. people. Yesterday,  Chairman of the National Assembly Nong Duc Manh also received  Senator Kerry.    Mr Kerry expresed his pleasure over the meeting with the NA  chairman and considered that event very important, ushering in  opportunities for cooperation between the Vietnamese National  Assembly and the U.S. Congress. He thanked Chairman Nong Duc  Manh and the Vietnamese authorities for their hospitality for  him and his party, and said that his Vietnam visits had left him  fine impressions on the land and people of Vietnam.    Speaking to his guests, Chairman Nong Duc Manh expressed his  hope that the results of the visit would contribute to  strengthening the mutual understanding between the two  legislatures and the people of Vietnam and the U.S. Prompted by  the humanitarian spirit and profound sympathies towards families  of Americans missing in action in the Vietnam war, the  Vietnamese National Assembly and people would in their capacity  continue their cooperation with the U.S. side in the settlement  of the MIA issue.    The U.S. guests had working sessions with Foreign Minister  Nguyen Manh Cam and representatives of the Vietnam MIA office.    To continue his Vietnam visit Senator Kerry left here this  afternoon for Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang City.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 5 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin returned home on Wednesday [4 May] after taking part in  the signature ceremony in Cairo giving self-rule to Palestinians  in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    After his return, Cetin evaluated the removal of the German  arms ban on Turkey as a normal consequence of Turkish-German  relations.    Germany which suspended arms shipments to Turkey in April,  on  claims that these weapons were used in the southeast against  separatist terrorists, declared the same day that the ban was  lifted, since the allegations proved to be false.    `The decision is proof that efforts to damage German-Turkish  friendship and cooperation have failed,' Cetin said.    `The traditional mutual-trust relations between Turkey and  Germany have been strengthened once more, after this  experience,' he said.</p>

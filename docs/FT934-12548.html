			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: LA Gear disposal helps Blacks recover to Pounds 0.64m BLACKS LEISURE, the camp-ing, sports and fashion retailer and distributor, lifted profits from continuing operations before tax and exceptional items by 6 per cent to Pounds 226,000 in the six months to August 28. At the pre-tax level, profit of Pounds 638,000 compared with a loss of Pounds 8.2m. The latest figure included a profit of Pounds 885,000 from the sale in June of its LA Gear distribution business. The loss last time included Pounds 7.7m of goodwill already written off. Total interest payable was down from Pounds 507,000 to Pounds 307,000. Total turnover fell from Pounds 35m to Pounds 30.4m, including Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 7.7m) from discontinued operations. Total operating profit after a Pounds 439,000 loss on discontinued operations was Pounds 60,000, compared with an operating deficit last time of Pounds 203,000 following a Pounds 753,000 loss on discontinued operations. Continuing operations of the retail division made profits of Pounds 1.1m (losses Pounds 273,000) on turnover of Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 17.9m). Mr Simon Bentley, chairman and chief executive, said the division had improved its margins and pushed like-for-like sales up by 20 per cent. This had been achieved through much keener buying, concentration on Blacks' own brands, and the purchase of more clearance lines from established suppliers. At the same time the group was advertising more and had increased staff training and cut costs. The distribution division incurred a deficit of Pounds 288,000 (profit Pounds 1.3m) from a sharply lower turnover of Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 9.5m). Mr Bentley said the group was looking for suitable opportunities to expand the distribution division following the disposal of the LA Gear business. He described the market as flat. 'If we do see growth in the market, all to the good, but we don't expect it in our strategy or plans.' Earnings per share were 1.86p (losses 25.94p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 0.75p.</p>

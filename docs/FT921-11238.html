			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Motoring: Motor trade heads for a crash course in change - A new report predicts a shake-up in the way cars are sold and serviced TODAY'S CARS may be crammed with high technology but the way in which they are sold and serviced has changed little in half a century. The motor trade, reeling from the recession, is due for a shake-up from which the customer will emerge as king (or, presumably, queen). This is the gist of a controversial paper* from a London-based marketing consultancy which, among other things, forecasts: Lower new car prices as other makers follow the trend set by Vauxhall, which cut dealer profit margins when launching the latest Astra model. New kinds of dealer. They will not stock full, runabout-to-luxury-car ranges from single makers but one type (say, city cars, small family cars, prestige saloons or 4x4s) from a variety of manufacturers. A decline in sales of costly prestige cars, partly from environmental pressures but also because 'there are few practical reasons for spending more than around Pounds 10,000 on mobility.' The separation of car selling and servicing. The authors of the report think that customers get a rotten deal from today's dealers. Salesman 'hover with price on their minds' in outlets which, although often large and luxurious, are run on out-of-date lines. Dealers take their title too literally and over-concentrate on closing deals. There is too much emphasis on prices and discounts. Test drives - 'a natural part of the product evaluation process' - are not always offered when asked for. When they are, the right model is often not available. Even when given, test drives are often too short and customers are made to feel under an obligation to buy. Because most potential buyers suspect that practically the only thing the salesman will talk about is price, they find out about the cars in which they are interested from other sources. Then, they draw up a short-list and visit three or four franchised dealers they hope will have them in stock. 'On a wet Saturday afternoon . . . with a young family in the back, this is a far from convenient or uplifting experience,' says the report. It concludes that customers see most car showrooms as distinctly hostile places because too much has been spent on tarting them up and not enough on training the staff. 'It is not furnishings which make for a friendly and informative experience, but people with the right training and attitudes.' Continental dealers, especially German and French, are held to be much better at initiating sales rather than merely taking orders and haggling about prices. Britons often complain that, once they have bought cars, salesmen rarely have the courtesy to follow up to ensure they are satisfied. They are made to feel that servicing dealerships put their own convenience before that of the customer. It was hardly surprising that, as soon as their cars were out of warranty, customers went to more responsive or cheaper service points. The authors do not say what they think will happen to car servicing - which is to be the subject of their next report. But there is a straw in the wind. A leading Japanese manufacturer is said to admit that its cars really need servicing only every 25,000 miles (40,000 kms). Oil companies confirm that their latest products will last that long, as will brakes and spark plugs if made to the right specifications. The motor trade will, of course, have none of all this. It is waiting anxiously to hear what the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report (due in a few weeks) has to say about the way it conducts its business. In the meantime, it keeps a stiff upper lip. Does Death of a Car Salesman?, the title of the report, over-state the case against the motor trade? I take no sides. When I was young, I was made to feel very small by car salesmen with regimental ties who emerged from behind potted palms in wood-panelled showrooms. It is different now that I know more about the cars they are selling (and much more about their competitors) than they do. Some years ago, I changed the make of our family car mainly because the girl receptionist at the local servicing dealer went out of her way to irritate mature women customers, my wife included. She must have cost that franchised dealer a lot of business. One former customer switched to Honda. Two days after taking delivery of her Civic, a bouquet and a 'call us any time you need us' letter arrived from the dealer. She will never buy anything but a Honda again. In my experience, the treatment a car-owner receives from a franchised dealer can range from excellent to appalling. The best defence against the wrong 'uns is to vote with your feet. *Death of a Car Salesman. Burkitt Weinreich Bryant, Glen House, 200 Tottenham Court Road, London W1P 9LA. Tel. 071-636 9801.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Arts: Manipulated by a master of light - The natural visions of James Turrell THE CONJUNCTION of James Turrell and Georgia O'Keefe at London's Hayward Gallery is revealing. The two artists, so different in their methods of work, prove to be alike not only in their shared grandeur of vision and sublime self-confidence in its achievement, but also in having produced individual works of striking similarity. Look at O'Keefe's charcoal drawing 'Black Diagonal,' of 1919 and compare its lines and circles with the forms Turrell plots over his photographs of Roden Crater, an extinct volcano in the Arizona Desert. Look at her 'Wall with Green Door' of 1952 and then at Turrell's 'Frontal Passage', 1992, which uses holograms and movement, but is essentially about a green rectangle in space. Go back to 'Green Door'. Note the importance of edge, of sky. Then visit 'Air Mass.' Look at 'A Celebration', O'Keefe's painting of a section of blue sky with clouds of 1924, then go back to 'Air Mass' and see 'A Celebration', live. O'Keefe expressed her experiences of desert landscapes in paintings and drawings admirable in their simplicity and concentration of purpose. Turrell, too, makes striking images of the desert landscape which is an essential ingredient of his most ambitious work. His objective, however, is different. He is not content, as O'Keefe was, to offer a record of sublime visual experience and allow us to share it as and how we will. He seeks, rather, to make manifest the vehicle of that experience - light itself. It is 'the thingness of light' as he calls it which possesses him, and which he has striven to communicate in works ranging from studio installations to outdoor environmental projects, of which the grandest is the transformation of the Roden Crater, on which he has been working since 1977. During the 70s, when 'Wedgework IV,' now on view at the Hayward, was created, Turrell was experimenting with dark spaces, reducing light to so low a level that spectators must wait for their eyes to adjust to be able to see the work. Both 'Wedgework IV' and 'Trace Elements', 1992, have the unnerving ability to make light seem solid. The first, red hued space seems filled with mist, although it is not, and the second dim chamber seems to end in a wall painted with a rectangle of heliotrope, whose solidity, when tested, proves illusory. Effective though they are as demonstrations of colour created through light and the capacity of the brain to create solids out of air, these two installations do not quite succeed as objects of contemplation. The red of 'Wedgework' has a nightclub quality which undermines its more spiritual effects, while the impact of the ghostly rectangle in 'Trace Elements' is lessened by white light reflecting from the side walls. 'Air Mass' is different. In this piece, The Hayward roof has been transformed into a high, white walled court with a ceiling open to the sky. Benches run along the walls. Atop the benches, hidden lighting reflects upwards. In photos of this piece as installed in sunnier locations, the walls glow golden, the sky emanates an ever deepening blue. In London in April the sky, grey with scudding clouds, seems reluctant to take part. Indeed, the installation is sometimes closed because of rain and the plywood entry tunnel and benches are stained with water marks. When open, the act of contemplation is disturbed by traffic noise and one's fellow viewers, embarrassed perhaps by the odd feeling of vulnerability which gazing fixedly upwards induces. However, all these awkwardnesses add to the piece's quality of delight, its unpredictability deepening its resonance, the power of the weather and the vagaries of the spectators undermining the artist's attempt to orchestrate our experience. And this is to the good. For the trouble with Turrell, despite his charming demeanour, is that, for his work to work, it requires him to assume total control. The viewing experience has to be shaped, planned out, and the spectator must act as the artist has ordained. To do so requires in effort of will, an acquiescence in powerlessness. Turrell's heart is really in his volcano. There, with the most benign of intentions, he will have total control not just of those art pilgrims who will flock to the site when it opens in the year 2000 but of nature itself. The bowl of the crater, its fiery duty done, is being reshaped to make visible the 'celestial vaulting' as he calls the curve of light where earth and sky meet. Tunnels are being driven into its heart, and visitors will follow designated pathways to the various forms of light experience created within. For, like others who have gone to the desert to find light made manifest, Turrell requires obedience from those who choose to follow him. That obedience, while a vital part of his work's undoubted power, is also the source of its weakness. The helpless viewer, groping along a wall in search of an exit, may finally feel manipulated rather than enlightened, controlled rather than empowered. At the Hayward Gallery until June 27.</p>

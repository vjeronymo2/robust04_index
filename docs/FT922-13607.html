			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Italians urged to embrace reform of electoral system MR Mario Segni, the leading reformist politician in the Christian Democrat party, yesterday offered to head a transitional government to carry out institutional and electoral reforms. This is the first concrete proposal to resolve the confusion created by Sunday's election, which led to unprecedented fragmentation of the political parties and ended the long-running hegemony of the Christian Democrats. Mr Segni, 52, son of a former president of the republic, has been the key figure behind a cross-party movement committed to using the referendum as a tool of reform. Mr Segni's initiative yesterday was taken without consulting Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the Christian Democrat party secretary. In so doing he is deliberately pressing for a change in the discredited party hierarchy and staking his claim as the leading figure among the younger generation. Mr Segni's position was strengthened by the good showing of the Christian Democrat vote in his home territory of Sardinia (it fell less than 1 per cent, against 5 per cent nationally) and the presence of 152 deputies and senators in the new parliament who had agreed in advance to back his pact for electoral reform via the referendum. The next government, he said, had to be formed quickly and should have four priorities: electoral reform moving towards a first-past-the-post system; dismantling the party's control over the state apparatus, starting with local health services and including television; a tough economic austerity programme and drastic measures to combat corruption; an emergency plan to fight organised crime, especially in the south. By throwing his hat into the ring, Mr Segni risks dividing the Christian Democrats into the old guard and the reformers. But he is one of the party's few credible political figures and could find cross-party support, especially if the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) were to support him. At the moment the PDS, which groups the bulk of the former Communist party, has been spurning sudden post-electoral advances from both the Christian Democrats and the Socialists.</p>

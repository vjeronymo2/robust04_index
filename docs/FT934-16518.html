			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Fears over combined heat and power THE RISE of energy-efficient power generation systems could be jeopardised by sharply higher gas prices to industrial consumers, the Combined Heat and Power Association warned yesterday. Mr David Green, its director, said the industry's strong growth in recent years had been 'kick-started' by British Gas's low-cost interruptible supplies. Interruptible users pay low prices but risk being cut off at times of peak demand. The association fears that moves to enhance competition by forcing British Gas to give up parts of its non-interruptible market could lead it to raise interruptible prices. Mr Green said a 'narrow' focus on competition by the Department of Trade and Industry in its review of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the future of British Gas could frustrate government environmental goals to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. A government target says CHP systems should account for 5,000MW, or about 8 per cent, of installed capacity by the year 2000. The CHP process produces both heat and electricity.</p>

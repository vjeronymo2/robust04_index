			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENTAGON, IN EFFICIENCY QUEST, TO MERGE COMMISSARY SYSTEMS  </P> <P> The separate Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps commissary systems and  supply depot operations will be merged to streamline operations and provide  better service, the Pentagon announced Friday.  </P> <P> The four systems, a Pentagon statement said, "constitute one of the largest  grocery store operations in the United States.  </P> <P> Consolidating them into a single organization will achieve the kinds of  efficiencies and economies available to a commercial grocery store chain."  </P> <P> There are 413 commissaries in the four branches of the military services,  Pentagon officials said.  </P> <P> A recent Defense Department study indicated that consolidation would save about  $90 million a year and improve service to members of the armed services and  their families, the statement said.  </P> <P> The department also intends to consolidate the supply depot operations of the  military services and the Defense Logistics Agency. The first consolidation  will take place among the five depots in the San Francisco Bay area, the  statement said.  </P> <P> The department's 35 supply depots in the United States operate 3,400  warehouses, storing supplies valued at $95 billion, plus $23 billion worth of  ammunition, the statement said.  </P></p>

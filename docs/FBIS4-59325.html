			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by "official military source" at the Defense </F> Ministry in Sanaa --date not given]    [Text] With God's help and support, the heroes of our brave  Armed Forces have continued their brave, heroic tasks in their  confrontation against the rebellious secessionist forces, which  are misled by the criminal and evil separatist elements in the  leadership of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], who are involved  in the plot against the people, unity, democracy, and  constitutional legitimacy.    Our Armed Forces in the southwest axis captured the 25th  Mechanized Brigade, stationed in the (?Faz) garrison, and seized  all its tanks, artillery, equipment, and vehicles. A number of  this brigade's officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers  surrendered to the ranks of Constitutional legitimacy who are  protecting Yemeni unity. In the same axis, in the  al-'Anad-(?al- Hawdah) sector, our Armed Forces inflicted on the  forces hostile to legitimacy and Yemeni unity huge losses in  equipment and weapons. In the al-Dali'-al-'Anad sector, the  Armed Forces continued their advance accomplishing their tasks  successfully.    In the Abyan-Aden axis, the forces affiliated with the  separatist forces -- which are hostile to unity and democracy  and which are devoted to serving the illegitimate desires of the  members of the bloody gang in the YSP leadership -- sustained  huge losses in equipment, weapons, and vehicles. These forces  retreated to rear positions after failing to carry out desperate  attacks.    Meanwhile, the heroes in the Armed Forces Air Defense in all  axes confronted the air raids carried out by the aircraft of the  forces of apostasy, which are hostile to the people and  Constitutional legitimacy, forcing these planes to flee. This  made the criminal secessionist forces resort to crazy methods,  which reveal their grudge, hysteria, and death throes, by firing  a number of missiles at peaceful populated cities and civilian  facilities, including the firing of two Scud missiles at Sanaa  early yesterday morning. One of these missiles fell in a big  residential area. This shows the state of hysteria and  cowardliness in which the igniters of the war are living as well  as their realization of the fate they will face soon, God  willing, now that their treacherous objectives of this war have  been aborted. Unity has been entrenched through the blood and  sacrifices of our valiant heroes in our Armed Forces and  Security Forces and by their great heroism in embodying their  loyalty to God, the homeland, the revolution, unity, and  democracy. Unity has also been entrenched through the entire  people's solidarity with their leadership and their righteous  sons in the Armed Forces and Security Forces in the battle aimed  at defending life and their great national and popular  achievements, championing the loftiest values and pan-Arab and  human principles of justice, and at making the rebels, the  enemies of people, homeland, legitimacy, and Constitutional  institutions taste the consequences of their acts and tyranny,  God willing.    God's victory is imminent.    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If you  will aid the cause of God, He will aid you and plant your feet  firmly. [Koranic verse]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jagodina, 7 May (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the assembly of the republic of Srpska, told Radio  Jagodina today that Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's  special envoy, is a man of peace and an esteemed diplomat and  that it is for this reason that the Muslims consider him  unsuitable.    "All diplomats and soldiers who have been objective and  unbiased in their quest for peace in these parts have been  branded as undesirables by the Muslims, who demanded their  dismissal," Krajisnik said. He stressed: "It is certain that  the Muslim government is backed and instigated by the United  States in its demand for Akashi's removal."    "To claim that Akashi has sided with the Serbs is an  abhorrent lie," Krajisnik said. Although he is undoubtedly one  of those responsible for the bombing of Serb positions around  Gorazde, in our books he is not among those most responsible.  That is why we are certainly not in favor of his dismissal, and  I hope that this will not happen," Krajisnik said.</p>

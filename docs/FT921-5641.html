			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / EC faces long battle over budget increase EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers yesterday prepared for a protracted wrangle over the Commission's plans to increase Community revenue by nearly a third over the next five years. The 1993-97 finance package is causing deep unease among richer member states, in particular Germany and the UK, the two largest net contributors, which have balked at such an increase. But foreign ministers kept their powder dry when Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, gave a spirited defence of the finance package, which calls for an increase in the budget from Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 47bn) now to Ecu87.5bn in 1997, at 1992 prices. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, foreign minister of Portugal which currently holds the EC presidency, produced snorts of disbelief among member states' diplomats when he described reaction to the package as 'indubitably very encouraging'. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, who was the most openly sceptical about the plan, said: 'People are reserving their fire,' Member states stand to pay significantly more under the plan, and their ministers used the closed meeting to map out a negotiating timetable. This looks set to run well into the UK presidency in the second half of this year. The budget increase is designed to accommodate the greater spending on regional aid, and to help Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland prepare for monetary union, agreed among the 'cohesion' aims at Maastricht summit in December. The rest is to finance farm reform, the EC's growing foreign policy commitments, and a sharpened research effort to strengthen industry. Mr Hurd reiterated Britain's contention that the EC can get two-thirds of the increase Brussels is seeking without raising the revenue ceiling. He added that farm spending should fall, not rise; that no figure was agreed at Maastricht on funding the four poorest countries; and that the increased research and training effort amounted to sanction for the Commission 'picking winners' in industry. Mr Delors rejoined by saying that, while the plan was not 'the bill for Maastricht', he had understood the summit to have agreed that 'cohesion was one of the supporting pillars of the Community'. He appealed for members not to sink to what he called 'budgetary guerrilla warfare,' telling journalists afterwards: 'We are building a Community, not a financial clearing house.' According to a senior Spanish official, Mr Delors told ministers that, if they wished to cut, they should look at fiscal transfers to the southern countries last. Farm reform, he said, needed short-term headroom to finance long-term change. He again maintained that spending on improving industrial competitiveness and on Community foreign policy was money the individual member states would have to pay out anyway.

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price tumbles to lowest for seven years GOLD TUMBLED through the bottom of its recent trading range on the London bullion market yesterday. It was fixed at consecutive seven-year lows of Dollars 327.20 a troy ounce in the morning and Dollars 326.95 in the afternoon, before closing at Dollars 326.45, a fall of 70 cents on the day. The fall in London followed pressure on the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) futures market from US commodity fund sales on Monday. The Comex April contract, which held above Dollars 327 am ounce on Monday, went to Dollars 326.60 in early trading yesterday. Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, said the fall was heralded last week by the decline of the commercial rand to 3.19 against the US dollar. At Dollars 328 an ounce, South African producers were able to sell their gold forward at R1,050 a troy ounce, giving them a healthy profit. Analysts in London yesterday pointed out that there is little apart from Far Eastern demand to support the gold price. 'There is a total lack of interest. People have other games to play,' said Mr Euan Worthington of SG Warburg, pointing out that inflation was no longer a factor in investment decisions, and that the US stock market is moving strongly ahead. 'We are in a situation where gold has been by-passed as an investment instrument in the Western World,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles of GNI, the London futures brokers. 'It is now used just for jewellery.' China has emerged as the main supportive factor for the gold market - a report last month from American Precious Metals Advisors of the US suggested that the country absorbed 800 tonnes (26m troy ounces) last year. This more than offset the 650 tonnes sold by central banks, including 400 tonnes by the Dutch. However, the threat of further central bank sales continues to hang over the bullion market. In addition producers have been able to lock in profits by forward selling as their currencies have weakened against the dollar. Gold has now broken through the bottom of its recent range of Dollars 327 to Dollars 332 a troy ounce, and many analysts expect further falls. 'Technically it is looking very very bad,' said Mr Eagles, who expected the price to fall rapidly if Dollars 325 was breached, possibly going below Dollars 300 by the end of the year.</p>

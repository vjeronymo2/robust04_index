			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- Leaders of the Czech  Social Democratic Party (CSSD) presented its deputies with a  recommendation to initiate a constitution-based revision of the  employment law, Vojtech Matejicny from the CSSD press department  told CTK today.    Before being passed by parliament, the employment bill was  criticized by the unions who organized an Old Town Square  demonstration on March 22 to highlight their reservations  against the possibility of a repeated conclusion of  limited-period work contracts and an article allowing pregnant  women to work night shifts.    Parliament passed the bill the day after. The coalition and  the Liberal Social National Party supported the bill while the  opposition including the CSSD voted against it. Czech President  Vaclav Havel signed the law on April 6.</p>

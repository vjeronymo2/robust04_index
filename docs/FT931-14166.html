			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers at odds on future of coal industry MR JOHN MAJOR chaired another cabinet committee on the future of the coal industry yesterday with no sign that the dispute between ministers, over how much the government should help, has been resolved. Minsters are at odds over how many pits should be saved, the extent and duration of any subsidy for coal - and the precedent such a subsidy may set. Downing Street said yesterday's meeting reviewed, rather than narrowed, the options available. Final decisions will not come for 'some time'. The meeting came as the Commons' trade and industry committee met to debate its report on the coal industry for which the government is waiting before announcing firm decisions. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is facing strong resistance from the Treasury over his proposals for possible subsidies. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, and Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, want subsidies to be strictly time-limited. They are understood to be backed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary who has a coal pit in his Nottingham Rushcliffe constituency. A 'union bashing' mentality in the cabinet was responsible for a serious misjudgement of the public mood over pit closures, according to former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, David Goodhart adds. Speaking on BBC radio, Sir Edward said: 'We've now got to be very careful that we aren't making changes in industrial relations legislation just for political reasons, to show that we're still bashing the unions. This psychology, I think, was the cause of the disaster over the miners'.</p>

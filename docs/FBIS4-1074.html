			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F> 20 April]    [Text] The ANC has repeatedly said that the National Party  [NP] has no programme or plan to place before the South African  public. It is consequently running a totally negative campaign,  trying to punch holes through the ANC's own carefully developed  Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP].    The NP's media conference of Tuesday 19th April was yet  another case in point. We do not want to be trapped into a  sterile argument about figures and estimates. But we think it  is appropriate to point up that these are the scare tactics used  in other campaigns in other countries in recent years. In the  USA, the public relations consultants employed by the NP,  attempted to use the same ploy against the Clinton/Gore  presidential campaign. In Britain the very same tactics were  used against the Labour Party. The executive summary of the  current document even makes the bizarre observation: "This  report is based on the costing of the Labour Party policies in  the 1987 and 1992 UK general elections... "We are at a loss to  explain its relevance."    To its credit, the NP did not conceal that its critique of  the RDP was initiated by one Mr Tony Karpel, assisted by Mr  Roelof Botha Jnr of the Rand Afrikaans University. This raises  the question, do these scary figures derive from serious  economic analysis, or are they thumb-sucks from manipulative PR  consultants?    We are dealing here with an election ploy, a public  relations  exercise that the NP prepared in secrecy. Our RDP is the result  of serious consultative processes, which were transparent, open  and involving a wide circle of people outside the ANC and its  allies. It included consultations with business, parastatals,  the trade unions, the civics, religious communities and, through  the people's forums, a host of other economic players.    During the short time that was available to us we have come  up with new economic policies, whereas the NP, in government for  46 years, has nothing to offer. The people of South Africa have  endured and suffered under the NP's policies for four decades.  Those policies have left us with the unenviable legacy of  massive unemployment, homelessness, economic decline and unequal  education. Whatever else may be said, it is crystal clear that  the NP has been an unmitigated disaster for this country.    The document prepared for the NP by Karpel completely  ignores  the real social and economic imperatives and trade-offs  associated with reconstruction and development. Instead it  tries to score political points by exaggerating the costs beyond  recognition while offering no solutions. Everyone agrees that  we must make choices in using our limited resources. It is  equally well-known that the legacy of 46 years of NP misrule  will weigh heavily on the new government.    Taking Tony Karpel's document at its word, it would appear  that the NP is opposed, among other things, to:     -  supervised and hygienic child deliveries;    -  equal tax treatment for women;    -  ten years of free, quality education for all children;    -  upgrading of hostels;    -  reduced fiscal drag.       The authors, Karpel and Roelof Botha Jnr, appear remarkably  ignorant of most current policy debates. This is hardly  surprising, since its principal author is a British consultant  while his South African junior partner has never been an active  participant in these.    Running like a red thread through the document, are a number  of groundless assumptions and bald assertions which the public  are expected to believe merely because they've been pronounced.  A telling example of this is the claim that: "Upgrading costs  have been realistically estimated at an average of R16,500  [rand] per 15 square metres (housing 4 beds)." Firstly, no  source is given for this astonishing assertion, which implies  that upgrading one room in a hostel costs about a third as much  as constructing an average township house.    With regard to taxes on women, again the document gives no  sources for its figures. There appears also to be the  assumption that women in this society earn as much as men. In  South Africa, which we all know to be extremely gender biased  that is a ludicrous assumption.    Every study of health care indicates that expenditures in  these areas repay themselves many times over in savings in other  areas of the health system. Thus the NP document does not use  the costs for patients in public hospitals nor does it take into  account the opportunity costs associated with unsupervised and  unhygienic child deliveries. These are extensive in economic  terms, even if we ignore, which we shouldn't, the costs in human  terms. Adequate prenatal care and birthing facilities  ultimately prove enormous net savings for the health care system  as a whole, in addition to the visible social benefits.    In another sleight of hand typical of the document, the  guesstimates it employs when discussing retraining of health  workers assume six-months of full-time retraining. This is  certainly not the normal way to upgrade professionals. A  programme of part-time study and workshops would come closer to  normal practice. While it does factor in the opportunity costs  - those of productivity loss based on its exaggerated  assumptions it ignores the much larger opportunity costs  entailed in continued neglect of primary health care. The  social costs of course elude the authors completely.    The costing of education is based on the assumption that  "quality education" requires the current wasteful, racially  differentiated spending that is at the centre of the NP's  current practice. The authors consequently argue that South  Africa cannot hope to achieve quality education for all. In the  long run, a national education budget of R23 billion should  suffice, provided the funds are used equally on all pupils and  the inefficiencies involved in 19 education departments and  bloated bureaucracy are eliminated. The NP seems to think that  South Africa cannot accomplish what virtually all other  countries with similar levels of economic development have  achieved.    When it comes to adult education, the sheer ignorance of the  authors leads them to make an alarming array of unfounded  assumptions. Just one example: The guesstimate suggests that  South Africans who cannot read and write have had no schooling  whatsoever. Even if that were the case it is a ridiculous  assumption to make that because a child requires at least four  years of education to be considered literate, and adult required  the same time frame to reach the same level.    No amount of scare-mongering can conceal the bitter, yet  incontrovertible truth that the NPs policies, past and present,  have wrought havoc on this country. By its constant red-baiting  the NP tries to imply that the ANC's policies are inspired by  communism. All fair-minded people know they are not. Our  policies are inspired by common sense. The common sense that  tells us that in the absence of an effort to address the basic  needs of our people there can be no stability. And that without  stability there will be no economic growth.    The ANC is convinced that our plan is realisable, workable  and affordable. What South Africa cannot afford is one day more  of the NP's misrule, economic mismanagement and continuing  corruption.    The ANC challenges the NP to come forward with its plan. We  shall not hold our breaths in expectation because the NP has  more than amply demonstrated its intellectual poverty. The NP  campaign, run by a party with no ideas of its own to offer, much  in the manner of a lazy schoolboy, has been content to literally  crib and copy the ANC's campaign down to our very slogans.  Perhaps we do however have this one consolation: "Imitation is  the sincerest form of flattery".</p>

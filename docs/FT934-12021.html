			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Moody's downgrades Commerzbank COMMERZBANK yesterday became the first German private sector bank to have its long-term credit rating downgraded, reflecting the impact of the European recession. Moody's Investors Service blamed a deterioration in the bank's asset quality for its cut in debt ratings of the bank, one of the three big German 'Grossbanken'. The downgrading prompted a sharp response from Commerzbank, which said its operating profits after provisions for bad and doubtful debt rose by a good 50 per cent in the first nine months of the year. 'Commerzbank today is a bank with strong earnings, a modern organisational structure, and internationally oriented,' it said. It said the downgrading was temporary, stressing that its rating remained higher than for other private sector international banks and that its top Prime-1 rating for commercial paper remained unchanged. Moody's reduced the long-term rating for the bank's senior debt to Aa2 from Aa1, saying that despite the bank's strong operating income Commerzbank's ability to 'cover high provisions with sustainable core earnings has deteriorated somewhat' and that its capitalisation was at the low end of its peer group. The senior debt rating of its Luxembourg subsidiary was lowered to Aa3 from Aa2. The downgrading affects some Dollars 3.9bn of long-term debt. 'We believe Commerzbank probably has been a little less conservative than its immediate peers and may be hit a little harder by the recession,' said Mr Gunther Stur, a senior analyst at Moody's in New York. Long-term debt from Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Bayerische Vereinsbank, Germany's other leading private-sector banks, is rated triple-A by both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. Commerzbank said that despite an increase in provisions to cover domestic bad and doubtful debts, the total outlay for provisions this year was likely to be lower than in previous years. This was because there were unlikely to be an increase loan loss reserves to cover country risks, the bank said.</p>

A communique issued today said Italy will also send first  aid  medical supplies in coordination with the World Health  Organization. As announced Saturday by Foreign Minister  Beniamino Andreatta, the head of the emergency intervention unit  at the ministry's Department for Development Cooperation,  Minister Vitaliano Napoleone, and Agostino Miozzo, a medical  expert on the department staff, arrived in Sarajevo yesterday.    The Italian surgeons will work in the main Sarajevo general  hospital, the Kosovo Hospital, in conjunction with WHO and will  be equipped with medical kits sent over.    Ten days ago, the communique disclosed, Doctor Miozzo was in  Sarajevo where he conferred with Bosnian authorities who  requested pediatric surgeons and specialists in facial and jaw  surgery, neurosurgeons, and those with experience in  rehabilitation surgery and war wounds.    Following the arrival yesterday of the doctor and the chief  of the emergency unit, the two Italians made arrangements for  sending twelve of the victims of the Saturday shelling to Italy,  where they will be placed under the care of the Social Affairs  Service of the premier's office.    (Reported today in the central Adriatic port city of Ancona,  near the Falconare Marittima Air Base, were preparations for the  arrival of a Canadian Air Force Hercules C-130 transport plane  with 15 of the people wounded in Sarajevo Saturday.  Accompanying them on the flight, conducted for the United  Nations High Commission for Refugees, will be an unknown number  of relatives of the victims.    (The first six, all between ages 17 and 25, were scheduled  to  leave Sarajevo in the early afternoon and the second group some  time later in the day, the Social Affairs Service and Italian  Red Cross said.    (It was also learned that an 11-year-old, Vladan Rajcevic,  who was among those wounded in the marketplace, was still in  critical condition in Ancona's Salesi Hospital where he is under  treatment for a perforated lung. The boy's parents, Danilo and  Retina Rajcevic, deaf mutes, arrived here yesterday.)</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Unease at review of Arts Council THE Arts Council yesterday gave a guarded response to a review of its working practices by accountancy firm Price Waterhouse commissioned by the National Heritage Department. Price Waterhouse made three suggestions for savings, the first of which it says would save Pounds 429,000 a year from a total Arts Council budget of Pounds 225m. The second would save Pounds 829,000. A third, more radical option, would save Pounds 2.2m but mean, in effect, the end of an independent Arts Council. Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, has indicated that he favours the second option, but the Arts Council said proper checks would have shown that the option would save about Pounds 390,000 - not Pounds 829,000 as suggested by Price Waterhouse. The council is also unhappy with calculations that its administration costs are 10p in the pound. It estimates them at less than 5p.</p>

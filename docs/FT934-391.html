			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Asian markets set records as Europe remains steady Stock markets in Europe and the US paused for breath yesterday but in Asia the year-end rally in world equities continued. Shares closed flat or slightly down in most Continental European markets but edged into record territory on Wall Street in quiet end of year trading. London markets were closed. In Asia, four markets finished at record levels. The biggest gainer in Asia was Hong Kong, where foreign buying pushed the market up 4.8 per cent to a new record, on strong volume, despite a warning from China about political reform. The Hang Seng index closed at 11,570.22, up 530.38 points, the biggest one-day rise on record. Highs were also set in Singapore, Bangkok and Karachi, with strong performances in Taiwan and Kuala Lumpur. The previous day's trading had set records in Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index rose 311.33 to 17,131.21, recovering half the 3.6 per cent it lost in the previous two trading days. Early today, the Nikkei was up around 130 points at about 17,260 after the first hour of trading. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained a further 0.8 points to finish at 3,793.7. In Germany, the DAX index touched a record intra-day high of 2,284.56 but ended floor trading at 2,242.82, a drop of 0.5 per cent from Monday's close. In later trading on the electronic Ibis system the DAX closed at 2,236.18. After three days of new records, French shares finished lower yesterday, with the CAC-40 index down 0.52 per cent. Shares in Spain lost all Monday's gains and more, closing 1 per cent down on the day, because of concern about Banesto. An interest rate cut in Belgium helped shares close 0.76 per cent higher at a new record. European government bond markets saw little activity, although the German government successfully launched its new 30-year bond. US Treasuries were steady above their lows, with the long bond down more than  1/4 , to yield 6.233 per cent. Sterling strengthened slightly in Continental trading. Against the D-Mark, it ended at DM2.563, up from Friday's DM2.545. Against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.5065 in London, from Dollars 1.502 on Friday, and rose to Dollars 1.508 in New York.

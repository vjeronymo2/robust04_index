			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Enskilda Ventures sells fund ENSKILDA Ventures, the London-based venture capital arm of the Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken Group, has sold its Scandinavian management buy-out fund, Scandinavian Acquisition Capital, to the fund's management. SAC, a SKr764m (Pounds 67.5m) fund, has been acquired by a new company called Industri Kapital, majority owned by Mr Bjorn Saven, former director of SAC. SAC, which has invested 70 per cent of its money, will be better placed to raise new funds if it is an independent company, Enskilda said. SAC's funds have all been provided by Scandinavian investors and all but one of its eight investments have been in Scandinavian companies, but it will retain its headquarters in London. SE-Banken said its fund management operation would remain an investor in SAC. Enskilda will retain control of European Acquisition Capital (EAC), an Ecu83m (Pounds 65.3m) fund raised last year to back buy-outs in the UK and continental Europe outside Scandinavia. EAC's first investment, of Pounds 6.5m, was in Tom Cobleigh, a Mansfield-based pub chain.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: VNU to double stake in TV station VNU, the Dutch publishing group, is to double its holding in the Dutch-language commercial television station RTL4 by acquiring a 19 per cent stake held by fellow publisher Elsevier for Fl 87m (Dollars 47m). The deal will give VNU a 38 per cent shareholding and make it the second largest shareholder in RTL4 after Luxembourg television group CLT, which owns 40 per cent. Other shareholders include banks, private investors and Philips, the Dutch electronics group, which holds 2 per cent. As part of the agreement, Elsevier has said that it will refrain from commercial broadcasting aimed at the Dutch market for the next three years, with the exception of regional and local broadcasting. VNU and Elsevier hold their stakes in RTL4, currently the only Dutch commercial station, through a joint venture company, European Media Investors, which will now be owned solely by VNU. Besides RTL4, which broadcasts to the Netherlands from Luxembourg to get around Dutch media laws, VNU also has an 11 per cent stake in Belgium's Flemish-language commercial station VTM.</p>

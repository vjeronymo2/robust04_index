			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RADICALLY DIFFERENT OPINIONS OF ACTIVIST'S 'JOURNEY OF CONSCIENCE'  </P> <P> The story on Westside political radical Mary Brent Wehrli filled me with anger  and pity ("A Westside Journey of Conscience," Feb. 26). The anger stems from  the apparent sense of satisfaction Wehrli derived from heckling the President  of the United States during his delivery of a speech.  </P> <P> A 47-year-old woman should know better than to conduct herself in such a  reckless, immature manner.  </P> <P> If Wehrli is so upset with the foreign policy of the Bush Administration, she  has several more respectable outlets by which to express her dissatisfaction,  such as running for office, financially supporting candidates who reflect her  views, or participating in organized political rallies that do not include  hurling unfounded accusations at the President.  </P> <P> My pity stems from Wehrli's seeming inability to even remotely realize that  what she did Feb. 6 at the Century Plaza was an outrageous breach of good  manners, and that she would have no reservations in attempting to embarrass the  President -- and herself and family -- again. Wehrli's headlong plummet into  radical, nonsensical politics has dealt a fatal blow to her perspective and  good judgment.  </P> <P> GUY R. GRUPPIE  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

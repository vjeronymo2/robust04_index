			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPEAKING FEES AND DOLE FOUNDATION  </P> <P> Sara Fritz's report about congressional speaking fees and charitable  foundations ("Speech Fees: Handy Tool for Congress," Part I, Jan. 16) was a sad  disservice to your readers and to disabled Americans.  </P> <P> As president and chief executive officer of the Dole Foundation -- one of The  Times targets -- I want an opportunity to set the record straight.  </P> <P> The Times claims that the Dole Foundation is "perhaps the most elaborate  outgrowth of excess honorariums." This statement is preposterous. In the four  years the Dole Foundation has operated, Sen. Robert Dole's (R-Kan.)  contribution of "excess" honorariums accounts for less than 1% of the total  funds we have received. The fact is that the vast majority of our funds come  from corporations and individuals, not congressmen.  </P> <P> Sen. Dole -- one of the nation's 36 million persons with a disability --  established the Dole Foundation in 1983 to help the disabled develop employment  skills and to make work areas accessible to them.  </P> <P> Times readers were not informed about the 10 programs we have funded in  California alone, which total $295,234, or about the hundreds of people with  disabilities across the nation who have been given marketable skills as a  result of the foundation's efforts.  </P> <P> I am proud of the accomplishments of this organization. Our purpose is to  enhance employment opportunities for people with disabilities, not to  "redistribute" honorariums.  </P> <P> JACKIE A. STRANGE  </P> <P> President and CEO  </P> <P> The Dole Foundation  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

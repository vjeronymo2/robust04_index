Production is folding fastest at enterprises in the  light and woodworking sectors. Dissatisfaction with the volume  of output has reached a record level of 83 percent in December.  For 81 percent of enterprises the demand in December was  inadequate.

The balance differential  (the indicator of the speed of change in the process) fell over  one month from -37 percent to -41 percent. The general  acceleration of the decline was fueled mainly by enterprises in  the woodworking and light industries, where the balances  registered at -56 percent and -50 percent. At the same time, the  pace of decline remains stable at machine-building  enterprises--about -40 percent.    The continuing production decline resulted in increased  dissatisfaction over the state of affairs at enterprises. The  share of "below norm" answers reached a record level of 83  percent in December. In December 1992 this indicator stood at 66  percent. The traditionally high dissatisfaction with the  December volume of output in machine building (80-91 percent)  was "fortified" by an increase in the share of "below norm"  replies at enterprises in the woodworking (from 61 percent to 89  percent) and light (from 68 percent to 83 percent) industries.  The situation has improved somewhat in the construction  industry--the result of our construction workers' habit for  shock labor in the end of the year. Another positive (although  unclear for how long) factor was an increased hope for  production growth among enterprises that consider their level of  production "below normal." While in November the share of such  hopes registered at 7 percent, in December it was 12 percent.  However, this category of respondents also displayed a certain  degree of pessimism--further decline in production has been  forecast at 46 percent of such enterprises (38 percent in  October and 40 percent in November).    A decline in satisfaction with the demand for the output  produced continued in December. The share of "below normal"  replies set a new record (81 percent). A decline in demand has  been noted by enterprises in all industry groups, with the  exception of the construction materials industry and printing.  The maximum number of "below normal" replies was received in the  light (89 percent vs. 73 percent in November), machine-building  (87 percent vs. 85 percent in November), and woodworking (67  percent vs. 62 percent in November) industries.    Demand limitations are beginning to exert a corresponding  influence on the behavior of an increasingly greater number of  goods producers--already 49 percent of the enterprises that  consider the demand for their output unsatisfactory foresee  cutbacks in production (the analogous indicator for November was  40 percent). The neutral reaction to insufficient demand also  declined--in December only 40 percent of the enterprises with  insufficient demand intended to sustain the current level of  production. Previously, this indicator stood at 54-57 percent.    A sharp decline in demand, noted by enterprises in  October-November 1993, immediately resulted in the increase of  excess inventories of finished products. However, cutbacks in  production, which did indeed follow the decline in demand,  permitted enterprises in general to halt the growth of excess  inventories. Nevertheless, the share of "above normal" replies  reached 78 percent in the light industry (63 percent in  November), 56 percent in woodworking (38 percent in November),  and 50 percent in the construction industry (40 percent in  November). At machine-building plants excess inventories  declined from 56 percent to 49 percent, and in the food  processing industry the "below normal" replies are more frequent  than "above normal." Still, only about one-half (48 percent) of  the enterprises with excess inventories plan to cut back  production in the next few months.  <H5>  Expected Changes in Production and Prices </H5>   In December increasingly more enterprises expected a  production decline. The share of "will decline" answers reached  42 percent--a record level for the past 15 months. The hope of  maintaining the existing level of production declined to 46  percent (54 percent in November). The highest expectations of  cutbacks have been registered in the petrochemical industry (63  percent of enterprises), machine building (50 percent), and the  light industry (39 percent). At enterprises in the  metallurgical, food processing, and printing industry the  prevalent answer was "no change." Production growth is possible  only in the woodworking industry, where the share of "will  increase" answers (44 percent) is higher than that of "will  decline" answers (23 percent).    The expected changes in the volume of production affect the  producers' pricing policy. Enterprises that foresee an increase  in production are less likely to plan to raise prices on their  products than enterprises that expect a decline in  production--74 percent as compared to 84 percent.    Since the beginning of the fall, surveys register a decline  in inflationary expectation in industry--the forecast of price  increases for the output produced has dropped from 96 percent in  September to 81 percent in December. A lower level of  inflationary expectations was last registered in October 1992  (79 percent). The smallest expectation of prices rising within  the next few months are in the food processing industry (where  the balance of "will increase"-"will decline" measured at 56  percent), the construction industry (67 percent), and machine  building (78 percent).

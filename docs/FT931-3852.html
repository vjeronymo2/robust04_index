			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Few buyers are found for Isosceles debt LENDERS to Isosceles, the Gateway food retail group in the middle of restructuring talks with its banks and shareholders, are finding little success in selling debt in the secondary market, traders said. Although many deals have been mooted, at prices around half face value for the senior debt, few trades have been completed, one New York based dealer said. Estimates were that about Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m of the Pounds 1.05bn of senior debt had been sold. The company said it had not been notified of any debt assignments. Buyers could, however, purchase a 'sub-participation' in a loan which would mean the original bank would still be regarded as the lender. One banker involved in the refinancing talks said that anyone buying the debt was taking a risk since the form of the restructuring was still not agreed. An investor buying a sub-participation would not even get a 'seat at the table' in the talks. Bankers said the Isosceles talks were progressing and they hoped to agree the refinancing in principle by the end of the month. Isosceles has a standstill agreement with its banks until May 28, though one said 'this could always be extended'.</p>

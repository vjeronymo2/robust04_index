			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Before It Is Too Late," the  newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on developments in the peace  process, and Israel's procrastination and maneuvering, which aim  to create additional excuses for evading the requirements of  peace and derail the peace process. The paper says: Now that  there is renewed talk of the possible resumption of the peace  talks, Israel has demonstrated an enthusiastic excitement about  the peace process. While focusing its attention on the  implementation of the Gaza- Jericho accord, which yielded  countless advantages in its favor, Israel seeks to play games on  the other tracks of the negotiations. Israel reaped the fruits  of games with the Palestinians when it concluded the Oslo accord  with them. This is because this accord contains serious and  secret loopholes that allowed Israel to pounce upon the  Palestinians, who departed from the overall inter-Arab  coordination regarding the peace process.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Israel is certain that it cannot ensnare  any other Arab side by making it depart from the Arab consensus  regarding the need to achieve a just and comprehensive peace.  Nonetheless, it has continued to make desperate attempts in this  regard. If anything, this policy indicates that Israel is not  concerned with just, comprehensive, and durable peace. This is  because such peace is the antithesis of the expansionist Israeli  scheme and its Zionist objectives, which aim to achieve a  version of peace that allows Israel to have peace, and, at the  same time, retain its control over the territories.    The paper adds that Israel is only interested in the  benefits  it can draw from the peace process, particularly since it has  continued to evade any discussion of substantive issues in the  bilateral talks, namely, the issues of occupation and withdrawal.    Concluding its commentary, the paper says: The solution, as  all observers believe, lies in activating the role of the United  States as a full partner that should honor its pledges and  commitments, particularly since it is the party that launched  the peace initiative in the first place. Otherwise, the peace  process will be jeopardized, and the region will remain  vulnerable to worst case scenarios.    Under the headline "Israel's Crimes Before the International  Community," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher has reiterated his willingness to make  a fresh tour of the region to activate the peace process,  without committing himself to a forceful role in efforts to  address the Arab-Israeli conflict. It was no coincidence that  Christopher's offer came in the aftermath of Israeli attacks on  southern Lebanon and amidst the thunder of bullets that kill and  wound scores of Palestinians of the occupied Arab territories  every day. That is why he has absolved himself of any  undertaking to play a forceful role. He is well aware that  progress in the peace process is now contingent upon the Israeli  stand, which seeks to obstruct the regional peace process.    The paper believes that Israel aims to encircle the new  peace  opportunity that could be created if the peace talks are resumed  in Washington. The paper notes that in addition to political  maneuvering and foot-dragging, Israel has begun to carry out a  series of successive massacres that started with the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre. This series of massacres is continuing.  Israel is now covering up its massacres with fresh ones, as  manifested in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church blast in Lebanon.    AL-BA'TH adds: By so doing, the Rabin government seeks to  distract those concerned with the peace process. It wants to  prompt them to address the new problems it is creating. Nobody  will be taken in by this policy, which has been stepped up  recently, particularly in the aftermath of the Geneva summit.  It is difficult for the Rabin government, regardless of the  tactics it is employing, to influence the course of the peace  negotiations, or to derail them.    Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH says: International  efforts to advance the peace process and resume the Washington  negotiations have become extremely necessary to end regional  tension and halt the Israeli anti-Arab terrorism, repression,  and massacres.</p>

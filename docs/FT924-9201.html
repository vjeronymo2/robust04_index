			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Saga Petroleum reports earnings down to NKr661m SAGA PETROLEUM, Norway's biggest independent oil company, has reported a NKr41m (Dollars 6.41m) decline in nine-month net profits to NKr661m due to lower crude oil prices and higher oil exploration costs. Group operating revenue rose by NKr671m to NKr3.86bn as operating profit slipped by NKr94m to NKr903m. Saga said exploration costs rose by NKr85m to NKr243m in the period. The group said that it would consider writing down the value of its 12.4 per cent shareholding in Elkem, the troubled Norwegian metals producer, in connection with 1992 accounts. Saga said Elkem's shares had been booked at NKr75 a share, but Elkem yesterday announced details of a rights issue in which the par value of its shares will be written down to NKr20 a share from NKr50. Saga said petroleum production had risen to 3.2m barrels of oil equivalent from 2.5m.</p>

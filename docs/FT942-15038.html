			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Confrontation avoided over Johannesburg march The Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party, which is boycotting South Africa's historic elections, yesterday pulled back from confrontation over a protest march banned by police to prevent bloodshed, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. But Inkatha Youth Brigade Chairman Charles Loliwe, announcing the postponement of today's march in Johannesburg, said IFP activists would defy the authorities if they banned the protest once a fresh date was announced. A march by Zulus in South Africa's commercial capital on March 28 sparked clashes which killed at least 53 people.</p>

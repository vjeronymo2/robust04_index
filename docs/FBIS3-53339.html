The evidence, he said, can be found in  Israel's continuing implementation of measures isolating  Jerusalem from the rest of the occupied territories and its  rejection of any demands for the reversal of these measures.    The Israelis, he said, are still using the Palestinian  detainees and deportees as hostages to blackmail the Palestinian  side. The official, PLO Executive Committee Member Sulayman  al-Najjab, who was talking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, said that,  during the recent negotiations, the Israelis hinted that they  were willing to release a new batch of detainees if the  Palestinians accepted the recent Israeli proposals on  supervision and control of the crossing points and bridges.    On the results of the latest round of negotiations held by  the liaison mission recently in Cairo, al-Najjab said: "That  round did not achieve any tangible progress because the Israeli  side retreated from its previous positions adopted in Paris and  Tunis." [passage omitted]    The Israeli Government, al-Najjab said, is now acting  without  regard or consideration for the Declaration of Principles and  behaving as if that agreement did not exist.    Al-Najjab stressed that the security issue, which the  Israeli  side uses as a pretext, insisting on the article in the  agreement which gives it responsibility for external security,  does not concern Israel alone, because it is a matter of mutual  concern.    He said that the Israeli side overlooks a fact which is  linked to and not less important than the security issue, namely  the stipulations in the Declaration of Principles agreement  regarding the Palestinian right to control the parts of their  homeland from which the Israeli Army withdraws and which, in the  first stage, are the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. [passage  omitted]    Al-Najjab added: We cannot forfeit this acquired right  because that would not only make the withdrawal meaningless but  would also clearly set a ceiling for the entity which we aim to  set up, making it just autonomy under full Israeli control with  no prospect of development towards independence. [passage  omitted]    Al-Najjab called on the Arab and international parties  concerned with the peace process and its success to take the  necessary steps to make the Israelis change their position and  respect the provisions of the Declaration of Principles  agreement and its implementation dates. He affirmed that, in  maintaining its intransigent position, Israel tries to exploit  the poor coordination among the Arab parties participating in  the peace process. [passage omitted]    Al-Najjab urged the U.S. Administration to take firmer  stands  against Israeli policies and to take a more comprehensive view  of the nature of the obstacles preventing progress in the  negotiations instead of maintaining the current U.S. position  which fully adopts the Israeli viewpoint.    In conclusion, al-Najjab stressed that the Israeli position  threatening to torpedo the negotiations should be a new  incentive for the Palestinians to close their national ranks,  eliminate all the loopholes that have emerged, and open the way  for national dialogue on two fronts, the first being the front  of the forces which support the agreement, and the aim here  should be to enhance the Palestinian leadership's performance,  develop the PLO's methods of work, and increase participation of  representatives of all Palestinian groups and forces inside and  outside the occupied territory in the current political process  and in the process of national reconstruction.    The second front, he said, is that of the Palestinian  patriotic forces opposed to the agreement with whom dialogue  should continue because the disagreement between the two fronts  is about the means and not the aims.

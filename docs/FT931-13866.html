			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's opportunity MR CLINTON'S inauguration marks a watershed. His will be the first post-cold war presidency; he himself is the first president born after the second world war. The desires of the American people meet the instincts of Mr Clinton in the belief that renewal starts at home. But it cannot end there. By what he does and what he fails to do, he will define not merely the future of his own country, but that of the world as a whole. He acknowledged this in an inaugural address whose purpose was inspirational. 'There is no clear division today between what is foreign and what is domestic' he said. 'The world economy, the world environment, the world Aids crisis, the world arms race affect us all.' The US remains the indispensable global leader, but acting in that capacity is also in its own interests. Mr Clinton's challenge is to link his domestic objectives to his country's global role. To succeed he must show not just his intelligence, which is evident, nor his political skill, which is unquestionable, but his capacity to choose. The formation of his cabinet gave something to almost every interest. His presidency must not. Fortunately for Mr Clinton, his opportunity to make things happen is exceptional. The American economy is recovering, which means he can eschew short-term fixes. Congress is dominated by his own party. That could be said of Jimmy Carter as well. But the Democrats of today are both desperate for success and fearful of the American people's reaction to failure. To this receptivity at home must be added fluidity abroad. With the collapse of communism, the shape of the global polity can be refashioned. Others may influence where the world will go, but nobody can rival Bill Clinton in his capacity to determine the outcome. Choice starts at home. The new president should leave economic recovery in the capable hands of Mr Alan Greenspan and focus instead, on two strategic issues: the role and financing of American government and reform of the American health system. A credible programme to eliminate the budget deficit is urgent. Since the US needs more public investment and probably more current spending as well, the answer is higher taxes. The introduction of a value added tax is the best solution. Higher taxation of petrol could be a complement. Reform of the health system to provide adequate coverage for all, at a bearable cost, will prove both technically and politically difficult. It is nevertheless essential. Internationally, Mr Clinton has the chance to help create a truly global liberal economy, one of the great objectives of postwar US statesmanship. But first Mr Clinton must resist the inclination of some Americans towards narrow-minded mercantilism and of others towards a short-sighted moralism. Some of those who surround the new president believe that the best way to spread human rights is to withdraw opportunities to trade. They are wrong, particularly in the the most important case, that of China. Others believe that the success of American industry requires an aggressively unilateralist trade policy. They too are wrong. To be effective even in its own terms, US industrial policy has to be disciplined by the international rules that have so long been a goal of US policy. Completing the Uruguay Round is in US interests. So too is greater support for Mr Yeltsin's reforms than afforded in practice by Mr Bush. Mr Clinton's in-tray is full, but he has a brief opportunity to set his own agenda. He will be a successful president only if he makes the hard choices that he blurred in his search for the office. He must also persuade the American people and fellow politicians to accept what he decides. Yesterday, he asked his fellow citizens to break the 'bad habit of expecting something for nothing'. He will need all his political skills to make that message stick.</p>

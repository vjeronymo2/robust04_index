Greeting the  significant day, functionaries and workers in the building  materials industry sector are filled with the burning  determination to produce more building materials and to supply  them to socialist construction projects at their work sites,  which have been built into chuche-oriented and self-reliant  building materials bases that firmly rely on their own affluent  raw materials and fuel.    Reporter Yi Hak-sil, of the Central Broadcasting Station,  met  with Chang Tae-pong, vice minister of the Building Materials  Industry Ministry, and Han Song-chon, deputy director of a  bureau of the ministry.    [Begin recording] [Yi Hak-sil] I congratulate you on the  Building Materials Day.    [Chang Tae-pong] Thank you. I feel deep emotion in greeting  this significant day. Thirty years ago, on 8 January 1964, the  great leader convened a consultative meeting of functionaries in  the building materials industry sector and made there a historic  speech entitled "On some measures to develop building materials  industry." The great leader's historic speech at the meeting was  a programmatic guideline in founding and developing a  self-reliant, modern, and our own style building materials  industry. This is why our functionaries and workers in our  building materials industry sector have significantly celebrated  8 January every year as the Building Materials Day to  commemorate forever the day which opened an epochal turning  point in developing the building materials industry of the  country.    [Yi] We can say that our building materials industry has  traversed the road of rapid development thanks to the great  leader's wise leadership and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il's energetic guidance. What do you say?    [Han Song-chon] That is right. The great leader took epochal  measures for developing the building materials industry right  after the national liberation and since then he has wisely lead  on to build building materials production bases throughout the  country.    Our building materials industry today has greeted a new  heyday in its development thanks to the tested leadership and  energetic guidance of the dear comrade leader who is upholding  the great leader's lofty intent. We can say with great dignity  and confidence that large-scale cement plants and many building  materials production bases have been built throughout the  country thanks to the wise leadership and great consideration of  the great leader and the dear comrade leader.    We will also further plan and coordinate organizational and  political work and production guidance so that all work sites  that have been built into self-reliant and modern building  materials production bases, which can outstandingly guarantee  any large-scale construction projects, can produce more building  materials. Thus, we will further enhance the popular  masses-centered socialism of our own style through the success  of more building materials production. [end recording]</p>

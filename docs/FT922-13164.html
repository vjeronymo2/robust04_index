Mrs Heather Ryan, president of the AMMA, told her union's annual conference in Birmingham that teachers had 'been forced to breaking point' by the government's 'muddled planning and impossible targets, rigidly imposed without thought'. She added: 'Politicians and Civil Service advisers have approached education like vivisectionists, using schools as laboratories for doctrinaire curriculum, assessment and funding techniques, squeezing the life and creativity out of the education service.' Mrs Ryan said AMMA, the third-largest teachers' union, would fight to retain coursework in the GCSE exam and to secure a general teaching council for England and Wales that would 'give teachers a right to influence government on key issues on which we have the authority of our hard-won professional expertise'.</p>

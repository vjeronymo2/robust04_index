			<p>BFN     [Text] With hostilities between the Cambodian government  and Khmer Rouge guerrillas intensifying, Thailand is to open a  border check-point to allow temporary refuge to affected  Cambodians, according to a spokesman of the Burapha Force.    Col Prayun Thamwongsa said neither side was sincere in  wanting to solve the conflict and the June 16 negotiations  failed because of their hardline positions.    Battles between the two factions have become more intense  since the talks broke down, according to Prayun.    The battles in Cambodia's Banteay Meanchey province, near  the  Thai-Cambodian border, saw some bombs falling on Thai soil in  Tambon Khlong Luk, Aranyaprathet District, Sa Kaeo Province.  Residents of both Bantaey Meanchey and Sa Kaeo province have  been seriously affected by the battles.    Recently, the Banteay Meanchey governor, the commissioner of  the Burapha Force, and a senior Cambodian militarist had met to  discuss the plight of border residents affected by the fighting.    They agreed to allow Cambodians to temporarily enter Thai  soil at Tambon Khlong Luk from July 1, according to Prayun.    However, the re-opening of the Klong Luk check-point for  Cambodians was changed to June 30 because the Sa Kaeo governor  would not be available to attend the check-point reopening  ceremony on July 1.    The re-opening ceremony will be held at the middle of the  friendship bridge in Tambon Klong Luk.    Prayun said officials of the two countries also agreed that  each party would control its men from committing any offence on  the other country's soil. Any party violating the accord would  have to pay compensation.    In the meantime, Col Woranan Namwong, a representative of  the  Suranari Force, warned Thai people along the Thai-Cambodian  border not to cross into Cambodian territory as they could  become casualties of the fighting.</p>

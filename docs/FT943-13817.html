			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / People: Fiat snaps up Renault's Caperan - Names in the News Fiat Auto has wooed Loic Caperan, formerly Renault's commercial director for France, to Turin, where he will become the Italian carmaker's overall commercial director from January 1, writes Andrew Hill. This could be a good time to join Fiat Auto; it has just launched the Punto, to wide acclaim, and has plans to produce 18 new models by 1996. The Fiat group, after heavy losses in 1993, expects to break even in 1994. Caperan's decision to leave Renault was announced in May, after nearly 25 years there. He had spent five years as commercial director for France, and was reported to be frustrated that Renault could not make room for him to develop within the company. During his career with Renault, he worked in Germany, Austria and for a time was director-general of Renault UK. In the highly competitive automotive sector, the move is certainly not as dramatic as the now notorious job-switch of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former General Motors director who joined Volkswagen of Germany. But analysts have interpreted Caperan's appointment as a further sign of the internationalisation of Fiat, which has seen its share of the domestic market decline over the last decade and is seeking to increase its share abroad. At Fiat, Caperan, 51, will initially work alongside the current commercial director, Guglielmo Chiarle, who is to move on within the Fiat group at the end of the year. Caperan will then take on full responsibility for the Fiat, Lancia and Alfa Romeo marques around the world.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Fidelity's alternative equity strategy - Philip Coggan weighs the pros and cons of a new way of investing in shares MANY PEOPLE like the idea of investing in shares but are frightened of the risks. They remember the effects of the 1987 Crash and are wary of a repeat. So the marketing slogan of the moment is: equity investment with reduced risk. One approach has been taken by the guaranteed funds (see page II), which protect investors against falls in capital if they retain their holding for a set period. An alternative strategy was unveiled this week by Fidelity, the US fund management group. Its new set of unit trusts - the Stabiliser Growth Range - uses futures and options to try to reduce the risks involved in equity investment. Futures and options tend to be associated in the public mind with speculation, and indeed they can be used for that purpose. But they also have a use as a form of insurance against disaster. Suppose an investor has shares in British Telecom. He believes that in the long run, BT shares are a good investment but fears that in the short term, the price might fall sharply, perhaps because of some bad economic news. He could sell all his shares with the aim of buying them back if the price falls. But that method would be costly and he would risk missing out on any BT share price rise. Instead, he could buy an option on BT shares, giving him the right to sell at, say, 360p. He would pay a premium of a few pence per share to do so. If the share price drops to 300p, he could exercise his option and sell his BT shares at 360p. Alternatively, he could sell his option to someone else. If BT shares are at 300p, an option to sell at 360p is obviously worth at least 60p. This profit would offset the loss on his BT holding, and would allow him to retain his shares in the hope of a rebound. However, if BT shares increased in price, he could simply let the option lapse. He would have lost the premium but he would have benefited from the rise in BT shares. By using such methods, Fidelity's aim is an investment which does not fall as precipitously as the index in a bear market, but does not rise as quickly as the index in a bull market. A rough guide might be that if the index falls by 50 per cent, Fidelity's fund will drop by 15 per cent. The bulk of the trust holdings - between 60 and 90 per cent - will be held in cash, with the manager holding the rest in various combinations of shares, futures and options. There will be four funds, based in the UK, America, Europe and Japan respectively. The UK fund will have a gross yield of around 5 per cent per annum. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, with an initial charge of 5.25 per cent (1 per cent discount between November 2 and November 23) and an annual charge of 1.5 per cent. So will these new products appeal to investors? There are a few snags. Unlike the guaranteed products, investors are not certain that their capital is safe. They do not even have the comfort of knowing that their maximum loss is, say 50 per cent. Of course, the same is true of investors in all conventional unit trusts - but that is precisely the problem Fidelity is trying to address. One really has to rely on the manager's skill to ensure that the assumed benefits of the trusts - in terms of reduced risk - will accrue. Fidelity has been running the funds for institutional investors for 15 months - with some success. The Japanese fund, for example, has shown a modest rise even though the Tokyo market has fallen. The tax position of investors is the same as on any other unit trust - that is any gain is subject to CGT and any income subject to income tax. Fidelity funds are thus more tax-efficient and flexible than most guaranteed products, with investors able to invest and withdraw at any time. It will be interesting to see whether the idea takes off. Fidelity says: 'Our aim is to give investors most of the benefit of equity investment whilst enabling them to sleep at night' - but it is important to remember that these funds can lose money. Investors could be forgiven for waiting to see how the trusts perform over the next year or two before backing this relatively new concept.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Alliance &amp; Leicester to shut administrative site ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester, the UK's fourth largest building society, is to close its administrative office in Hove, East Sussex, with the loss of 700 jobs to the town over the next four years. The withdrawal from Hove, where Alliance Building Society was based before its merger with the Leicester in 1985, dismayed local councils. The area's unemployment rate is above the national average. Mr Peter White, the society's chief executive, said it had to rationalise administrative sites, and would be concentrating its retail financial services operation in Leicester. He said some redundancies, almost all at Hove, would be necessary but that it was too early to say how many. Some staff would be relocated. The first department to leave Hove will be computer services which will move to Leicester in the next six months. Mr Michael Ray, director of planning at Hove Council, described the closure as 'a devastating blow to the local economy'. Council officers are to seek a meeting with the society. Mr Paul Bevan, economic development officer at Brighton Council, said he was concerned because the financial services sector was one of the main employers in the area. The society employs about 9,500 staff in the UK, more than 1,000 of whom are employed in sites in or near Leicester, and more than 3,000 of whom are based in Bootle on Merseyside. Mr White emphasised that the branch network in Sussex would not be affected by the changes, and said the measures were needed to improve efficiency and customer service. Increased competition within the financial services sector has put growing pressure on institutions to reduce their administrative costs. A&amp;L's cost-income ratio rose much more than the average for the building society sector after its acquisition of Girobank in 1990.</p>

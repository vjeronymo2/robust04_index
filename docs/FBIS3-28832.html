As was said by the Ambassador of Laos to Mongolia Mr.  Chaleng  Varinthrasak, the two countries and peoples from time immemorial  have established traditionally good relations. Mongolia and  Laos have exchanged visits of their leaders rendering mutual  assistance and support both in the cause of defence and  strengthening of their countries and on the international scene.  The "friendship" hospital and the cattle breeding farm built  for residents of the Province of Siengkhuang are symbolizing the  friendly relations of the two countries. At present the  cooperation in the spheres of economy, trade, and culture should  be promoted which is nowadays more needed than whenever taking  into account the possibilities of the two sides being based on  the principles of equality and mutual benefit, the ambassador  noted.    In late February of the current year the Mongolian president  is likely to pay official visits to such countries as India,  Thailand, Laos and Vietnam.</p>

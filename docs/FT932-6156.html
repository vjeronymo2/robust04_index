			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: Standa net ahead 23% for year STANDA, the big Italian retailing chain controlled by Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest concern, raised net group profits by 22.9 per cent, to L38.1bn (Dollars 25.77m), last year. The improvement came on the back of a 9.2 per cent rise in sales to L4,398bn. The increase in revenues matches that at Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailer, controlled by Fiat. It corroborates analysts' forecasts that the two big retailers have been gaining ground in the recession at the expense of small family outlets. Moreover, Standa's increase is based on a broadly-unchanged number of outlets. The improvement has continued into this year, with a 9.5 per cent rise in group sales in the first quarter, it said. In January, Standa bought 60 per cent of the regional Essebi supermarkets chain for L220bn, payable over three years. Consolidating Essebi, in which Standa has an option to buy the remaining 40 per cent for L75bn this year, will push up group turnover to about L5,000bn this year - within sight of Rinascente's market leadership. The company is paying an unchanged dividend of L300 a share on ordinary shares and L330 on savings stock. The earnings recovery follows aggressive marketing and continuing restructuring to lower costs. At operating level, profits soared to L68.2bn from L27.6bn. The earnings rise after tax was depressed by higher taxation and extraordinary items, including about L15bn in restructuring costs.</p>

He enlisted in the Navy when he was 17 and,  during World War II, served in North Africa, where he assisted French  Legionnaires. He left the Navy after the war but reenlisted a short time later,  volunteering for the Underwater Demolition Team.  </P> <P> In 1966, he joined the U.S. Agency for International Development and served as  a logistics adviser in Vietnam for eight years.

The book will be  sent to a publisher early next year.  </P> <P> Foss is survived by eight children, Stephan Foss and Stewart Foss of Rhode  Island; Frank J. Foss Jr. of Coronado; Duncan Foss and William Foss of Imperial  Beach; Martita Foss-Ricketson of Oceanside; Margaret Foss of San Marcos; Maria  Foss of Chula Vista and seven grandchildren.

			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> REBELS ATTACK ARGENTINE BASE; UP TO 24 DEAD  </P> <P> Armed civilians seized a small military base near the capital today, and up to  24 people were killed or wounded before soldiers firing tank shells, mortars  and machine guns retook most of the base, news reports and officials said.  </P> <P> The civilian attackers who stormed the base carried pamphlets supporting  officers who have led three previous uprisings, the private news agency Diario  y Noticias said.  </P> <P> "Militarily, the situation at the 3rd Infantry Regiment at La Tablada is  dominated," the secretary for state intelligence, Facundo Suarez, told the  government news agency Telam about 10 hours after the incident began.  </P> <P> He admitted, however, that some civilian attackers remained inside, and gunfire  could be heard coming from the base as he spoke on the radio.  </P> <P> DyN, the news service, quoted a military source it did not identify as saying  at least 20 of the estimated 50 civilian attackers were killed or wounded  during fighting.  </P> <P> Hospital officials said at least four soldiers were killed and 12 wounded in  the fighting, along with one reporter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Caravan of Insurgents  </P> <P> The attack by the rebels began about 3 a.m., when civilians in a truck crashed  through the regiment's main gate, DyN said. Six cars followed, with 40 to 50  people taking part in the attack, news agencies reported.  </P> <P> According to DyN, as they entered the base, the civilians threw pamphlets  supporting what is known as the "New Argentine Army" of Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, who  led short-lived army uprisings in April, 1987, and January, 1988. Rico was  dismissed and now is in prison.  </P> <P> Two small tanks opened the noon counterattack, firing on the officers' club, in  which the civilians were thought to be isolated, Telam said. Sporadic shooting  continued for several hours.  </P> <P> The Ministry of Defense, anticipating a possible fourth insurrection against  the government in the past 21 months, bolstered defenses at Government House  and the official residence of President Raul Alfonsin, Telam said.  </P></p>

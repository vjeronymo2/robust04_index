			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- Yu Ho-chun, director of  the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front  for the Reunification of the Fatherland [DFRF], released a  statement to the press on June 2 expressing the hope for an  early meeting with South Korean political parties, organisations  and public figures to discuss the convocation of a national  conference.    Recalling that a consultative meeting of representatives of  the government, political parties and public organisations of  the DPRK on the 25th of May selected the North side's delegates  to the preparatory committee of the national conference and, at  the same time, urged the South Korean authorities to show an  affirmative response to the North's proposal for the convocation  of a national conference and select the South side's delegates  to the preparatory committee as soon as possible, thereby  keeping step with the North, Yu Ho-chun said the South Korean  authorities, however, are still taking a wrong position.    The true road of patriotism which should be chosen by the  nation at present is to oppose war and confrontation and for all  the compatriots in the North, South and overseas to be  reconciled and united, transcending all the differences, and the  most reasonable way for it is to convene a national conference.    If the conference is to be convened as scheduled, we think,  it is necessary for the political parties, organisations and  public figures in the North and South who want reunification to  meet in whatever form, to begin with, and have open-hearted  discussions for a successful conference under the condition  where the preparatory committee for the national conference has  not yet been formed and the South Korean authorities are laying  hurdles in its way.    From this point of view the DFRF Central Committee urges the  South Korean political parties, organisations of reunification  movement and politicians and public figures who want contacts  with us to meet in whatever form as soon as possible at any  place.    The South Korean authorities should not bar the  representatives of the South Korean political parties and  organisations and patriotic-minded figures from contacting us,  but, though belatedly, positively respond to the proposal for  the convocation of a national conference desired by all the  fellow countrymen, clearly mindful that the convocation of the  historic national conference is a national-historical demand.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (18): A cloud over the 'economic miracle' - Amid political uncertainty, Poland still owes commercial creditors more than Dollars 12bn. Peter Mayo Elstob finds that past defaults mean that credit insurers are treating the country cautiously / Short-term trade credit / Poland POLAND'S past is working against it. In spite of its present performance, the nation's short-term creditworthiness is suffering because of the massive defaults of the past and fears about its ability to stay on the rails in the future. When Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department resumed medium-term insurance cover for exports to Poland in July, the country had been 'off-cover' since it first defaulted on its external debt payments in 1982. But in addition to its debt to official creditors (which stood at Dollars 33bn until it negotiated a 50 per cent reduction in 1991), Poland still owes commercial creditors more than Dollars 12bn which, unlike the official debt, has still not been rescheduled. Against this background, the resumption of ECGD cover - which is restricted to the export of capital and semi-capital goods, projects and services - is perhaps more of a political than a business decision. Like other western countries, the UK is anxious not to be seen putting obstacles in the way of Polish reform. But Poland's political uncertainty (which has increased since the success of left-wing parties in the September 19 general elections) and doubts about the sustainability of its 'economic miracle' mean that exporters, banks and commercial credit insurers remain cautious towards trade finance. Trade Indemnity, for example offers cover on short-term trade finance with Poland, but only as part of a wider portfolio of risk, says James Fairrie, who advises the London-based company on export finance. NCM Credit Insurance, Britain's leading export credit insurer, which took over the privatised short-term part of ECGD's operations, offers cover for Poland but at a 3.5 per cent surcharge over its flat rate premium. This is high, reflecting NCM's perception of Polish risk (it charges 4.5 per cent for Lebanon), but NCM points out that the exporter receives pre-credit risk cover, whereas a confirmed letter of credit (l/c) although cheaper is only valid against shipment of goods. An exporter manufacturing, say, turbines built to a particular specification, may find it worthwhile to make use of the pre-credit cover provided by NCM or other insurers. If his customer becomes insolvent before his tailor-made goods can be shipped, he can claim on his policy. If, however, the goods being exported are more generally saleable, the exporter may find that an l/c confirmed by a well known London-based bank is a preferable route. Even if the exporter holds an NCM policy, he will not be charged the surcharge if he has a confirmed l/c. UK banks are reluctant to accept l/cs issued by any but a handful of Polish banks, all state-owned or ex-state-owned. Of the more than 100 Polish banks which now exist, most have been started up in the past few years as privately-owned concerns. The bulk concentrate on the domestic market but, being for the most part small and not sufficiently known to international banks, they probably could not engage in the financing of foreign trade even if they wanted to. In practice, even the specialist banks are prepared to deal with no more than (and often less than) the dozen or so state-owned banks which resulted from the hiving-off of the regional branches of the old monolithic national bank. The only exceptions to this rule are the recently privatised Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, which counts the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development among its shareholders, and the soon-to-be privatised Bank Slaski, in which the EBRD is also expected to seek a stake, along with a number of Polish and western institutional investors. Poland's political and economic imponderables and possibly its history of default are also responsible for a reluctance among most UK banks to hold Polish trade paper to term. Much finds its way on to the secondary market, with Bank Handlowy w Warszawie, the foreign trade bank - an important buyer of this paper - both from banks and directly from exporters. A small number of specialist banks, however, including Creditanstalt, Hungarian International Bank, Morgan Grenfell, Midland Bank's trade finance unit MidAval, and the London branch of Banque Indosuez, compete with Handlowy to discount Polish paper, on a non-recourse basis. Exporters who wish to divest themselves completely of Polish risk may prefer one of these non-Polish banks, but they may find that the discount is a few basis points deeper to reflect this. Steven Harding, Handlowy's assistant general manager in London, concedes that, in spite of this fairly active market for Polish trade paper, British exporters remain wary of generating Polish receivables. Harding and other Handlowy staff have responded by going on the road, visiting more than 30 manufacturers so far this year, mainly in such sectors as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural, mining and printing machinery. The aim is to put the financial risks of trading with Poland into perspective and to draw exporters' attention to the protection available.

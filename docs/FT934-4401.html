			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Brazilian tax aims to squeeze out speculators A new tax on foreign investment in Brazil's lucrative local currency fixed-income market - announced as part of the government's plans to tackle inflation - is expected to squeeze out most short-term speculators who had been taking advantage of real annual interest rates of up to 20 per cent. But a new tax on Eurobond issues by Brazilian companies announced at the same time probably will not reduce new issue volume significantly, according to bankers in Brazil. Banks, the biggest issuers, are expected to pass on the extra cost to the local borrowers. For private sector companies, it will remain much cheaper to go to the Euromarkets than to local lenders. The government's moves are aimed at stemming the huge tide of dollars entering the country, attracted by a high real interest rate policy which aims to combat inflation. The inflow is itself inflationary, since the central bank is obliged to issue local currency, the cruzeiro real, in exchange for foreign currency. This increases the money supply and helps to sustain Brazil's chronic inflation, now nearly 2,000 per cent a year. 'The measures are understandable and will help the government's macroeconomic plans,' said Mr Vincent Parkin, Brazilian representative for CS First Boston. Last Thursday, the government ruled that foreigners investing in fixed-income instruments will have to pay a financial operations tax at 5 per cent on the capital they bring into Brazil, which will have to be channelled mainly to a new type of fixed-income fund for overseas investors to be managed by the private sector. Issuers of Eurobonds will have to pay 3 per cent tax on the money they raise. Money market traders said that investors would have to leave their money in the new funds for at least five to six months to make paying the tax worthwhile.</p>

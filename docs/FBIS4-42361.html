			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michele Cotta on poll commissioned by LE NOUVEL </F> ECONOMISTE: "Is There a Cure for Euroskepticism?"]    [Excerpts] We should call a spade a spade. France today  does not have, or no longer has, any enthusiasm for Europe.  French citizens' disinterest is growing from one poll to the  next, as is the fear that European integration is running  counter to national interests. The poll carried out by Sofres  [French Opinion Polling Company] and LE NOUVEL ECONOMISTE from 7  to 11 May confirms this trend. Just one month before the  elections, to be held on 12 June, 44 percent of the French admit  that they are only slightly or not at all interested in the  upcoming elections. Even more significant is the fact that the  proportion of French people which has decided not to vote is  rising. In late April, 50 percent said they would abstain.  Today, in the midst of the campaign, 53 percent said they would  not. Only 47 percent of French people have decided to go to the  polls. Women are more hesitant than men, and those under 34  years of age are more reticent than their elders. Workers and  employees are among those most likely to ignore the elections,  whereas farmers -- surprise, surprise -- are exactly in the  average of their fellow citizens: 47 percent of them say they  intend to vote. [passage omitted]    The following poll was carried out by Sofres for LE NOUVEL  ECONOMISTE from 7 to 11 May 1994 on a national sample of 1,000  people representative of the entire population aged 18 or more.  It was carried out using the quota method with stratification  by region, category, and urban area.  <H5>  Table 1: Participation </H5>   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Participation: 47 percent intend to vote; 53 percent do not intend to vote.  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Question: On a major issue, do these elections raise your interest?          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1. a lot                              |16 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2. somewhat                           |39 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |3. not much                           |31 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |4. not at all                         |13 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |5. no reply                           |1 percent                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Table 2: Profile of a French Voter in the European </H5> Elections:  Altogether, 47 percent [of the French] will vote.

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE CONTINUES OVER NEA GRANTS  </P> <P> More than 100 years ago, Walt Whitman, arguably America's greatest poet, became  the victim of the kind of narrow-mindedness that Sen. Jesse Helms and the NEA  now seek to impose upon us.  </P> <P> Samuel Sillen in his "Walt Whitman, Poet of American Democracy" noted that: "A  few months before Lincoln's death, Whitman had been appointed to a clerkship in  the Department of the Interior.  </P> <P> One day, the bigoted secretary of the department, James Harlan, snooped around  in the clerk's desk, found a copy of 'Leaves of Grass,' threw up his hands in  horror, and fired the author of 'an indecent book.' "  </P> <P> Sillen added that "Leaves of Grass" received more national attention than it  would have received without this act of intolerance. In those days, apparently,  not everyone in the Administration felt compelled to clone each other  politically. Whitman moved from the Interior Department to the attorney  general's office, enabling him to live and continue writing.  </P> <P> BERNARD BURTON  </P> <P> Camarillo  </P></p>

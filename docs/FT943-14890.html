			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (3): Presidential hopefuls The first round, on April 23, in next year's election to succeed President Mitterrand in the Elysee will attract the usual mixture of mainstream and fringe candidates from which the two top scorers - usually but not invariably one from the right and one from the left - will go on to the decisive May 7 run-off. Vying for the gaullist nomination are Mr Jacques Chirac, and prime minister Edouard Balladur, who tops all rivals in the opinion polls. Ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing still hankers after the Elsyee which he won 20 years ago. If he stands, he may face a generational challenge from within the UDF by Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister. The Socialists ousted Mr Michel Rocard because of his bad performance in the June Euro-election. Many left wingers are now entreating Mr Jacques Delors to carry their colours into battle.</p>

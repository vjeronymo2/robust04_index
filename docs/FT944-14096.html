			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / People: Non-executive directors Edward Pickard, who was finance director of Invergordon Distillers until soon after it was taken over a year ago by Whyte &amp; Mackay, has become a non-executive director of Macallan-Glenlivet, the quoted company which produces the Macallan, one of the better known single malt whiskies. Invergordon drew its success from own label brands for supermarkets. In April, Chris Greig, who was Invergordon's chief executive, became a non-executive director of William Grant &amp; Sons, the family-owned producer of Glenfiddich, the UK's leading single malt. Pickard, 49, came to the whisky industry after spells as finance director of Wiggins Teape and as finance manager with John Menzies. At Invergordon he was involved in floating the company in 1990, and then in holding off Whyte &amp; Mackay (part of American Brands) in 1991, before it succumbed last year.</p>

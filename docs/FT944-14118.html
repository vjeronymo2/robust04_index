			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / The George Walker Aquittal: Bloodied but unbowed and heading home Bloodied, bruised, but back in business - that was how Mr George Walker described himself after his acquittal yesterday. At a hastily-arranged press conference opposite the courtroom where he has spent the last 4 1/2 months he was too exhausted to be in celebratory mood. The former head of Brent Walker said: 'I am relieved, but I don't feel like celebrating. There has been too much tension, particularly for my family.' He made it clear, however, that he did not see a quiet retirement ahead. Although 65 years old and with 18 months of a bankruptcy order to serve, he said that he still had friends in business prepared to make offers. 'I haven't thought a lot about it, but I have had a lot of support from friends in the business community. I do think I have something to give. I know my business - the leisure sector,' he said. Mr Walker still feels deeply angry about losing the company he built up from a modest chain of petrol stations in the 1950s. The history of Brent Walker has been written many times. From managing the boxing career of his brother Billy, to opening 'Billy's Baked Potato' shops in the 1960s, Mr George Walker moved into the leisure sector, running clubs and restaurants. Property deals were to follow - notably the development of the Brent Cross shopping centre after which the company's name was coined. Throughout its history Brent Walker was always synonymous with Mr Walker. His tough management style became a City byword. It was in the boom years of the 1980s that the company made the big time. The development of Brighton Marina and the Trocadero centre in London's West End were two of the projects which put Mr Walker at centre stage. The company was always heavily borrowed and this was to prove his downfall after the Pounds 685m purchase of the William Hill chain of bookmaking shops in 1990. The markets turned against him and, unable to raise money by selling property in a falling market, Mr Walker had to arrange a Pounds 100m bond issue to save the company. He put Pounds 30m of his own and his family's money into the issue. This was not enough to satisfy his bankers, however. The condition of their further financial support was for him to leave the company. Mr Walker yesterday repeated his criticisms of the banks. They had, he said, reneged on promises of support for him by engineering his removal. Everything from his removal to bankruptcy and prosecution was brought about by the banks panicking. 'Their performance on this question needs a lot of thought. I hope somebody will be looking at their way of acting,' he said. He has started legal proceedings for unfair dismissal against Brent Walker. These, he said, would continue. Mr Walker may have put the criminal proceedings behind him, but he must still deal with the consequences of being made bankrupt with debts totalling some Pounds 180m. At the time the High Court judge who ordered his bankruptcy questioned the arrangements made with Mr Walker's wife Jean, which have left significant sums out of the reach of creditors. He said Mr Walker's attitude to his creditors had been 'cavalier'. Mr Walker's only business at the moment is his Russian trading operation which is involved in exporting cigarettes. The acquittal means he can now rebuild a business career. Yesterday, however, he was not thinking beyond a quiet family celebration. 'I am going to go home with my family, have dinner and go to bed.'</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Unitas struggles to reduce deficit The depth of the 1992 Finnish banking sector crisis was highlighted yesterday when Unitas, the country's second largest banking group, announced heavier write-offs and another big loss for the first eight months of the year. The bank said its credit losses, at FM1.82bn (Dollars 374m), were FM137m higher than in the same 1993 period. It relied on lower interest rates, higher capital gains on equities and the acquisition of part of the Savings Bank of Finland to achieve a 14 per cent reduction in overall pre-tax losses, to FM870m from FM1.01bn. A large part of Unitas's credit losses in the first eight months was caused by the collapse of two groups - Haka, a construction concern, and Eka, a retail and wholesale company.</p>

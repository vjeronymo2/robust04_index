			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Spain arranges Ecu4bn borrowing facility THE Kingdom of Spain is putting in place an Ecu4bn (Dollars 4.6bn) borrowing facility, which bankers claim is the largest financing to be put together by any European government this year. NatWest Capital Markets , which is arranging the multi-currency revolving credit facility, said the deal was being put together 'to reflect changes to the ways in which European Community governments fund themselves following the signing of the Maastricht Treaty'. It added that 'under the terms of the Treaty, the Bank of Spain will, from 1 January 1994, be forbidden to provide credit lines to the Treasury of the Kingdom of Spain. 'The three-year facility is designed to replace those credit lines.' 'This is not a foreign exchange support system, but it is required and it will be drawn on like an overdraft facility,' said one banker. NatWest Capital Markets has been in discussions with other European sovereign borrowers, including Italy, about structuring similar deals. Last September, the UK Treasury announced a Ecu10bn multi-currency funding programme, which was aimed at supporting sterling in the foreign exchange market and funding government spending. The financing was seen as 'emergency funding' at a time when sterling was under considerable pressure in the foreign exchange market. By contrast, the Kingdom of Spain's deal is not intended for currency support, but as a means of establishing long-term liquidity. NatWest Capital Markets said the deal has been fully underwritten by a group consisting of: ABN AMRO Bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Citibank, Dresdner Bank, National Westminster Bank, Societe Generale, and Sumitomo Bank. 'Banks are screaming out for quality assets and we feel they will support this' said one banker involved in the deal. The Kingdom of Spain has a double A credit rating. The deal will probably be signed in September and is unlikely to be drawn before year-end, bankers admitted. Capital Markets, Page 22</p>

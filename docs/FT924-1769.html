			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: France keeps up war against US-EC deal FRANCE LAST night continued its attrition tactics against the European Community's subsidised food exports agreement with the US as farm ministers of the 12 met for a second day here. But the European Commission still plans to send undertakings, known as 'schedules', to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva reflecting the subsidy and export volume cuts it agreed with Washington to unblock the Uruguay Round world trade reform negotiations. France insists these schedules go beyond the cuts in May's agreement on common agricultural policy reform. But although assurances were sought that the CAP and Gatt deals were compatible, there was no backing for holding up the Geneva talks. EC foreign ministers last week defeated French attempts to brake the momentum in Geneva, but balanced this by saying that 'concrete results' would have to be achieved in the other 14 trade areas under negotiation in the Uruguay Round package. This prevented a damaging row on Gatt at last weekend's Edinburgh summit, where EC leaders endorsed the foreign ministerial formula. There is little or nothing that farm ministers can do to reverse this. The compatibility issue will be considered as part of an overall Gatt agreement, ministers agreed last night, despite French opposition. But France, which yesterday raised tricky questions on Gatt compatibility, also announced that its attrition tactics would continue. 'This is but the first of the analyses the French delegation will present,' said Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, France's farm minister. The current UK presidency of the farm council and the European Commission were expected last night to circulate a complex compromise on a range of outstanding issues. Settlement on some of them could dim opposition to the Gatt deal. They include: Introduction of tariffs on Central American bananas above a fixed quota, in line with Gatt requirements, but at a very high level to protect EC and Caribbean producers. Maintenance for a limited period of 'switchover' protection for farmers against currency fluctuations. Phasing out of transitional protective measures agreed for Portugal and Spain when they entered the EC in 1986. Higher payments to small French beef and durum wheat producers. Raising Italy's milk quota.</p>

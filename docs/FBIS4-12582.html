			<p>BFN     [Text] The cabinet is getting ready for a prolonged  closure of the territories. Our political correspondent Shlomo  Raz reports that the cabinet today decided to keep the closure  in effect until after Independence Day and to discuss its  duration and magnitude in its meeting next week.    The cabinet also consented to import 18,000 foreign workers:  15,000 in construction and 3,000 in agriculture. They will  begin working within three to five weeks and will be issued  six-month work permits. It was also decided to subsidize the  employment of 4,000 foreign workers in agriculture, including  2,000 who are already working in this sector.    The cabinet decided to set up a team to examine the plan to  employ high school students and soldiers in agriculture until  the foreign workers arrive. The prime minister said in the  meeting that we should rid ourselves of our dependence on  laborers from the territories, a dependence which forces us to  decisions which endanger the security of the citizens.</p>

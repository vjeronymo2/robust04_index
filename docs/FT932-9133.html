			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Germany warns Croatian leader: Clinton still hopes to win over allies to military options on Bosnia GERMANY, Croatia's most loyal supporter in Europe, yesterday warned Croatian President Franjo Tudjman that he risked losing western support if he did nothing to prevent the Bosnian Croats from attacking Moslems in Bosnia. The German warning came as fighting between Croats and Moslems continued in Mostar despite a ceasefire and as Serb forces pressed an attack against Moslems near the strategically placed town of Brcko. In Washington, meanwhile, President Bill Clinton said he would keep pushing his proposals to lift the UN arms embargo, so that Bosnian Moslems can get heavier weapons, and to use air power against Serb targets. His plan had 'not been rejected out of hand'. Some European allies had agreed with it and 'others are not prepared to go that far yet'. Mr Clinton also said he had reservations about trying to set up and protect 'safe havens' for Moslems. The warning to Croatia was delivered by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, when he met Mr Tudjman in Zagreb. He was speaking both for his own country and the whole EC, which earlier this week sent a similar message to the Croatian president. Mr Kinkel said the United Nations would shortly publish a report containing evidence of direct Croatian involvement in the fighting in Bosnia between Croats and Moslems, formerly allies in the struggle against the Bosnian Serbs. After two hours of talks with Mr Tudjman, the German minister said other countries considered that Zagreb exerted decisive influence over the Bosnian Croat militias, which are reported to be armed and financed from Croatia. Though Mr Tudjman denied Zagreb bore any responsibility for Bosnian Croats' acts, he told Mr Kinkel he would go to Mostar in the next few days to try to persuade them to halt their attacks on Moslems. A UN spokesman in New York said Mr Tudjman might meet Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Mostar next Tuesday to discuss how to end the fighting. He said they had invited the international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, to attend. The mediators were expected to hold talks in Moscow at the weekend and in London on Monday before flying to Bosnia. Although fighting between Croats and Moslems continued in Mostar yesterday, it was waged with less intensity than in the past few days. Spanish UN troops came under fire as they tried to approach the line of confrontation between the warring parties. In the struggle between Serbs and Moslems in the north of the country, Serb forces pushed forward towards the town of Brcko, which commands an important supply route linking Serb territories in eastern and western Bosnia. Moslem-controlled Sarajevo radio said more than 30 Serb tanks were trying to break through Moslem lines near the town. Some 20 people had been killed in the Serb offensive since Thursday and villages in the area had been destroyed, the radio said.</p>

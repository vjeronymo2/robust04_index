			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHAPMAN NAMES BOYD ATHLETIC DIRECTOR  </P> <P> The fortunes of Chapman College's financially troubled athletic department seem  to rest more and more with Bob Boyd, who was hired Friday as the school's  athletic director.  </P> <P> Boyd, who was named the Panthers' basketball coach in March, has been the  interim athletic director since May. He replaced Walt Bowman, who resigned in  March and is now an associate athletic director at Cal State Fullerton and the  executive director of the Titan Athletic Foundation, a fund-raising group.  </P> <P> After conducting an informal search during the past four months, Jim Doti,  Chapman's acting president, met with Boyd this week and offered him the  position.  </P> <P> "We're very fortunate to have Bob Boyd," Doti said. "He knows a lot of people.  He's highly regarded and has roots in this community. The reputation he has  established will serve us well."  </P> <P> And "well" would mean increased contributions for the Chapman Athletic  Foundation.  </P> <P> Boyd, 59, inherits a department that has been streamlined to consolidate its  financial resources. Last January, the school dropped six sports and reduced  the number of scholarships that will be offered.  </P> <P> Only baseball, men's basketball, women's basketball and women's volleyball are  currently scholarship sports. And none of those sports will offer the maximum  of 12 scholarships allowed in Division II programs by the National Collegiate  Athletic Assn.  </P> <P> Boyd' said his main goal will be to restore the scholarships to the NCAA  maximum in all sports, saying it is essential that the school return to full  scholarships if Chapman is to be competitive with the other schools in the  California Collegiate Athletic Assn.  </P> <P> "We want to at least give each coach a fighting chance," Boyd said. "I feel the  athletic director is responsible to his staff to give them the opportunity to  win. As it is right now, it's quite a challenge for our teams to be competitive  in the CCAA."  </P> <P> The men's basketball team will have 10 players on scholarship next season, some  of whom will have partial scholarships. The other sports may also divide their  scholarship money to accommodate more athletes.  </P> <P> Boyd said that a scholarship at Chapman is worth $15,630 a year.  </P> <P> "Chapman College has decided that those are, 'hard dollars,' " Boyd said. "They  are not paper scholarships. The money has to be raised."  </P> <P> The Chapman Athletic Fund covers approximately 20% of the athletic department's  scholarship needs, Doti said. To meet Boyd's goal of full scholarships for  every sport, the athletic fund would have to cover all costs, he said.  </P> <P> "Our goal is that, in four years, we'll be at the point where community support  funds all our scholarships," Doti said.  </P> <P> Boyd, who has a three-year contract worth about $60,000 a year, said he will  not be in charge of fund raising, as Bowman was in the past. Boyd said his  duties will be to coach basketball, recruit and take care of administrative  chores.  </P> <P> Don Anderson, who was hired as an associate athletic director in July, will  head the athletic fund drive.  </P> <P> Anderson has worked with Boyd at Santa Ana College (now Rancho Santiago) and at  USC. Anderson was the sports information director at both schools while Boyd  was the basketball coach. Boyd also was an associate athletic director at USC.  </P> <P> "I have a great respect for Don's talent," Boyd said. "Before coming to  Chapman, he had a sports marketing company that was quite successful."  </P> <P> School officials are hopeful that Boyd will be a catalyst that helps the  athletic department move forward financially.  </P> <P> "Bob Boyd is the focal-point of our department," Doti said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hisayoshi Ina; from the "The Hata </F> Administration: Mounting Problems" series; part three of a  three-part series: "Apprehension About Crisis Management  Concerning North Korean Issue: Increasing Importance of  Repairing Japan-U.S. Relations"]    [Text] What caused the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] to leave the administration? Nuclear suspicions  involving the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK] is  one cause. The SDPJ was forced to leave the administration  because the coalition government had to take into consideration  its capability in dealing with the crisis if an unforeseen  situation takes place. However, ironically the coalition  government's foundation has been weakened with the SDPJ leaving  the administration, and at least temporarily has lowered its  capability for crisis management.  <H5>  It Has Become Difficult To Form a Consensus </H5>   During the Cold War, the positions of the Japanese political  parties were determined by their distance with the United States  or the USSR. At the start of the Hata administration, instead  of this criterion, the stance of the Japanese political parties  in dealing with the problems involving North Korea became one of  the criteria in determining their positions, at least for the  time being. In the process of forming the coalition  government's policy consensus, which has become a scrap paper,  Shinseito's [Japan Renewal Party] Ichiro Ozawa used the various  cards in persistently requesting the SDPJ to compromise.    Persons concerned with the coalition parties admit that  Ozawa  intended to give priority to internal affairs by "first  cornering the SDPJ, and second by sending the message to the  United States that we are taking this problem seriously." As a  result, the coalition parties have made at least two mistakes.    First, more discrepancies than consensus have been revealed  among the coalition parties, which the coalition parties managed  to patch up through political measures. If this becomes known  to the public, it will be difficult to form a national consensus  which is indispensable in dealing with the crisis. Second, it  has become apparent that no consideration is being paid to the  People's Republic of China [PRC] in the process of arguments.  We should say Japan has committed a serious diplomatic error  when we consider the significance of the PRC.    Actually, Japan can shoulder its responsibilities in the  international community so long as its actions are based on  three key principles--the Constitution, the Japan-U.S. security  structure, and the United Nations. However, in part, Japan  could not do so because the national discussion on the issue is  still immature.    On one hand, there are people who argue that economic  sanctions are indispensable in order to make North Korea give up  its nuclear development and therefore a naval blockade may  become necessary in effecting the sanction. Their argument  sounds as if they are prepared to fight a war. On the other  hand, there are those who see the situation optimistically  without grounds simply because they want to avert their eyes  from such a worst-case scenario. Though the attitude of the  latter group is out of the question, the former group is also to  blame in the sense they tend to unnecessarily stir up a sense of  crisis.    The UN Security Council will take step-by-step sanctions if  North Korea does not agree to undergo inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As expected, the PRC  will also make its intention clear during the process, and as  exports to the country are not to be totally banned immediately,  it is not realistic to talk about a naval blockade. If the  countries concerned intend to impose sanctions by themselves,  their sanctions will also be imposed step by step.    The countries concerned are also in agreement that the  window  for negotiations should be kept open in order not to uselessly  incite North Korea. There is no need to uselessly create a  sense of crisis. At the same time, we should realize more  seriously the negative aspects of the crisis to be created if  North Korea declares that it is armed with nuclear weapons.    Discussions May Take Place on Nuclear Armaments    In order to cope with the threat of a nuclear-armed North  Korea, the United States will try to maintain a nuclear  deterrent by including allied countries such as Japan and the  Republic of Korea [ROK] under the U.S. nuclear umbrella.  However, if North Korea becomes so desperate it is not afraid  of being attacked with nuclear weapons, it is possible the logic  of deterrence may no longer hold true. Some people may claim  that Japan should be armed with nuclear weapons, and in certain  cases it may be difficult to convince these people that such an  option is not necessary.    The fact that the arms race is beginning in northeast Asia  is  not the only problem. North Korea's behavior might incite other  countries such as Iraq, Iran, and others subjected to nuclear  suspicion. It might might also jeopardize the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) structure. If military tension  is intensified in the Middle East, with nuclear issues as the  background, it could even affect the trend of petroleum  supplies, creating confusion in the world economy as a whole.    Russia is another dangerous neighbor which is strengthening  its nationalistic tendency. Former presidential assistant  Zbigniew Brzezinski expressed anxiety that "Russia is aiming at  becoming an imperial rather than a democratic state." U.S.  strategic experts consider the possibility of a new Cold War  taking place as a result of the confrontation between Russia and  Ukraine.    Prime Minister Hata is regarded as "a person able to see  things from the standpoint of the general public." However,  amateurism should be excluded as far as diplomatic and security  problems are concerned. In that sense, the first thing the  prime minister should do is correct the course of the amateurish  diplomacy laid out by Hosokawa, who tried to explain the failure  of the Japan-U.S. summit as "relations of mature men." When we  take into account the cloudy situation seen in North Korea and  Russia, we realize what the prime minister should do is to  repair Japan-U.S. relations.    In the White House administration of former President Nixon,  who died recently, all diplomatic papers used to be written  taking U.S.-Soviet relations into consideration. Even in  producing papers on U.S.-Uruguay relations, it was necessary to  analyze the possible influence the papers might have on  U.S.-Soviet relations.  <H5>  A Way Out Not in Sight </H5>   The USSR has disappeared, and the Clinton administration  does  not maintain the habit of seeing everything in the context of  U.S.-Soviet relations. However, even after the end of the Cold  War, the significance of the United States to Japan has not  decreased at all. The Japan-U.S. security structure is already  functioning as a system capable of dealing with the post-Cold  War threat. Every diplomatic policy should be considered in the  context of Japan-U.S. relations. If people feel that such a way  of thinking is a Cold War-oriented attitude, they are mistaken.    J. Hodge, chief editor of FOREIGN AFFAIRS, wrote a short  article in the latest issue entitled "From Chaos to Order." The  shift from the Hosokawa to the Hata administration might also  have been a process of seeking for a new order. However, no  outlet from the chaos has been found yet.</p>

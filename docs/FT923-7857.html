			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Observer: Settling old scores Yiannis Yiannikos, the elderly Greek publisher who has ridden to the rescue of Pravda, once the bible of the Soviet Communist party, is making his second stab at becoming a newspaper proprietor. But this time revenge may be more important than profit. Yiannikos belongs to the heroic age of Greek communism. After leading a guerrilla band in the Greek civil war in the late 1940s, he landed in jail. Then he became a publisher of Greek translations of Soviet books, notably the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia. In 1981, his partner in the encyclopaedia venture, George Bobolas, launched Ethnos, a leftwing tabloid which quickly became Greece's top-selling daily. Yiannikos thought his publishing agreement with Bobolas gave him a half-share in Ethnos. Bobolas disagreed. After losing a succession of court cases, Yiannikos revealed that Ethnos was launched with money provided by the Soviet government. It later turned out that the KGB's dirty tricks department had been involved. Owning Pravda will give Yiannikos a chance of scoring off Bobolas at last. Though Bobolas still flourishes - he owns 20 per cent of Greece's most successful private television station, Mega Channel - Ethnos's circulation has slumped badly.</p>

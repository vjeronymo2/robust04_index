			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Hata starts talks on coalition with Social Democrats The minority government of Mr Tsutomu Hata, yesterday started talks with the opposition Social Democratic party to save the ruling coalition from imminent defeat. Government officials will this morning meet the SDP for a second time, in an attempt to persuade it to rejoin the coalition, so restoring its parliamentary majority. This would ensure the failure of a no-confidence vote by the largest opposition group, the Liberal Democratic party, which could be launched as early as today. The markets will watch the talks closely because the latest bout of political instability has been a factor in exchange rate turmoil. It has fuelled fears that the government will be unable to produce a convincing package of deregulation and tax reform measures, due next week, so stoking US frustration and putting more pressure on the yen. If the SDP refuses to join forces with Mr Hata, and sides with the LDP, the no-confidence vote will probably succeed, forcing Mr Hata and his cabinet to resign. Mr Hata has said that he would not call an election, because that would delay completion of a new electoral system, but leave it to other parties to form a coalition. SDP leaders yesterday indicated they are interested in rejoining Mr Hata's camp. The party has agreed, in a document presented to the government, to a rise in indirect taxation, the most controversial part of the coalition's economic policy. The SDP party also wants promises it will be more closely involved in decision making, a sensitive point because formation of a centre right grouping within the coalition, but excluding the SDP, prompted it to walk out of the government in April.</p>

[passage omitted]    Clinton also listed some of the national tasks facing the  G-7  countries. For the United States, he said, the task is to  reduce its budget deficit; for Japan, to increase domestic  demand; for Europe, to achieve lower interest rates.    Even those countries whose delegations had doubts about the  U.S. proposal for the creation of a G-7 employment task-force --  a German official said it would be "superfluous" -- admitted  Washington's determination to, as Italian Labour Minister Gino  Giugni put it, "roll up its shirt-sleeves."    Giugni, who is leading the Italian delegation with Treasury  Minister Piero Barucci, added that the United States was now a  country "deeply divided between rich and poor" whence Clinton's  commitment to rebuilding the lost inheritance of the New Deal.    "The Clinton Administration is clearly aware of the problem  and looking for a solution, even if it isn't easy to find a path  for the moment," he said, adding that the first day of debate  "zigzagged" along, from "cyclical and structural unemployment to  flexibility, with great stress on professional training." He  also showed little surprise over Clinton's reference to the  success of business and technological innovation in northern  Italy: "The model clearly works, and other countries are envious  of it."    According to Giugni, the meeting here should certainly  produce a joint statement projected towards the Naples summit  which will conclude Italy's G-7 presidency.    But he warned against expecting immediate concrete steps:  "It  would already be a success if an agreement was reached on the  need for the more industrial countries to stake their money on  technological renewal and youth training if they want to remain  in the G-7 ambit, rather than slipping into the Second  Division."

			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 WOMEN JAILED FOR KILLING RAPIST  </P> <P> A Turkish Cypriot court Monday sentenced a German mother and daughter to prison  for killing a rapist who had attacked them in a lonely seaside campsite.  </P> <P> Uthe Loh, 48, received four years in prison. Her daughter Melani, who turns 21  today, got three years. Both are from West Berlin.  </P> <P> The court said that by the time of his death, Ozmen Tulga, 20, was weakened by  his struggles with the two tourists and no longer posed a threat to them. It  also said the women had failed to flee from the attacker.  </P> <P> The women, who came to Cyprus on vacation in March, were found guilty of  manslaughter.  </P> <P> In statements read in court, they said Tulga forced his way into their tent and  hit both of them with a stick before raping Melani. They said that in the  struggle, they strangled Tulga with a belt but did not intend to kill him.  </P> <P> "We are going to appeal against the conviction and against the sentence,"  defense lawyer Ali Dana said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 85 (575); </F> compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich's campaign officers  have succeeded to collect signatures of more than 100,000 voters  and 150 deputies, which is more than is needed to stand as  presidential candidate. The Central Electoral Commission [CEC]  is due to register him as such in the next few days.    Kebich is free to choose whether he wants to be nominated by  parliament or the voters, a CEC source told INTERFAX IF Note:  Under the election law, a presidential candidate is expected to  collect 100,000 signatures on the ground or 70 signatures by  Belarussian deputies to qualify for the race. As many as 19  candidates seek nomination in a signature collecting campaign  due to end on May 14.    Many of the contenders are about to collect the required  number of signatures. Among those collecting 70,000 signatures  are former Speaker Stanislav Shushkevich, Communist Party and  People's Front Movement leaders Vasiliy Novikov and Zenon  Pozniak as well as head of the now-abolished anti-corruption  commission Aleksandr Likhashenko.    Critics of the Prime Minister have accused him of usurping  radio and television ahead of the presidential campaign.    Shushkevich's campaign managers issued a statement saying  "the government's propaganda machine for Kebich's nomination was  switched on long before the election itself." They said "any  provision of air time to Kebich's rivals carried the risk of a  journalist's dismissal" adding that perpetual appearance on  radio and television by Kebich and his team was unfair.    Campaign managers of two other candidates have also accused  the Prime Minister of using central and local government staff  in his presidential campaign.    In the meantime, President of the National Bank Stanislav  Bogdankevich told Interfax that all of the heads of NBB branches  had been warned against financing any of the presidential  candidates. In this connection, the Bank will also tighten  control over commercial bank operations, he said.    IF Note: Representatives of nine pro-democracy groups and  movements set up a public supervisory commission to make sure  that the forthcoming election is free and fair.</p>

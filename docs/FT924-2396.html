			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average eases on profit-taking ACTIVITY surged in the morning session on technical trading related to the settlement of December futures and options, but the Nikkei average fell back as afternoon profit-taking erased earlier gains, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei fell 60.28 to 17,441.02, down 0.8 per cent on the week, after a high of 17,635.31 in the morning session, and a day's low of 17,424.67 towards the close. However, volume rose to 500m shares from 381m, with 300m shares changing hands in the first hour of trading on settlement-related activity. Declines led advances by 570 to 402 with 191 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first-section stocks fell 3.68 to 1,325.15 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 0.96 to 1,070.78. The index lost ground following the announcement of the Bank of Japan's tankan, its quarterly survey on business sentiment, which showed that confidence had fallen to its lowest level since 1975. The business confidence index for the leading 393 manufacturers fell 7 points to minus 44, while the index declined 14 points to minus 27 for 295 non-manufacturers. Traders said that while weak figures had been expected, the Bank of Japan's comments after the tankan's release ruling out an early cut in the official discount rate discouraged some investors. Mitsui Mining and Smelting, the day's most active issue, fell Y13 to Y495 after rising on rumours of a discovery of a new gold vein. High-technology issues were lower as the yen rose against the dollar. Hitachi fell Y2 to Y745 and Matsushita Electric Industrial fell Y20 to Y1,170. In Osaka, the OSE index fell 87.27 to 19,029.06 in volume of 23.8m shares. Roundup THE region's markets were mixed at the end of the week. HONG KONG fell 80 points at the opening on continued disappointment over the failure of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group to produce a statement on Thursday. However, bargain-hunting later in the session saw the market recover some of the ground and the Hang Seng index closed 20.61 lower at 5,253.18, only marginally down on the week. Turnover remained low at HKDollars 1.85bn. Among actives, HSBC Holdings lost 50 cents to HKDollars 55 while Jardine Matheson bucked the trend with a gain of 25 cents to HKDollars 46.25. SEOUL rose in moderate trading but sentiment remained nervous ahead of next week's presidential election. The composite index gained 3.67 to 645.70, down 1.5 per cent on the week. Turnover improved to Won451bn from Won383bn. TAIWAN, which had fallen more than 30 points at one stage, made up some losses towards the close on bargain-hunting. The weighted index finished 12.45 lower at 3,734.30, but was up 2.3 per cent on the week. Turnover was TDollars 8.7bn from TDollars 10bn. MANILA fell sharply for the third day and the composite index shed another 16.48 to 1,232.36, down 3.7 per cent on the week. Combined turnover stood at 197.2m pesos after 244.9m. Shares in Philippine Long Distance Telephone fell 20 pesos to 875 pesos. SINGAPORE saw selective buying in property stocks as the Straits Times industrial index rose 5.19 to 1,447.57, slightly up on the week. KUALA LUMPUR weakened on stop-loss selling, but gains in some index-linked stocks pushed the composite index up 1.32 to 635.26, for a 0.4 per cent fall on the week. Losers led gainers by 156 to 117 in volume of 86.6m shares. NEW ZEALAND ended slightly firmer after a lacklustre day's trading and the NZSE-40 capital index gained 6.08 to end at 1,521.92, up 0.3 per cent on the week. Turnover was high at NZDollars 34m, NZDollars 8.1m of which was done in Brierley, up 1 cent at 96 cents.</p>

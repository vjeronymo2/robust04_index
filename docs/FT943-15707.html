			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF announces two Dasa joint ventures Thomson-CSF, the French defence-based electronics company, yesterday announced two joint ventures with Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) in an attempt to demonstrate that it had not been deflected from its expansionary course by losses from the Credit Lyonnais bank that put it FFr2.3bn (Dollars 425m) in the red last year. The Thomson-CSF and Dasa joint companies are involved in 'smart' munitions and missile propulsion. They would have a combined turnover of FFr1.9bn. 'We have not yet finished our expansion,' said Mr Alain Gomez, president, noting that only external acquisitions during the past four years had enabled Thomson-CSF to keep its turnover steady last year at FFr34bn. The French government confirmed this week its decision to renew Mr Gomez's tenure as president of Thomson SA, the group holding company, as well as of Thomson-CSF. Mr Gomez disclosed that he had recommended to the government that before privatisation - which will possibly take place next year - the subsidiaries and the holding company should be merged into a single unified group. He said, however, that this course of action should only be taken after an improvement in the balance sheet of Thomson Consumer Electronics, which had already transformed its 1992 operating loss of FFr335m into an operating profit of FFr155m last year. Thomson SA recorded an overall net loss last year of FFr3.03bn, which was largely due to Thomson-CSF's FFr2.3bn net loss. As a 21.5 per cent shareholder in Credit Lyonnais, Thomson-CSF had to absorb a proportional FFr1.48bn share of the bank's 1993 loss, and to set aside FFr1.77bn in provisions against possible bad property loans by the bank.</p>

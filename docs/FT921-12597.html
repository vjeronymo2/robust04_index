			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Work while you travel IF YOUR desire for travel is in inverse proportion to your ability to pay, the answer might be a working holiday, either abroad or in Britain. For volunteers aged 18 and over, the International Voluntary Service Organisation offers two- to four-week holiday projects in Britain and Europe (including eastern Europe), the US and (to a limited extent) Australia. You pay your own fare to your destination and food and basic accommodation are provided, along with health insurance. But you get no salary and there will not be too much time for beachcombing. Perhaps the chance to see new faces and places is not enough and you would like to learn a new activity, but without cost. In this case, vacation training courses are your best bet. Working in a training environment helps you decide if a particular career choice is right for you, or to acquire skills in a job you enjoy. Now that income support and housing benefit during vacations is no longer available, such courses can support students without yet another request for a bank loan. Pay is around Pounds 145 per week, from which National Insurance will be deducted - but not tax if you apply for the relevant exemption. Courses last from five weeks to whatever time is agreed at the interview, but accommodation rarely is offered. Formal qualifications are not always specified. The 7,000 training opportunities available cover all types of manufacturing and service industries. They include the civil service, British Council (eight weeks at Pounds 195 per week), local government sponsorships (Pounds 100-Pounds 130 per week) and the Meteorological Office (A-levels for lab work; eight-12 weeks at Pounds 122.85 per week). Police and army traineeships are useful for those able to spare only a short period. Places are available on a two-week course in computer application, with accommodation and pocket money; or on a six-week workshop practical course in various engineering modules which contributes to the requirements for a chartered engineer. Students get free board and lodging in the officers' mess at the Royal Navy Engineering College and a weekly allowance of Pounds 25. Application forms are available at college career offices. Computers and electronic industries, hit by the recession, offer placements mainly to undergraduates, but other branches of engineering still have training opportunities: The Culham Laboratory in Oxford takes post A-level students for two summer months at Pounds 424-Pounds 525 a month, depending on age and year of study. The cost of any accommodation required is deducted from pay. The Law Society in England (071-242-1222) and Scotland (031-226-7411) offers general advice on short-term traineeships. In insurance and banking, vacation work is not always through formal traineeships. Towers Perrin has seven undergraduates for eight or more summer weeks, assigns them to actuarial departments and offers 'a competitive rate of pay.' Scottish Provident takes a few students. Apply in January or February, but not later than March. As traineeships abroad are fewer - and, even with leading organisations, often unpaid - it is better for the indigent traveller to look at other methods of achieving a paid vacation. A book called Summer Jobs Abroad (published by Vacation Work, Oxford, for Pounds 6.95) lists more than 30,000 vacancies in 40 countries at varying wages. For most, applications should be made between January and March. Working Holidays Abroad (Pounds 7.95), from the Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges (CBEVE), is in its 40th year. It concentrates on voluntary 'green' opportunities but also lists paid work opportunities for all ages lasting two weeks to 12 months. The bureau also provides free information sheets. Do not be deterred from applying for jobs or projects if you are handicapped. Tom Sewell, of the CBEVE, says job opportunities and voluntary projects exist in other areas for those with restricted ability, and are indicated by B (Blind), D (impaired hearing) or PH (physically handicapped).</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. S. Ivanov, Shirshov Institute of Oceanology, </F> Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 551.462]    [Abstract] This article examines the fractal relief of the  Earth's surface on the global scale. Based on one-degree grid  elevation values, lengths of various topographic isolines were  computed for seven grades of averaging. The perimetric method is  used to determine that at the 100-2000 km scale the relief  isolines are actually fractal lines with dimensions which  substantially exceed unity (1.30 and above). Several additional  considerations make it possible to expand these limits to 5 and  20,000 km. The dimension of isolines depends on their  hypsometric position. A simple model is proposed which  illustrates the mechanism of this scale-dependent  self-similarity of relief contours at different scales. Figures  6; references 9: 2 Russian, 7 Western.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- The original version of  Balladur's security plan for Europe included clauses  unacceptable to Slovakia, Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan says in  an interview with the Czech left-leaning daily RUDE PRAVO today.    Slovakia cannot accept the linkage of border issues with the  situation of ethnic minorities, he adds.    However, the idea of Balladur's plan has evolved and the  text  is still being discussed, says Kukan. "I think the authors of  the plan have adopted some of our positions," he states.    The new cabinet has been harshly criticised by Meciar's  opposition for its allegedly too accommodating approach to the  Czech Republic, says Kukan. "Just slamming the door in case of  some discord is very easy," he comments on this.    "In the election campaign there will certainly emerge  politicians who try to play the tune that we are yielding to  Prague," he states.    Kukan says he does not cherish any illusion that  Slovak-Hungarian problems will be resolved quickly. However, we  have proposed talks on the readmission agreement and a temporary  water regime for the Danube River, as well as other issues to  Budapest, he adds.    Asked what Americans think about Slovakia, Kukan, former  Slovak Ambassador to the United Nations, says that ordinary  Americans do not know much about the country. When some of them  planned to travel to Slovakia, they asked us about security in  the country. Lots of them still mistake us for the former  Yugoslavia, explains Kukan.</p>

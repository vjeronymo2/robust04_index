			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / OECD sees only weak world recovery in 1993: Inflation predicted to fall as unemployment rises THE INDUSTRIALISED world will see only a weak recovery next year, with a further rise in unemployment, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday. The 24-nation body said in its twice-yearly Economic Outlook that short-term prospects for growth across the region were 'relatively sombre', while inflation was likely to fall by the end of 1994 to its lowest level for more than 30 years. Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the OECD's chief economist, said he could not rule out the current period of decline turning into a 1930s-style slump. However, such an outcome was not particularly likely. Developed countries were better able to co-ordinate policies than in the 1930s to stop damaging falls in output and confidence. In spite of this, Mr Shigehara warned that governments were restricted in their efforts to boost output by expanding state spending because of large budget deficits in many countries. The OECD was especially gloomy about unemployment. It forecasts that 34m people will be jobless in OECD countries by the end of 1993 - 10m more than at the most recent low point for unemployment in the first half of 1990. 'Many of those who become unemployed over the next two years will drift into long-term unemployment, with all that entails in terms of erosion of skills and morale, and financial hardship,' it said. The organisation's central projection for the region is that growth next year will be 1.9 per cent, a substantially lower figure than the 3 per cent it forecast six months ago. Growth this year is expected to be a meagre 1.5 per cent. The outlook is better on inflation, which the OECD expects will come down to 2.5 per cent by the end of 1994, its lowest rate since 1960. Mr Shigehara said individual countries should take whatever steps they could to cut interest rates in the near future, while keeping inflation low. German interest rates are expected to come down next year, enabling a broad reduction in rates across Europe. However, the OECD is playing down hopes of an imminent policy relaxation by the Bundesbank. On a more upbeat note, Mr Shigehara said recent economic data indicated that the US economy was picking up slightly more rapidly than expected a month ago. But the impact of this on overall output had been reduced by the greater slowdown in the German economy. OECD economic outlook Page 6 Editorial Comment Page 18 Samuel Brittan Page 19</p>

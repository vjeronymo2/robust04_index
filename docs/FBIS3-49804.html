"A conference which does not bear fruit should cease to  exist," Siladjzic said Sunday, refering to the UN conference on  the former Yugoslavia which has led peace negotiations over  Bosnia-Herzegovina with the European Community. "Under these  conditions the Bosnian issue should be sent back to the Security  Council, which would have to assume responsibility for  Bosnia-Herzegovina," he added. Silajdzic threatened to boycott  the Geneva talks if "Bosnian civilians continue to be killed,"  adding "we should bring the Europeans, the Americans and the  Russians to negotiate in Sarajevo, under shell fire."    The Bosnian premier, who held talks Saturday with Momcilo  Krajisnik, speaker of the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament,  said he was "not optimistic" that a settlement of the  21-month-old war could be reached. "We reached no political  agreement," said Silajdzic, adding that "I wonder whether there  will be any progress in Geneva." [passage omitted]    In Athens, Bosnia mediators Thorvald Stoltenberg and Lord  Owen held talks with Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias,  whose country currently holds the EC's rotating presidency.  Owen said the prospects for a settlement in Geneva were not  good given the intensification of fighting in Bosnia.  Stoltenberg said Greece, which is close to the Serbs, fellow  Orthodox Christians, had not officially presented a new peace  initiative but had offered "an idea".</p>

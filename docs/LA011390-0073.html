			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDIO PROVIDES A PEEK BACK IN TIME  </P> <P> Judging from the trash, early Spanish officers at the Presidio overlooking  Mission Valley preferred Chinese pottery with blue willow designs. But, when  Mexico took over in the 1820s, brightly painted Mexican dishes were the pottery  of choice.  </P> <P> The garbage left behind by 18th-Century Spanish officers stationed at the  Presidio, the site of the first Spanish settlement in California, is giving  archeologists a continuing look at preferences of the Europeans who lived at  what was both a fort and an administrative center when it was founded in 1769  by Spaniards led by Father Junipero Serra.  </P> <P> "The Presidio was the frontier fort of the Spanish colonial exercise," Brad  Bartel, professor of anthropology at San Diego State University, told an  audience during a recent slide presentation at the Museum of Man in Balboa  Park.  </P> <P> What distinguishes the San Diego fort in Presidio Park from ones established at  Santa Barbara, Monterey and San Francisco, is that it is the only one that was  extensively preserved and available for excavation. The one in San Francisco  was destroyed by the Army in the 1850s, and the other two are beneath modern  structures, Bartel said.  </P> <P> Since fall, 1987, about 50,000 artifacts have been excavated from the northern  side of the fort by Bartel and SDSU students. Most of the artifacts came from  what was a trash dump next to the four rooms that have thus far been excavated.  That trash, Bartel said, has revealed pieces of Chinese pottery with blue  willow motifs from the 1770s and British imitations of the Chinese pottery from  the 1800s.  </P> <P> Bartel said they have found pieces of bowls, plates and teacups in different  floral patterns made by the British.  </P> <P> "The Spanish preferred British or Chinese pottery," Bartel said. "They were  users of other societies' pottery.  </P> <P> "They took a little slice of life from Europe with them," he said. "Frontier  duty for a soldier is not easy. Therefore, to be able to pick some aesthetic  preferences made life a little bit easier."  </P> <P> When control of the fort transferred from Spain to Mexico in the 1820s, the  trash changed. Among the shards were fragments of brightly painted Mexican  pottery, metal buttons, nails, beads, abalone and clamshells, and the bones of  thousands of butchered animals.  </P> <P> Other parts of the fort have already been excavated: a chapel on the southern  side by a San Diego State crew, from 1965-1976, and the fort's western wing by  a Mesa College crew, from 1976-1983.  </P> <P> The Serra Museum, dedicated in 1929 on a hill above the Presidio, has artifacts  from those excavations on display. The San Diego Mission was once situated at  the Presidio but was moved in 1774 to its present location in Mission Valley,  about 6 miles east.  </P> <P> The fort was abandoned in the 1830s when the inhabitants moved down the hill  into what is now Old Town.  </P> <P> The fort was buried in the 1930s, when George White Marston acquired the land  and gave it to the city to be used as a public park.  </P> <P> "He understood the significance of the site and wanted to preserve it," Bartel  said.  </P></p>

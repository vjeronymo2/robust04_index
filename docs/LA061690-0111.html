			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AND JAPAN WORK ON INTERIM TRADE ACCORD;  </P> <P> PACIFIC RIM: THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HOPES TO MAKE TOKYO 'FLESH OUT' ITS APRIL  PROMISES.  </P> <P> The United States and Japan began serious efforts Friday to iron out their  differences over a high-level interim accord that the two countries signed in  April to help ease their trade frictions, but the outcome of the spat remained  in doubt.  </P> <P> At a meeting in San Francisco, Secretary of State James A. Baker III pointedly  warned Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama that Japan must "flesh out" some  of the promises it made in the April accord or risk reviving anti-Japanese  sentiment in the United States.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear whether the meeting between Baker and Nakayama  would be enough to turn around lower-level talks, in which U.S. officials have  charged that Japan has been "stonewalling" American demands that Tokyo spell  out the concessions it made in April.  </P> <P> But participants in Friday's session said the tone of the talks provided some  optimism that top Japanese leaders are beginning to take U.S. demands more  seriously and may begin moving to provide the details Washington wants.  </P> <P> The meeting marked the first Cabinet-level discussions between the two  governments since the lower-level negotiations broke down two weeks ago. The  negotiators are scheduled to meet again -- presumably for the last time -- June  25-26.  </P> <P> The accord, which contained the most sweeping pledges for economic  restructuring negotiated by any two trading partners, involved a number of  Japanese pledges, from significant deregulation of Tokyo's goods-distribution  system to promises of a crackdown on bid rigging by Japanese construction  firms.  </P> <P> But the report clearly was intended as an interim step that would form the  basis of a final report that the two sides would hammer out shortly before the  annual seven-nation economic summit to be held July 9-11 in Houston.  </P> <P> Washington wants Japan to nail down several key concessions by providing  specific numerical targets for Japanese pledges to boost government spending on  public works projects and to increase penalties for violations of anti-monopoly  laws -- lest they be watered down in practice.  </P> <P> Until Friday, lower-level Japanese officials had flatly refused to move ahead  on any of the points that U.S. negotiators had raised, contending in effect  that the interim report initialed in April was sufficient and that no further  measures would be needed.  </P> <P> But U.S. officials said the session Friday was devoid of any such posturing and  that Nakayama had promised to carry the message back to top Japanese  policy-makers -- a signal that frequently means that an issue is about to be  considered more seriously.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said Nakayama also took pains to assure the Administration that  Japan did not intend to abandon efforts to reduce its balance of payments  surplus with the United States, despite suggestions to that effect by some  lower-level officials in Tokyo.  </P> <P> The suggestions, contained in a report published two weeks ago by the Japanese  Finance Ministry, enraged senior Bush Administration policy-makers, who had  spent months persuading Tokyo to make payment reduction its top goal.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said if the June 25-26 meetings do not produce any results, the  Administration may have to intensify its pressure -- possibly by involving  President Bush directly in talks with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.  </P></p>

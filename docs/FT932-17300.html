			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Calor ahead of forecasts at Pounds 33.6m CALOR GROUP, the liquefied petroleum gas distributor, yesterday reported better than expected results for the year to end-December 1992, bolstered by a stronger performance in the second half. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 33.6m from Pounds 45m in 1991 after exceptional charges of Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 7.2m) to cover redundancies and the write down of stock as part of the group's substantial two-year restructuring programme. The exceptional charges last year were as reported at the interim stage and comprised Pounds 11.4m to pay for gas busi-ness redundancies and other reorganisation costs, and Pounds 3.4m related to a write-down of Air Separation stock. An unchanged final dividend of 6p is proposed, maintaining the total for the year at 12p. The dividend is just covered by earnings per share of 12p (18.1p). However, Mr Michael Davies, chairman, said the directors made their recommendation in the light of buoyant earnings in the core gas business, the strength of the group's balance sheet, and the fact that the main restructuring of the group was complete. Turnover for the year fell by 14 per cent to Pounds 311m (Pounds 362.2m) due partly to a reduction in the tonnage of gas sold, but mainly to lower selling prices. Operating profits slipped to Pounds 49.6m (Pounds 54.8m). Finance costs were again reduced, with net interest charges falling to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 2.6m). This reflected lower interest rates coupled with a substantial reduction in capital expenditure and tight controls over working capital. Year end net borrowing was reduced by Pounds 10m despite further investment in the Air Separation business and the Pam Gas Central European partnership with Calor's main shareholder, SHV, the Dutch investment company which owns 46.2 per cent of the stock, and Primagaz, the French LPG distributor.</p>

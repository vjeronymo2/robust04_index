			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (6): A sign of confidence - Foreign banks in Spain THE biggest sign of confidence so far this year in Spain and in its financial sector has been neither the rush to buy shares in the Argentaria state banking corporation nor J. P. Morgan's involvement in an important rights issue by the under-capitalised Banesto group. It has been Deutsche Bank's decision to spend Dollars 350m on the acquisition of a medium-sized Spanish bank. The purchase followed a period of familiarisation with the domestic market which apparently convinced the German bank that there was good business to be done in Spain. Deutsche Bank first moved into the Spanish retail market in 1989 when it bought outright the 100-branch Barcelona-based Banco Comercial Transatlantico (Bancotrans), a bank that it had founded early in the century and which it forfeited after the Second World War. At Bancotrans, Deutsche Bank began to develop mortgages and also niche products such as car loans which were novel to Spain. The second acquisition involved Banco de Madrid, a subsidiary of Banesto. Banco de Madrid's 300-branch network in the Spanish capital and central Spain compliments the Bancotrans presence in the north-east of the country and together the two units make Deutsche Bank the biggest foreign bank operating in the domestic retail sector. Deutsche Bank is now bigger in Spain than Credit Lyonnais which bought two bank networks, each with about 150 branches, in 1990 and 1991 and it is nearly double the size of NatWest and of Barclays who both began building up Spanish networks in the 1980s. The German bank's move is by any standards a long-term investment. It now faces the testing task of welding together its two branch networks and moulding them to Deutsche Bank's own corporate culture. Complex in-house information systems which were installed in Bancotrans now have to be extended to Banco de Madrid and it will take at least eight years before employees extract optimum benefits from the technology. What Deutsche Bank has done is to buy a market quota. The strategy has been similar to that of Credit Lyonnais whose purchases of Banca Jover in Barcelona and of Banco Comercial, based in Madrid, both subsidiaries of Banco de Santander, also aimed to establish a solid presence in the centre of Spain and in the north-east. This is a quick route into Spain and it contrasts with the step-by-step approach developed by Barclays over the past 10 years following its purchase of a small, and bankrupt, domestic bank. The market quota strategy has an in-built advantage because Spain is a thoroughly overbanked country that has more bank branches per head of population than anywhere else in the European Community bar Luxembourg. Setting up a banking office in an optimum location, as Barclays has done, requires a lot of money and an equivalent amount of patience. The obvious positive elements in the step-by-step strategy are that the institution is able build up its staff gradually and according to its own standards and that it can likewise choose exactly where it wants to open for business. Foreign banks who would follow Deutsche Bank and others into Spain have both models to choose from. A market quota is readily at hand in the shape of Banco de Fomento, a subsidiary of Banco Central Hispano (BCH), with a nationwide network of 165 branches. BCH was in negotiations to sell its unit earlier in the year to Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), but the talks broke down allegedly because the price was too steep. At the begining of this month, BCH paved the way for Fomento's future disposal by paying the equivalent of Dollars 82m for the 32 per cent of the bank that it did not already own. The outright takeover was in the form of an offer of one BCH share for every two of Fomento and it was accompanied by a commitment from BCH to put aside Fomento's cash flow, which stood at Dollars 47.5m last year, for pension funds and reserves. BCH's move has put a clearer valuation on Fomento and its decision over the cash flow will serve to make the unit more attractive to potential buyers. Fomento's coverage of non-performing loans stood at 70.5 per cent last year, down from 84.4 per cent in 1991. The step-by-step strategy into Spain has in the meantime been made easier by the continuing process of network rationalisation that is being conducted by all the big Spanish banks, and particularly by BBV and BCH which have an oversupply of branches as a result of the respective mergers.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> SHOPTALK;  </P> <P> SERVING THE REAL MOTOR CITY  </P> <P> AUTOBOOKS ETC. AND Automotive Book Stop couldn't be further apart in  philosophy. But as a pair, the two bookstores have made an unlikely strip of  Magnolia Boulevard in Burbank a Mecca for car enthusiasts.  </P> <P> Autobooks Etc. is clean, well-lighted, aloof; Automotive Book Stop is gritty,  dark, about as friendly as a mechanic's smock. Autobooks Etc. has hundreds of  glossy new books; Automotive Book Stop has hundreds of gritty used tomes. One  is Sir Laurence Olivier; the other, Al Bundy.  </P> <P> This odd couple is heaven for auto lovers. From the hefty picture books  covering everything from Alfa Romeos to Zimmers and the well-stocked selection  of new periodicals at Autobooks Etc. to the automotive-shop manuals, sales  brochures and old magazines at Automotive Book Stop, all bases are covered.  "Our customers come from all walks of life; we have a lot of fun in here just  talking cars," says Fred Chaparro, owner of Automotive Book Stop. A former  midget-car racer, Chaparro doesn't stock anything exotic, but promises that he  can locate just about any book anybody wants.  </P> <P> Autobooks Etc. will also go the extra mile to find books for its customers. "In  addition to the new books, we carry out-of-print and rare items," says store  manager Neal East. "We have a lot of people -- we call them 'gearheads' -- who,  in the middle of a repair or a restoration job, are looking for do-it-yourself  materials. We can usually help them out." The store also gets a lot of  once-a-year business (mostly Australian and Asian auto enthusiasts visiting Los  Angeles from overseas, according to East).  </P> <P> And this being the movie capital of the world, both shops also get a lot of  studio business, people researching bygone eras for movie and television  productions, as well as stars who are car nuts. After all, everyone knows that  L.A. is the real Motor City. Autobooks Etc., 3524 W. Magnolia Blvd., Burbank;  (818) 845-0707. Automotive Book Stop, 1508-A W. Magnolia Blvd., Burbank; (818)  845-1202. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN  </P></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Half of electorate found to support system of PR - Electoral Reform HALF the electorate favours the replacement of Britain's first-past-the-post voting system by proportional representation, according to a 'state of the nation' survey published yesterday. Pressure on Mr Neil Kinnock and his shadow cabinet to back the change will be intensified by the disclosure that it would be approved by more than a two-to-one majority among Labour Party supporters. The survey, commissioned by the Rowntree Reform Trust and conducted by Market &amp; Opinion Research International (Mori), also indicated that Conservative voters were split almost evenly for and against the switch. This is seen as reflecting a growing public perception of Mr John Major, the prime minister, as a more consensual figure than Mrs Margaret Thatcher, his predecessor, but will make little impact on the Conservative party's traditional opposition to PR so long as it is able to command a majority in the Commons at regular intervals. Mr Robin Cook, principal health spokesman and leading advocate of the abandonment of the first-past-the-post voting system in the Shadow Cabinet, welcomed the verdict that Labour voters wanted PR even more strongly than the rest of the population. He emphasised: 'This poll shows Labour should stop resisting PR as a threat and start to recognise it as an opportunity'. Mr Cook's enthusiasm is unlikely to receive early public endorsement from Mr Kinnock. The Labour leader, like the majority of his senior colleagues, fears that a declaration of support for changing the voting system at the present time would be interpreted as lack of confidence in the party's prospects for forming a majority government after the next general election. Even so, a resolution approved by last year's Labour conference requiring the National Executive to consider alternatives to the first-past-the-post voting system for elections to the House of Commons ensures that PR stays high on the party's agenda. Mr Robert Maclennan, home affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats - the most consistent advocates of electoral reform among the leading political parties - said the survey showed they were more in tune with public opinion about how Britain was governed than any of their rivals. Other findings from the survey are: More than 50 per cent support fixed term parliaments, thus denying the prime minister of the day the right to make party advantage the first consideration in determining the date of a general election. The introduction of a bill of rights enshrining individual freedom has 72 per cent support, and 60 per cent believe government power is too centralised. While majority government is preferred on balance (49 per cent to 45 per cent), half the public would like to see more co-operation between the parties. A devolved assembly is the most popular option among Scottish voters, with majority support for legislation to establish one in the event of the Conservative party continuing to hold on to power through the seats won in England and Wales. Only 50 per cent of voters know the name of their constituency MP, and only a third are aware if their constituency comes within the category of a marginal seat. Opinion is almost equally divided over political contributions by trade unions (46 per cent want them banned while 43 per cent do not), and political contributions by companies (44 per cent want them banned and 45 per cent do not). Eleven to one favour a Freedom of Information Act (77 per cent for and 7 per cent against). Mori interviewed 1,547 adults between March 7 and March 25 in 180 constituencies.

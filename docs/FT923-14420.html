			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television One day the journalists who currently make environmentalist programmes, all of them belonging to the 'Have you stopped kicking kittens?' school of manipulation, may be joined by somebody who approaches the subject in a genuine spirit of inquiry. Until then we will have to make do with programmes such as Costing The Earth, which returns to Radio 4 today asking, among other things, whether everyone is being brainwashed by green propaganda (7.20). BBC2's six new documentaries States Of Mind are co-productions between the BBC and American public service broadcasters, exploring American life via different families. Today's programme observes events in middle class Milwaukee through the eyes of Fred Lach at the time of the trial of a man convicted of serial killings (8.10). BBC2's 'Screenplay' Force Of Duty (9.00) is a thriller set in Northern Ireland. An RUC detective becomes obsessed with finding the terrorists who killed his friend and police partner. Director Pat O'Connor previously directed 'The Ballroom Of Romance', a superb television drama.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: BAA The stock market is bound to worry that BAA's profits in the late 1990s will get stuck in the sludge works occupying the future site of Heathrow's Terminal 5. Investors, to be sure, have good reason to be cautious about the airline industry's long-term prospects, given the unanimous belief of the experts that everything looks rosy. But worries that BAA will be unable to fund the terminal from new borrowings and retained earnings are probably misplaced. After adjusting for interest and inflation the ultimate cost of the project could be Pounds 2bn, of which perhaps a little over half will be needed to complete Phase One in 2002. That implies additional capital spending of Pounds 100m a year, hardly excessive for a group which should be making profits of Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m this year. Admittedly, BAA is heavily cash negative at present due to existing capital commitments and low profits. But by 1996-97, when the work is expected to start, this should have reversed. The next pricing review is conveniently timed for around then, which could give the company an opportunity to repeat the sort of threats which helped it secure such a lenient regime last time. That said, it is hard to see BAA providing much excitement following the re-rating of the last six months. Relief at the outcome of the review, the disappearance of the Labour threat and the stay of execution for intra-EC duty-free have combined to leave the shares on a prospective yield of under 3 per cent and a forward multiple whose premium to the market is again higher than the post-privatisation average.</p>

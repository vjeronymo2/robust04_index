			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (10): The mobilisation of a diehard patriot - Profile: Christoph Blocher TO SOME, he is a right-wing eccentric, to others he is the conscience of the nation, the quintessential Swiss patriot. Christoph Blocher is a colonel in the Swiss army, a member of the federal parliament for the conservative People's Party and executive chairman of a successful speciality chemical company. He also led the forces that six years ago successfully opposed the proposal that Switzerland join the United Nations. And now he is in the forefront of efforts to block the federal government's plans to take the country into the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Community. If he were British, he would undoubtedly be a diehard Thatcherite. He distrusts bureaucrats and believes passionately that less is better when it comes to governments. He is also suspicious of corporate bureaucrats, and prefers to pay out big dividends to Ems-Chemie shareholders rather than use the company's strong cash flow for risky diversification projects or acquisitions. Next week, the Swiss are to vote in a referendum on joining the IMF and early next year they will have to decide whether or not to ratify the so-called European Economic Area (EEA) treaty, which would bring the six countries of the European Free Trade Area (Efta) closer to joining the EC. Mr Blocher is already mobilised for these campaigns, with beguiling negative arguments at the ready. On the IMF and World Bank, as on the UN, he h a s no particular complaints, but he thinks Switzerland is better off as a non-member. He insists that the country is not isolationist; it pays to support many of these organisations' projects and agencies, but it also reserves the right not to participate if it thinks a particular project is ill-conceived. 'If we were a member, we would have only one vote. We are a little country, so no one would listen to us. So it is better for us to be on the outside and decide on a case-by-case basis. I think also that our views are sought more than they would be if we were members.' Mr Blocher also resents the enthusiasm of what he calls 'official Bern' for joining these organisations. 'They say we must participate, that we must be in solidarity with other countries, but they really just want to be in the club so they can tell us, the people, that the club has decided something and there is nothing we can do about it. They like power, but Swiss democracy is against power.' His complaints against the EC are more numerous. Indeed, Mr Blocher opposes the EEA because he believes it is designed as a halfway house towards full EC membership. 'The government's policy is that the EEA is a first step towards EC membership. You cannot find many people in Switzerland who are for the EEA and against the EC. If anyone says he likes the EEA but not the EC, he is saying it for tactical reasons.' The basic problem with the EC, he says, is that it is an 'intellectual construction'. Viewing it with Swiss eyes, it appears very centralised, undemocratic and unfederal. 'We have a lot of difficulty finding out what officials in Bern are doing with our money. Brussels would be much worse.' He says the whole idea of a united Europe is fundamentally flawed. Europe is composed of several states with substantial differences in history, culture, language and economic and political systems. Several attempts have been made to unify it, but all have failed, and the EC will fail too. 'I am sure that it cannot function.' The current tensions between Germany and other countries in the European Monetary System (EMS) illustrate the difficulties. 'It is not that Germany has made a mistake or France or Britain; the mistake is having one system.' Mr Blocher thinks it is better to have competition between governments to prevent any one of them from getting too powerful or arrogant. He acknowledges that if it turns out that Switzerland is the only western European country to refuse to join the EC, Brussels might get tough. 'But they need Switzerland, too. This is not a new problem for us, and we have been in much more dangerous positions in the past than we are today. 'The EC wants to export. We are their largest single market after the US and they sell more to us than we sell to them.' Mr Blocher is not distressed either by the prospect of 'missing the train' by not joining the EC at the same time as the other Efta countries. 'Nobody can see what Europe will be like in 10 or 20 years. Perhaps it will be more decentralised, and then we could apply, if we wanted to. In a situation like this, it is better for a little country to wait and watch. 'This is not an egotistical stance. We want to be friendly with everyone, politically and economically open, but always maintaining our sovereignty.'</p>

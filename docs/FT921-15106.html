			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Three initials that spell a pension profit - AVCs offer people in company schemes an extra option. John Authers looks at their advantages and disadvantages YOU probably already know how to give your investments more PEP. But if you want to boost your pension, three other initials might also spell a strong and tax-efficient investment - AVC. Any member of a company pension scheme - but not personal pension plan holders - can make Additional Voluntary Contributions. Money paid into AVCs carries full tax relief at your top rate of income tax. This effectively means your contributions when invested in the fund automatically grow by a third, if you pay 25 per cent tax, and by two thirds if you pay 40 per cent tax. Many people do not realise this. A survey by Family Assurance of 20,000 of its members found that less than one in ten knew how to make Additional Voluntary Contributions. Perhaps this is not surprising. AVCs sound technically baffling, and their name implies that they are an integral part of company pensions. But since the pensions market was liberalised in 1987-88, with the introduction of personal pensions and changes to the rules on contracting out of SERPS, it has been possible to use AVCs as free-standing investments in their own right. They provide a vital tool in improving your pension beyond the basic amount your company will provide. PEPs can do this as well, of course, but as end-of-year tax-planning approaches, boosting pension contributions must be considered in the same context as sheltering equity investments from tax. Virtually all AVCs - with the exception of a few public sector pension schemes - are invested in funds separate from the main scheme. So the fact that you are already committed to a company scheme does not limit the broad range of possibilities facing you when choosing an AVC. Far from forming an integral part of a company scheme, the AVC could be more simply described as a personal pension plan for people who are already committed to a company scheme. But the rules are limiting. The maximum you can invest in an AVC in one year is 15 per cent of your gross earnings. If your company makes all the contributions into your pension scheme, then you are free to put a full 15 per cent of your gross income into an AVC. However, many company schemes require you to make contributions. A typical figure might be 5 per cent of your gross salary. In this case, you would be allowed to put up to 10 per cent of your gross income into an AVC. Another rule introduced for the new breed of AVCs makes them more of a headache - all the money from an AVC fund started since April 7 1987 must be used to buy an annuity when you retire. The annuity payments are then taxed. You cannot take any cash in a lump sum. There is no such limit on your freedom to spend the proceeds of a PEP. However, Brian Symonds, of Sun Life, points out that an AVC can still increase the size of the cash lump sum you receive when you retire. Your main company scheme may not be prepared to give you the maximum lump sum allowed by the law if you have not built up full pension rights within the fund. The trustees might think it more responsible to put more of your money into the annuity. If you can show that you have a guaranteed income from the AVC annuity, the trustees are more likely to give you the lump sum. This can be overlooked, but the restrictions on what you can do with an AVC are still a problem. Also, bear in mind that annuities paid in future would be taxed at the rates prevailing at the time. Buy a PEP or a TESSA, and you must do so out of income which has already been taxed, but it will act as a shelter against future taxes. Another barrier to understanding AVCs is their division into two forms of AVC contract - freestanding AVCs, and in-house AVCs. The differences between the two contracts are described in the box (below right), but note that neither is directly related to your salary. Both will build up a fund, and then buy as much income as possible with that. The law forces company schemes to offer AVCs. AVCs can be invested in a full range of funds; unit-linked, with-profits, unit-trust linked or building society funds are all available. This gives AVCs an advantage over PEPs, which can only be invested in equities. In the long term, equities give the best chance of capital growth. But if you are close to retirement, a broadly based AVC is more secure. There is a full choice of methods of paying contributions. You can pay by regular premiums, or make a one-off single lump sum contribution into a fund. Most plans are flexible. The Labour party, which could win the election due this year, is committed to raising taxes for those on the highest income. This is an incentive to buy a PEP which will deliver a tax-free lump sum no matter what taxes prevail when the plan is closed. It also gives PEPs an advantage over AVCs, because the annuities are taxed as income, and so would not offer any shelter against new taxes. But this does not mean that AVCs do not have an important part to play for many people, or that the choice between PEPs and AVCs is mutually exclusive. Money in an AVC is irretrievable until you retire. In a PEP it will make little sense to try to retrieve it for at least five years. Those in their 30s or 40s, with fairly tight commitments, might limit themselves to a high-yielding PEP, and wait to see how the markets perform over the next few decades. But if retirement is a little closer, do not forget the range of tax-efficient investments open to you through AVCs. One final advantage, pointed out by advisers Towry Law, is that AVCs are invested in tax-free funds. Qualifying endowments, also popular as shelters against a Labour tax regime, invest in taxed funds.</p>

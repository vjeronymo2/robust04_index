			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LIFEGUARDS USE TAPE TO SILENCE TRANSIENT  </P> <P> Two Long Beach lifeguards failed to use proper procedure when they taped the  mouth of an apparently drunk, profanity-spouting transient and left him bound  on the beach for several minutes, the chief lifeguard said Monday.  </P> <P> City lifeguard officials were reviewing the apprehension Sunday of Don Peterson  for possible disciplinary action against the two veteran lifeguards, said  Lifeguard Chief Jim Rae. He refused to release the names of the lifeguards.  </P> <P> "The officers just got frustrated at the time because the guy was verbally  swearing at the general public," Rae said. "It was a judgment call that  shouldn't have been done."  </P></p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Lib Dems under attack over racism inquiry The Liberal Democrat leadership was last night besieged by complaints from the Labour party - and its own councillors in the London borough of Tower Hamlets - that it had mishandled allegations of racism against its members. The Liberal Democrats published an inquiry into racism in the borough last week but Ms Gwynneth Deakins, who chairs Tower Hamlets' Liberal Democrat group, said that two party councillors had quit 'in disgust' at the weekend and a third councillor, who was severely censured in the report, would 'fight to clear his name'. Mr Peter Hughes, leader of the majority Liberal Democrats on the council, last night issued a statement which strongly criticised the national leadership and said: 'If any group members resign from the party we would continue as a single group and maintain the administration of the council.' A meeting of local Liberal Democrats last night moved to set up a breakaway group, Liberal Focus. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, yesterday pressed home his claim that the inquiry had censured the party leadership for 'incompetence or worse'. Mr Charles Kennedy, president of the party, said the matter had been investigated thoroughly following the Tower Hamlets by-election which resulted in the far-right British National party winning a seat. He told BBC 1's Breakfast with Frost programme: 'We have been accused of circulating racist literature. We set up an inquiry. It reported, we published it in full and we are taking action.' He accused Labour leaders of covering up an inquiry into their party's conduct in the September council election. 'Jack Straw, who is accusing us of not having dealt with this properly, knows that Labour has had an internal inquiry,' he said. 'They are not publishing it and we don't know if they are taking any action.' Mr Straw highlighted a section of the Liberal Democrats' report that accused Mr Graham Elson, the party's general-secretary, of 'failing in his duty' when he was checking the distribution of allegedly racist pamphlets at a by-election this year. Liberal Democrat leaders were reported to be furious that Mr Straw had requested Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, to refer the allegations against Liberal Democrat councillors to the Metropolitan police on the grounds of incitement to racism. Scotland Yard said on Friday night that the attorney-general had referred the matter to it. The Liberal Democrat leadership said the referral was 'of a standard nature in response to any such approach from an MP'.</p>

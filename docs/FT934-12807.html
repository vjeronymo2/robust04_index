			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Review must protect local democracy Sir, John Authers' piece ('Up the pole at the town hall', October 20) is an excellent summary of the problems and costs of the proposed review of local government. There is another point of national importance which may well be overlooked in the piecemeal review of local government structures. Some may argue that unitary structures will improve public accountability. Perhaps so, but only if the gradual accretion of powers from local democracy to Whitehall is halted. Local government exists to enable local choices to be made between competing and often irreconcilable demands. How do you choose - within limited budgets  -between the needs of the elderly and the young, the demands for better maintenance and nursery schools? It is the job of local politicians to decide these issues and to be publicly accountable for their decisions. As we review structures we need also to buttress local democracy against the tide of Whitehall's bureaucracy. Brian Briscoe, chief executive, Hertfordshire County Council, County Hall, Hertford SG13 8DE</p>

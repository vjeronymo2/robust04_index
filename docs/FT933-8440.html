			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Business ebbs at English seaside THE BIRCHFIELD, on the promenade at Weston-super-Mare on the Bristol Channel, is a 35-bedroomed Victorian hotel which 'by a fluke' has been full this week, its owner Mr David Wright said. On present bookings he expects it to be very quiet in a couple of weeks' time. In the resort as a whole, which has more than 6,000 hotel and self-catering beds, the occupancy rate for July and this month is only about two-thirds. Mr Wright, wearing his other hat as chairman of the town's hotels and restaurants association, said this was much the same as last year, when the number of bed-nights was 4 per cent down on the year before. The poor weather 'has had a dampening effect on people deciding on impulse to go away for the weekend. People are tending to book much later - if the weather is good they may well book a UK holiday, if it is poor they may well go into their travel agents and jet off to somewhere sunny,' he said. Few people now stay as long as a fortnight. 'Holiday patterns are changing dramatically. There is still a place for a week at an English seaside, but for a typical family it is not their main holiday any more.' Mr Wright said that Weston-super-Mare has suffered less than some resorts from the downward trend because it is within reach of the Midlands with motorway and rail links, and is a good touring centre. 'A lot of business has become tours-orientated, which may be in May or June. It is not necessarily true that July and August are the busiest weeks any more.' While it waits for an upturn, the town has been investing in its Victorian inheritance. 'Resorts are very fragile things,' he said. 'Once the rot sets into a resort it very quickly slips away. That is not the case at Weston, which is holding its own.'</p>

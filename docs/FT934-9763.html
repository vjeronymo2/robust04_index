			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Norway forced to reveal bank plan NORWAY'S finance ministry plans to make public a condensed version of a confidential report laying out options for possible mergers between the big four Norwegian banks. It said yesterday the report, prepared by Davis International Banking Consultants of the UK, had gone missing. As a result, a condensed version would be made available. The report, commissioned last year by the ministry, had a mandate to make recommendations about the structure of Norway's banking industry with a view to improving profitability. The report has apparently gone missing from the office of a member of the board of Norway's state-backed Bank Insurance Fund. The ministry said it had not made any decisions about recommendations in the report. 'In the discussion of possible merger solutions, all combinations between the four largest banks are considered,' the ministry said. Norway's four biggest banks, ranked by assets, include Den norske Bank (DnB), Christiania Bank, Sparebanken Nor, known internationally as Union Bank of Norway, and Fokus Bank. 'The report considers different measures to improve the profitability of Norway's banking business, among other things possible adjustments to the banks' domestic and international networks of subsidiaries and possible merger solutions,' the ministry said. Norway's banks have just begun to emerge from a six-year crisis. Christiania Bank plans to launch a public share issue this year, while DnB said it would issue shares some time next year. Against this background, the contents of the missing report are likely to raise a number of extremely sensitive political and stock market issues. The sector's fall into heavy losses forced the state to take a controlling share in three of the four biggest banks. Sparebanken Nor, Norway's biggest savings bank, remained independent. Norway has refused to allow its banks to establish so-called 'bad banks', into which defaulted loans are placed in a bid to speed recovery and protect healthy operations. DnB said the bank had no plans to merge. Christiania Bank refused to comment on the report. The report also suggests a further concentration of the savings banks and 'sees Sparebanken Nor as the natural centre for such a process'. The report also sees the state-backed Post Bank and Post Giro as possible merger candidates for the banks.</p>

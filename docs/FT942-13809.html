			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks turn firmer on bond prices Wall Street US stocks rallied as investors focused on a surge in bond prices and strong corporate earnings, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at its session high of 3,652.54, with several waves of program buying contributing to a 53.83 gain on the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 powered 6.77 ahead to 448.73. For a second day running, trading was frenzied, with volume reaching 379m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite improved 3.53 to 431.13, and the Nasdaq composite surged 13.22, or 1.8 per cent, to 718.74, ending a three-day losing streak. Stocks returned to old habits, closely tracking bond prices to sharply higher levels. On Wednesday, share prices had de-coupled from the US Treasury market, giving ground despite a rally in fixed-rate investments. There was a mixed bag of economic news on offer yesterday, but equity investors drew encouragement from the bond market's agility in side-stepping potential obstacles. The Labor Department was helpful, reporting a big jump in claims for unemployment benefit for a third consecutive week. Bonds moved higher and stocks were close behind them. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve, however, offered a more complicated view of the economy in its April survey of regional business conditions. The overall index was softer, but the prices-paid index, keenly watched by the inflation-sensitive bond market, was up sharply. Prices dipped on the news, but in a surprising display of resilience, recovered quickly. By the afternoon, bonds were showing solid gains. The equity markets were impressed by the rebound, as it suggested a mild reaction to Monday's move by the Federal Reserve to lift short-term rates. In Wednesday's session, investors were growing increasingly concerned over the impact of rising long-term rates on corporate profitability. Yesterday was indication that the worst may be over, leaving them free to concentrate a fresh batch of company results from the first quarter. International Business Machines was the star of the session. The bellwether stock jumped Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 58 3/8 after exceeding market expectations of its first-quarter performance. The issue accounted for nearly 10 points of the gain in the Dow industrials. Caterpillar, up Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 106 5/8 , made a smaller contribution in recovering some of its heavy losses the previous session. Sears was up Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 48 1/2 after showing improvement in the quarter. IBM's progress gave a boost to the entire technology sector, which has been hard hit over the past fortnight. Texas Instruments climbed Dollars 6 3/4 to Dollars 71 1/2 after announcing a decision to divest non-strategic business and to boost its dividend. Micron Technology rebounded from several days of weakness, adding Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 34 1/8 . On the Nasdaq, computer stocks staged a parallel rally, led by Wellfleet, up Dollars 5 1/4 at Dollars 71. Intel jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 60 1/4 and Microsoft climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 91 1/2 . Canada Toronto prices rose steadily throughout the day, in fairly active trading. The TSE 300 composite index jumped 61.29 points, or 1.49 per cent, to 4,167.22, with advances outpacing declines 454 to 284. The rebound followed four straight days of losses. Volume of 70.15m shares was above Wednesday's 60.83m shares, and trading value rose to CDollars 859.0m from CDollars 712.7m. All 14 stock groups ended higher, with transportation and conglomerates surging 5.25 per cent and 3.45 per cent, respectively. Mining gained 2.70 per cent, industrial products rose 2.36 per cent, and golds were up 1.55 per cent. Consumer products and energy gained 1.10 per cent and 0.98 per cent respectively, and banking was somewhat higher. Noranda Inc. was up  1/2 to 23 1/2 afte reporting a first-quarter net profit compared with a loss in the same period of l993.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Chinese leader presses for faster reform SIGNALS that 1992 will see economic and possibly political reform in China strengthened yesterday when a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong again referred to calls by the paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping for accelerated reform, Simon Holberton reports from Hong Kong. Wen Wei Po said government departments had been circulating Deng's observations on his recent visit to southern China - the region which has most embraced economic reform. Diplomats and analysts said the article was significant because the dissemination of information in this way was part of the Chinese way of building consensus about policy. It follows several reports which taken together suggest a struggle for party policy and succession is under way. However, not all accept that recent developments heralded a return to reform. Professor David Shambaugh of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, said a year ago the Chinese press ran pro-reform articles only for hardliners to reassert themselves later. The Chinese communist party is due to convene its 14th party congress late this year. At this meeting the party's 'line', or policy, will be established and a leadership appointed to carry it through. Signs of change may be visible at a meeting of the National People's Congress, China's token parliament, when it convenes in late March. Wen Wei Po said Deng's view was the improvement of the economy should be the Communist party's first priority in contrast to party dogma which since Tiananmen square has stressed correct ideological thinking.</p>

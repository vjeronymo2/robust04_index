			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, 28 February (TANJUG) -- Four Galeb-type  aircraft were shot down about 50 km west of Banja Luka, an  official NATO representative confirmed today in Brussels. The  aircraft that were shot down, according to him, refused prior to  this to heed a warning and make a forced landing.    The official NATO representative stated that U.S. F-16  fighter aircraft participated as part of NATO forces in the  shooting down of the planes. He also said the U.S. planes flew  from one of the bases in Italy.    The official NATO representative said first that the planes  that were shot down either belonged to the "Bosnian Serbs" or to  Serbia. He later corrected himself, saying that they flew from  territory controlled by Bosnian Serbs.    He also recalled that the NATO planes were authorized to  take  action on the basis of the Security Council resolution banning  flights over Bosnia. This ban, according to him, was infringed  by a total of six Galeb-type planes, but two planes from this  group succeeded in avoiding being shot down.    The same representative failed to reply to a question as to  whether this was an isolated incident or an action with more  serious consequences. He also refused to comment in any other  way on this incident, of which he said only that it took place  early this morning.</p>

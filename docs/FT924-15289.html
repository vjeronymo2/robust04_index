			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / No relief from gloom DATA published yesterday on the real economy provided little relief from the gloom which has been generated by the turmoil on the financial markets, writes Emma Tucker. The Building Employers Confederation angrily warned that another 50,000 jobs in construction were likely to disappear by the end of the year. Official figures added to the pessimism. The Central Statistical Office said consumers made a net repayment of Pounds 30m in August on credit agreements with finance houses, building societies and on certain credit cards, compared with July's Pounds 78m increase in net borrowing  - dashing hopes that consumer spending was reviving. Figures from the Department of the Environment showed that private house starts during the first eight months of the year fell by 7 per cent compared with the same period a year ago.</p>

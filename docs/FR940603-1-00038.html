			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current policies and procedures that will be affected are set forth in REA Bulletin 40&hyph;6, Construction Methods and Purchase of Materials and Equipment; REA Bulletin 40&hyph;8, Construction Specifications, Drawings and Contract Forms for Distribution, Transmission and Generation Facilities; REA Bulletin 81&hyph;6, Closeout Procedures and Documents for Contract Construction of Distribution and Transmission Facilities; REA Bulletin 85&hyph;1, Closeout Procedures and Documents for the Contract Construction of Generating Facilities and Associated Buildings; REA Bulletin 86&hyph;1, Closeout Procedures and Documents for the Construction of Buildings Other than Generating Plants; and REA Bulletin 86&hyph;3, Headquarters Facilities for Electric Borrowers. The current policies and procedures will be changed and updated by this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major substantive proposed changes are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) This proposal applies to procurement and construction for all projects which will or may be financed, in whole or in part, with loans made or guaranteed by REA. REA Bulletin 40&hyph;6 currently contains the requirements for all procurement and construction, regardless of the source of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) This proposal would eliminate the current requirement that REA approve subcontracts. (Subcontracts for generating projects are already exempt from REA approval.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) This proposal would change the dollar thresholds that determine which procurement procedure is to be used for a project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) This proposal would raise the dollar thresholds that determine whether REA approval of a contract is required and eliminate the requirement of REA approval of certain contract amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) This proposal would eliminate the requirement of REA approval of borrowers' contracts for headquarters facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) This proposal would add procedures for procurement of communication and control facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) This proposal would simplify the procedures for the closeout of construction contracts by reducing the number of forms to be submitted to REA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) This proposal would revise the REA standard contract forms. The major changes in the contract forms would be as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Change the forms to reflect the changes listed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Change the insurance and bonding dollar limits as outlined in 7 CFR part 1788.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Change the forms to require prequalification of all bidders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Change the interest rate on overdue accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Change the ``Buy American'' provision to include Mexico and Canada in accordance with the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of December 8, 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;182.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Change the indemnification clause (also called ``hold harmless clause'') to reflect REA's current policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Incorporate certain technical changes relating to wood treating and right-of-way clearing chemicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to reduce printing cost and volume, the forms to be included in this part are condensed, especially the tables. Also, several forms refer to guide drawings, which do not contain requirements, and, hence, will not be included. It is intended that once the forms are finalized, REA will reformat these forms similar to their current configuration (including the tables and drawings) and make them available in that format either from REA or for purchase from the Government Printing Office. See proposed &sect;1726.300 for a list of the standard forms of electric contracts and where each may be obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1726  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Electric power, Loan programs_energy, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Rural areas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In view of the above, REA proposes to amend 7 CFR chapter XVII by revising part 1726 to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

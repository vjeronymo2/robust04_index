			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Fight for the final frontier: The rise of Russia's satellite launch industry In Kazakhstan, Russian rockets are being readied to take on their US and European counterparts. The US vice-president has called for a tough line to be taken in delicate talks between Washington and Moscow. China is waiting in the wings to pick off the losers. It may sound like the cold war, but it is 1993 and the battleground is commerce, not ideology. The prize is a slice of the commercial space launch market worth Dollars 2bn a year. The Russian space industry is offering to launch western satellites for about half the cost normally paid in the west, and in some cases much less. But a price war could undermine western companies' struggle to diversify out of defence contracts. The Clinton administration has indicated that it might protect what it sees as a strategic industry and end the Bush doctrine of supporting this area of Russian industrial strength. Cut-price launches would bring many benefits. Telephone calls and satellite television should become cheaper. There could be improvements in air traffic control, weather forecasting and environmental monitoring. Companies might be able to make economic use of the weightlessness and vacuum of space in precision manufacturing. Many western companies are keen to capitalise on Russia's price advantage in the space industry. 'Everyone who wants to put up satellites is thinking about the Russians,' says an executive at an international satellite services operator. In December, for instance, London-based Inmarsat, one of the world's top satellite operators, gave Russia its first commercial launch contract, worth Dollars 36m. The equivalent launch with the international market leader, Europe's Arianespace, costs more than Dollars 60m. More western contracts should follow. Lockheed, one of the largest US defence contractors, has signed a pact with Russia's Khrunichev Enterprise, the builder of the world's most reliable rocket, the Proton. The joint venture will try to sell cut-price launches on Protons to companies and governments around the world. 'This is the tip of an iceberg that will lower the cost of transportation into space,' says Mr Mel Brashears, assistant general manager of Lockheed Missiles and Space. The iceberg is big enough to threaten the dominance of the west's launch industry. Built on the requirements of arms and space races, the Russian space industry still launches more than 50 rockets a year for scientific and medical research, ground observation, and telecommunications. Mr Yuri Milov, deputy director of the Russian Space Agency, says it could presently conduct four to five big commercial launches a year, and more in future with foreign investment. Arianespace, by comparison, had 10 launches last year. The western launch industry also has roots in defence and is suffering from the fall in the value of contracts which has followed the end of the cold war. Many defence companies have tried to diversify into civil work such as commercial satellite launching. Four western companies have been successful in this business. Paris-based Arianespace, owned by more than 50 European aerospace and finance companies and five governments, has half the market and sales of FFr5bn (Pounds 600m) a year. Its FFr14bn order book represents three years' work. In the US, General Dynamics and Martin Marietta, both defence contractors, have their Atlas Centaur and Titan rockets, and McDonnell Douglas, the aerospace company, has the Delta rocket. Their biggest customer is still the US government, but they also undertake commercial contracts. Despite Arianespace's dominance in launching commercial satellites, it is in the US where efforts have been greatest to ward off the Russian assault. Vice-president Al Gore has endorsed industry calls for 'fair market pricing' and limits on the number of launches made by eastern competitors. 'The emergence of (space industry) competitors from non-market economies increases the opportunities for predatory pricing - the very same economic weapon that foreign countries employed in the 1980s to target and destroy the American manufacturing base,' he said in a speech immediately prior to the November elections which outlined the incoming administration's aerospace policies. The Clinton administration has the power to prevent Russian commercial launches by refusing export licences for satellites. This would be a reversal of the previous administration's policy of encouraging both the Russian and Chinese space industries in an attempt to encourage economic reform. Lockheed is confident that Washington's authorisation of its deal with Khrunichev, at a time when Bush administration officials were working closely with their successors, is a sign that policy will not change much. Yet the pressure for protection of the western launch industry is likely to strengthen as Russia seeks to increase its commercial launches. Further Russian price cuts are already on the table. Russia has offered to launch South African satellites on converted SS-18 or SS-25 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The sophisticated guidance systems in the missiles should allow the accurate placing of a satellite in orbit. The price is Dollars 10m. In an attempt to avoid a damaging dispute, Russian government and industry officials are holding informal talks with their American counterparts, as well as with the European Space Agency and European Commission. A tripartite deal setting quotas and price floors for Russian launches could emerge later this year. But commercial pressures may quickly mount. Within days Eutelsat, the Paris-based group which provides satellite telecommunications between European countries, will choose to launch its next satellite with either General Dynamics, Arianespace or Proton. Mr Jean Grenier, Eutelsat's director general, acknowledges his organisation's pro-European 'solidarity' with Arianespace and a recent success with the General Dynamics rocket. But the Russians also get approval: 'We need reliability and a good price and without any doubt the Russians have a lot of experience, they have invested a lot of money and talent in their space industry.' A second contract for Proton would confirm the arrival of the Russians as a significant presence in the satellite launch market. But in so doing, it might also increase the prospect of a trade war in space.  ------------------------------------------------------                    SHARE OF GLOBAL                    COMMUNICATIONS                   SATELLITE MARKET                       (% SHARE)  ------------------------------------------------------                   Completed 1981-1991 US                                              34.4 Europe                                          18.7 International                                   18.0 Rest of world                                   28.9  ------------------------------------------------------                   Forecast 1992-2003 US                                              22.8 Europe                                          23.4 International                                   20.7 Rest of world                                   33.1  ------------------------------------------------------ *Forecast; Source: Euroconsult  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POOL IS NOW OPEN; TRUNKS REQUIRED  </P> <P> Connie was the first to test the waters, delicately dipping the tip of her  trunk into the murky water, much as a person might wet a toe to check the  temperature.  </P> <P> She trumpeted loudly. Then, finally, Connie took the plunge.  </P> <P> She was the bravest of the San Diego Wild Animal Park's seven female Asian  elephants, which edged up cautiously to their plush new pool shortly after  being released into the compound Monday. The pool is designed to provide a more  aesthetic and natural environment, as well as to get the pachyderms exercising  more.  </P> <P> "Nita we would have expected to go in right away because she's the dominant  elephant, and she's usually the one who goes trying something out before others  will," said Tom Hanscom, spokesman for the park.  </P> <P> Eventually, Nita and the others took turns getting wet, only to fling dirt on  themselves with their trunks once they got out.  </P> <P> "Elephants, when they get wet, they get itchy," elephant program manager Alan  Roocroft explained.  </P> <P> A boulder placed in a clearing in the compound is at a height just right for  them to scratch their undersides after a swim, he said.  </P> <P> The $100,000 Asian elephant pool, which opens to the public today, has been  five months in the making and is the first step toward bringing patrons within  arm's length of the floppy-eared beasts at the park near Escondido.  </P> <P> It replaces an older, smaller pool and is similar in size to one built for the  African elephants in a neighboring compound.  </P> <P> The park hopes to eventually build a deck reaching to the edge of the wading  pool and to plant grass in parts of the compound, which now is mostly dirt.  </P> <P> The pool and the compound, which includes boulders and ficus and bamboo trees,  was designed for the convenience and health of the elephants, park employees  said.  </P> <P> A collage of boulders, some of them weighing 6 tons, were placed in a pattern  that makes it impossible for them to be dislodged.  </P> <P> "It's kind of like a jigsaw puzzle," Roocroft said. "We want them to be able to  get to them and use them as scratching posts, but obviously we don't want them  to be moving them. Given the right terrain, though, they could move those rocks  quite easily."  </P> <P> The elephants did succeed in rocking one of the boulders forward, but could not  pull it out.  </P> <P> The pool gives the elephants a chance to swim, something they couldn't do in  their old pool.  </P> <P> "Elephants don't move normally in captivity, and you've got to find ways to get  them to exercise," Roocroft said.  </P> <P> The pool, which is 9 feet deep and has two entrances, is deep enough to put the  8-foot-tall elephants through a healthy workout and is designed to accommodate  their social structure.  </P> <P> "If we were to build a pool with just one entrance, you may have a dominant  animal at the entrance keeping a sub-dominant one in or out of the pool,"  Roocroft said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry plans  to strengthen risk management measures for insurance businesses,  with a key piece giving policyholders rights to file a suit  against insurers even if the policyholder is alone, ministry  sources said Monday [23 May].    Under the current law, at least 3 percent of the  policyholders have to unite to file a suit to check their  insurer's management situation or possible illegal activities.    That requirement practically prohibits policyholders from  seeking law protection, particularly if their insurance firms  are large.    For example, in the case of Nippon Life Insurance Co., a  policyholder would have to call and unite more than 450,000  other policyholders to bring a suit.    According to the ministry sources, the other risk-managing  measures include establishing a finance body to salvage any  financially troubled insurers, and allowing issuance of  corporate bonds to insurers as a means of new fund-raising  channels.    Reorganizing insurance firms into a joint-stock corporation  from the current mutual aid status is also being sought so to  strengthen their management in the face of increasing  competition, they said.    The measures are planned by the Insurance Council, an  advisory panel to the finance minister, as part of regulation  reforms ahead of foreign entry in Japan's life and nonlife  insurance industries.    With the suggestions, the Finance Ministry is likely to put  the new guidelines into effect in the spring of 1996, the  sources added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 12 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] On 11 May, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan stated in Tokyo that he prefer a  general election under the existing multiseat constituency  election system. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata reacted strongly to  Murayama's remark, saying: "The remark is problematic. If the  next election should be held under the existing election system,  why did we have to carry out political reform? Obviously, some  people do not want political reform."    On top of that, Hata stressed he has no intention of  dissolving the lower house under the multiseat constituency  system, and said "it is not time for dissolution of the lower  house."</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Software makes hospital rounds MANY hospital management information systems have been based on large centralised computer systems, which can prove unwieldly and expensive. But software now under development that runs on personal computers, using a client-server architecture, could help reduce the costs. Devised by Meta Generics, of Cambridge, for King's Healthcare (formerly Camberwell Health Authority), in London, the HS2000 system uses standard operating systems such as Dos and Unix as well as off-the-shelf hardware. As a result, systems can be put together for either large or small hospitals, and expanded as required to enable doctors, nurses and administrative staff to work from one information base. A further advantage of HS2000, which will be marketed by Sema, of Cambridge, is that graphical user interfaces and a mouse enable staff to manipulate visual information - moving a patient from intensive care, say, to a general ward.

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (25): Writing its own success story - BancoSol, the unorthodox bank BancoSol, not yet three years old and the smallest of all Bolivian banks, is writing its own success story. Inspired by a 'bank for the poor' in Bangladesh, this unorthodox financial institution presently channels through its 29 branches short-term 'mini-loans' to 60,000 individuals 'who wouldn't normally get through a bank's glass doors,' says Mr Pancho Otero, BancoSol's general manager. BancoSol has set up its unusual headquarters in a bustling, lower middle-class district next door to La Paz's San Pedro prison - a far cry from the marble banking halls of El Prado preferred by its more traditional rivals. BancoSol customers make up 40 per cent of all Bolivian borrowers, but the average individual credit is a tiny Dollars 500. Bad loans are almost unheard of. The first write-off in BancoSol's history was in October  -for Dollars 1,500. Each month, the bank processes 12,000 loans for Bolivia's army of informal entrepreneurs - known to economists as 'the self-employed' and estimated to number about 1m. BancoSol's clients, a majority of them women, would never receive credit from a traditionally-constituted bank: they lack the necessary documentation and formal guarantees. Forty per cent of all credits go to finance the commercial activities of street-traders, the rest to workshops and small back-street factories. The secret of BancoSol's success lies in its policy of lending only to small groups of between three and eight who co-guarantee the loan. Alicia Aira, Flora Blanco and Irma Gutierrez are a typical group of borrowers. All three are tough-talking Aymara women, proudly dressed in traditional bowler hats and many-petticoated skirts. Their Spanish is deficient but their business talents irrefutable. All make their living as street-traders, with adjoining pitches in central Avenida Camacho. One sells sweets, another sun-glasses and the third, magazines. In October, they were seeking BancoSol credit for working capital in preparation for the busy Christmas season - Dollars 500 each for eight months at 2.5 per cent a month. Without BancoSol, their only alternative would be an informal loan shark who would charge at least twice that. 'There's an unquenched thirst for credit in the informal sector,' says Mr Javier Villanueva, a young university graduate-turned-stockbroker at Saxxon Capital who wrote his thesis on informal banking practices in Bolivia. He has identified some 50 non-governmental organisations which presently grant informal credits outside the banking law. But BancoSol is the first formalised bank to attend those needs. Five NGOs are awaiting the green light from Bolivia's banking superintendency to become authorised lending institutions. BancoSol, meanwhile, aims to lend a total of Dollars 150m in 1998. With Dollars 7m in capital, BancoSol eschews the mask of philanthropy. 'It's run along the same criteria as any other bank,' says Mr Otero, who expects profits of Dollars 1m for 1994. It receives credits at commercial rates (between 10 and 12 per cent a year) from other banks and large, liquid companies to increase volume. A pilot programme to attract small savers has got off the ground, bringing in Dollars 4m to date. International organisations such as Massachusetts-based Action International, the Fundes foundation of Switzerland for the promotion of small enterprise and the IADB's offshoot IIC are all shareholders in BancoSol. But so too, encouragingly, are some of Bolivia's wealthiest businessmen with a social penchant: President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, Mr Fernando Romero, former planning minister, and Mr Julio Leon Prado, a prominent entrepreneur, all have a stake in BancoSol and are ready to offer professional advice.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Bulgaria suffers wave of strikes A wave of strikes and protests by workers demanding overdue wages spread in Bulgaria yesterday, Reuter reports from Sofia. The Podkrepa trade union called ore and coal miners out on strike from yesterday and said it expected the stoppage to attract a total of 25,000 miners by the end of the day. The other strong labour grouping, the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions which launched an ore-mining strike 13 days ago, said 20,000 strikers were to decide yesterday whether to accept an agreement signed by the non-party government and union leaders on Friday. The Trud daily said yesterday the government had promised to transfer 283m levs (Pounds 6m) to the ore mines. But the Podkrepa mining federation said the union had demanded documents to guarantee that government promises would be fulfilled. 'We demand a decision on which mines will be closed and our people must know where they will work afterwards,' it said. Delays in the restructuring of the pollution-hit ore mining industry, which produces mainly lead and zinc, are widespread in the state sector where unreformed enterprises are floundering.</p>

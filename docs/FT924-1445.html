			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Beijing welcomes Yeltsin RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin, vilified a year ago as a traitor to communism by China's leaders, was warmly greeted in Beijing yesterday by Chinese President Yang Shangkun and accorded a 21-gun salute. The Russian leader told reporters it would be abnormal for two great nations sharing a 4,000km border not to develop co-operation. He said the two sides must make 'every effort to develop mutually beneficial trade and friendly co-operation.' Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the then Soviet leader, visited China in May 1989 in a trip overshadowed by the doomed student democracy movement which took over the streets and hailed him as a hero. The Chinese economy is booming under tight political controls while Russia's attempts at free market reform have so far failed to bring the measure of economic prosperity and double digit growth apparent along China's east coast. Barter trade along the border grew 20 per cent this year. Almost 20 documents are due to be signed during the visit. They include a joint declaration on the basic principles of Russian-Chinese relations and agreements on co-operation in trade and in the economic, scientific, technical, nuclear energy and cultural fields.</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Tory rebels firm on vote THE TORY rebel camp was holding surprisingly solid last night with 72 hours to go before the critical vote the Maastricht treaty. Questioning of rebels yesterday suggested that those who are determined not to support the government might still number as many as 35, even after a hard weekend's work by government whips. Should that hard core vote against Mr John Major's paving motion on Wednesday, the prime minister, would face an ignominious defeat. However, if even a relatively small number were to abstain, the government would probably scrape home. The most heartening news for the rebels yesterday was a clear statement from Mr Bill Cash, the arch-Euro-sceptic MP for Stafford, that he will be 'most emphatically voting against' the government motion. 'I cannot see a redeeming feature in the treaty,' he said yesterday, adding that he would support his party in a vote of confidence if the verdict went against the government. Mr Iain Duncan-Smith, Lord Tebbit's successor as MP for Chingford, was also on the point of deciding to vote against the government, saying that he would inform the whips today of his final decision. 'This is about the Maastricht treaty,' he said of the meticulously crafted motion with which the government still hopes to bring enough potential rebels back on board. 'Now is the time to vote against it. We will never get another chance.' In another shot in the arm for the rebels, Sir Gerard Vaughan, MP for Reading East, made clear that he was still agonising over how to vote in spite of telling the whips that the government would have his support. 'I may have to tell them that I have changed my mind,' he said, adding that he did not think he would abstain. In a more cheering development for the government, Mr James Pawsey, MP for Rugby and Kenilworth, was one of a number of potential rebels to say they had decided not to vote against the motion.</p>

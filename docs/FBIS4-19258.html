			<p>BFN     [Text] Spain has just made public its position on  ratification of the GATT world trade liberalization agreement.  We will now hear from our special correspondent in Marrakech,  Jose Luis Garcia Sanchez. Good afternoon.    [Garcia Sanchez] Hello, good afternoon. The Spanish  administration is convinced that the signing in Marrakech will  give a new impulse to world economic growth and to the wellbeing  of all countries.    State Secretary for Trade Apolonio Ruiz Ligero was in charge  of reading the Spanish position which highlights the need for  the new world trade body to study the social rights of workers  in developing countries.    Spain believes that forced labor, the lack of trade union  legislation, and general wages agreements which fail to protect  third world workers should be condemned. Furthermore, Ruiz  Ligero says that the signing of the Uruguay Round will favor  Spain in the long-term, it will not hurt our agriculture, and he  calls upon Spanish businessmen to test their ability to compete  in the world marketplace as well as at home.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Foreign investment in India up eightfold in year Foreign investment in India is estimated to have risen eightfold in the year ending this month to about Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.9bn), far above the government's targets and the most optimistic private forecasts. Announcing the figure at a business conference yesterday, Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, urged businessmen to make further investment commitments, saying the economic reforms carried out since 1991 required 'a vigorous response from both foreign and Indian investors'. The estimated total includes about Dollars 1.5bn in direct investment and about Dollars 3.5bn in foreign fund managers' investment in Indian stock markets and overseas issues made by Indian companies. The figures measure actual inflows, not investment approvals, and compare with a total of Dollars 585m for 1992-93. The big inflow of portfolio investment reflects the fact that India's financial markets were largely closed to foreign investors until late 1992 and the general popularity of investment in emerging markets, as well as growing appreciation of India's prospects. The Dollars 5bn estimated total for 1993-94 compares with a forecast of Dollars 3bn published in the government's annual Economic Survey only a month ago. At the start of the financial year, finance ministry officials expected inflows of up to Dollars 2bn at most. They believed it would take years for inward investment to pick up speed. They are pleased actual inflows exceed their forecasts but there is concern that a large element of the inflow is portfolio investment, which could be reversed if fund managers sell their holdings. The government's policy is to encourage direct investment, especially in infrastructure. Mr Singh said India remained committed to further reforms, including liberalisation of foreign exchange rules, financial markets and trade policy.</p>

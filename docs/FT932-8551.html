			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Kurds die in gunfight Turkish troops killed 13 Kurdish guerrillas and wounded two in a gunbattle in south-east Turkey, agencies report. An official at the regional governor's office in Diyarbakir said the clash, the bloodiest since rebel Kurds declared a ceasefire in March, took place on Sunday near the town of Kulp. Turkey says it does not recognise the unilateral ceasefire proclaimed by the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and has called on all PKK fighters to surrender unconditionally. More than 5,600 people have been killed since the PKK began fighting for an independent Kurdish state in 1984.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Bundesbank resistance grows to further cuts in interest rates RESISTANCE to further interest rate cuts is growing among Bundesbank policymakers alarmed by rapid money supply growth and ballooning public sector deficits. The heads of three state central banks, all members of the Bundesbank central council, yesterday spoke out against relaxing monetary policy despite more evidence that the recession has yet to ease. The engineering industry reported an 11 per cent year-on-year drop in orders during April, while the federal statistics office said turnover in the wholesale trade fell a real 5 per cent in the first quarter. Meanwhile, the west German inflation rate fell in line with expectations to a provisional 4.2 per cent in May, compared with 4.3 per cent in April, and the Bundesbank's medium-term target of 2 per cent. According to Mr Guntram Palm, president of the Baden-Wurrtemberg central bank, there was no further room for rate cuts because the M3 measure of money supply growth overshot the Bundesbank's target range last month. There was a danger that the May figure would also exceed the upper limit of 6.5 per cent, he said. Mr Dieter Hiss, of the Berlin and Brandenburg bank said a pause in the recent series of small cuts could be in order in the light of monetary developments and the D-Mark exchange rate. The German currency's advance against the dollar had come to an end, he said, and it was no longer so strong within the European monetary system. Although recent signs of weakness were not a 'trend', he said, the D-Mark's strength had to be protected by monetary policy when necessary. Yesterday's comments had a significant impact on financial markets, forcing dealers to scale down their expectations of German rate cuts while strengthening the D-Mark inside the European exchange rate mechanism. The D-Mark strengthened against all currencies, pushing the dollar down 2 1/2 pfennigs on the day to a close of DM1.5870. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London, said there would probably be little further reduction in German interest rates in the next six weeks. 'That will make it difficult for European countries to reduce interest rates, and may trigger new tensions inside the ERM in the longer term,' he said. The comments by Bundesbank central council members coincided with renewed opposition to any more relaxation from Mr Lothar Muller of Bavaria, who earlier this week criticised money supply growth rates and ever-growing public sector deficits, and said rates would not be cut for some months. The central bank council has been shaken in the past two weeks by the unexpected surge in April M3 and the sharp upward revision of Bonn's budget deficit estimates. Germany's ruling coalition ignored yesterday the protests of industrial lobbies and agreed to impose a surcharge on workers and employers to finance the growing cost of health care for the elderly, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. The plan will pay for residential care for 1.1m elderly persons. It foresees an initial 1 per cent surchage - shared equally between employers and employees - on income, starting January 1, 1994. It will rise to 1.7 per cent on January 1, 1996.</p>

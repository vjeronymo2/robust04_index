			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mustafa Shihab: "Al-Zamil Emphasizes Need for </F> Conservation of Electricity Consumption in Saudi Arabia"]    [Text] The Saudi minister of industry and electricity,  Engineer 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Zamil, emphasized the need for  conservation of electric power consumption in Saudi Arabia. In  this regard, he called upon government organizations, especially  companies, in addition to citizens and [foreign] residents, to  respond to the need to conserve the utilization of electrical  apparatuses.    Al-Zamil, in a meeting with journalists the day before  yesterday after he signed a contract with the Middle East  Engineering and Development Corporation dealing with expanding  the Tabuk power plant, said that the total amount of electricity  consumed in Saudi Arabia last year was 15,000 megawatts, whereas  the total amount produced was 18,000 megawatts, with 2,500  megawatts being produced by desalinization plants on the Red Sea  and the Persian Gulf.    The minister emphasized that the abundance in the  electricity  produced does not mean that there is an abundance of electricity  available for all areas of the country. He indicated that  electricity production and utilization differ from area to area  and that "this is why there remains an urgent need to conserve  consumption, especially in the areas where the demand is  particularly heavy."  <H5>  Wasteful Consumption </H5>   He said: "There is at least a 20 percent waste in  consumption." In this regard, he said that the ministry will  cooperate with the General Electricity Organization to implement  an integrated program for the conservation of power consumption,  in accordance with measures that are in effect in various  nations of the world.    Al-Zamil expects that, during the next three months, a  contract will be signed for constructing the ninth power plant,  between Riyadh and al-Qasim, which will serve the central area  of the country in addition to the capital city of Riyadh. He  said that the bids submitted by the companies are being studied  right now.    Sources expect the General Electric Corporation to play a  role in the construction of the new plant. The lowest bid for  the construction of the plant was 3 billion riyals [SR] ($800  million).    In addition to this, he announced plans for the expansion of  power plants in the following cities in the northern area:  al-Jawf, 'Ar'ar, Rafha, and al-Qurayyat. In this regard, he said  that one of the options being considered in this sector was the  possibility of setting up a unified power company in this area.    The Saudi minister of industry and electricity, together  with  Engineer Mahmud Tibah, the head of the General Electricity  Organization, signed a contract for the expansion of the Tabuk  power plant with Mr. 'Abdallah al-'Utayshan [name as  transliterated], chairman of the board of the Middle East  Engineering and Development Company, Ltd. (MEEDCO). The value of  the contract, which is to be implemented within 24 months, is  SR230 million.  <H5>  Expansion Details </H5>   Al-Zamil mentioned that the contract includes the  construction of two power units having a total capacity of 120  megawatts. The contract also includes provision of all the other  requirements pertaining to technical support, spare parts, and  maintenance. Also included is the mechanical [engineering] work  pertaining to the fuel system, fire fighting, the compressed air  system, and the necessary mechanical hoisting apparatuses.  Likewise, the contract includes the electrical [engineering]  work pertaining to the main transformers and generators, the  civil [engineering] work pertaining to expansion and laying out  of roads, a water purification system, cable lines, and also the  training of Saudi technical engineers and an insurance engineer  for the project.    He said that the contract was one of the important things  being done in the northern area (Tabuk), in view of the steady  increase in the work being undertaken as a result of the  industrial and agricultural development and population increase  taking place in the area.    MEEDCO, which won the contract, was founded in 1978 with a  capital of SR10 million. The chairman of the board, 'Abdallah  al-'Utayshan, contributed 51 percent of this amount, and 49  percent was furnished by the South Korean firm Hyundai.    The company began its activity in the field of construction  by implementing the Ministry of Defense's housing project in the  Tabuk area. Then the company switched over to the field of  electricity. At the present time it is implementing contracts  for the expansion of three substations that are part of the  Riyadh electrical system, in addition to a contract involving  the Bani Malik Station in the area of Jizan.</p>

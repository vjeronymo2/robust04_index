			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Pay revelations raise eyebrows - Bernard Simon examines Canada's latest corporate governance move Correction (published 19th May 1994) appended to this article. Canada's corporate gossip-mongers are having a field day. Since the beginning of this year, they have been fed a juicy diet of proxy statements which for the first time disclose the pay packets of the captains of Canadian commerce and industry. Barely a day goes by without the business press carrying a prominent story about the surprisingly high or surprisingly modest remuneration of some or other chief executive. Corporate governance and executive compensation consultants expect that the disclosures will not only be good for their business, but could have significant repercussions in boardrooms, among outside shareholders and even in the political arena. Mr Richard Finlay, a Toronto consultant, describes the new rules as the biggest advance in corporate governance in Canada since the start of securities regulation. 'We're paying a lot of attention to it,' adds Mr Bob Sillcox, head of investments at Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (Omers), one of Canada's biggest pension funds. According to Mr Sillcox, Omers has already raised the question of excessive compensation with a company (which he declines to identify) in which it has an investment. At least one large institutional investor, the Ontario teachers' pension fund, has decided to publish details of its own executives' compensation. The chairman of the fund's board said recently: 'Since we sort of bug other people about this and they are now required to do it, the question arises, why shouldn't we do it?' The new rules were imposed last year on a reluctant and notoriously clubby business community by Ontario's social-democratic government. The government over-ruled the advice of the Ontario Securities Commission, which had recommended that companies reveal only the aggregate compensation paid to their top five executives. The new guidelines closely follow rules applied by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Every company registered in Ontario (which in practice means all those listed on the Toronto stock exchange) must disclose the annual salary, bonus, share options and other compensation paid to each of its top five executives for the past three years. No Canadian executive comes close to the USDollars 203m reportedly taken home last year by Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, the US entertainment group. Nonetheless, several of the dozens of compensation statements published in Canada over the past three months have raised eyebrows. By far the most contentious has been the CDollars 4m to CDollars 6m awards - all in the form of bonuses - paid to each of the three top officers of First Marathon, a medium-sized Toronto securities firm. First Marathon's net profit more than doubled last year to CDollars 44.6m (USDollars 32.3m). But the combined pay packets of the top three officers amounted to more than a third of bottom-line earnings. First Marathon's senior management, long famed for their swashbuckling style, control the company through multiple voting shares. At the other end of the spectrum, Mr Peter Godsoe, Bank of Nova Scotia's chairman, has been singled out as one executive who might legitimately ask for a raise next year. BNS's earnings of CDollars 714m and its 14.4 per cent return on equity were the highest among Canada's big six banks in 1993. But Mr Godsoe's total remuneration of CDollars 786,400 was relatively modest compared to his counterparts. Mr Matthew Barrett, Bank of Montreal's chairman, earned CDollars 1.75m. In many cases, bonus payments appear to bear little relationship to a company's performance. Royal Trust, the loss-making financial institution which collapsed into the arms of Royal Bank of Canada last August, paid its top five executives CDollars 3.2m, including a raft of bonuses and consulting fees. Bramalea, the troubled real-estate developer, paid its chief executive a CDollars 285,000 bonus as part of his CDollars 971,000 earnings. The company justified the bonus on the grounds that its losses narrowed to CDollars 91m from more than CDollars 900m in 1992, and it posted positive cash flow after negotiating a debt-restructuring agreement. Some executives have paid a tangible price for their companies' lacklustre performance. Mr Red Wilson, chairman of BCE, Canada's biggest public company, took a 35 per cent pay cut last year to just under CDollars 750,000 in the wake of the heaviest losses ever suffered by the company. Nova, the Calgary-based pipeline and petrochemicals group, has taken the ultimate step in linking compensation with performance by paying its chief executive entirely in common shares. The barrage of publicity on executive pay 'is waking shareholders up to (compensation) issues', says Mr Bill Mackenzie, vice-president at Fairvest Securities, which specialises in corporate governance. It will take some time, however, before the full repercussions of disclosure can be assessed. Mr Sillcox notes that the bald numbers published in proxy statements do not tell the full story. He says Omers needs to examine such questions as the composition of boards of directors and their compensation committees before it can draw any firm conclusions. One safe bet, however, is that many directors will think much more carefully at the end of this year not just about how much senior management should be paid, but also about how the decisions should be explained to increasingly vigilant shareholders. CORRECTION Mr Peter Godsoe is president and chief executive of Bank of Nova Scotia, not chairman as wrongly reported on May 10.</p>

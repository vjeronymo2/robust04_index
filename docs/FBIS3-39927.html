A spokeswoman for the Federal Economics  Ministry stated on Tuesday [22 February] that, as far as Bonn is  concerned, the point is to prevent financial damage, while Iran  did not want to cut itself off from the possibility of being  granted further Hermes guarantees. Both sides have differing  views regarding, among other things, the beginning of the  repayment of debts and the number of installments. Before the  beginning of a new round of talks, the Iranian side will be  contacted by telephone at the end of the week, the spokeswoman  said.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (1): Goal is to be on the fast track to EMU - As recession lifts, Ireland is in a good position to take advantage of the upswing When the Channel Tunnel linking Britain and France was officially inaugurated earlier this month, most Irish newspapers were quick to note that Ireland was now the only EU nation without a land-link to the rest of the member states. They lamented the fact that the tunnel would reinforce Ireland's isolation and warned that Irish goods would find it more difficult to compete with British ones in Europe's populous heartland. What good are Irish Oscars, Booker Prizes and successes in the Eurovision song contest if they do not produce jobs, they asked? Although Ireland has had some outstanding successes in stealing the European limelight in music, literature and film over the past year, the frustration of not being closer to the economic and political pulse of Europe is strongly felt. As the European parliamentary elections approach, there are no powerful Euro-sceptic lobbies or irate backbenchers berating the government for wanting to be in the fast track to European monetary union (EMU). That goal is a cross-party objective. But Irish fears of economic isolation are perhaps overstated. As the clouds of recession show signs of breaking up, the country appears to be better positioned than many of its EU partners to take advantage of the upswing. The Fianna Fail-Labour coalition, now in its second year, has maintained the central thrust of the economic policy pursued by two previous governments since 1987 - reduction in the debt/GNP ratio and securing price stability. A measure of that policy's success is that inflation in 1993 fell to 1.5 per cent, one of the lowest in the EU. The crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism towards the end of 1992, putting pressure on several European currencies including the British pound, forced the incoming coalition government to accept a 10 per cent devaluation of the punt within weeks of taking office. Despite the turbulence at the time, this has had a salutary effect. Interest rates are now at record lows and heading lower; foreign currency reserves are higher than before the crisis; exports look likely to hit record new levels and consumer demand is showing strong signs of recovery. The fiscal deficit is well under control - Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, felt confident enough to give away IPounds 333m in tax reliefs to the lower-paid in last January's budget, equivalent to 1.1 per cent of GNP. Indeed, the budget's underlying assumption of a 3.8 per cent growth rate in GNP this year is now looking conservative. The latest spate of economic forecasts from independent analysts put the figure closer to 5 per cent, a level which is expected to be sustained up to the end of the century. On that basis, the current budget deficit will be eliminated by 1996, and the EMU target of reducing the debt/GDP ratio to 60 per cent appears attainable by the end of the decade. Provided that inflation is not stoked up again, Ireland has thus positioned itself well to take the fast track to Europe. Yet there remains a fundamental problem at the heart of economic policy-making, as Mr Han de Jong, chief economist at Goodbody, Dublin stockbrokers, points out: 'In conducting exchange rate policy, the authorities are using a basket of currencies with sterling and the DM as heavyweights. The foreign exchange market, on the other hand, has effectively relinked the punt to sterling . . . the perceived poor quality of economic policy-making in the UK is the core of the problem for the Irish authorities and constitutes the paradox of Irish policy intentions,' he said. While the Irish authorities want Ireland to be among the first to participate in monetary union, they are being held hostage to the political fortunes of a UK Conservative party in disarray over Europe. According to Mr de Jong: 'UK politics is a constant potential threat to (economic) stability.' In other economic policy-making areas - notably the deregulation of state enterprises - Irish freedom of action is subject to internal rather than external constraints, but still the process has had successes. Aer Lingus, the state-run airline, has managed to emerge from a big restructuring, aimed at returning it to profitability, without a crippling labour dispute. Unions at An Post, the state postal service, have accepted radical changes to work practices. Both companies are searching for overseas partners. The rail unions are proving more reluctant to accept change at Iarnrod Eireann (Irish Rail), the heaviest government loss-maker, but as practically all of Europe's railways are heavily subsidised, most of the attention will now focus on Telecom Eireann, the state telecommunications company, and on whether a proposed link-up with British telecommunications group, Cable &amp; Wireless, will get the go-ahead from the government. Telecom unions have indicated that they will support a joint venture with a foreign partner - but are opposed to one with Cable &amp; Wireless. The importance of telecommunications to the economy cannot be over-estimated. Over the past 10 years Ireland's telecommunications services have improved dramatically. The recent entry of competitors into the international segment of the market is rapidly bringing down the cost of calls, adding to the continuing tax attractions of setting up business in Ireland, not least in the financial service industries. More than 150 offshore funds totalling some Dollars 9bn are now managed out of the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Dublin, a sector which has grown rapidly in the past two years. A growing number of funds is also being listed on the Dublin stock exchange, which itself is attracting an increasing amount of overseas attention. Inward industrial investment is also continuing to notch up successes. Several new projects - in the health care sector, in telemarketing and in electronics, among others - have been announced since the beginning of the year. (Generous grants and a low tax regime have helped to attract these, despite intense competition from, for example, Scotland and Wales.) Ireland's profile - and its hopes of attracting further investment in both manufacturing and services - will be raised further next month when its team travels to the US to play in the finals of football's world cup in Orlando and New York, accompanied by tens of thousands of supporters. A flood of Italian tourists to Ireland followed Ireland's participation in the 1990 World Cup in Italy. A similar effect is hoped for in the US, traditionally Ireland's main overseas tourist market. An increase in numbers from the US will be especially welcome in the west of Ireland, which is having to come to terms with the reform of the EU's common agricultural policy. This is forcing change in the traditional dairy and beef farming sectors in favour of new industries such as tourism and forestry. Planting of new woodlands and forests has accelerated in the past five years, encouraged by generous grants and incentives which are scheduled to be increased again soon. A forest products industry is already undergoing expansion. This is expected to be as important to the economy, in 20 years, as the food industry is now. So Ireland's position at the edge of Europe is not the disadvantage it is frequently made out to be. Its comparative advantages have been recognised and economic and political stability is fostering a positive climate for inward investment by companies positioning themselves for growth in the European market. Much more would be possible, too, given a satisfactory resolution of the island of Ireland's most intractable problem - Northern Ireland, an issue which has absorbed large amounts of ministerial time over the past year. While prospects for peace in the province have come tantalisingly closer than at any time in the past 25 years, as a result of talks with the UK government leading up to the Downing Street Declaration, the government has had to accept that its suggestion last year that 'peace by Christmas' was possible was wide of the mark. It may be some way down the road yet. Nevertheless, even on this issue, there are signs of the same movement, which, in other areas, is leading to hopes of a more prosperous and stable future for Ireland in the twenty-first century.</p>

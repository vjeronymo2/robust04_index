			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone message from Yi Song-ho, acting chairman of the </F> Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society, to Kang  Yong-hun, president of the ROK Red Cross Society, on 19 May]    [Text] Yi Song-ho, acting chairman of DPRK Red Cross  Society Central Committee, today sent a telephone message to  Kang Yong-hun, president of the South Korean Red Cross,  demanding again that South Korea respond to our proposal for the  repatriation of old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan -- long-term  prisoners who refused to renounce communism -- and for providing  Kim Chi-yon, the daughter of Kim Pyong-chu, another person who  refused to renounce communism, who is seriously ill, with  medical treatment.    The contents of the telephone message were as follows:    On 26 and 27 April, I sent telephone messages to you,  demanding that South Korea repatriate Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan,  prisoners of war, and that it send the seriously ill Kim  Chi-yon, daughter of Kim Pyong-chu who refused to renounce  communism, to the North, for medical treatment.    To date, your side has not taken any measures for our  proposals that need to be settled immediately. Furthermore,  your side did not even reply. This cannot be regarded as proper  behavior befitting Red Cross men who regard humanity as sacred  and saving mankind from misfortune as their basic mission.    Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, who were taken as prisoners by  the  U.S. Forces during their guerrilla struggles in the South in the  past years of war, are clearly prisoners of war in view of  international law. Therefore, your side is obliged to  repatriate them to our side. Article 118 of the Geneva  Convention of 12 August 1949 regarding the treatment for  prisoners of war defines that prisoners of war must be released  and repatriated immediately after a hostile action ends. Also,  Article 20 of the Hague Convention of 1907 regarding laws on  land battle and practice defines that after a treaty is  concluded, the repatriation of prisoners of war should be  carried out as quickly as possible.    Nevertheless, your side has stated that Kim In-so and Ham  Se-  hwan, prisoners of war, cannot be repatriated due to the South  Korean National Security Law, which has aroused protest from the  international community. This is wrong behavior in which you  are employing international law in your own way.    Furthermore, your side acts as if you are interested in the  humanitarian issue, ignoring the issue of repatriating Kim In-so  and Ham Se-hwan, which is more important than the issue of  separated families. This is a very wrong attitude.    Also, it is very regrettable that without any plausible  reasons, your side has not yet positively reacted to our  humanitarian proposal to provide Kim Chi-yon, the daughter of  Kim Pyong-chu, who refused converting from communism, with  medical treatment in the North.    Neglecting to say that your side will provide medical  treatment for Kim Chin-yon, who is seriously ill, your side has  ignored our proposal that we provide her with medical treatment  in the North. This can be regarded as an attitude of ignoring  the basic duty and mission of Red Cross men.    The DPRK Red Cross Society Central Committee sincerely  advises [chunggohada] your organization not to follow  authorities of the South side, who pursue North-South  confrontation, but instead to be faithful to the basic duty of  the Red Cross. Thus, it again strongly demands that your side  positively respond to our humanitarian proposals from now on.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / UK Company News: Lamont seeks Pounds 16m to fund acquisition LAMONT Holdings, the Northern Ireland-based carpets and textiles group, yesterday announced a 19 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, accompanied by a Pounds 16m cash call to pay for its latest acquisition. The one-for-four rights issue, pitched at 280p, will raise Pounds 15.9m to pay for the 100-year-old fabric printer, Alexander Drew &amp; Sons. An initial consideration of Pounds 16.4m will be supplemented by performance-related outlay of up to Pounds 2m over the next 18 months. The cash call, underwritten by Lazard Brothers, will enlarge Lamont's existing share capital by 25 per cent. Lamont's shares fell 11p after the announcement to 339p. Sir Desmond Lorimer, chairman, said the acquisition of Drew - which was the subject of a management buy-out from Coloroll in 1990 - would bring a positive contribution to earnings per share. Last year earnings fell from 28.11p to 23.21p. However, the purchase would also load Lamont with Pounds 7.4m in Drew's debt. This would leave the enlarged company about 30 per cent geared, with net borrowings of between Pounds 9m and Pounds 10m. Speaking about last year's performance, Sir Desmond said recession had continued 'at an ever increasing pace', although the group expected slow growth in sales and margins this year. As a result the final dividend is maintained at 8.5p, for a total of 12p. Turnover was maintained at Pounds 109.1m, including 12 months of Bonded Fibre Fabric - purchased in 1990  - compared with just nine months the previous year. A swing from Pounds 826,000 in interest receivable to charges of Pounds 68,000 helped depress pre-tax profits, which fell from Pounds 10m to Pounds 8.11m. The sharpest decline came in the carpets division, which saw profits fall from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 3.3m; sales dropped from Pounds 56m to Pounds 52m. The linens and fabrics business raised its contribution from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 3.2m, while turnover increased from Pounds 41m to Pounds 46m. The other divisions, which include a small computing firm and an engineering subsidiary, fell by Pounds 118,000 at the trading level to Pounds 894,000.</p>

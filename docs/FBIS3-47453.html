			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Shigeru Komago; from NIHON KEIZAI </F> SHIMBUN in Japanese 13 January Morning Edition]    [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has said  that the possibility of restoring the Super 301 provision of the  1988 Omnibus Trade Act through a presidential decree is under  consideration. He is believed to have made the remark to shake  up the Japanese Government, which continues to take a hard-line  attitude toward the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks.    It is highly possible that the United States will restore  the  Super 301 provision through presidential decree if the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks end in failure, but the  United States is not necessarily confident it will have the  desired effect.    A bill on restoration of the Super 301 provision is expected  to be introduced to Congress in late January, when its recess  ends, and it is widely believed the bill will be supported by  Congress.    The U.S. Government has explored ways to restore the  provision through presidential decree since last year, before  Congress moved to enact the bill. It began to look at how to  restore the provision in December when Japan and the United  States were locked in confrontation over the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks and the multilateral trade negotiations [the  Uruguay Round of GATT] reached their conclusion without some  U.S. complaints having been addressed.    But the Japanese do not expect restoration of the provision  to have the desired effect. A source traveling with the  Japanese delegation said, "there is no need for Japan to be  furious at all." If the United States restores this one-sided  sanction so soon after conclusion of the Uruguay Round, it would  lead European and Asian nations to criticize the United States.  The U.S. Government must, therefore, be cautious about invoking  the provision.    It could create a situation in which Japan and the United  States come to a showdown on the eve of the scheduled Japan-U.S.  summit talks in February. How will Prime Minister Hosokawa and  ministers of the coalition government respond to the issue? If  government leaders rush to instruct Japanese negotiators to make  absurd concessions at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks,  the United States will get what it wants. It goes without  saying that whatever the U.S. attitude, the Japanese Government  needs to decide on concrete measures on its own to fulfill the  prime minister's public pledge to expand Japanese domestic  demand and cut its current account surplus by opening the  Japanese market.</p>

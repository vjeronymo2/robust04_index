The license provides, among other things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The facility is of a pressurized water reactor type and is located in Citrus County, Florida. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 50 (10 CFR Part 50), Appendix A, ``General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants,'' Criterion 3, ``Fire protection,'' specifies that ``Structures, systems, and components important to safety shall be designed and located to minimize, consistent with other safety requirements, the probability and effect of fires and explosions.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, sets forth fire protection features required to satisfy general design Criterion 3 of the Commission's regulations. Pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III. O, ``Oil collection system for reactor coolant pump,'' the reactor coolant pump (RCP) shall be equipped with an oil collection system which ``*&blank;*&blank;* shall be capable of collecting lube oil from all potential pressurized and unpressurized leakage sites in the reactor coolant pump lube oil systems.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee proposed to replace the existing RCP motors with a new motor and implement a re-designed RCP lube oil system. As a result of physical interferences and other design difficulties, four specific sites in the RCP motor lube oil system could not accommodate an oil collection systems for collecting potential oil leakage. The four potential leakage sites are: the anti-reverse device (ARD) vents, upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD, lower motor leak detection system piping, and lower guide bearing thermocouple wells. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An exemption from 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III. O, is required to permit the four specific sites in the RCP lube oil systems not to be equipped with an oil collection system, and thus, exclude them from leakage protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated June 7, 1993, as supplemented March 28, 1994, the licensee submitted its exemption request for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50 when (1) the exemptions are authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to public health or safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) when special circumstances are present. Special circumstances are present whenever, according to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), ``Application of the regulation in the particular circumstances would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule *&blank;*&blank;*''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

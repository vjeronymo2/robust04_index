			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / FT European Water Conference: Ofwat seeks more power for consumers MUCH greater involvement of customers in the setting of charges and levels of service by water companies is to become a top priority, Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the industry's economic regulator, said yesterday. Mr Byatt warned at a Financial Times conference in London on the European water industry that without much greater consumer participation the regulatory regime of the privatised industry might be in jeopardy. 'This will not be an easy task, but I believe it is essential to try,' he said. 'I would go so far as to say that, without acceptance by customers that they are getting value for money, the whole regime could be at risk.' Mr Byatt's views are significant because he will be responsible for drawing up new charging limits in 1994 before they are implemented for five years from April 1995. It will be the first big change in pricing levels since the industry was privatised in 1989. After substantial price rises to pay for the early stages of the Pounds 28bn capital spending programme, there will be pressure for customers to be protected as much as possible. Mr Byatt said he would concentrate on three strategic objectives in the review. They were greater involvement of customers; more stable investment and pricing over the next five years; and greater emphasis on service and value for money. He said investment in the industry during the past 20 years had been erratic, and prices had tended to follow in quite steep steps. Investment rose by 40 per cent last year and was due for a further 25 per cent increase this year. He explained that by 1995 much plant and equipment would be renewed, and it should then be possible to improve assets at a steadier rate. Mr Byatt urged the government to ensure that costs of new environmental obligations were established before decisions were taken. Ministers should consider the scale of benefits likely to be gained from new obligations and the willingness - and sometimes the ability - of consumers to pay increased bills. Mr David Trippier, environment minister responsible for the water industry, said there were three areas of European Community environment law which the government would like improved: the machinery for enforcement, drafting of laws, and the analysis which must precede and support drafting of legislation. He said there was little point in EC law on water unless it applied in a comparable way across the community. At present there was no certainty of this, and member states had very different ways of enforcing standards.</p>

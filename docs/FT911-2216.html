			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC assurance to US on oilseeds THE EC's long-running dispute with the US over its subsidies for the production and processing of oilseeds could boil over again unless Washington accepts undertakings from Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner. During talks in Washington tomorrow and on Friday Mr MacSharry will tell his counterparts that the EC will implement the 1990 Gatt ruling on oilseeds in July next year, but not before because of legal constraints. Mr MacSharry told journalists: 'The seed is in the ground, the contracts are signed, we can't change this year.' The EC had originally planned to implement the ruling as part of the results of the Uruguay Round, which reached deadlock over farm subsidies in December. The US warned at a Gatt trade council in Geneva last week that it would take action unless the EC changed the subsidies regime immediately. This regime pays the subsidy to oilseed crushers rather than farmers, to compensate them for buying higher-priced EC soyabeans, rapeseed and other oilseeds. The Gatt ruling found the payments to be more than the difference between the EC price and world market prices and therefore discriminatory. US soyabean farmers have lost valuable market share to competitors from Brazil and Argentina as well as the EC. Mr MacSharry says since 1987 - and including this year's proposed price package - the EC has cut prices by 25 per cent for rapeseed, 30 per cent for sunflowers and 46 per cent for soyabeans.</p>

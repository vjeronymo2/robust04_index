Primakov's visit was motivated by the need to create a basis  for cooperation between the intelligence services of the two  countries in the fight against international crime, terrorism,  the drug and arms trades, and the situations in unstable regions  of Europe, Presidential Spokesman Anton Bodis told journalists.    "The cooperation will be not directed against any third  country," Bodis said, adding that the intelligence services of  the two countries agreed to exchange representatives in their  headquarters in order to establish connection.    Primakov's Spokeswoman Tatyana Samolis told CTK that the  talks with the Slovak Intelligence Service would continue  tonight and tomorrow morning. "The issue was not raised," she  replied to a question about the activities of Russian agents in  Slovakia.</p>

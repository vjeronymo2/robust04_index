			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Equities: Two big Spanish issues in wings SPAIN will be the source of two substantial international equity issues over the next month with offerings from Repsol, the state-controlled energy group, and Argentaria, the state-owned banking group. Repsol hopes to raise Dollars 700m to Dollars 800m with the sale of about 30m shares. The offering, to be priced late next week, will result in a reduction in the state's stake from about 50 per cent to just over 40 per cent. The offering can be increased by 15 per cent if there is strong demand for the shares. Repsol has quite a broad international investor base. Under the global deal, 12m shares will be offered in the US, 7m in the UK, 6m in continental Europe, 3.5m in Spain and 1.5m in the rest of the world. The Spanish tranche will be offered to institutional investors as Repsol is widely held by Spanish retail investors. Meanwhile, investment bankers expect Argentaria to wait about a month until Repsol is out of the way before proceeding with its IPO. The bank is 100 per cent owned by the state, and is expected to sell up to a quarter of its shares with Spanish retail investors likely to dominate the issue, bankers said.</p>

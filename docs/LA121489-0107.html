			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MORNINGSIDE'S GIRLS GAIN REVENGE OVER WASHINGTON  </P> <P> Morningside High Lady Monarchs Coach Frank Scott said his team definitely had  something to prove against visiting Washington High in the championship game of  the Morningside Tournament Wednesday night.  </P> <P> After watching his defending state champions and No. 1 team in the nation  defeat the Lady Generals, 65-54, Scott said he was satisfied.  </P> <P> Morningside's only loss during the summer was to Washington in the L.A. Games.  </P> <P> "We don't like to lose and we definitely don't like to lose at home," Scott  said.  </P> <P> The game plan for Morningside was simple: Get the ball to preseason  All-American selection Lisa Leslie. Once the 6-5 senior got her hands on the  ball, she went to work collecting a game-high 38 points, including 22 in the  first half.  </P> <P> Washington had a tough time getting its offense on track early in the game.  </P> <P> "I think our main problem tonight was a combination of nerves and a tough game  by Lisa Leslie," Washington Coach Phil Chase said.  </P> <P> When Leslie wasn't scoring, she was clogging the middle, forcing the Lady  Generals to take the majority of their shots from the perimeter.  </P> <P> Morningside enjoyed a 14-6 lead after the first quarter, with Leslie accounting  for 12 points. It was much of the same in the second quarter as the Lady  Monarchs built a 35-19 halftime advantage.  </P> <P> Washington basically traded baskets with Leslie and Morningside in the third  period. Leslie scored 14 of her team's 16 points in the period. The Lady  Generals scored 17.  </P> <P> "The difference from tonight's game and the game we played in the summer was  that the level of intensity in this game was a lot higher," Chace said. "If we  meet them in the state tournament, it (intensity) will be higher than tonight."  </P> <P> Morningside is 4-0 and Washington, the defending 4-A City champion, is 5-1.  </P></p>

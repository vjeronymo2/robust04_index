To us, of  course. [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini is so sure of  crushing his opponents from Rome that these days he is scouring  the far north in an attempt to eat into the votes of Bossi, "the  Attila of national politics." He makes no secret of the reason  for this: If the League ends up being a minority in the  center-right line up, Fini will be the one to lay down the  conditions for governing. With [Forza Italia leader]  Berlusconi, of course, with whom he seems to be in full  agreement even though he did not manifest a great deal of  solidarity in the Publitalia affair.    It is a victorious Fini who is speaking. You people should  not be splitting hairs over the fact that there are already too  many shouts of victory during these last phases of the election  campaign. Yesterday the National Alliance leader was in Udine  and Gorizia. As usual he laid the blame on [Northern League  Secretary] Bossi, [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, and [Italian  Popular Party Secretary] Martinazzoli. Then, perhaps because of  the proximity of the border, he relaunched an attack on Italy's  shattered rights in Istria. Japan, which is a democratic  country like ours can try to get the Kuril Islands back from  Russia "solely by diplomatic means," of course. Whereas Italy  should not even worry about compensation for all those who were  obliged to abandon Istria at the end of the war.    [Pennacchi] Fini, you really do not want to let go on  Italian  Istria?    [Fini] It is a matter of principle that must be assessed as  such and that does not bring any immediate consequences. I have  been thinking a great deal about his: We must look to Japan as  an example. I am asking to open diplomatic talks, not war.    [Pennacchi] Are you not afraid that raising the Istrian  issue  again could create problems with Berlusconi?    [Fini] I do not think so. Even so, I could not care less if  the things in which I believe create problems. This matter is  entirely free of consequences, except for those who are totally  in bad faith. I am laying down the problem as a whole, so that  matters that can be resolved are discussed in concrete terms:  the problem of the goods that were expropriated, that of  safeguarding the Italian language, of maintaining cultural  institutions that have been eradicated.    [Pennacchi] "Attila" Bossi you said yesterday. If you  continue in this way, and even if the progressives lose, you  will end up being unable to govern because of too many exchanges  of insults.    [Fini] I have never declared war, neither am I waging one. I  only feel the need to explain why an agreement was not possible  in the north.    [Pennacchi] Okay, but let us face it. If you win, you will  have to govern together.    [Fini] Everything depends on the voters, they are the ones  who will establish the power relationship. If a power  relationship is balanced out with the League, which is the  easiest of the three, Bossi will clearly have to come off his  high horse.    [Pennacchi] To do this you will have to double your victory  in the south.    [Fini] We will have an extremely good result in the south.  But even the north will give us some nice satisfaction. I went  to a meeting in Arezzo where there were 5,000 people, more than  Fanfani attracted in 1948. There is a revolt against the old  system. National Alliance is a credible alternative.    [Pennacchi] What relationship do you foresee between  yourself  and Berlusconi for those elected in the center-south?    [Fini] Unlike the others, when I sign an accord I respect  it.  Therefore, I am not concerned about whether Forza Italia or  National Alliance will take the lion's share. The important  thing is that the pole does its utmost.    [Pennacchi] Are you convinced that you will be the strongest  in the south?    [Fini] Yes, certainly.    [Pennacchi] Your accord with Berlusconi seems perfect but  you  left him alone with little or no solidarity in the clash with  Judge Colombo [on Fininvest investigations].    [Fini] I never generalize, I do not consider it right to say  "the judicial authorities...." The magistrates are all the  same. However, there are undoubtedly shortsighted magistrates  who see very little when they must investigate to the left and  are quite farsighted when they investigate in other directions.    [Pennacchi] And as far as separating careers in the  magistracy is concerned?    [Fini] This is sacrosanct. There are three fundamental  aspects of reform: freeing the Higher Council of the Magistracy  from political party influence; abolishing automatic career  advancements; and separating the careers of the judges from the  public prosecutors.    [Pennacchi] What will happen after the elections?    [Fini] The winner will govern. Not any hypothetical body of  married institutions, therefore the voters must be careful: Any  vote for Segni or Martinazzoli is the photocopy of a vote for  Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left].    [Pennacchi] So, let us return to Bossi. If you win, will you  succeed in staying together?    [Fini] The voters must decide who will have more power in  the  pole of freedoms. The ones with more power will lay down the  rules for the government. And since I am convinced that it will  not be Bossi, I am very, very calm.</p>

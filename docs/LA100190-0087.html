			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LACQUER FUMES EXPLODE IN HOUSE, INJURING 3  </P> <P> A man spraying lacquer in a Thousand Oaks kitchen was seriously burned Sunday  when the fumes, ignited by an oven pilot light, exploded in a fireball that  wrecked the house and rattled the neighborhood.  </P> <P> The blast caused an estimated $180,000 damage and sent two residents of the  house at 2885 Marietta Circle to the hospital with less severe burn wounds,  authorities said.  </P> <P> "It had to be a helluva fireball," said Peter Cronk, an investigator for the  Ventura County Fire Department. "It moved down a hallway and out the window  with so much force it bent the window-screen frames."  </P> <P> The painter, Allan Parfitt, 29, of La Puente, was in serious condition Sunday  evening in the acute burn unit at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital, with second-  and third-degree burns over 40% of his body.  </P> <P> Susan Ashford, 37, was in fair condition in the hospital's intermediate burn  unit with second- and third-degree burns on her hands and forearms. Her son,  Timothy, 11, was treated for minor burns at Los Robles Regional Medical Center  and released.  </P> <P> Investigators said Parfitt works with Ashford and had come over to do the  painting Sunday morning.  </P> <P> Ashford's husband, Tom, was outside and escaped injury. Knowing the  flammability of the fumes, he had stepped out before lighting a cigarette,  Cronk said.  </P> <P> Another son, Ryan, 14, said he was watching a football game on television in  his parents' bedroom when the explosion occurred at 10:26 a.m. The force blew  the glass and blinds out of the bedroom windows, he said, but he was not hurt.  </P> <P> Dashing into the smoke-filled hallway, Ryan saw the silhouettes of two people  fleeing the house, he said. He said he ran back into the bedroom, dialed the  911 emergency number and fled as smoke began to overwhelm him.  </P> <P> Across the street, Melissa Nolan and her mother were in their kitchen when the  blast rattled windows throughout the house. "My mother thought my little  brother had run into the glass door," Melissa, 15, said.  </P> <P> They saw flames shooting from the Ashfords' windows and ran outside, where they  found Timothy collapsed on the lawn and the other burn victims lying nearby.  Melissa and her mother ran back into their house and got wet towels to drape  over the burns.  </P> <P> County fire officials said the explosion occurred because Parfitt did not  adequately ventilate the room while applying the highly combustible lacquer to  kitchen cabinets. The fumes were concentrated because of a plastic tarpaulin in  the doorway between the kitchen and the family room.  </P> <P> Ryan Ashford said the fireball melted the tarp and blew the hot plastic into  the family room and onto his mother and brother, causing some of their burns.  </P> <P> The fire took about 50 minutes to bring under control and was extinguished  within 90 minutes, Battalion Chief Frank Tinsley said.  </P> <P> Most of the roof remained intact, but the interior of the house was gutted,  Cronk said. "The painter was lucky to get out of there in the shape he did."  </P></p>

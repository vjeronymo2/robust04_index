			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FBI JOINS PROBE OF ATTACKS ON 2 BERKELEY BOOKSTORES  </P> <P> The FBI on Wednesday entered the investigation of two Berkeley bookstore  firebombings that authorities said may have been prompted by Muslim outrage  over Salman Rushdie's novel, "The Satanic Verses."  </P> <P> An FBI spokesman in San Francisco said the agency stepped in on the grounds  that the attacks violated the Hobbs Act, a federal law prohibiting violence or  threats against interstate commerce.  </P> <P> Law enforcement officials had yet to hear from any person or group claiming  responsibility for the Tuesday predawn Molotov cocktail bombings at Cody's book  store and a Waldenbooks outlet, both on Telegraph Avenue near the University of  California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Open Mind' in Probe  </P> <P> "We're approaching this with a real open mind," said FBI spokesman Chuck  Latting. "It's real easy to assume this has something to do with the Rushdie  book." He added, however, "At this time we have no real hard evidence."  </P> <P> Cody's had maintained a high profile in the Rushdie furor, proclaiming on a  window poster that it will not ban the book. After the Molotov cocktail attack,  a pipe bomb also was found in the wreckage there.  </P> <P> Latting said the crude nature of the devices, as well as the limited damage to  both stores, made it unlikely that the blasts were the work of international  terrorists. "It wouldn't have been so sloppily done," he said.  </P> <P> As dozens of FBI agents went door-to-door looking for witnesses, Berkeley  Police Lt. Michel de Latour said his detectives had not yet turned up any  suspects. "We have a few leads in the case," he said. "There are a few  witnesses and that's all I have to add."  </P> <P> Cody's remained closed for cleanup on Wednesday, but manager Nick Setka said he  plans to reopen and "probably hire a security guard."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Open for Business  </P> <P> Waldenbooks, where workmen replaced the shattered window and charred carpeting,  carried on a normal business day. Security guards have been hired there and at  another Berkeley Waldenbooks store.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the chain in Stamford, Conn., said the bombing had not changed  its policy of allowing individual store managers to decide whether to sell "The  Satanic Verses."  </P> <P> But, said Trace Urdan, "The chances are slim that it will ever be displayed in  the windows."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Washington, a group of publishers and booksellers, fearing that  bookstore bombings will continue, met with Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh and  received his assurance that "every resource available" will be used to hunt  down the bombers and guard against future attacks.  </P> <P> In the meeting, which lasted more than an hour, 10 representatives of  publishing houses and three representatives of booksellers expressed their  concerns in the wake of Monday's firebombings.  </P> <P> Thornburgh later told reporters: "There simply is no room for any threat  against the exercise of First Amendment rights."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lee May in Washington contributed to this article.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY MEADOWS JOCKEY HAD PAST WEIGHT TROUBLE  </P> <P> Ricky Frazier, the jockey whose incorrect postrace weight resulted in the  disqualification of a horse finishing first in a $250,000 race last Sunday at  Bay Meadows, has been fined by stewards on two previous occasions in the last  13 months for violations related to weight.  </P> <P> In September, 1989, the stewards at Bay Meadows fined Frazier $100 because of  two weight problems.  </P> <P> Bob Novelli, clerk of scales at the track in San Mateo, Calif., reported to the  stewards that Frazier attempted to be weighed before a race without holding all  of the required riding equipment while on the scale.  </P> <P> Later the same day, Frazier was weighed before another race and was more than  two pounds over the weight assigned his horse. The trainer of the horse, who is  entitled to change jockeys if a rider is more than two pounds over, did not  consent to Frazier riding his horse.  </P> <P> During an interview with Frazier, the stewards pointed out that he could have  made the weight by using a smaller saddle. The weight a horse carries in a race  consists of the jockey's weight, the weight of the equipment -- about four or  five pounds -- and lead weights that can be added if the combined weight of the  jockey and the equipment is less than the assigned weight. Weights for horses  are either arbitrarily assigned by the racing secretary, in the case of a  handicap, or by the conditions of a race, which can be related to past  performances and the age and sex of the horses.  </P> <P> In fining Frazier, the stewards warned him about future weight violations, and  last May they fined him another $100 "for not doing (making) the reported  weight."  </P> <P> Frazier was using a larger saddle Sunday when he and Allijeba won the $250,000  Final Fourteen Stakes by a nose over Tex's Zing. Allijeba was supposed to carry  126 pounds, but after the race, Novelli reported that the jockey's weight was  only 123 1/2. California rules say that after a race, a jockey and his  equipment can't be more than one pound under what the horse was assigned.  </P> <P> The stewards disqualified Allijeba from winning the $125,000 first-place purse,  making Tex's Zing the winner, and ordered the mutuel department to refund all  money bet on Allijeba. Robert Allensworth, the owner of Allijeba, has appealed  the stewards' decision to the California Horse Racing Boad.  </P> <P> Frazier, 27, told Larry Robideaux Jr., Allijeba's trainer, that he uses the  larger saddle because the lead weights can be inserted into the top, near the  horse's withers. The standard place for the lead weights is in saddle pads on  both sides of the horse. Some jockeys think that carrying the weight at the  withers is better for a horse because of the center of gravity.  </P> <P> Robideaux said that, according to Frazier, the jockey has room for four pounds  of lead underneath his saddle top, and he was carrying two pounds of lead in  the Allijeba race.  </P> <P> Neither Frazier nor Novelli could be reached for comment Wednesday. Bay Meadows  stewards said the race is still under investigation.  </P></p>

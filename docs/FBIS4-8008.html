			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cajnice, 8 Apr (TANJUG) -- The command of the  Srpska republic army's Herzegovina corps this morning said in a  statement that heavy fighting had continued over the last 24  hours in the area of Oglecevo, Vitkovici [near Gorazde] and  Donja Potkozara.    The same source says that a strong attack by the Muslim army  was repelled last night in the area of Krizevci, in the  immediate vicinity of Gorazde. [passage omitted]    Over the last 24 hours the frequency of NATO flights at very  low altitude over the area of Gorazde, Cajnice, and Foca, where  the fighting has been under way for 11 days, has increased, the  statement says.    Reinforcements in groups of 30 or 40 soldiers, specially  trained in sabotage and terrorist activities, are being sent to  the Muslim army in Gorazde from central Bosnia, Serb military  sources say.    The fate of some 700 Serbs trapped in Gorazde is  increasingly  uncertain, in the light of the fact that they are being used by  the Muslims as a shield for Muslim soldiers who are being  forcibly sent to the front line, the statement says.</p>

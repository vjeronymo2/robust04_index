According  to a report by the military correspondent of Bakhtar Information  Agency, Sheberghan's airport and command and concetration  centers of the communist traitors were bombed by jets of the  heroic air force of the country. As a result of the air raids,  heavy losses have been inflicted on the criminal militia.    According to another report, air raids were conducted on the  enemy's centers in Balkh Province. The report adds: Dehdadi  airport, Qala-e Jangi, and other areas of concentration of the  atheists and traitors were hit by the air force of the Islamic  army of the country. As a result of the destruction of the  fighter planes that were at the disposal of the looter militia  and their hypocrite colleagues, the country's air space is now  completely under the control of the air force of the Islamic  army. It is for this reason that the last command and  concentration centers of the enemy are being bombarded by the  air force and are being eliminated one by one.    Similarly, another report says: last night, the militia,  which has sold itself, made another failed military effort in  the area of Pacha Pol and mounted a broad offensive against the  positions of the Islamic army and mojahedin. Consequently, they  confronted the resistance of islamic forces, and, having  suffered heavy losses, they were forced to retreat.    By the same token, the notorious militia of Golboddin-Dostom  yesterday mounted an offensive against the positions of the  islamic army in the area of Bagh-e Babor, where as a result of  the counter offensive of the Islamic army, 43 of their people  were killed and 50 others were injured, and they eventually were  forced to retreat. A number of foreign mercenaries are among  the dead. The enemy's one tank was set abalze, and their two  posts behind Gozargah electricity station were captured by the  brave defenders of islam.</p>

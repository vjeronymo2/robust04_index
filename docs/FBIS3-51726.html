			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the opinion page by Foreign Minister Celso </F> L.N. Amorim: "Brazil, Mercosur, and International Commerce"]    [Text] We are currently at the doorsteps of a new Mercosur  [Common Market of the South] presidential summit, which will  meet at a crucial moment for the consolidation of our common  market. The occasion seems appropriate to make an analysis of  the most recent events that in one way or another affect  international trade and Brazil's insertion in the world economic  system. Three facts seem particularly important, although in  different degrees, from the viewpoint of Brazil's foreign trade:  1) The U.S. Congress' approval of NAFTA and the fact that the  agreement became effective on 1 January, 2) the conclusion of  the Uruguay round of GATT talks after seven years of  negotiations, and 3) the negotiations to establish Mercosur,  particularly in the area of a common external tariff system. To  this we may add President Itamar Franco's proposal during the  last Rio Group presidential summit to create a South American  Free Trade Area (ALCSA) that would be built around Mercosur and  also include, within a 10-year period, Amazon Initiative and  Andean Group member countries and Chile.    During the 1970's and 1980's we witnessed the consolidation  of regionalization processes and the global character of  international economic relations resulting from the growing need  to reorganize the world economy, widen production scales,  broaden markets, and contemplate the new preponderance of  technical innovations. In Brazil, these trends coincide with the  exhaustion of the imports substitution model and the  deterioration of the state financial crisis. The answer to these  changes, implemented rather brusquely by the previous  government, was to unilaterally liberalize the foreign trade  system and reduce the state's presence in economic activities.  In the multilateral area, Brazil began to get increasingly  involved in the Uruguay round of GATT talks. At the regional  level, this emphasis was noticeable in Brazil's increasing  economic integration with Argentina and the subsequent  incorporation of Paraguay and Uruguay through Mercosur.    The implementation of NAFTA shows the U.S.' willingness to  liberalize -- even though with limitations -- international  trade. Although the discussion involving "trade creation" versus  "trade deviation" is complex and not easily given to categorical  evaluation, NAFTA should have a positive impact on international  trade similar to the impact resulting from the establishment of  the European common market. NAFTA's repercussions on Latin  America are still subject to different views, but the fact that  the impetus of the most protectionist U.S. groups has been  contained is encouraging.    The implementation of GATT agreements by which developing  countries grant Brazil an average tariff reduction of 38 percent  will contribute, without a doubt, to ameliorating the effects of  eventual trade deviations resulting from the tariff preferences  granted Mexico through NAFTA. But that is not the only reason  why the implementation of GATT agreements are particularly  important for Brazil. The reinforcement of the multilateral  trade system is essential to make international economic  relations predictable and reduce the margin for sudden  implementation of protectionist surges and unilateral decisions  by our biggest trade partners. Because of the profile of  Brazil's trade structure, which spreads almost evenly throughout  all regions of the world, the strengthening of the multilateral  system is of great importance to sustaining our internal  economic reforms and shoring up efforts to achieve a more  competitive insertion in the world economy. In this context,  Brazil's interest in a strengthened multilateral trade system  should encourage its efforts to consolidate Mercosur and  establish a South American Free Trade Area.    The liberalization process within Mercosur member countries  continues to progress as anticipated. It has resulted in a  strong positive impact on trade exchange, which has more than  doubled between the four member countries since the signing of  the Asuncion Treaty in 1991. Today nearly 13 percent of  Brazilian foreign trade involves our three partners (Argentina,  Uruguay, and Paraguay). Brazilian exports to Mercosur countries  have almost tripled from 1990 to 1993. The association between  companies also has increased and contacts at all levels of  society are becoming more frequent, generating the conditions  for a true integration. Naturally, this exponential growth of  trade flows has created some specific difficulties, which in the  case of the proliferation of safeguards and anti-dumping  measures can cause serious damage to our trade. They are not  unsurmountable differences that cannot be ironed out with a  frank and friendly dialogue between the four partners, however.    The difficulties encountered in defining a common external  tariff system for some products such as digitized capital goods  show the need for intense negotiations in the coming months. Our  partners should perceive that even though the common market's  advantages benefit all, the consolidation of that common market  presupposes the preservation of absolute preference margins for  some category of products for which it is important to have an  integrated market. This is the case of products that still  cannot compete on an equal footing with those produced by highly  developed countries. Between the goal of promoting the country's  competitive insertion in the world economy and renouncing our  own industrial growth to sacrificing entire areas, particularly  areas involving technologically developed products, there is a  distance that cannot be ignored.    The Mercosur plan is essentially open and not exclusive. We  should be prepared to be, at the right time, in a good  negotiating position to talk with other regional groups in this  hemisphere or outside it about broadened schemes of trade  liberalization. It is essential, therefore, to strengthen the  regional base of our insertion into the world by consolidating  Mercosur and decisively encouraging the South American Free  Trade Area.</p>

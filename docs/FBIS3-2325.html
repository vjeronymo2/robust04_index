With life-giving spring breezes and  rains, our great socialist motherland is full of life and energy.    This year is a vital one for China's reform, opening up, and  modernization drive; a year significant to the people of all  nationalities in their efforts to implement the spirit of the  14th party congress and to put into practice all the  "resolutions" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee. It is also the first year since China's  economic structural reform entered a new phase of comprehensive  promotion and specific breakthroughs. The adoption and  implementation of the package of comprehensive reform measures  will serve to alleviate many profound contradictions and  problems that long have existed in China's national economy and  that China always has wanted, but failed to resolve over the  past many years. It also will give initial shape to a solid  foundation for a socialist market economy structure. Therefore,  it is our unshirkable responsibility to act in accordance with  the arrangements of the party Central Committee, to support  reform with a clear-cut stand, to unremittingly promote reform,  and to enthusiastically plunge ourselves into reform.    To support reform with a clear-cut stand, we should regard  reform as our own duty and be eager to meet the needs of reform.  The energetic cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics  is created by the billions of the masses themselves. The  process of building a socialist market economy structure is, in  essence, a process in which the masses of the people create  history. Reform is a cause that relies on the masses and  benefits the people. Every one of us is the master of reform.  Taking reform as our own duty means that we need to fulfill  tasks and duties as masters, regard difficulties in reform as  our own difficulties, and share weal and woe with reform.  Experience gained from reform and opening up over the past 15  years has told us that the extensive support and participation,  as well as the conscious creation of the masses of the people  are the motive of the constant deepening of reform, and also a  basic guarantee for success in reform. Without the support, the  wisdom and strength, or the understanding of the masses, we can  see no hope of success in our great cause.    Reform is an undertaking from which the people can benefit.  To achieve its ultimate target, our party has adopted major  measures, policies, and principles to suit the development needs  of social productive forces, with the aim of bringing benefits  to all the people. This is determined by the socialist nature  of reform. However, we cannot but see that reform is a  readjustment of the original interest structure, as well as a  recombination of interest relations among the people.  Therefore, during the implementation of a certain policy, it is  unavoidable that the benefits enjoyed by the masses living in  one location are different from those enjoyed by the masses  living in another, that there still remain wide gaps between  different regions, and that we have to sacrifice the interests  of some for the time being. By no means can we lose sight of  the glorious prospects of reform in favor of temporary  interests, nor can we sacrifice the future for immediate  interests. The shape and shift of things always should be taken  with a broadness of view. Only when we integrate immediate  interests with long-term ones, and partial interests with the  interests of the whole can we always remain confident in reform.    To support reform with a clear-cut stand, we must safeguard  the authority of the party Central Committee and the government,  seek unity of understanding, and coordinate our actions. In a  large country like ours with such a vast territory and such a  large population, extensive and thoroughgoing revolutionary  changes cannot succeed without correct theoretical guidance,  powerful spiritual backing, or an authoritative and firm leading  core. Having withstood the grim tests of complicated practice  over the past couple of years, the leading collective of the  party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core,  is a leading nucleus that can be trusted fully by the whole  party and the people of all nationalities throughout the  country. It is of particular significance in today's reform to  firmly safeguard the authority of the party Central Committee,  and to seek unity of understanding and action under the  leadership of the party Central Committee. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping said in as early as 1988: "To succeed in reform, we  must carry out reform in an orderly way under a correct  leadership. What can we achieve under a chaotic situation in  which everyone goes his own way?"; "If the party Central  Committee and State Council have no authority, the situation  will get out of control"; "Macroeconomic management should be  reflected by the authority of the central authorities." Comrade  Jiang Zemin also stressed in his speech at the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee: "Party organizations  at all levels should consciously place the interests of the  party and country before everything else. They should subject  partial interests to overall ones and immediate interests to  long-term ones. They should take the overall situation into  consideration, ensure the implementation of all policies and  principles of the central authorities, and promote a high degree  of unity within the whole party -- politically,  organizationally, and practically." To safeguard the authority  of the party Central Committee and the government, we should  implement to the letter the principles, policies, and decisions  of the party Central Committee and the State Council, and must  never permit the existence of the practice whereby "the higher  authorities draw up policies, while the grass-roots levels adopt  countermeasures." It is imperative to put into effect all the  orders and bans imposed by higher authorities, and no one will  be allowed to continue banned practices in disregard of repeated  prohibitions. Some leading cadres, on the one hand, are  extremely enthusiastic in starting new projects; competing with  each other to attain a higher speed; and go in for ostentation,  extravagance, and high consumption. On the other hand, they  show little interest in improving economic efficiency;  practicing thrifty; putting an end to deficits and increasing  profits; strengthening management; or concerning themselves over  market development, commodity prices, and the livelihood of the  masses. On seeing this, one will find it hard to convince  oneself that these leading cadres really are doing their bit to  safeguard the authority of the party Central Committee.    To support reform with a clear-cut stand, we need to make  active explorations and have the courage to carry out practice.  The establishment of a socialist market economy structure is,  in the final analysis, an issue of practice. We need to engage  ourselves in practice if we wish to overcome difficulties and  resolve problems. We need to study policies, work out measures,  sum up experience, and distinguish right from wrong. We should  take note of the fact that in carrying out major reforms this  year in such sectors as finance and taxation, the monetary [jin  rong 6855 5816] industry, investment, and commodity prices, we  have gained experience in certain fields, yet we still know very  little about others. Facing things totally new to us, we should  draw up plans carefully and have the courage to put them into  practice, just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said: "Once we  determine the direction, we need to have the courage to  experiment and to open up new paths." Without the courage to  open up new paths or the spirit to carry out practice, we can  never take a correct new road, accomplish new undertakings, or  bring about the stable progress of reform.    At present, we are faced with a favorable historic  opportunity to carry out reform and promote development. We now  are enjoying sound natural conditions, topographical advantages,  and unity and coordination within our own ranks. Under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and under the leadership of the  party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core,  let us unswervingly carry out the party's basic line, firmly  seize favorable opportunities, deepen reform and expand opening  up, bring about greater development, maintain and stabilize the  overall situation, and strive for new victories in the socialist  modernization drive!</p>

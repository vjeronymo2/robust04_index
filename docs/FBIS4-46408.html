			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alon Pinkas] </F>   [Text] It will be impossible over the long term to  guarantee the safety of the settlers in Gaza Strip settlements  and over a thousand kilometers of roads in Judaea and Samaria, a  senior army source said on Friday.    The senior General Staff source said that in the Gaza Strip  over 15,000 soldiers are occupied with protecting 4,500 settlers.    "At no stage during the negotiations did the army recommend  a  course of action based on an inability to defend settlements,  but in the longer term, it will be impossible to maintain  full-proof [as published] security," said the source.    As for Judaea and Samaria, the source said the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] expects a rise in violence by Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement], and does not rule out riots in the major  cities if the economic situation of the Palestinian population  continues to deteriorate, or if the self-rule process fails to  progress.    "The PLO will try to co-opt Hamas into the political  institutions being established, but we do not rule out a  scenario in which economic hardships and political uncertainty  combine to strengthen Hamas in the street," said the source.    He added that while the territories are now relatively  quiet,  there are indications that Hamas plans violent activities.    "One new phenomenon in Judaea and Samaria is the use of more  sophisticated roadside bombs, detonated by wireless remote  control devices. It is difficult to detect these devices, which  is why it is difficult to guarantee the safety of settlers and  soldiers moving on the main roads," he said.    "There are over 20 platoons currently deployed in Judaea and  Samaria, whose sole mission is to maintain road and settlement  safety. These soldiers are not training as they ought to, and I  do not think this can go on endlessly without compromising the  quality of your military force," he added.</p>

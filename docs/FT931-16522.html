			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Control Securities 'encouraged' by debt talks CONTROL Securities, the property, hotels, brewing and pubs group involved in refinancing discussions with its bankers, said yesterday it was encouraged by the progress of the talks. It hoped to be able to put proposals to shareholders and bondholders in the next few weeks. Meanwhile, the group continues to trade with the support of its banks. In a circular to holders of its bonds Mr Sydney Robin, chairman, said that the group had produced a business plan involving an orderly disposal programme which it had presented to its banks. However, finalisation of restructuring plans were unlikely to be ready by the annual meeting to be held on January 28. Bondholders agreed last October that interest on the bonds should be deferred and the bonds would not be declared in default until January 18. Now they are being asked to approve resolutions at another meeting on January 18 to agree further deferrals until March 1. The group announced last October that asset write downs had contributed to net losses for the year to end-March of Pounds 192.4m. The shares have been suspended since October 1991.</p>

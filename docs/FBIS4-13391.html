			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The [Hizballah-backed FM transmitter] "Voice of  Light" yesterday commemorated the first anniversary of the death  of its director general, Dr. Hasan al-Qila. The ceremony, which  was held at the Rawdat al-Shahidayn School, was attended by  Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah, Deputies Muhammad  Yaghi and Muhammad Barjawi, Dean of Sciences College Dr. Muhsin  Jabir, and a number of Hizballah and Islamic resistance  officials.    Yusuf Nur-al-Din, current director general of the Voice of  Light, delivered a speech in which he underlined the feats of  the late director general. He criticized the cabinet's decision  to ban the broadcast of newscasts and political programs.  [passage omitted]    Hasan Nasrallah said that the Voice of Light is not a  militia  radio, it is the voice of the honorable resistance. This radio  has never been a tool to sow sectarian sedition. It is the  voice of national unity, amity, and knowledge.    He added: We regret that on this anniversary we have to  mourn the loss of part of the freedoms in this country. The  Voice of Light could be silenced for some time but it will  certainly come back. This kind of voice can never be silenced,  and nobody can silence the voice of right and justice. What we  have heard so far of claims and pretexts concerning the  procedures against the audio and visual media are not  convincing. If the Lebanese authority had enough courage to  dissolve the Lebanese Forces-Israeli party, it can silence the  voices that are considered Israel's tools.    The Hizballah secretary general said that the deliberations  that took place during the recent cabinet's session were  theatrical, stressing that such maneuvers could possibly be made  in other countries but here it is difficult to fool anyone.    Nasrallah urged the Lebanese to adopt a unified stance to  curb this threat and to advise the authorities that the Lebanese  people cannot accept such procedures that could harm peace.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Safa Ha'eri: "Demonstrations in Qom Against </F> Khamene'i and Hashemi-Rafsanjani"]    [Text] Paris -- Anti-regime demonstrations involving some  6,000 people were staged in Qom yesterday. Sources in the city  said that the demonstrators, most of whom are clients and  depositors of the "Waliyy ol-Asr" loans and savings company,  which was established in 1991 by senior clerics, protested  against the "disappearance" of some 12 billion riyals they had  deposited in the company. Demonstrators chanted slogans,  calling for the overthrow of 'Ali Khamene'i, the republic's  guide, and President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. It is worth noting  that, in the absence of a sound banking system, loans and  savings companies thrived rapidly as a result of the interest  rates they offer their clients. But most of these companies,  which were established with the blessings of clerics, have  become bankrupt quickly.</p>

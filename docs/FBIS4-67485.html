			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 7 KYODO -- Japan plans to take the  initiative in setting up guidelines on environment and labor for  the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to defuse a  North-South squabble over the issues, a Japanese Government  source said Saturday [7 May].    The guidelines are expected to urge APEC members to enhance  antipollution measures and improve labor conditions like wages,  the source said. Japan aims at presenting the draft for the  guidelines to 17 APEC members in preparatory work for the annual  ministerial meeting to be held in Jakarta in late November, he  said.    The APEC, established in 1989, groups Japan, Malaysia,  Canada, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, China, South Korea,  Taiwan, Hong Kong, Brunei, Indonesia, the United States,  Philippines, Singapore, Papua New Guinea, and Mexico.    The guidelines will include protection of tropical forest,  introduction of a minimum wage ceiling system and enforcement of  compulsory education with their medium-and long-term targets,  the source said.    The camp of industrialized nations, led by the U.S. and  France, calls for tightening trade curbs on such countries where  preservation of environment and labor conditions remain below  international standards, while developing countries fear such  measures would risk their economic development.</p>

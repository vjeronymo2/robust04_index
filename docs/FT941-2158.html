			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Surge at HK broadcaster Television Broadcasts (TVB), a Hong Kong broadcaster, yesterday lived up to its reputation as the colony's most profitable media company with a 42 per cent rise in net earnings, to HKDollars 519.6m (USDollars 67.2m), for 1993. Profits were struck on an 11 per cent rise in turnover, to HKDollars 2bn. A final dividend of 65 cents a share makes a total of 80 cents, an increase of 33 per cent on 1992. Underwriting TVB's profitability is its near-80 per cent share of terrestrial television advertising revenues in Hong Kong. Directors remain confident that demand for advertising air-time will remain strong this year. TVB entered the satellite television market last September with the launch of a Chinese-language TV station aimed at Taiwan.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARINE CHARGED IN 2 KILLINGS, ROBBERY AT COIN DEALERSHIP  </P> <P> A 20-year-old Tustin Marine was charged Wednesday with the murder of two people  at a Newport Beach rare coin dealership in an execution-style assault and  robbery in March that also left the firm's owner critically wounded, police  said.  </P> <P> Lance Cpl. Eric Jon Wick was being held without bail Wednesday at the Newport  Beach Jail in connection with the murders of Clyde Oatts and Renee Ratoon King,  and the wounding of her husband, the owner of Newport Beach Coin Exchange,  Newport Beach police said.  </P> <P> Wick, stationed at the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Station, is the son of an  FBI agent based in Reno, Nev., and his fingerprints allegedly were found at the  crime scene, military sources said.  </P> <P> The Marine, who had been held by military authorities after being arrested last  week in Reno, was taken into custody by Newport Beach police Wednesday on a  warrant charging him with two counts of homicide, one count of attempted  homicide, one count of robbery and one count of burglary, Newport Beach Police  Lt. Tim Riley said.  </P> <P> William D. King, 37, owner of the coin firm, could not be reached for comment  Wednesday on the arrest in the slaying of his 38-year-old wife and his friend,  Oatts, 45. Riley said King, who suffered gunshot wounds to the head and chest,  is recovering at home.  </P> <P> At the time of the murder and robbery, King, a precious metals trader, was  under investigation for allegedly bilking dozens of investors out of $1 million  through a Newport Beach telemarketing company, Precious Metals Accumulation  Corp., or Premaco, which sold contracts for gold, platinum and silver.  </P> <P> Oatts was a commodities broker at Monex International of Newport Beach. His  wife, reached at her Irvine home late Wednesday, said she was glad to hear of  the arrest in the case. "I think if that's who it was (responsible for the  crimes), then it's good."  </P> <P> Newport Beach police spokesman Lt. Tim Newman said detectives worked closely  with the Naval Investigative Service to make the arrest in the case. Military  sources said investigators linked Wick to the scene of the crime by  fingerprints on a display case at the exchange house.  </P> <P> As the investigation proceeded, Newman said Wick "fled the area and went absent  without leave." Investigators suspected that he had gone to his hometown, Reno,  and notified police there.  </P> <P> Newman said Reno police set up a surveillance at Wick's "last known address" in  Reno, "and he was arrested by them on the evening of June 8 without incident."  </P> <P> The Naval Investigative Service took custody of Wick and eventually transferred  him to the brig at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, Newman said.  </P> <P> It was not until Wednesday that Newport Beach detectives, working with the  Orange County district attorney's office, obtained the arrest warrant for Wick,  charging him with the murders. Newman said an investigation is continuing.  </P> <P> Wick, who has been on active duty since May 4, 1988, was a small arms repairman  in the Marine Corps, according to Master Sgt. Steve Merrill, public affairs  chief at the El Toro base.  </P> <P> "He was an armorer. He would fix rifles and pistols, and was in charge of  issuance and custody of weapons," Merrill said.  </P> <P> Wick was a member of Marine Aircraft Group 16, said Lt. Gene Browne, also a  public affairs officer at El Toro.  </P> <P> While military sources said Wick is the son of an FBI agent, no one was  available at the Reno FBI office late Wednesday to confirm that relationship.  In the Las Vegas office, an officer in charge confirmed that an agent named  Bruce Wick works in the Reno office, but Bruce Wick could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> The attack on King, his wife and Oatts occurred March 14 at the Newport Coin  Exchange offices on MacArthur Boulevard. Sources close to the investigation  have said that all three were shot in the back or top of the head "execution  style." A shotgun was recovered at the scene, and the area was littered with  9-millimeter ammunition.  </P> <P> Paramedics rushed King to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center  after they ignored his pleas to let him die at the scene, the federal source  said.  </P> <P> At the time, police said they believed that robbery was a motive in the  slayings but were not ruling out other reasons.  </P> <P> A source close to the investigation said in March that King and his attorney  had been negotiating with federal authorities concerning indictments on the  various mail and wire fraud charges in the Premaco case.  </P> <P> According to affidavits filed by postal investigators, Premaco salesmen hawked  their wares to the public through telephone solicitations, promotional  mailings, TV ads on Financial News Network and newspaper ads.  </P> <P> Authorities in connection with those investigations could not be reached for  comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Maria L. La Ganga and Carla Lazzareschi contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

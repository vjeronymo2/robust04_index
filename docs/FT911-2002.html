			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Poor first quarter at Imasco THE RECESSION and tougher competition, particularly for the US fast-food subsidiary, hit first-quarter earnings of Imasco, the tobacco, financial services and retailing group which is 40 per cent-owned by BAT Industries of the UK. The tobacco products business continued the largest single contributor and escaped the impact of recent sharp tax increases at retail. The Canada Trustco financial services subsidiary, on a consolidated basis, was second-largest contributor but was affected by the recession and larger loan loss provisions. Overall, first-quarter profit was CDollars 51.9m (USDollars 44.7m), down 22 per cent from CDollars 66.6m a year earlier, equal to 38 cents a share, against 50 cents. Revenues were CDollars 1.1bn, up 1 per cent. Hardees Food Systems made a negative contribution because of difficult fast-food markets in the US, but improvement is expected with aggressive marketing and cuts in overhead. The Canadian drug store business did better despite the recession. Imperial Tobacco is expected to gain cigarette market share in Canada beyond the present 60.2 per cent, offsetting the impact of retail tax increases. Imasco expects a slow second quarter, but results should pick up with the North American economy in the second half this year. St Laurence Cement, controlled by the Swiss Holderbank Group, had a first-quarter loss of CDollars 13.2m, or 32 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 961,000, or 2 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 58.6m against CDollars 105m. BP Canada had a first-quarter loss of CDollars 6.2m against a profit of CDollars 6m, or 12 cents a share, a year ago, on revenues of CDollars 73.5m against CDollars 92m.</p>

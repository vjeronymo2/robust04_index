			<p>BFN     [Text] The Association of Committed Protestant Pastors and  Leaders [APLPE] takes a position. The association is calling on  the Christian people of Haiti to resist, and reminds them that,  like the people of Israel, the defense of the homeland against  the attack of invaders, is sacred. According to the Association  of Committed Protestant Pastors and Leaders, the embargo that  the association calls unfair and criminal, imposed on Haiti by  the international community, constitutes an attack on human  rights, and the various UN resolutions are an open invitation  for an invasion of the Haitian national territory and violates  the spirit of the organization.    The association notes that several political and  socioprofessional organizations have made proposals for a  solution to the crisis, and that the international community has  faced failure after failure in its attempt to restore a  fictitious democracy in Haiti. Therefore, the Association of  Committed Protestant Pastors and Leaders calls on the Christian  people to organize a resistance and reminds them that like the  people of Israel, the defense of the homeland against invaders  is sacred.    This press release was signed by Dr. Jacques Jovin,  president  of the Association of Committed Protestant Pastors and Leaders.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television An extraordinary night for history. BBC2 begins a new series, The Day The World Changed with Steven Berkoff making his choice: November 7 1938 when Herschel Grynszpan shot a German diplomat in Paris. That was followed by Kristallnacht which led eventually to the Holocaust (8.00). Timewatch (8.10 BBC2) investigates 'the battle of the styles' in the 1830s when classicists and modernists argued about the sort of building that should replace the old Houses of Parliament which had burned down in 1834. The argument scarcely differed from that which we hear today about the design of public buildings. ITV are wrapping their two-hour drama documentary The Treaty around 'News At 10', so this account of the emergence of the Irish Free State begins at 9.00 and ends at 11.45. BBC1 begins a 4-part series, Churchill, which claims to be 'the first complete television biography of Britain's wartime leader'. It is written and presented by Martin Gilbert who spent 25 years researching and writing the 8-volume official biography. Today's programme covers Churchill's early life and political career up to 1940 when he became Prime Minister.</p>

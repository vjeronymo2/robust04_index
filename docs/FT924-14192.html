			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Danes seek 'substantial'alterations to treaty THE Danish government yesterday said it would not submit the Maastricht treaty to a second referendum unless it offered 'substantial changes' which took account of the concerns expressed by Danish voters when they rejected the treaty last June, write Robert Mauthner, Diplomatic Editor, and Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. 'We will not hold a second referendum on the same basis as before. I'm not going to present the Danish voters with the same question, dressed up in some fancy clothes,' Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an interview with Mr Brian Walden of London Weekend Television. Although the Danish foreign minister did not call for formal amendments to the text, he stressed his government was looking for 'clarifications' of matters of vital interest to Denmark which were already in the treaty. In particular, Denmark, in common with other member states such as Britain and Germany, wanted clarification of 'subsidiarity,' the principle that decisions should only be taken by European Community institutions if their objectives could not be as effectively achieved by national governments. 'You have to put flesh and blood on what is only a principle in the treaty. We will have to lay down clear rules on how decisions are taken.' The minister, who was speaking two days after his government had published a white paper containing eight possible options which Denmark and its partners could pursue to overcome the obstacles to ratification of the Maastricht treaty, also said Denmark wanted some 'special deals' on specific issues. Although he denied Denmark wanted to exclude sensitive matters such as defence, education and health from the treaty, it wanted the principle of subsidiarity to be applied to them in the form of opt-out clauses, of the kind obtained by the UK for the social chapter of the treaty. Another important issue on which Denmark wanted to reserve the right to opt out was adoption of a single Community currency. Meanwhile, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, leader of the Danish opposition Social Democratic party (SDP), has tightened his party's conditions for supporting special arrangements between Denmark and the other 11 EC members. At a meeting of European Socialist parties in Brussels at the weekend he stressed any special arrangements must have a legally binding status. Mr Rasmussen rejected the suggestion that Danish ratification of the treaty should be subjected to a time limit and said his party demanded exemption from any participation in an EC defence policy. Ratification with a time limit, enabling Denmark to withdraw from the treaty if developments were regarded as incompatible with Danish interests, was one of the options suggested in the government's white paper. Other special arrangements which the SDP is calling for include exemption from participation in economic and monetary union, particularly the common currency, and union citizenship.</p>

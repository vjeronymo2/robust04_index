Decca 436 243-2 (three CDs) MASSENET'S last operas were given their first performances posthumously: the comedy Panurge in 1913 (a year after his death), the romantic tragedy Cleopatre the following year. Neither was a success. Don Quichotte apart, this had been the fate of most of his works in the last decade of his life. His star was on the wane. A public introduced in 1902 to the brave new world of Debussy's Pelleas became perhaps impatient thereafter with the 'well-made' aspects of Massenet's idiom, and unable or unwilling to distinguish with what subtlety he continually renewed it. From that time until quite recently the critical formulation has tended to go unchallenged that late Massenet - Don Quichotte, again, apart - comprises a tired, formula-bound series, little worth the bother. That is changing. In particular, the annual festival launched a few years ago at Saint-Etienne, the composer's birth-place, is stirring up received opinion. Cleopatre is the latest of several feats of Massenet re-discovery undertaken there: the 1990 festival production was recorded 'live' and is now published on one of the more adventurous small-company labels. It is endlessly fascinating: an opera of chamber-drama intimacy (for all its gestures in the direction of spectacle) executed with peculiar mastery, and so economical in its treatment of Louis Payen's workmanlike libretto that within the first 15 minutes all the basic elements are laid in place. There is an unwasteful quality about the musical treatment, an underplaying of melodic curves and a touching-in of ceremony and show that betoken the confidence of a mature artist in his craftsmanship. More than ever - because now the strokes are so lightly and pointedly made - the word-setting skill is breathtaking. Whether it be the introductory Roman fanfares ('generic' rather than musically original, but briskly introduced and summarily dismissed) or the infusion of Egyptian low-life exoticism (with its gentle back-references to Thais), Massenet squanders not a note on scene-setting. What interests him most are the erotic pull of the work's pivotal relationship and, above all, the titular heroine. From her first monologue Cleopatra (mezzo) is pictured in the round, as a mature sensualist, complex, quick to calculation - she has set out to captivate a brashly sceptical Anthony (baritone), and easily accomplishes the ploy - and prone to sudden caprices, yet capable of grand, unfettered passion in the end. (The fact that the role was written for Lucy Arbell, the composer's own amitie amoureuse of his last years, throws revealing sidelights on the characterisation.) Subplots involve Octavia (soprano) and Spakos, the freed slave with whose affections Cleopatra cruelly toys (tenor). But everything is intended to reflect back on the 'infinite variety' of Cleopatra herself, and does so with effortless directness. The fallibilities of lovers, tenderly and uncensoriously described (especially the female ones), was always the central concern of Massenet's artistic vision. Here, in the final product of that vision, his arts of description are distilled to a fine essence. Part of the secret of Massenet's final-period economy lay in his intimate understanding of fine singers, in his knowledge of all the ways they could be counted on to 'make the difference' to the drama - a plain vocal line becomes a bewitching one when fragrantly uttered. The Saint-Etienne recording does not command singers of quite that calibre: only Kathryn Harries in the title role, at her most liquidly and duskily appealing (because not taxed by strenuous high notes), possesses a proper measure of distinction. For all that, this is a highly enjoyable performance, briskly kept on the move, a 'real' rather than a studio-bound experience. It's curious to move from it to the latest Pelleas - DG's all-star, studio-glossy version - not only because one notes with heightened awareness Massenet's influence on Debussy, but also because the over-studied, over-calculated atmosphere created by Abbado and the Vienna Philharmonic seems the opposite of Saint-Etienne down-to-earth-ness. Beauty of sonority, which the DG offers in abundance, is no bad thing in this opera, but when dramatic muscle-power goes be missing beneath its surface, it can appear a strangely qualified virtue. In addition, Francois Le Roux and Maria Ewing in the title roles give the impression that Debussy and Maeterlinck have pitted a pair of youthful sophisticates, mannered to the last degree, against a castle-full of sincere older people, led by Jose van Dam's magnificently unforced Golaud and Jean-Philippe Courtis's quietly eloquent Arkel. The extreme refinement of the reading is not to be scorned; but the greatness of the opera is somehow diminished thereby. Van Dam is the Barak on Decca's new Frau ohne Schatten - uncut, long-awaited, high-profile in its cast, and disappointingly flawed. It is not without its great points. Julia Varady glows with inimitable and glorious lustre in the monumental title role; Van Dam sings nobly, though the character's bluff warmth does not come easily to this most fastidious of bass-baritones; and Hildegard Behrens throws her all - searing passion, pinpoint high notes and middle-register wobbles included - into the dyer's wife. The many smaller vocal elements in this vast, rich, wildly overblown fantasy are nicely touched in; the Vienna Philharmonic play with native authority. But Solti, who writes in the programme book of a lifelong devotion to the work, is still only half a Frau conductor - the craggily monumental half, not the candidly diatonic, chorale-like, which he nags forward impatiently. (The recording was made over a period of two-and-a-half years, which may account for its lack of 'consecutive' line.) And the casting of Domingo as the Emperor proves an embarrassing failure: he hashes up the text, breaks up the phrases, and sounds worryingly uneasy with the tessitura.</p>

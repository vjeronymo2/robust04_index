			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tories' business pledge to Scots THE Scottish Conservative Party pledged yesterday to bring business rates in Scotland in line with those in England and Wales in the lifetime of the next parliament. The promise is contained in the Scottish version of the Tory manifesto which was launched by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, in Edinburgh. Mr Allan Stewart, local government minister, said that by the new financial year the Tory government would have reduced the burden of business rates on Scotland by Pounds 370m from what they would otherwise have been. This would be achieved through subsidies, instructions to local authorities and by banning business-rate increases greater than the inflation rate. However, the Scottish National party argues that Pounds 400m is needed to close the gap between Scottish and English business rates, and business organisations put the remaining gap at more than Pounds 350m. In 1989, when the government embarked on harmonising rates between Scotland and England, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, then Scottish secretary, said that the process would take 'five years, or possibly a little more'. Harmonisation would involve removing the differences in the valuing of property between the two countries. The Scottish manifesto states that the party stands unequivocally for the union of the UK and rejects Labour's plan for a devolved Scottish parliament, as well as independence. However, the party is 'willing to consider ways of improving the government of Scotland'. Mr Lang yesterday offered no new ideas on improving Scotland's government and said it was vital that any proposals 'maintained the integrity of the union'. Discussions with other parties on constitutional improvements were always possible, he said. Among other new pledges, free transport is to be provided for secondary school children whose parents wish to send them to schools other than their neighbourhood comprehensive. It will be made illegal to carry knives in public, apart from 'certain penknives' and sgian dhuibhs (ceremonial knifes).</p>

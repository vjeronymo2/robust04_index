			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading RENEWED HOPES of a cut in both German and UK interest rates reversed Tuesday's falls in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Hopes of a reduction in base rates, which had fuelled Monday's rise but faded on Tuesday, returned strongly yesterday. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index, which opened at 2,876, was in demand from the beginning as developments in the currency markets were taken to indicate a cut in German rates today. Such a move, traders argued, would allow a reduction in UK rates. This view was strengthened by the release of UK retail sales figures which were worse than expected. Having moved steadily forward throughout the morning, June reached the day's high of 2,900 just ahead of Wall Street's opening. It came off the top to close at 2,889, a 6-point premium to the underlying cash market. Dealers continued to roll pos-itions forward ahead of tomorrow's expiry of the June contract, which saw volume of 12,923. The September future had 6,854 lots transacted. The expiry of the June stock options was the main feature in traded options and a significant contributor to the day's total turnover of 31,338 lots. Amstrad, whose June options expired yesterday, traded 3,197 lots, followed by British Gas with 2,214, another with June expiry. GEC had volume of 1,150.</p>

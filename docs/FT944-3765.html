			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Investors warned on Halifax merger The Halifax and Leeds Permanent building societies will this week warn investors that reducing their balances could affect their free share entitlement when the merged society becomes a public limited company and a bank. This is likely to intensify speculation that Halifax, as the merged organisation will be called, does not want to follow the path set by Abbey National, the former society, which gave its investors and borrowers 100 free shares each on a 'flat-rate' basis when it converted in 1989. Adopting a different system runs the risk of a legal challenge since it may not fall clearly within the terms of the 1986 legislation which governs societies. The warning will be made in the first letter the societies are sending to their 10m members about the merger and flotation plans announced last month. The letters will tell members who will be eligible to vote at the special general meetings - planned for the spring - at which the merger must be approved if it is to go ahead. Within each society the borrowers and the investors must separately agree to the deal. For the borrowers' resolution only a simple majority of those voting is needed. For the investors' resolution, however, three-quarters of those voting must support the move, although there is no minimum turnout figure as there is for investors to approve conversion. Halifax is already the UK's biggest mortgage lender and the merger with Leeds, the fifth biggest society, would create an organisation with about Pounds 90bn in assets. Members will have a separate opportunity after the merger to decide whether the joint society should become a public limited company. The most likely time for flotation is early 1997.</p>

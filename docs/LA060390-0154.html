			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> TIME HAS COME FOR METS TO TURN THE PAGE ON 1986  </P> <P> By now, we all have heard -- ad nauseum -- how few rules Davey Johnson  established during his tenure as Mets manager and how little he enforced the  ones he did have. Discipline has its place, but neither Bill James nor Dallas  Green has found direct correlations between a game of hearts and ERA and  between afternoon success on the 16th hole and ninth-inning failure to hit.  </P> <P> Johnson did have one directive that he regularly enforced and emphasized. It  was neither profound nor his own creation. It was simply "Turn the page." He  would advise his players to do so, knowing that selective recall can do wonders  for a player's psyche. Forget yesterday's failure, clear your mind, dump your  burdens.  </P> <P> Now, because Frank Cashen lacks the patience he says he has and because he  undermined Johnson eight months before he dismissed him, the Mets' players must  turn the final page of the most successful chapter in the history of the  franchise. The next few weeks will produce an epilogue, no doubt, but the book  on Davey Johnson as Mets manager essentially is closed.  </P> <P> And now the Mets must forget him and the strain of the last 204 games of his  regime. In doing so, they are all but forced to purge Johnson's greatest  achievement from their memories. And that's a good thing. The time has come for  them to turn the page on The 1986 Season and all the wonder and spectacle it  created. Johnson's dismissal ought to enable the Mets to accomplish that.  </P> <P> His departure leaves only remnants from that season in the clubhouse. Now that  Johnson is collecting more than $750,000 over the next 1 1/3 seasons to fish in  Florida, nearly all of the primary people involved in that wondrous season are  gone. Think about it. Hernandez, Carter, Knight, Backman, Dykstra, Wilson,  Mitchell, Orosco, McDowell and Santana are gone. And now Johnson is, too.  </P> <P> Granted, most of the starting rotation from that season remains intact, and, of  course, Darryl Strawberry still draws his salary from Sterling Doubleday  Enterprises. But as good as the pitching was that season, it wasn't the primary  force in the team's drive to the World Series championship. And Strawberry no  longer is the person -- and perhaps not the player -- he was then.  </P> <P> The 1986 Mets scored early and buried opponents. And on those rare occasions  with they fell behind, they knew they could come back against any pitcher who  wasn't named Scott or Krukow. They dared opponents to bunt on them. They  infuriated other teams. They out-arroganced everyone.  </P> <P> There was the grit of "Backstra," the intensity of Hernandez, Carter and  Knight, the talent of Strawberry and Mitchell and the mystical Mookie element.  And Johnson knew how to make it all work together. They traveled with arrogance  and intimidation in their bags.  </P> <P> Of course, the starting pitching was critical. But Dwight Gooden was merely  very good, not great. Ron Darling was good but not very good, and Bob Ojeda, a  critical clubhouse force these days, was in his first season with the team and  never asserted himself as he has this year. Sid Fernandez hadn't emerged, and  David Cone and Frank Viola were in the other league.  </P> <P> Strawberry was a primary factor and personality then, but his role has shrunk  dramatically in the aftermath of his alcohol rehabilitation.  </P> <P> And now Johnson is gone. There is little or no arrogance. Losing records don't  lend themselves to feelings of superiority. But is this a case of cause and  effect or effect and cause? Is this collection of Mets not arrogant enough to  play well or are they unable to play well enough to become arrogant? Probably  both. Right now, they don't have personnel that opponents fear.  </P> <P> These Mets are not going to recreate 1986 and that team's intensity and need to  succeed. And because they aren't -- or can't -- they'd be better off not trying  to. Turn the page. Forget it. Stop using it as a point of reference. They are  far enough removed from it in time, talent and personnel to make a divorce  work.  </P> <P> These Mets ought to establish a new personality and remove themselves from the  long shadows of '86. Johnson was part of that shadow. With him gone and Bud  Harrelson in his place, they have the opportunity.  </P> <P> Expect Kevin Elster to emerge as more of the team leader and spokesman now that  Harrelson is in place.  </P> <P> There's every reason to believe Cashen wanted to make the move Wednesday, an  off-day, with players dispersed and Johnson in Florida. It's hard to believe  he's a former newspaper man.  </P> <P> Everyone's talking about Johnson moving to the Yankees. If he wasn't enough of  a disciplinarian for Cashen, how would he satisfy George Steinbrenner? How  would he deal with Mel Hall?  </P> <P> Why not Johnson to the Braves or Rangers? He has roots in both places. Why not  Bobby Valentine to the Yankees?  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Cabinet yesterday approved a Bt715-billion  budget for fiscal year 1995, the first balanced budget during  the term of the elected government of Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai. The figure represents a 14 per cent increase from the  1994 budget.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said the balanced budget was  possible because the country's economic growth during the past  year had passed the government's target and because more  efficient tax collection was expected. The 1995 Budget Bill  will be forwarded to the House of Representatives for  deliberation in June, he said. The 1995 fiscal year starts this  October.    Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa denied that  discussion of the budget at the Cabinet meeting yesterday was  linked to a possible dissolution of the House.    Earlier rumours suggested that the government wanted to rush  the 1995 Budget Bill through Parliament then dissolve the House  before calling a snap general election. Aphisit dismissed the  rumours, saying the government had to prepare the bill in  advance so the budget could be approved in time for the  beginning of the new fiscal year.</p>

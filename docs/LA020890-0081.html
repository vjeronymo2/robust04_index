			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM CHINESE TO FRENCH, FLAVORS OF MUSTARD REKINDLE MANY MEMORIES;  </P> <P> SEASONINGS: CONDIMENT HAS A LONG HISTORY OF SPICING UP THE SIMPLEST OF FOODS.  </P> <P> Mustard is one of my favorite condiments, a romance going back to the days when  deli clerks in my neighborhood in Manhattan smeared a spicy, semi-brown type  similar to Gulden's on franks and hot pastrami sandwiches. I have not seen,  smelled or tasted that particular brown spicy mustard since. Not even from a  Gulden's jar.  </P> <P> I remember the old, stooped waiters at Ratner's dairy restaurant. Their vests,  bow-ties and white coats were covered with mustard markings, like so many  khaki-colored pigeon droppings.  </P> <P> It didn't do much for the appetite, but it reminded me to rush over to Katz'  Delicatessen on Houston Street, where one could buy homemade mustard and the  best pastrami sandwiches in town.  </P> <P> As a teen-ager I was introduced to hot Chinese mustard, the kind that shoots  quickly to the sinuses the way horseradish does. In those days, Chinese  restaurants served tiny saucers filled with squirts of catsup and mustard for  dipping egg rolls. The idea was to keep the catsup and mustard separated lest  they turn a muddy red you wouldn't use for paint, much less eat.  </P> <P> Then along came Dijon mustard and the world changed. By this time I had started  cooking things from Dione Lucas' Cordon Bleu Cooking School repertoire, in  which French mustards (Dijon, Meaux, Orleans and Bordeaux) often figured. I  particularly remember a mustard butter Lucas often used with herring or  mackerel; it was made with both French Dijon and English hot mustards. I used  it with all kinds of sausages, on sandwiches and in salad dressing. I put it on  my grilled chicken, steak, lamb chops and pork chops. Everything and anything.  </P> <P> In France, the term for mustard (moutarde, from mout ardient, meaning piquant  must) is reserved for mustard paste obtained only from brown seeds (Brassica  juncea, of the type originating in Africa, India and China) and black seeds  (Brassica nigra, which are also native to Europe and the Middle East). These  seeds, unlike the white seeds (the most bitter and pungent of all), contain  myronate and myrosin, the essences that give mustards their piquancy when  crushed in the presence of water or vinegar. English mustard consists of a  mixture of black and white mustard seeds ground into flour with turmeric added.  </P> <P> Mustard is one of the most ancient spices known to man. Early Egyptians chewed  on seeds as a complement to meat, and Greeks appreciated its medicinal  properties. It has been used for thousands of years in both Africa and China,  where the seeds are grown, and Christ immortalized mustard seeds when he spoke  of the power of faith.  </P> <P> The ancient Romans Pliny and Terence wrote that slaves crushed mustard seeds in  mortars and turned it into a thick paste by adding wine vinegar, much as people  do today. Roman conquests introduced mustard to Gaul in the 15th Century, where  a mustard-making guild was instituted. Today it's manufactured around the world  with formulas differing from manufacturer to manufacturer.  </P> <P> Larousse Gastronomique reports that in the 18th Century a Dijon manufacturer  called Naigeon prepared a strong, white mustard to coincide with the winter  harvest.  </P> <P> In Bordeaux the mustard seed is mixed with unfermented grape must (mout); in  Dijon, the capital of Burgundy, considered the greatest mustard-producing  center in France, the seeds are mixed with verjuice (unriped green fruit juice)  and white wine, and in Meaux the preparation is made with vinegar.  </P> <P> The word Cremona was first uttered in my memory by Celestino Drago, of  Celestino Ristorante, who explained what mostarda di Cremona was all about.  Italians translate mostarda di Cremona (named after the place in Lombardy where  this mustard product derives) as mustard, but it looks more like chutney.  Cremona is actually made from candied fruits macerated in a sauce that contains  mustard and is generally served with grilled or roasted meats. Drago uses the  mustard as a flavoring for pumpkin-filled tortellini. The Italian mustard can  be purchased at most well-stocked Italian grocery stores.  </P> <P> Dutch and German mustards are a novelty not to be passed up. They need easing  into, especially if you're not accustomed to the bitter taste and drab color of  some types. But eating Dutch Marne brand mustard, for instance, with  jerooktewurst, a traditional Dutch sausage, was a treat of treats, introduced  to me as a child by a neighbor who would bring over a care package of Dutch  goodies, including smoked wurst with mustard, dark rye rojjeberood (a dense  brown bread), and potato-meat croquettes called kroquette -- a full meal in a  deli basket.  </P> <P> Mustards come not only from jars. People actually concoct their own flavors and  types to go with all manner of hot and cold meats, sandwiches, salad dressings  and the like. One such mustard is Champagne mustard, now an old Dosti family  standby thanks to a friend who once served it with baked ham at a Christmas  party. She makes the mustard herself and often gives jars of it as gifts.  </P> <P> If you are thinking of making your own mustard, here is a rundown of  characteristics of mustard, courtesy of the American Spice Assn.  </P> <P> Powdered mustard is often called flour, which is an FDA designation standard.  The husk of the seed is removed by milling and the heat is finely ground.  Mustard flour is usually a blend of Oriental brown and yellow seeds. Ground  mustard is the product of ground seeds, husks and all. It is primarily used by  the sausage industry because the husks contain a mucilaginous substance that  acts as a good binding agent.  </P> <P> Pungency can only be released when triggered by enzyme action when water is  added. Low acid liquids, such as milk and beer, also work well to trigger the  enzyme. Acidic liquids, such as wine, vinegar and lemon juice are poor triggers  but good preservatives; heat can also impede the flavor release. It's best to  let moistened mustard powder stand 10 minutes before adding it to any food  preparation, including salad dressing.  </P> <P> Incidentally, any powdered mustard will produce the fire of a Chinese mustard  if it is moistened to a thin paste then left to stand 10 minutes. However, it  should be used immediately because pungency dissipates within a few hours  unless vinegar or other acidic liquid is added. You can extend life of the  product by keeping the mixture cold. A tablespoon of vinegar may be added per  cup of mixed mustard to further lengthen the flavor life. Mustard will remain  hot to the taste for several days if kept refrigerated.  </P> <P> Mustard also has the unique ability to emulsify liquids. Powdered mustard added  sufficiently to salad dressing will hold the oil and vinegar together.  </P> <P> Whole seeds are used primarily in pickles, relishes and condiments where the  appearance of whole seeds is necessary.  </P> <P> There are numerous uses for mustard, whether to enhance the taste of sausages,  charcuterie, grilled meats, fish or poultry. It can be served as a dip for  steak or can be addded to salad dressings for a flavor fillip. Macaroni and  potato salads are especially palatable with the addition of mustard.  </P> <P> Organ meats such as liver and kidneys are enhanced by a touch of mustard in the  cooking sauce. Vegetables such as asparagus, broccoli, cabbage and other  cruciferous vegetables also take to mustard, especially when the mustard is the  creamy type. Breaded meats and vegetables also are compatible with mustard.  </P> <P> Following are recipes for making your own mustards. Included are standbys such  as picnic mustard, English mustard and fiery Chinese mustard. Among the  Oriental mustards is a recipe from Benihana, a Japanese teppan restaurant  chain. It's ideal with grilled Japanese-style steaks and other meats, chicken  or fish.  </P> <P> MUSTARD  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons dry mustard  </P> <P> Few drops water  </P> <P> Combine mustard with enough water to make paste.

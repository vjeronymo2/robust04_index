			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GODFATHER'S SON  </P> <P> The article glorified the mob, Mafia, organized crime and all they represent by  idolizing the lawyer son of an infamous crime figure. Many of the types of  organized crime and its roots are in the past, though certainly operant today.  It made me wonder if in the not so distant future this same Sunday magazine  will be featuring an article on the offspring of our now infamous gangs.  </P> <P> ZELLE HAMMOND  </P> <P> Harbor City  </P></p>

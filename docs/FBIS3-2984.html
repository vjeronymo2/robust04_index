This is the question facing the governments on the two  sides of the Atlantic Ocean.    And there is little hope to put their chronic argument to  rest when the labor and finance ministers of the world's biggest  industrial countries gather here on Monday [14 March] for a  summit that, for the first time, focuses exclusively on jobs.    "For long, the choice is either between a low wage, high  employment model, that is the United States, and a high wage,  low employment model, that is Europe," commented Jeff Faux,  president of the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute.    "It seemed to us that this trade-off is unsatisfactory," he  said. "Solving the problem will require some sort of collective  action."    Collective action comes from a common solution, which now  looks almost impossible since the problems at issue, despite  some similarities, are basically different, observers noted.    In the U.S., the real wages of workers have been falling by  one percent a year since 1973, when the country's real gross  domestic product went up 27 percent. However, it gained more  than three million jobs since the 1990-1991 recession, mostly  part-time jobs in the service area.    "Especially in recent years, the real problem is we've had a  collapse in earnings opportunities for young Americans of all  educational levels," said Lester Thurow, MIT's [Massachusetts  Institute of Technology] professor on management and economics.    In Europe, it is a picture of another kind. European Union's  unemployment rate stands at a high of 11 percent, although in  the last 18 years, the manufacturing workers there enjoyed wage  increases from 30 percent to 40 percent.    "From the European perspective, the position is that  unemployment is worse, it is worsening, and it will continue to  worsen," said Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor of the Exchequer  of Britain's Labor Party on Thursday.    In the U.S., meanwhile, six out of every seven new jobs  created from 1970 to 1991 were in the private sector, while in  Europe, according to OECD statistics, two thirds of the new jobs  were in government.    Another difference: Half of the incomes for European workers  come from benefits and pensions, while in the U.S., workers  suffered a continuous decline in unemployment insurance  benefits, which generated the call to reform the country's  welfare system "as we know it."    For the whole 1980s, the unemployment rate in the U.S. and  European Union were respectively 7.3 percent and 10.1 percent,  while in the 1960s and 1970s, the rates were five percent for  the U.S. and two percent for Europe.    What's in common for them, according to Eileen Appelbaum, a  professor of economics in the Temple University, is that the  industries experiencing high productivity in these countries all  shed workers.    "The question is how and whether we can get back to a  situation in which wages, productivity and employment all rise  together," she asked at a recent seminar.    The Clinton administration, which said it expected no  communiques out of the two-day summit, stressed in recent days  that they wanted to use the occasion to swap notes with Western  Europe.    "It's the height of arrogance to think we cannot learn from  each other," said U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen last  week.    For examples, U.S. officials said, Europe's success in  worker  training and integrity of schools and workplaces is one area  that Washington thinks warrants learning.    The mobility of the U.S. labor markets, which means workers  can move freely and employers can fire workers without the  pressures from labor unions, U.S. officials said, is perhaps  their own advantage that cannot be found now in Europe.    For U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich, there is a third  choice bringing the gap across the Atlantic.    "It may be to combine the investment in education in Europe  with the dynamic labor flexibility in the United States, all  encased within macro-economic policies which encourage growth  and jobs," he told foreign reporters on Wednesday.    In so saying, Reich was referring to the high price  Europeans  have been paying for higher interest rates, especially in  Germany, which the U.S. said obstructed the countries' real  economic growth.    This, in turn, is not what the European ministers would like  to be lectured when they fly half around the world to Detroit,  whose major presence - the auto plants - is the pride for the  White House, more than ever.</p>

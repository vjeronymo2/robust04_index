			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Double helping of carrots for farm show visitors - Incentives for growers to attend and to spend will abound at next week's Royal Smithfield Show THE ORGANISERS of the Royal Smithfield Show, scheduled to open for its five-day run at the Earl's Court exhibition halls in London next Sunday, have been sending carrots to exhibitors - real carrots. It is not because there is a surplus of the orange-coloured roots, although there has been a very big crop this year, but to try to persuade hard-pressed agricultural traders of the potential benefits of showing their wares to what is claimed to be the biggest specialist farming audience in Britain. For although falling incomes and fewer UK farmers (they are going out of business at the rate of about 100 a week) have reduced attendances at the event from 70,000-plus in the 1970s to nearer 50,000 in the 1990s, surveys of those who do attend make impressive reading. The organisers claim that 62 per cent of visitors are directly involved in agriculture and 35 per cent are trade buyers. They say that 38 per cent of the farmers who attend control over 500 acres, and are therefore more likely to be buyers than those on smaller acreages, and that 81 per cent of those working on farms are involved in decision-making. It is an interesting irony that a farming show located in the heart of London seems able to deliver for exhibitors an audience consisting of 'quality' prospects. Even so, to companies which have seen their sales plummeting in recent years, the high cost of setting up and staffing trade stands in the metropolis can still be daunting. Indeed some big names in the farm machinery business have pulled out of exhibiting at Earl's Court for that reason. That is where the other type of carrot has come into play. Smithfield officials have taken advantage of the recession in the travel and hotel trades to negotiate cut-priced combined train and accommodation deals for both exhibitors and visitors. Indeed several special incentives have been launched to try to ensure that not only are the trade stands taken but also that the avenues between them are busy. The techniques may be more familiar to those who sold life insurance or airplane tickets but they appear to have worked. Earl's Court, we are assured, will be full next week with both the livestock and meat from which the Smithfield Show derived its name and the farm machinery, albeit from some new exhibitors, which has dominated the event since it became a vital ingredient of efficient farming. But it will also contain elements not seen there before. A whole new area will be devoted to business advice with land agents, consultants and the like offering to help farmers to survive CAP reform and the potential General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade settlement - for substantial fees of course. Ironically, seems highly likely that they will be advising clients not to spend too much money on the expensive machinery all around them. For it is a regular criticism of farmers that they buy far more machinery than they actually or can really afford. Moreover, in the days, 10 or so years ago, when it was possible to write off 100 per cent of the cost of a new machine against tax in the year of purchase, farmers, the consultants allege, bought to save tax and that was the wrong reason. The machinery trade, predictably, has a different view. It has already welcomed the chancellor of the exchequer's announcement in his Autumn Statement that capital allowances will be raised to 40 per cent for the next 12 months. But this does not go far enough, says the Agricultural Engineering Association. Furthermore, there is little doubt that, when manufacturers entertain Mr John Gummer, the minister of agriculture, to lunch at Earl's Court next Monday, they will press him once again to persuade Mr Norman Lamont to allow a faster write-down of farm machinery, preferably returning to 100 per cent in the first year. For the trade has seen its sales slip yet agin. Only 12 or 15 years ago it was for instance possible for dealers to budget on total UK tractor sales in excess of 30,000 units a year. Last year the figure had fallen to 15,280 and so far this year (to 31 October) sales are down a further 6.1 per cent. Industry forecasts put the year end figure at about 14,500. To achieve even that modest target it will be necessary for manufacturers and dealers to continue to offer large discounts, extended credit and/or interest-free deals. But those companies that do exhibit next week may well be approaching the occasion with a little more optimism than in recent years, for in the short term in some favoured areas of agriculture there is a little more money available. In spite of wet harvest weather some UK farmers, but not all by any means, enjoyed fairly good grain yields and quality this year. When sterling floated free of the European Community's exchange rate mechanism and was devalued, the price of that grain increased significantly and some farmers are now selling their produce at 12 per cent to 15 per cent above what they had budgeted. The fall in bank interest rates to a base of 7 per cent (most secure farmers pay 2 to 3 per cent above that) has relieved at least some of the burden of borrowed money and the public spending cuts, announced by the chancellor earlier this month, treated farmers relatively leniently. All of which will combine to improve the fortunes and the mood of the fortunate farmers who have so benefited and make them more inclined to renew old machines, which may well have needed to be replaced for some time. Add to that the appalling wet autumn which has led to difficult cultivations and imposed severe strains on men and ageing machines, and there may be significant numbers of farmers wanting to update and improve their tackle in order to be able to deal better with bad conditions next time they occur. But that is the nature of farming. We farmers always plan for next year on the basis of last year's weather. And if we get it wrong, generally speaking, in arable farming anyway, the next opportunity to try again is the year after. That is the price of being part of an industry where there is only one product per field per year. Indeed it may be appropriate in this time of dramatic changes to remind the politicians imposing them of the same message. If the combined result of cuts in farm prices, quotas on production, virtually compulsory acreage set-aside and bad weather, is a shortage of food instead of a surplus it will be another 12 months before anything can be done to rebuild supplies.</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PLAYING THE MAPLE LEAFS IS NO LONGER A JOKE  </P> <P> Early in the season, it seemed every team was pushing the Toronto Maple Leafs  around. They were the butt of jokes around the NHL.  </P> <P> Playing in Toronto is no laughing matter these days. The Maple Leafs have  toughened.  </P> <P> The Pittsburgh Penguins, who had won eight of their last nine and were leading  the league with 4.2 goals a game, found that out Saturday night.  </P> <P> Mike Krushelnyski scored twice to lead the Maple Leafs to a 6-3 victory, their  fourth in the last five games.  </P> <P> "We seem to have a renewed feeling," Krushelnyski said. "We're ready to play  anybody. We were ready for these guys."  </P> <P> Calgary 8, Hartford 2 -- The Flames were only 9-7-1 at home before Al MacInnis,  Theoren Fleury and Doug Gilmour each scored twice to lead the rout of the  Whalers.  </P> <P> Chicago 3, New York Islanders 1 -- Goaltender Ed Belfour stopped 34 shots at  Uniondale, N.Y., and gained his league-leading 23rd victory.  </P> <P> The Islanders spoiled his shutout on Wayne McBean's goal with 13:44 to play.  </P> <P> Quebec 4, Washington 3 -- Mike Hough scored twice and assisted on another goal  at Quebec, and the Nordiques extended the Capitals' winless streak to 0-7-1.  </P> <P> New Jersey 4, Buffalo 4 -- With 2:06 to play in regulation, Brendan Shanahan  scored to give the Devils a tie at home.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 3, St. Louis 1 -- Goaltender Ron Hextall stopped 34 shots at St.  Louis and Keith Acton scored twice on power plays to lead the Flyers.  </P> <P> Boston 4, Minnesota 4 -- Goals by Ulf Dahlen and Dave Gagner 20 seconds apart  brought the North Stars even with 2:03 to play.

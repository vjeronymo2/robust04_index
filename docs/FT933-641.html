			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hammerson profits hit by fall in rent income HAMMERSON, the inter-national property investment company that is in the hands of new management, yesterday reported a decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 23.1m to Pounds 15.2m for the six months to June 30. The fall in profits coincided with a period of continued weakness in many of Hammerson's international markets. However it primarily stemmed from a decline in rental income from Pounds 61.4m to Pounds 59.8m, following property sales, and from a reduction of Pounds 6m in the amount of interest capitalised by the group. 'Conditions have remained difficult in many of Hammerson's territories in 1993,' said Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman. A further fall in asset values is expected at the year-end. Hammerson, which announced plans for the equalisation of votes between the ordinary shares and the 'A' ordinary shares when it launched its Pounds 200m rights issue in May, said that it would outline details of its proposals later this year. Mr Ron Spinney, who joined the group as chief executive in May, said he had overhauled the management structure to shorten lines of communication. Management had suffered from an unwieldy board structure, unclear objectives, inefficiencies, poor management of human resources and a lack of research. Steps to tackle these problems included restructuring the board, devolving operational authority and cutting overheads. A review of strategy indicated that more emphasis should be placed on the UK content of the portfolio. This would be achieved primarily by further investment in the UK, rather than by sales of overseas assets, Hammerson said. Some overseas properties might be sold when markets recovered. The group also plans to go beyond its traditional concentration on offices and shopping complexes to increase the retail part of its portfolio. Overheads fell from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 7.8m. In the UK, staff numbers have been cut by 15 per cent. Earnings per share fell from 10.7p to 6.4p. The interim dividend was 3.5p. Lex, Page 20</p>

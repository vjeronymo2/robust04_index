			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOREMAN-COONEY: A FIGHT FOR THE AGED  </P> <P> George Foreman will get a chance tonight to do something some fighters would  like to do -- punch a promoter.  </P> <P> In a scheduled 10-round bout, Foreman, 41, will meet Gerry Cooney, who promoted  two of the former heavyweight champion's fights in his comeback.  </P> <P> Cooney, also on the comeback trail, promoted Foreman's fourth-round knockout of  Carlos Hernandes at Atlantic City, and his second-round knockout of Ladislas  Mijangos at Ft. Myers, Fla., both in 1988.  </P> <P> Cooney, 33, hopes he has less trouble with Foreman than he did in his two  promotional ventures with the punching preacher. Foreman threatened to pull out  of both matches on fight day.  </P> <P> The bout is being criticized in some quarters for exploiting the fighters and  the paying public. Each fighter is guaranteed $1 million. Foreman is the 9-5  favorite in the bout at the Convention Center. A crowd of 11,000 is expected.  </P> <P> It is conceivable, however, that the winner will earn several million dollars  more by fighting Mike Tyson for the championship, which Foreman held in  1973-74.  </P> <P> Since beginning his comeback March 9, 1987, Foreman's record is 19-0, with 18  knockouts.  </P> <P> At Sunday's weigh-in, Forman weighed 253 1/2, Cooney 231.  </P> <P> Foreman's career record is 64-2, with 60 knockouts. Cooney, who failed in a  title bid against Larry Holmes in 1982 and who has not fought since 1987, has a  record of 28-2, with 24 knockouts.  </P></p>

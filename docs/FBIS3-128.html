He said people in the Umfolozi area were being armed by  white conservative farmers who were assisting in training them.    The only objective could be to serve the stated goal by  certain parties that there would be no election allowed in the  territory. "The activities clearly show something is afoot in  preparing a number of people who are fully armed, probably to  launch an attack on people going to vote."    Mr Ramaphosa quoted from a letter received from a local  chief  in December. "It demonstrates the problems we will face in  Natal," he said. Guns were being deployed throughout the  territory.</p>

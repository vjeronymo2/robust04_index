			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Undated open letter signed by CILFA, Argentine Industrial </F> Center of Pharmaceutical Laboratories, published in full-page  advertisement]    [Text] Ambassador Cheek: On the occasion of the visit by  His Excellency the Vice President of the United States.    "What was signed with one hand cannot be erased with the  other."    In December 1993, 117 countries -- including the United  States and Argentina -- reached an agreement for the protection  of intellectual property rights within the framework of the  Uruguay Round of GATT talks, which included the issue of  medicine patents.    This agreement, for which both our country and your country  have actively worked, sets precise international medicine patent  norms.    Consequently, we do not understand the reason for the  continued threat of commercial sanctions and preconditions for  joining NAFTA, under the pressure some U.S. PMA [Pharmaceutical  Manufacturers Association] laboratories are exerting, ignoring  the agreement the two governments have signed.    The pharmaceutical laboratories with Argentine capital have  repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to meet in your country with  the pharmaceutical industry (PMA) and the U.S. trade  representative to help find a reasonable solution to this  problem, but we never got any answer.    Despite the fact that the GATT agreement does not fully  reflect our interests and position, we accept it and respect it.  We ask you to request a similar attitude from your  pharmaceutical industry, which is represented by the PMA,  respecting the decision made by the international community.</p>

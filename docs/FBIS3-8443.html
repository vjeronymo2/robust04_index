			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Victor Ciorbea, chairman of the CNSRL-Fratia </F> Trade Union Confederation, by Constantin Mesenschi; place and  date not given: "We Want Opposition Parties To Participate in  the Government Also"]    [Text] [Mesenschi] Mr. Chairman, how do you view the  results of the round of negotiations that have been held with  the representatives of the government?    [Ciorbea] Unfortunately, we noticed that they showed a  tendency to drag things out when it comes to finding solutions  to the problems that we are currently facing. Most of the 14  claims formulated by the CNSRL [National Confederation of  Romania's Free Trade Unions]-Fratia were on a list that was  submitted to the government as early as in May 1993 and those  claims can be found again in the protocol concluded on 6 May  1993 between the confederations that started the general strike  and the government. Eleven claims were included among the  requests expressed by our trade union confederation at the 18  November rally. Immediately after the rally, during the round  of negotiations held on 20 November, certain solutions were  agreed upon and were to be adopted by the government within two  weeks at the latest. This has not happened, so the problem is  still topical, but meantime, another three claims have been  added to the previous ones.    In conclusion, the discussions held recently with the  government representatives have remained at a level of  information exchanges and the government presented certain  intentions and proposals that can be found in the draft activity  program of that institution. Looking at things realistically, we  believe that by not granting our claims, there was no way for  the 28 February strike to be avoided.    [Mesenschi] What problems do you currently have to face and  how do you believe they can be solved in time?    [Ciorbea] The 14 claims can be divided into two main groups.  One refers to the acceleration of the reform process, that is,  privatization, economic restructuring, ways to halt the  subsidizing of those sectors that are working at a loss, and the  need to introduce a new fiscal system, etc. The other refers to  claims of a social nature, such as the need for the memorandum  [with the IMF] to be accompanied by a program of social  protection measures, particularly for the most disadvantaged  groups of people, that is, the unemployed, the young, and  pensioners.    Thus, our claims could be solved in a very short time, a  minimum salary throughout the economy and a salary-price ratio  could be established, and negotiations regarding the amount of  money that will be allotted for the budget could start at once.  But, first of all, it is necessary that the government and the  Ministry of Finance show openness in connection with the draft  budget, since both the provisions of Law 13/1991 regarding the  collective labor contract as well as Article 15 of the  collective labor contract at national level are currently being  completely ignored. These laws stipulate that before the  endorsement of the law on the budget, the representatives of  trade union federations in all budgetary sectors and the  representatives of the executive should hold negotiations on how  much money will be allotted for the respective areas. We are at  the end of February and those discussions have not even started  yet, and we were not even given the document that contains the  draft budget for 1994.    We have never had such a delay in negotiating the collective  labor contract at the national level. The position adopted by  the employers' association recently was extremely rigid, and  even culminated with their representative being absent from the  round of negotiations convened at the meeting with Dan Mircea  Popescu. Thus, we can see that neither the employers'  association nor the government are displaying any real desire to  find solutions to the problems that we are currently facing.    Another group of claims refer to the need to have urgent  programs endorsed immediately or to have them included in the  norms, government decisions, or draft laws that have to be  submitted to the parliament in urgent procedures. In this  category I can mention some measures of social protection, such  as establishing tripartite bodies, to ensure professional  retraining, and modifying the package of laws that refers to the  rights of trade unions and to labor legislation. But mainly  they should refer to concrete measures to accelerate the reform  process in the economic sector: privatization, restructuring,  finding solutions to the economic-financial blockage problems,  etc.    [Mesenschi] In that respect, how do you view the program of  measures and actions drafted by the government to achieve the  goals included in the government program for 1994?    [Ciorbea] Unfortunately, many provisions in this program  can be found only a few years after the time we claimed them.  The provisions regarding other claims are stipulated in  extremely general terms, without any presentation of measures  through which they could be implemented. Solutions to this  program will almost totally depend on the implementation of the  provisions included in the Memorandum concluded with the IMF.  But, as is well known, there are real difficulties in this  respect, because certain previous conditions have to be  fulfilled and they have not been achieved to this very day.  After the Memorandum is approved, there is still the question  of the political will of the government to implement the  provisions. Therefore, I must repeat our viewpoint that, in  order to find solutions to those clauses stipulated in the  memorandum, which are so very necessary to achieve  macro-economic stability and mainly to obtain foreign financing,  it is absolutely necessary to establish a new parliamentary  majority. We believe this to be necessary because, in practical  terms, we are currently witnessing an obstruction at the  parliamentary level. That became even more obvious when the  PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] and the PRM [Greater  Romania Party] broke off relations, something that has become a  reality. It is absolutely necessary to draft a new government  program that basically should include concrete measures to  enable the implementation of those provisions and the  achievement of real social protection for the more disadvantaged  social strata. Obviously, on the basis of this new  parliamentary majority and of the program that I was talking  about, a new government should be established. We would like to  have a coalition government that should include the main  opposition parties as well, because the social and economic  crisis that we are currently facing can be solved only if we  start solving the political crisis.    [Mesenschi] What have you done to achieve that goal?    [Ciorbea] We have recently been holding meetings at various  levels. On the one hand, we have held discussions with the  representatives of the government in an attempt to solve these  claims and, on the other hand, we have held talks with our  colleagues at the Alfa-Cartel, the leaders of the major  opposition parties, and the PDSR leaders. During those  discussions we wanted to find out what possibilities there are  to establish a coalition government and a parliamentary  majority, and to work out a new ruling program.    [Mesenschi] How are relations between the CNSRL-Fratia,  Alfa- Cartel, and the BNS [National Trade Union Block] in terms  of new trade union activities?    [Ciorbea] In accordance with the decision made during the  latest meeting of the Executive Committee of our confederation,  we are cooperating with the Alfa-Cartel with a view to carrying  out certain joint activities. We noted with satisfaction the  change of date of the general strike announced by the  Alfa-Cartel, from 16 February to 28 February, as this has  allowed the actions of our confederations to take place  simultaneously. Similarly, we have agreed that if the general  strike on 28 February does not have the expected effect, in  March or April we will organize actions of greater scope such as  rallies and a march in Bucharest and other towns. We might also  organize a general strike by blocking roads, major arteries, etc.    For the time being, we are cooperating with the National  Trade Union Block so as to finalize the collective labor  contract for this year, a contract that the three confederations  CNSRL-Fratia, Cartel- Alfa, and the BNS wish to sign on behalf  of the trade unions. We would be pleased if the BNS  participated in the organization of other joint activities in  the coming period.    [Mesenschi] Mr. Ciorbea, please tell us what you think will  be the consequences of the establishment of a government that  would include the current parliamentary majority?    [Ciorbea] We hope that such a government will not be  established, because this is one of the goals of the 28 February  actions, to prevent such an act. The separation of the PDSR  from the PRM represented a positive sign in this respect. We  hope that a similar evolution will take place also regarding  relations with other extremist, nationalist, and anti-Semitic  parties. If, nevertheless, such a government were established,  it is certain that the reactions, at least on the international  plane, would be extremely unfavorable. There would even be a  very big question mark next to the approval of the Memorandum if  such a government were established. Similarly, the entire range  of Romania's foreign relations and actions aimed at integration  into European structures or NATO would be affected by such a  decision. Obviously, international reaction would also have  consequences for the domestic arena.    All these things also concern us, that is, trade unions,  because such actions will be reflected directly in the evolution  of the Romanian economy and the social and economic crisis in  our country.    [Mesenschi] How will you hold a dialogue with such a  government and how far will you go with your action in March or  April?    [Ciorbea] In accordance with the decisions passed by the  leading bodies of our confederation, we have not had, we do not  have, and we will not have any relations with extremist,  nationalist, or anti-Semitic parties. Thus, the problem of our  relations with such a government would become an extremely  serious problem, if we were to accept a dialogue or negotiations  with an executive that includes such a formula. Obviously, our  actions planned for March or April would be more aggressive if  the executive opted for such a formula. I believe that our  actions would reach extreme limits.    [Mesenschi] What do you mean by reaching extreme limits?    [Ciorbea] To stop the establishment of such a government.  If, nevertheless, it were to be established, our actions would  be directed toward dissolving such a government and replacing it  with another one, based on a new parliamentary majority and a  new program, which I mentioned before.    [Mesenschi] There has been much talk about the possible  presence of the CNSRL-Fratia leaders at the helm of the Ministry  of Labor and Social Protection. What should trade union members  expect -- and not only they -- from a minister of labor who  comes from their ranks?    [Ciorbea] No doubt such an act would also have positive  aspects, but it would also involve certain risks, both for the  respective organization as well as for the person in question.  Among the advantages I could mention that the respective leader  would take all the necessary measures to establish the legal  basis for the tripartite leadership and social partnership, for  a new labor legislation, and for new rights for employees in the  industrial sectors and union members, which would be in  accordance with generally accepted European and international  standards. He would consider the trade union a serious partner  in the social dialogue and would immediately proceed to the  establishment of those triparty bodies, ensuring professional  retraining, and establishing a socioeconomic council, etc.    Similarly, such a leader would be concerned with ensuring  real and adequate social protection mainly for the most  disadvantaged strata of the population in this period of  transition, using all the available funds in that ministry to  maximum effect: the unemployment fund, social security, and  important sums that come from the PHARE [Economic Reconstruction  Aid for Poland and Hungary] program or from loans obtained from  the World Bank and the IMF. He would do all this to curb as  quickly as possible the substantial, even twofold, increase in  unemployment that is expected by the end of this year .    However, such a government would also take special risks  because it is certain that currently or in the near future, of  the ministries in our country, the Ministry of Labor will be the  one most difficult to manage because it is necessary to ensure  social protection while financial resources are limited as we  know.    [Mesenschi] In your view, is it possible that a political  pact, including a social pact as well, will be signed in the  current political situation?    [Ciorbea] If, by political pact we understand an accord  concluded with absolutely all the parliamentary parties, then my  answer is negative. I do not believe that there are adequate  conditions in this respect and, I repeat it, the break between  the PDSR and the PRM emphasizes the impossibility, at least for  the time being, of achieving such a pact.    On the other hand, it is very possible to conclude a  government pact based on a new parliamentary majority that at  the same time might include the necessary -- albeit not  sufficient -- conditions to begin negotiations regarding the  social pact that the country badly needs to overcome this period  of crisis.</p>

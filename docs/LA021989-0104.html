			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING THE GREEN IN AN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> Green! Green! Green! Boy, do I love Southern California when it's green!  </P> <P> I looked up at our downtown hills and they're green! Driving out Laguna Canyon  Road: Green! Village parks and lush neighborhood gardens: All green! The recent  rains may cause havoc on our highways, but the riot of green they add to open  space is a remarkable, beautiful sight.  </P> <P> I more fully appreciate the word greenbelt, and I'm delighted to read that  Laguna Greenbelt Inc. is the recipient of the 1989 David Gaines Award for  "sustained and effective action in defense of the environment," awarded by  California's oldest environmental lobbying group, the Planning and Conservation  League.  </P> <P> As the Laguna Greenbelt celebrates its 20th anniversary, the award is an honor  well-deserved. Congratulations to them and good luck in the continued fight to  keep Orange County green!  </P> <P> SHAREN HEATH  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

Japanese Parliamentary Vice Foreign  Minister Syozo Azuma and Peruvian Prime Minister and Foreign  Minister Efrain Gordenberg Schreiber exchanged documents on the  Japanese loan in Lima.    Azuma told Gordenberg the Japanese Government will provide  emergency relief materials worth 19 million yen to help the  victims of heavy rains, which have killed more than 71 people in  Peru. The loan, to be extended in coordination with the  Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), will be used for Peru's  program to improve and modernize the basic equipment in public  medical organizations which offer medical services to people on  low incomes, the officials said.    Because of the lack of basic medical equipment and funds,  there are insufficient medical services for such people in Peru,  and epidemics such as cholera and malaria are common in the  country.    The 30-year loan, with a 10-year grace period, carries an  annual interest rate of 3 percent. It brings the total amount  of Japanese loans extended to the Latin American nation to  153.87 billion yen, the officials said.    The emergency relief materials from Japan include blankets,  tents and medical goods, they said.    According to the officials, heavy rains have been falling on  the mountainous regions of Peru since mid-January. As of March  1, the subsequent floods and landslides had killed 71 people and  affected another 70,000.    The officials said the Peruvian Government has requested  emergency relief goods from Japan.</p>

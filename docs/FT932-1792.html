			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Magistrates' move on Ferruzzi criticised THE DECISION by Milan magistrates to open a file on the Ferruzzi debacle yesterday depressed share prices and provoked a hostile reaction from the Consob companies and stock market watchdog. The magistrates' step means that any future action by the committee of five creditor banks working on a rescue plan for the troubled group will be monitored by a special section of the Milan tribunal. It will concentrate on Ferruzzi's books to check for possible irregularities or infringements of company law. 'The judicial initiatives do not help a solution,' said Mr Enzo Berlanda, Consob's chairman. He also warned of the potential damage to Ferruzzi's image abroad. However, the magistrates' decision was welcomed by Italy's small savers' association. Its chairman, Mr Adamo Gentile, has written to Milan's chief public attorney, Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, expressing 'extreme satisfaction'. Many Milan dealers appeared to find Mr Borrelli's claim that the initiative was purely a reaction to recent events barely convincing. 'At the very least, the magistrates are sending a clear signal to Mediobanca that this time, things can't be done in the old way,' said one. However, enthusiasm for the magistrates' action was not universally shared, with some brokers criticising the move, ostensibly to protect small shareholders, as unnecessary meddling. 'They've already brought down the politicians, now they're looking elsewhere,' claimed one critic. Investors reacted with a new wave of sales of Ferruzzi group shares, reversing the partial recoveries of the second half of last week. Shares in the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company dropped 2.65 per cent to L636.2, while shares in Montedison, the main operating subsidiary, dropped 4.79 per cent to L894.</p>

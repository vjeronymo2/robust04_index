			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Boundaries all over the place - Ballot Box The case for getting on with the next review of constituency boundaries as soon as the general election is out of the way is overwhelming. As a look at the electoral registers shows, the difference in the size of the electorate from constituency to constituency can be more than two to one. It is a well-known fact that as a percentage of the population Scotland is over-represented in Westminster, but so is London. The two English constituencies with the smallest rolls are Kensington (42,327) and neighbouring Chelsea (42,549). A lot of the other low figures come from the capital: Greenwich (48,225) and Hendon South (48,816). Some of the London suburbs are also exceptionally low: for example, Surbiton (42,845) and Walthamstow (49,603). Edward Heath's constituency of Old Bexley and Sidcup has only 50,064. These figures are wildly out of line by any standards. The ideal size for a constituency electoral register is generally reckoned to be around 75,000, give or take local factors. The Isle of Wight, which is a special case, has the biggest with 101,492: the island is not quite large enough to be split. In the rest of England, the biggest constituency is Huntingdon (94,077) where the Tory candidate is John Major. By contrast, Margaret Thatcher would be facing an electorate of only 53,322 if she were standing again in her old London constituency of Finchley.</p>

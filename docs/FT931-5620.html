			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Fall in US new orders steeper than expected THE US Commerce Department yesterday reported a bigger than expected decline in new orders for manufactured goods in January. It is the latest in a string of reports pointing to a slowing in the pace of economic expansion from the robust growth of the fourth quarter of last year. State unemployment insurance claims also rose sharply in the week ending February 20, a sign that labour markets remain sluggish. New orders fell 1.3 per cent between December and January against expectations of a drop of less than 1 per cent. However, the decline mainly reflected weakness in the volatile aircraft sector and only partly offset the strong 6.1 per cent increase between November and December. Orders were 8.7 per cent higher than in January last year, suggesting that the outlook for manufacturing is improving, albeit erratically. Claims for unemployment insurance rose 26,000 to 351,000 in the week ended February 20, a surprisingly large increase given that the week included a public holiday. The weaker tone of economic reports has helped sustain a vigorous rally in bond markets but raised apprehension about the outlook for jobs, which remain scarce in spite of the rapid fourth quarter expansion. Analysts predicted that February employment figures, out today, would show a modest rise in payrolls of about 110,000, well below the increase normal in past recoveries and not sufficient to reduce the 7.1 per cent unemployment rate significantly.</p>

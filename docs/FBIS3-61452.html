			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. F. Evdokimov, A. S. Ogir, Zh. P. Zhuravlev; </F> UDC 534.8:534.7.4]    [Abstract] Discrete mathematical models of hologram  descriptions are examined. They are based on phase dependencies  of the Frenel integrated transform and use raster  representations of holograms and objects in the form of  unidimensional hologram projections of acoustic sections of  objects. Raster representations allow two dimensional quasi  holograms to be processed in a computer by using special  unidimensional high-speed procedures, as well as coordinated  filtration methods. Ways to form hologram descriptions in the  Frenel zone are examined, which is fundamental for modelling  acoustic holography problems. Figure 1; references 7.</p>

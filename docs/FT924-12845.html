			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Sterling on trial ALL EYES will be on sterling this morning to see whether the resilience displayed on Friday, in the face of a one point cut in base rates, can be sustained, writes Emma Tucker. Most are expecting the currency to fall further over the week as the market takes stock of the poor economic outlook in Britain together with base rates now 1 1/2 points below Germany's Lombard rate. 'The cut signalled a recognition by the government of the seriousness of the economic situation, but we still need further cuts,' said Mr David Coleman, treasury adviser at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. The market is fairly convinced that more reductions are ahead and the sterling futures market is discounting base rates of 7 per cent by the end of year. However, it is still not clear how much importance the government is attaching to the exchange rate. Many are forecasting another cut around the time of the Autumn statement, but Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Montagu thinks rates have fallen as far as they are going to this year. 'Unless the government can surprise the market by seriously undercutting spending plans in the Autumn Statement, I doubt they will be able to cut rates again with a weak exchange rate,' he said. The dollar, which shrugged off Friday's poor trade figures, may come under further pressure this week as the presidential election campaign enters its last stretch. A Governor Clinton victory has mixed implications for the dollar. Higher government spending could upset the dollar, but more robust economic growth might mean the Federal Reserve delays another rate cut.</p>

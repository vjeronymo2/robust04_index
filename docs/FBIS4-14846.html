			<p>BFN     [Text] On 1 April, the Supreme Soviet Presidium held a  session chaired by Mechyslaw Hryb. The session discussed  questions related to the election of the Belarusian president.  A. Abramovich, chairman of the internal [as received] electoral  commission, presented a report to the session. A resolution on  organizing measures for preparing and holding presidential  elections was adopted. The Cabinet of Ministers as well as  executive committees of oblast councils were charged with the  task of immediately securing facilities, equipment,  transportation, and means of communication, which are necessary  for the normal work of electoral commissions. The Ministry of  Culture and Publishing should publish within a 10-day period a  mass edition of a brochure with the law on presidential  elections. The media founded with the participation of state  bodies, organizations, and institutions, as well as the media  partly sponsored by the state, were instructed to provide  presidential candidates with equal access for electoral  addresses and to widely inform the public about the electoral  campaign. In order to handle the organizational problems  emerging during the preparation for the presidential elections,  a working group was created, for which Vyacheslav Kuznyatsow,  first deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet, was appointed head.  The Supreme Soviet Presidium approved the proposals of the  Cabinet of Ministers to appoint Deputy Prime Minister Syarhey  Linh as minister of economy of the Republic of Belarus;  Alyaksandr Stalyarow as chairman of the State Committee for  Broadcasting; Anatol Butevich as minister of culture and  publishing; and A. Darafeyew as minister of natural resources  and environmental protection. Other issues were also discussed.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effects of Critical Habitat Designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires for any proposed or final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation that designates critical habitat a brief description and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modify such habitat or may be affected by such designation. At the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of preparation of the revised proposed rule, the Service identified the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following list of proposed or ongoing actions whose effects likely would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardize the delta smelt and adversely modify or destroy its critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat_Central Valley Project operations, State Water Project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations, deep water navigation channel dredging, reoperation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Folsom Dam, Oroville Dam, and Auburn Dam, Central Valley and State Water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Project Wheeling Purchase Agreement, San Joaquin Valley Drainage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program, Central Valley Project water contract renewals, petition by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bureau for a change in diversion point, South Delta Water Management,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Delta Temporary Barriers Project, Stanislaus-Calaveras River Basin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water Use Program, Phases 3 and 4 of the Suisun Marsh Project, North  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delta Water Management Project, West Delta Water Management Project,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delta Wetlands Water Storage Project, Los Banos Grandes Reservoir, Los  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vaqueros Reservoir, Kern Water Bank, full operation of four State Water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Project pumps, entrainment of fish and thermal pollution by industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., power generation facilities), urban or agricultural nonpoint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminant discharges, in-Delta and Suisun Marsh water diversion, Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 of the Coastal Aqueduct, and the Delta Levee Subvention Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since publication of the revised proposed rule, the Service has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined through section 7 consultations that the South Delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Temporary Barriers Project, deep water navigation channel dredging, Los  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vaqueros Reservoir Project, and Phase 2 of the Coastal Aqueduct Project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not jeopardize the delta smelt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule to revise the critical habitat designation did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify any proposed actions that might jeopardize the delta smelt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without adversely affecting critical habitat. In the revised proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, the Service did identify (based on section 7 consultation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experiences) five activities that, depending on the season of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction and scale of the project, might result in the destruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or adverse modification of critical habitat without necessarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardizing the continued existence of the delta smelt. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities were: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Sand and gravel extraction in river channels or marshes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Diking wetlands for conversion to farmland and dredging to maintain these dikes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Levee maintenance and bank-protection activities, such as riprapping, removal of vegetation, and placement of dredged materials on levees of banks;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Bridge and marina construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Construction and implementation of each of these five actions requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorization by the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) pursuant to section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and section 404 of the CWA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore are considered Federal actions. In a section 7 consultation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Bureau and the California Department of Fish and Game,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California Department of Water Resources (DWR), the Service reviewed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure for effects on delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt. As a result, DWR and the Bureau sponsored an investigation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effects of the operation of the Structure on delta smelt, and DWR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed to operate the gates only as required to meet existing Suisun  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marsh salinity standards. When not operating, the gates on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Structure will remain in the raised position. The effect of gate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation on delta smelt is currently being studied, and the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will make a determination on the Structure's operations in the near  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future. As to the other actions, the Service will consult with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corps as these actions arise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 4, 1994, subsequent to the publication of the January 6,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994, revised proposed rule to designate critical habitat, the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmitted to the Bureau a jeopardy biological opinion on the combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of the Federal and State Water Projects on the delta smelt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through February 1995. In the 1994 biological opinion, the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that the proposed operation of the Federal and State Water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects likely would jeopardize the continued existence of the delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt and would destroy or adversely modify proposed critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This one-year opinion did not recommend a reasonable and prudent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative that distinguished between the number of days of compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the 2 ppt criteria to avoid jeopardy and the number of days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance that would have been required to avoid destruction or adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification of proposed critical habitat. The Service acknowledges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that such a distinction may be appropriate in future biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opinions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any possible revisions to the biological opinion will recognize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three major initiatives that will shape the dynamics of future estuarine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions for delta smelt. First, in accordance with a Framework  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agreement (1994) between the Governor's Water Policy Council of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State of California (Council) and Club Fed, the State Board will seek  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement with DWR and the U.S. Department of the Interior to operate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SWP and CVP to make an equitable contribution to meeting the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water quality standards beginning calendar year 1995. The Board will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seek this agreement while they are working on a water rights decision to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocate responsibility among water rights holders in the Bay-Delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> watershed. Second, section 7(a)(1) of the Act imposes an affirmative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation on Federal agencies to carry out programs for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation (recovery) of listed species. With the forthcoming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuance of a Delta Native Fishes Recovery Plan, currently in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation, the Service expects that local, State, and Federal agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will fulfill their responsibilities by assisting in the completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tasks and objectives in the plan. Third, and related to number two, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled renewal of water contracts (i.e., reopened or expired Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licenses, expired CVP water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts) will provide an additional opportunity under sections 7(a)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 7(a)(2) of the Act to implement Recovery Plan objectives and meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's water quality standards. Collectively, these initiatives likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will result in a phased improvement to water quality based habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for the delta smelt. Accordingly, the Service anticipates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that adverse modification or destruction of critical habitat will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoided by operation of the CVP, SWP, and other water management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities with implementation of the above described initiatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Consideration of Economic and Other Factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to consider economic and other relevant impacts of specifying any particular area to be included within the critical habitat boundary. EPA, in coordination with the Service, included an analysis of the effects of designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt in its draft Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for its proposed water quality standards. A summary of that analysis was provided in the revised proposed rule designating critical habitat for the delta smelt (59 FR 852).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service stated in the revised proposed rule that if the final economic analysis substantially differed from the draft analysis summarized in the revised proposed rule, a revised analysis would be made available for public comment. No opportunity for public comment was afforded because the results of the final economic analysis do not substantially differ from the results of the draft analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's economic analysis assumes that the economic impact of restricting activities associated with construction and implementation of major water projects would be attributable to the jeopardy standard imposed by listing the delta smelt as a threatened species, as opposed to designation of critical habitat. Specifically, the impacts of designating critical habitat are in addition to the economic and other impacts attributable to (1) listing of the species, (2) economic effects resulting from conservation actions taken by other Federal agencies under section 7(a)(1) of the Act, and (3) regulatory actions required by other laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

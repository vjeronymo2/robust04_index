			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda: Martino on Conditions for </F> Sending Troops"]    [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, June 22 -- Italian Foreign Minister  Antonio Martino, speaking during a break in a Senate Foreign  Affairs Committee hearing this morning, specified the conditions  under which this country would consider sending troops to an  international peace force to Rwanda.    The United Nations would have to vote a request for peace  keeping forces under the command of the Western European Union  [WEU] or of NATO, Martino said. And to guarantee that force's  effectiveness, it would have to be based on an accord among the  national forces being deployed, the Foreign Minister added.    "Under those conditions we may even consider sending troops,  but if those conditions do not hold, we will end up with a  unilateral initiative," Martino added.    The decision taken Monday [20 June] by the WEU in Brussels  to  send French troops backed by "logistical support" on the part of  Great Britain, Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg "is a move in the  right direction," the Foreign Minister said.    "It involves international coordination, which gives us the  guarantee this is not a unilateral initiative but a multilateral  effort that puts the emphasis on the humanitarian aspect of the  mission," he told reporters, adding he thought it was possible  the WEU-sponsored mission "could put an end to the massacres."    "What we were worried about was a unilateral move that would  have had a neocolonialist flavor and would have aggravated  rather than reduced tensions."    The Italian government had urged the broadest possible  participation among WEU nations. [passage omitted]</p>

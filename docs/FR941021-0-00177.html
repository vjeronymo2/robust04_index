To this end, in preparation for the WRC, ITU-Radiocommunications Study Group Task Groups 8/3 and 4/5 are attempting to define spectrum requirements, to identify available frequencies and to evaluate sharing possibilities with existing and future users of the band. When these Groups complete their work in December of this year, both will prepare Reports to the Conference Preparatory Meeting (CPM)&hyph;95. These Reports will form the basis for the CPM's Report to WRC&hyph;95 on feeder links, which will be the technical basis for international decisions regarding feeder links and the International Table of Allocations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 168. Since the frequencies to be used for LEO feeder links may also be used by GSO satellites, Task Group 4/5 is studying the sharing potential between LEO and GSO satellites in all FSS allocations between 3 and 31 GHz. These studies have indicated that certain FSS frequency bands are used more extensively by GSO FSS systems and other radio services and that these bands are therefore less likely candidates for LEO MSS feeder links due to sharing difficulties. In bands at or below 15 GHz, the 5000&hyph;5250 GHz and 15.4&hyph;15.7 GHz frequencies appear to be promising candidates for reallocation for LEO feeder links. <FOOTCITE>214</FOOTCITE>  Task Group 4/5 has also studied the interference created by antenna beam coupling between GSO earth stations and LEO satellite stations, <FOOTCITE>215</FOOTCITE>  and is exploring ways to reduce interference through a variety of coordination procedures, including geographic exclusion zones, reverse band operation, and dedicated frequency allocations for LEO satellite feeder link use. When these studies are completed, we will have an indication as to which bands may be recommended and, hopefully, made available internationally for MSS feeder links at WRC&hyph;95. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 214 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Task Group 4/5 forwarded a preliminary study to TG 8/3 that identified the 5000&hyph;5250 GHz and 15.4&hyph;15.7 GHz bands as strong candidates for Non-GSO Earth-to-space feeder links. The study indicated that TG 4/5 was of the preliminary view that sharing of non-GSO feeder links (both downlinks and uplinks) with Aeronautical Radionavigation Services (ARNS) in these bands appeared feasible, since the interference to microwave landing system (MLS) receivers would be within the assumed permissible levels. ICAO, at Task Group 8/3, objected to this study, but further analysis is underway and the bands are still being considered as possibilities within these international forums. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 215 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Antenna beam coupling occurs when a LEO satellite passes below a GSO satellite and crosses into the transmission path of an earth station to the GSO satellite. At that point, the transmission beams from the LEO satellite and the earth station will intersect. If the LEO and GSO systems are operating in the same frequency band, this ``coupling'' will produce significant interference for very short durations of time when the earth station, LEO and GSO satellites form a straight line. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 169. Nevertheless, as we stated in the Notice, we will not allow the uncertain availability of bands below 15 GHz to delay the licensing and implementation of Big LEO systems. Consequently, if sufficient spectrum is made available at 20/30 GHz to accommodate all Big LEO licensees before bands below 15 GHz are identified, we will authorize all licensees in the 20/30 GHz band, recognizing that several applicants will be faced with substantial system design and service concept modifications. We will continue, however, to pursue bands at and below 15 GHz for Big LEO feeder links, and will allow licensees to modify their licenses to request operational authority in any new bands if, and when, they become available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

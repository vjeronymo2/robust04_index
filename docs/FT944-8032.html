			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Technology: Keeping better tabs on truancy The widespread truancy highlighted in today's educational league tables is likely to heighten the debate in schools about the use of electronic technology to monitor pupils' attendance records. Merely checking up on pupils more rigorously can make substantial cuts in truancy figures, according to research by the Truancy Unit at the University of North London. Nearly two-thirds of truants would not skip lessons if they believed there was a risk of getting caught. Monitoring systems such as swipe cards and electronic registries are seen by many teachers as expensive, complex and unproven. But the schools that have pioneered their use are frequently enthusiastic about them. Don Vickers, head of Hesketh Fletcher High School in Manchester, reports that truancy rates have declined dramatically since the introduction of an electronic register in September 1993. This system, which was produced by Bromcom, a Kent-based computer company, supplies the teacher with a small computer in an A4-sized folder instead of a paper attendance register. The computer folder includes a radio transmitter and receiver, which transmits data to a radio tranceiver unit mounted on a nearby wall or roof. These units, the number of which depend on the layout of the school, are linked to a PC in the school's office. The system has been installed in 80 schools at an average cost of around Pounds 20,000. The advantage of this system is that it reduces teachers' administration, allows regular and more accurate monitoring of absences and produces letters to parents about the absence quickly. It also allows the school to check attendance at every class, cutting down truancy after pupils have registered.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Asean under pressure to speed the pace of trade liberalisation: Prospects following the Apec talks To judge by the behaviour of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, at last week's Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Jakarta, one might think that Asean, the six-nation south-east Asian group to which his country belongs, was in disarray. Dr Mahathir took the gloss off the occasion by expressing public doubts about the plan by Apec, the 18-nation trade forum, to free trade and investment in the Pacific Rim by 2020. That cannot have pleased his host, President Suharto of Indonesia, a fellow Asean leader, who had set great store by agreement on this. Had this been a meeting of the European Union the recriminations might have reverberated for weeks. Yet it is a measure of both the strength and the weakness of Asean that there is scarcely a hint of embarrassment. Asean countries, which also include Singapore, Thailand, Brunei and the Philippines, are used to the pragmatic view of consensus which characterised Jakarta. Apec's other 12 members may find that this continues to affect the pace at which they can move forward. The essence of Asean's philosophy is that its members avoid coercion and collaborate only when they perceive it as being in their national interest to do so. This is in stark contrast to the way others, such as the US, see Apec. They regard it as a vehicle for cajoling governments to bargain away some sovereign rights for the sake of the general good. Mr Hadi Soesastro of Indonesia's Centre for Strategic and International Studies admits that Asean's lowest-common-denominator approach has produced a 'dismal' record on economic co-operation, but he says that, by shying away from internal tension, Asean has come to enjoy a 'great sense of togetherness'. Moreover, with a population of 340m, a fast-growing economy and an import market of Dollars 226bn (Pounds 138bn) Asean has assumed considerable economic significance. 'Asean is an entity that nobody can just push aside,' says Ms Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's trade minister. Founded in response to the communist threat at the time of the Vietnam war, Asean had security matters as its main original concerns - typical for a group of small countries. Over the years its collaboration has extended both formally and informally to a wide range of activities. Asean has endorsed the policy of constructive engagement with the military regime in Burma, which is most heavily promoted by Thailand and Singapore. With the end of the cold war, it has sought to refocus the debate on security through its regional forum which encompasses a range of international dialogue partners. Now it is also trying to put together its own free trade area, an effort often dismissed by outsiders because it is basically confined to tariff reduction and is peppered with exceptions. Even after the sweeping tariff cuts in its recent budget, Malaysia still affords heavy protection to its domestic car industry. Indonesia is reluctant to expose its petrochemical and aerospace industries to full international competition. If the bad news for Apec is that Asean is likely to resist outside pressure to speed the pace of regional trade liberalisation, the good news is that it shows signs of doing so for internal reasons. Already Asean has added non-processed agricultural goods to the products covered by its free trade talks and it is reducing the time-frame for liberalisation. 'We might be seen to be rather partial and weak, but we are making progress,' says Mr Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thai deputy foreign minister. Among the factors pushing Asean forward is the gradual re-emergence of Indochina. Asean will not only find itself competing with cheap labour from this quarter, but will also come under pressure to broaden its membership, starting probably next year with Vietnam. Overarching the debate will be a need to offset the growing economic and political power of China. According to Mr Richard Grant of London's Royal Institute of International Affairs, pressure from the private sector at home, as well as the perceived success of the North American Free Trade Agreement, will also drive Asean's own liberalisation process faster than many now expect. Within seven to 10 years a 'fairly complex' arrangement could be in place. There is no guarantee, though, that the group will then warm to Apec's ambitious programme. Some argue that Asean's involvement in Apec mostly reflects a desire to dilute the influence of China and Japan in the region. Like the regional security forum, the intention is that it should remain little more than a talking shop. But the risk in the trade policy area is that another powerful member, the US, will come to dominate proceedings. That goes a long way to explain both Malaysia's ambivalence and the predilection of most Asean countries for pushing any binding decisions back to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the new World Trade Organisation. After all, the multilateral forum is where the influence of big brothers is most greatly diluted.</p>

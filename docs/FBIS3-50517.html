			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 28  November 1993 on page 5 reports that the El Caracol Enterprise,  which was turned over to 100 workers in 1990, still employs all  100 employees, who receive as benefits a basic market basket,  transportation, a uniform, shoes, and medical care. The market  basket includes 20 pounds of rice, 20 pounds of sugar, six bars  of soap, 10 pounds of beans, and a gallon of oil. The article  reports that workers earn between 600 and 900 cordobas per  month. According to Ronaldo Rodriguez, president of the  enterprise's board of directors, El Caracol sells 130,000 to  170,000 pounds of grain per month, and has set a goal of 200,000  pounds for December.    Managua BARRICADA of 6 December 1993 on page 14 reports that  the footwear factory Rolter will be shut down temporarily due to  financial problems caused by smuggling and taxes. Assistant  Manager Francisco Lacayo explains that the factory cannot  compete with smugglers who pay no import tax while the factory  is forced to pay a 17-percent sales tax to Managua City Hall.  Lacayo says that the tax is "excessively high" for a product  which is included in the basic market basket. According to the  article, the enterprise's 240 workers, most of whom are single  mothers, understand the factory "is going through hard times"  and hope that it will reopen in a few months.</p>

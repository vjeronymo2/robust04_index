			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy deal hits Enterprise A BOUGHT deal involving the purchase and sale of a 2.1 per cent stake in Enterprise Oil, regarded as the UK's leading independent oil exploration and production company, triggered a steep decline in the share price. After opening on a relatively steady note at 343p, Enterprise dropped as news of the placing filtered into the market. The 2.1 per cent block, some 9.6m shares, was bought by broker Hoare Govett from a single UK institution and placed with a number of Hoare's institutional clients. Hoare said it had placed the shares at 318p each and that no corporate holders had been involved on either the buying or selling side of the deal. The placing took only 20 minutes, according to the broker. The Seaq ticker revealed that a block of 9.6m Enterprise shares had been traded at 315 1/2 p, indicating that Hoare took a 2 1/2 p a share turn on the block. At worst the shares touched 323p, before finishing a net 21 down at 324p. Turnover, almost entirely accounted for by the bought deal, reached 20m. The seller was not revealed but specialists ruled out Elf Aquitaine, the French oil concern, which has a substantial holding of Enterprise shares via its Elf-Enterprise joint venture. Norwich Union, with an 8 per cent stake (36.7m shares) was seen as a possible seller, as was Prudential, with a 4.9 per cent interest (22.3m shares). On the other hand, Schroders, with 3.39 per cent (15.5m shares), was believed to be a firm holder. Among other investment institutions, Gartmore was suggested as a possible seller of Enterprise stock. Rank sold Not even confirmation of the disposal of one of its London hotels could lift the recent gloom that has descended on Rank Organisation, and the slide in the shares continued apace yesterday, this time caused by a profits downgrading from broker BZW. Following Tuesday's downgrading by Kleinwort Benson, BZW yesterday shaved its current year forecast by Pounds 14m to Pounds 246m and cut the following year's figure by Pounds 35m to Pounds 285m, 'to take account of the tougher outlook for leisure in the UK'. Ms Jane Anscombe at BZW, however, believes the recent falls in Rank have been overdone, as have worries over the balance sheet, and said: 'We are actually buyers at these levels.' The shares closed 14 lower at 477p after brisk trade of 1.7m. Rank confirmed that it had sold its Athenaeum central London hotel for what analysts believe to be Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m. Tarmac drops A thoroughly demoralised building sector provided the market's weakest individual performer in building materials and contracting group Tarmac, which dropped 9, about 14 per cent, to 56p, the lowest level since the mid-1980s. Almost 11m Tarmac shares changed hands, making them the market's third most heavily traded stock. The latest bout of selling pressure was said to have been triggered by Kleinwort Benson, the stockbroker, which was said to have pencilled in a loss of around Pounds 15m for this year. Abbey National was prominent in the banks sector, with hints of a broker buy recommendation said to have triggered an advance of 7 to 270p. Sun Alliance softened 2 to 222p in front of today's interim figures, which are expected to show a loss of between Pounds 115m and Pounds 165m. The electricity distribution companies tumbled as private investors sold their stock ahead of the final 70p call on the shares due on September 15. The Electricity Package was under pressure in front of Friday's cessation of trading, closing Pounds 100 down at Pounds 3055, with dealers detecting signs of sizeable overseas selling, particularly from the US. Among the individual electricity stocks, Midland fell 14 to 306p on heavy turnover of 3.6m, while Yorkshire and London each lost 13 to 353p and 286p respectively. Dealers feared that the big institutional deal in Enterprise Oil might spark a similar trend in other UK oil independents. It was remembered that the Clyde Petroleum share price had suffered as a result of similar institutional activity earlier this year. Along with Clyde, Goal, Premier and Monument Oil &amp; Gas were viewed as potentially vulnerable to the recent retreat by crude oil prices, when the latter are seen in sterling terms. The severe weakness of the dollar has left sterling oil prices at around their lowest for some 20 years, according to oil analysts. Lasmo shares, given a severe mauling by the market since the group won control of Ultramar, eased 2 to 129p. A stock overhang and worries that the poor late summer weather in the UK will affect full-year profits at Cadbury Schweppes combined to depress the shares, which ended 8 down at 421p. Ladbroke Group was in demand ahead of today's half-year statement and moved forward 5 to 148p. Granada Group appreciated 6 to 243p. Housebuilders continued to attract determined selling across the board, with Wilson Bowden, scheduled to reveal interims this morning, a further 6 lower at 226p. George Wimpey, reporting half-time results next Tuesday, slipped 2 to a low for the year of 83p as dealers pondered the possibility of a cut in the dividend. Owners Abroad, still depressed by the recent Smith New Court profits downgrade, continued to languish and finished 2 cheaper at 54p. Demand from the US was said to have been the reason for an advance by British Airways of 10 to 234p on turnover of 3.4m shares. A trader shopping for around 250,000 shares in IMI caused a squeeze in the stock, which moved ahead 7 to 239p. Siebe gained 6 at 581p. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is said to have a positive view on both stocks. An initial decline in British Aerospace was followed by a strong rise, with brokers Kleinwort Benson and SG Warburg reported to have shown a keen interest in the shares. They were eventually 12 ahead at 217p after turnover of 1.4m. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (6).

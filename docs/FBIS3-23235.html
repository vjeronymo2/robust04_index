Your newspaper published a frontpage  report on Saturday 5 March 1994 headlined "Abu-'Ammar [PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat] Orders Not To Retaliate" which says that  sources close to the Hamas Movement told you that the  Palestinian leadership hopes Hamas will not carry out any  military operations at present, and that Hamas has halfheartedly  responded to this request.    We emphasize that this report is baseless and that all  information contained in this report is a total fabrication.    No contacts have taken place between our movement and the  Palestinian leadership on retaliation for the Hebron massacre.  Our movement's policy is clear and open. it calls for strong  and decisive retaliation against the holy Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre and revenge for the martyrs' blood.    Our position has always rejected the Oslo and Cairo  agreements, and this fully conflicts with the published report.    While we wish that you would check such information through  contacting the known Hamas representatives in the future, we  hope that you will publish this clarification in the same place  in which that report was published.

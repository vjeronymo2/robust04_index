			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Problems of meeting the all-seater deadline  -Soccer club funding following the Taylor Report NO SOONER has West Ham United football club announced considerable sweeteners to help sell its unpopular bonds, than another first division club is contemplating putting its toe in these uncertain waters. Leeds United, lying second in the first division, is considering raising Pounds 3m by selling bonds at Pounds 500 each. The amount is modest compared with the Pounds 16.5m sought by Arsenal and the Pounds 11m to Pounds 15.5m target at West Ham. It will hope to follow in the footsteps of Glasgow Rangers, so far the only football bond scheme to nearly sell out. But the experience of West Ham, where little more than 1,000 of the 19,300 bonds have been sold, shows how this form of fund-raising can run into trouble. Debenture bonds give fans the right to seats at favourable prices - but still at rather more than they pay to stand. They have been issued mainly to raise money for stadium improvements required after the Taylor Report into the Hillsborough disaster. It has been estimated that the building work could cost the 93 clubs in the English league a total of Pounds 360m. Grants from the Football Trust are so far expected to total about Pounds 150m. With a ceiling of Pounds 2m on individual grants, the shortfall at Arsenal, for instance, is more than Pounds 20m. The Hammers Bond was the third such scheme launched by a football club. It followed success at Rangers, but a cool reception for Arsenal's Pounds 16.5m effort, which is 40 per cent sold after eight months. In West Ham's case, not only did the original offer flop, but the protests included a large and angry demonstration on the pitch after one Saturday afternoon match. Mr Graham Watson, a financial adviser to all three issues, as well as to the Pounds 36.7m Murrayfield debenture for the Scottish Rubgy Union, said: 'West Ham went into a period of playing badly and the bond has become a scapegoat for all sorts of things.' It illustrated the 'intangibles' that had to be taken into account when setting up these issues. 'You learn from each one. There were bound to be some teething troubles.' West Ham's original scheme differed from the other two in some important respects. At 19,300, the number of bonds far outstripped the other issues and they accounted for a high proportion of the average gate of 23,000. The plan was to spread the cost of redeveloping Upton Park across all the fans, throughout the ground. Both Arsenal and Rangers attached their bonds to particular stands. The Hammers Bond was, however, cheaper than the other two at between Pounds 500 and Pounds 975, whereas Rangers' was Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 1,650 and Arsenal's Pounds 1,100 or Pounds 1,500. To a West Ham or Arsenal supporter, paying perhaps Pounds 6 to stand behind the goal, these sums looked high. Rangers, on the other hand, put a new tier on the stand at the side of the pitch, cashing in on an excess demand for better seats. With average gates below the ground capacity, neither Arsenal's nor West Ham's bond offer could exert anything like the pull of, say, England's international rugby programme. At Twickenham, which has just put another 11,000 bonds on sale at Pounds 2,000 each for 10 years (much shorter than the football clubs'), more than 200,000 applications are received for 60,000 tickets to see big internationals. Arsenal has the advantage that new impetus may be provided next season when construction work will reduce the capacity to 29,000, below the 33,000 average gate. Mr Watson said that this should provide a new impetus to the bond, which has suffered because of delays in getting planning permission for the new stand. The amounts that both Arsenal and West Ham are attempting to raise always looked ambitious. Manchester United, the best supported club in England, raised less than Pounds 5m from the public as part of its flotation last year. Tottenham Hotspur's change of ownership and rescue has sucked in more than Pounds 10m, but most of it came from the traditional source of a rich individual's pocket. Nevertheless, the normally cautious Bank of Scotland was prepared to underwrite 87 per cent of Arsenal's issue and 75 per cent of West Ham's. To breathe new life into its scheme, West Ham is now offering bondholders up to Pounds 100 off season tickets. Leeds has gone for this approach from the start, proposing this level of reduction for seven years. As Manchester United has pointed out, however, this means sacrificing future revenue. Its burden will instead be the dividend payment. For smaller, less profitable clubs, public or private share issues seem impracticable. West Ham said the short time limit on acceptances and the need to meet a minimum subscription level meant these options were not viable. The problem gains urgency against the background of losses made by many clubs and their existing debt. Mr Simon Pitt, a management consultant, has just published a survey which puts the combined debt of the English league clubs at between Pounds 90m and Pounds 130m. Mr Watson said that the 'harsh facts of financial life' had yet to come home to many clubs. To find the money for stadium redevelopment, either players' transfer fees and wages would have to come down or fans would have to pay up. Assuming that the growing lobby for a relaxation of the Taylor requirements does not succeed, bonds will in fact remain one of the less difficult ways for clubs to raise some money over the couple of years that remain before the all-seater deadline.</p>

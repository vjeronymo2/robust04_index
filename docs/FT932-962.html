			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: ML now in profit after Pounds 11m loss ML HOLDINGS, the loss-making aerospace, defence and electronics group which launched a rescue rights issue in January, yesterday confirmed that it was now trading profitably. As flagged at the time of the Pounds 14.3m rights issue, substantial provisions increased losses in the year to March 31. Turnover was flat at Pounds 84.9m but the pre-tax deficit rose from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 11.2m. Losses per share emerged at 18.4p (8.6p). There was no dividend. Under FRS 3, the pre-tax loss was swollen by provisions totalling Pounds 7.9m, marginally more than expected at the time of the cash call. The workforce fell by 15 per cent to 1,300 over the year, and the provisions included Pounds 3.5m for redundancy payments and surplus capacity costs. Mr Howard Grant, who joined ML as chief executive in September from BTR, the conglomerate, said the cost base had now been brought in line with market conditions and he did not envisage any more big job losses. ML wrote off Pounds 1.1m on stock provisions, Pounds 800,000 on product line closures and Pounds 1.1m in settlement of a long-running legal action over a hovercraft supply contract. In addition the value of certain properties was written down by Pounds 1.4m. The rights issue proceeds cut gearing from 114 per cent to 60 per cent. Mr Grant said the group had strengthened both management and board and also introduced stricter controls in finance contracting and pricing. ML suffered severe cash pressures during the second half of the year, as its bankers had reduced credit available. This limited the ability of some subsidiaries to procure materials and load their factories efficiently. Customer service suffered and consequently losses mounted rapidly. The group incurred extra costs of Pounds 600,000, comprising legal fees, costs of the rights issue and compensation for Mr Peter Pollock, who departed as chief executive last June.</p>

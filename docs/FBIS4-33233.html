			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Joint statement issued by Constitutional Court president, </F> Council of State president, and the prosecutor general of the  Republic in Santa Fe de Bogota on 27 May]    [Text] Meeting in Santa Fe de Bogota today, 27 May 1994,  and taking into account the need to uphold and reaffirm one of  the fundamental principles of the state of law, we declare:    First -- The normal functions of democratic institutions  impose absolute respect to the constitutional principle that  establishes the separation of state branches, legislative,  executive, and judicial. Anything that infers a disavowal of  the independence of one of those branches is against the  Constitution.    Second -- We reaffirm, now and always, the judicial branch's  independence and ability to act in accordance with the exclusive  authority the Constitution assigns to it. We praise the respect  and observance used to express disagreement with one of its  decisions which, although debatable, must not be attacked by  turning the public against the institution that dictated it, as  has been done by certain government officials whom the  Constitution and the law have not given such attributes.    Third -- The Constitution includes its reform and the  mechanisms to be used to this end. Institutional stability is  not furthered when each time an authorized judicial branch  official makes a decision that does not satisfy certain  interests, proposals to change the Constitution are made so as  to invalidate the decision.    [Signed] Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango Mejia,  Council of State President Amado Gutierrez, and Prosecutor  General of the Republic Gustavo de Greiff Restrepo.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Roh sacks intelligence chief SOUTH KOREAN President Roh Tae Woo yesterday fired his intelligence chief and replaced three cabinet ministers in the aftermath of a humiliating parliamentary election defeat, AP reports from Seoul. The action followed an opposition demand that Mr Roh sack his entire 23-member cabinet and issue a public apology for alleged vote-rigging in last week's elections. Mr Roh's ruling Democratic Liberal Party lost its majority by one seat in the March 24 elections, widely seen as a prelude to presidential voting later this year. The DLP had controlled nearly two-thirds of seats in the 299-member parliament. In the shake-up, the first since last December, Mr Lee Sang-hyon, home minister, replaced Mr Suh Dong-kwon as chief of the agency for National Security Planning (NSP), the main government intelligence organisation. Mr Lee Dong-ho, a provincial governor, succeeded the outgoing home minister, whose job includes control of the 130,000-member police. Mr Kang Hyon-wook was named agriculture and fisheries minister and Mr Noh Won-il is the new transport minister. Officials said the NSP was the only cabinet-level post directly held responsible for election-related disputes. The agency is suspected of having been deeply involved in illegal campaigning.</p>

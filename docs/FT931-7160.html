			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Spain warns of tax on currency speculators THE governor of the Bank of Spain, Mr Luis Angel Rojo, issued a veiled warning yesterday that measures to restrict short-term currency speculation could be reintroduced if the peseta continued to come under pressure on the foreign exchanges. His remarks to the economy committee of the Madrid parliament came as the peseta appreciated against the D-Mark following what dealers said was the third successive day of large-scale intervention by the Bank of Spain. 'We do not want to return once more to administrative measures (against speculators),' Mr Rojo said, 'but I must tell you that there is a thinking under way which says that some sort of tax should be established against short-term speculation. We have not used the measures because we hope the situation will not become alarming.' Last September, at the height of the currency turmoil within the exchange rate mechanism, Spain introduced emergency measures that effectively froze trading in the peseta. The measures caused sharp selling on the domestic equity and debt market, and were largely lifted within two weeks. Dealers yesterday said that the governor, by referring to a special 'tax', could have had in mind a streamlined version of the measures which would apply only to one- to three-day peseta swap operations. They said money traders selling pesetas 'short' might be forced to deposit with the Bank of Spain a sum equivalent to the day's transactions at an interest free rate and for a period of up to a year. The Bank of Spain was estimated by some dealers to have spent some Dollars 5bn, or just over 10 per cent of Spain's reserves, defending the peseta since pressure built up against the currency late last week. Late yesterday the peseta had appreciated to Pta72.04 to the D-Mark against Tuesday's closing rate of Pta72.54.</p>

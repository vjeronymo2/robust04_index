			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (9): A dream becomes a reality - . . . Hand-held PCs EVER SINCE the personal computer first appeared, the technology has held out the prospect of eventually making the hardware small enough to hold a complete system in your hand. This year, that dream looks like eventually becoming a reality. There are those that would argue that such machines have been around for some time, with the UK company, Psion, being amongst the market leaders. Small note-keeping, diary managing products have had their drawbacks, however. They have had limited functionality, often complicated connectivity to other systems such as desktop PCs and, most important of all perhaps, the restrictions of a small keyboard. The technology has moved on, however, and it is now possible to move away from the keyboard as the prime input device and on to the next goal: direct, on-screen, handwritten input and the use of icons to control system functions. This is much more a direct copy of the way people normally work with, say, a paper-based personal organiser, and as such is the first time that systems can be small enough and functionally rich enough to contemplate their use as a direct replacement for them. Already generally referred to by the name first used by Apple - Personal Digital Assistants, or PDAs - the early examples made their initial appearance last year. Apple's PDA, called Newton, was demonstrated as a marketing exercise rather than a real product, but though the company has shown it several times at various events, a saleable version has not yet appeared. Others, particularly Japanese companies such as Sharp and Kyocera, have also announced varying degrees commitment to the new PDA marketplace, though little has yet appeared. The latest, most aggressive and possibly first attack on the market with a real product available in volume comes from Amstrad. The company claims it will have its PDA600 PenPad in the shops by May, and at a price of Pounds 299, including VAT, it is certainly aggressively placed to attack a currently over-hyped but largely non-existent competition. The features of the PenPad are broadly representative of what most suppliers are planning. Small size and low weight are, of course, de rigueur. At 400 gms it is claimed to be lighter and smaller than most loose-leaf organisers. The key feature is the ability to input instructions and information by writing directly onto the screen with a special stylus. Amstrad claims that, once the machine has learned to read a user's handwriting, information entered in this way can be converted into machine-readable text. If the information is not textual, for example a hand-drawn sketch, this can be stored 'as is.' Accessing the particular function needed, such as the Diary or Address Book, is achieved by 'pressing' the appropriate icon on the display with the stylus. The Pen Pad is said to be able to store a maximum of 5,000 'pages' of information when the memory is expanded to its upper limits. There are, obviously, limitations with such systems, and handwriting is one. The Pen Pad, for example, can recognise both upper and lower case letters, but it cannot yet work with 'joined up' writing. Each character has to be entered to a separate box, just as found on many paper forms, and will undoubtedly take some getting used to. The upside of this is that, once captured, the information stays far more legible than a long-forgotten handwritten note may do. Connectivity, particularly to a desktop PC, is another key capability which all the competitors must address. According to Amstrad, software is coming to allow communications between them, in both directions. There is also said to be a range of additional applications coming, such as word processing, spreadsheet and reference guides. These will be sold on the credit card-sized PCMCIA cards already broadly accepted as the standard vehicle for loading applications, expanding available memory and adding additional functions such as modem-based communications. The idea is that the user plugs in the appropriate card to gain the new functionality required. Though some cards, such as memory and function cards, may be useable across all types of PDA that utilise the PCMCIA interface standard, applications cards will probably be geared to use with a particular type of machine. This could be a problem for applications developers, for the market potential for PDAs is estimated to be huge. AT&amp;T, for example, predicts that some a billion units will have been sold by the turn of the century. The company has two direct interests in this market. The first is its new Hobbit processor chip family, specifically developed to be at the heart of other suppliers' PDA offerings; even a 1 per cent share of this would mean sales of 10m processors over the next seven years. The second and most important interest, however, is that AT&amp;T sees PDAs being the vehicle for a far wider range of services than storing personally generated personal information. Communications through cellular telephone networks, for example, would bring the user direct access to wide-ranging information sources. The users would not just make a note to book an airline ticket, they would access a worldwide communication and information service such as CompuServe and make the reservation direct. They could then dial-up an information service such as Reuters, and gain direct access to stock market prices that need to be processed in the spreadsheet. The results could integrated into a report which is then faxed to the individual the user is planning to visit. That is the goal: all that functionality in a handheld, personal system. That level of functionality is still some way off, but the basis of such a machine, the Model T version of it, is now starting to appear.</p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Sharp rise in Pakistani shares SHARES on the Karachi Stock Exchange yesterday recorded their highest rise on any single day this year. The KSE-100 index rose 44.63 to close at 1399.68. The surge came amid expectations that last Thursday's devaluation of the rupee would improve textile profits by boosting exports. Almost a third of the 652 companies on the KSE are in textiles, which have suffered heavy losses over the past year. The market was also lifted by confidence in Mr Moeen Qureshi, a former vice president of the World Bank who became interim prime minister last Sunday. He is expected to negotiate new loans worth Dollars 2.5bn from a consortium at a Paris meeting in September and a Dollars 1bn loan from the IMF under the extended structural adjustment facility. Mr Amin Umer, a KSE broker, said he expected the momentum to continue. Other brokers echoed this, forecasting that bullish sentiment could continue until the run-up to the October elections. Before leaving for Washington yesterday, Mr Qureshi denied reports that Pakistan was seeking a moratorium on its Dollars 18.5bn foreign debt. He also denied that foreign exchange reserves had fallen sharply. 'In the last few days, foreign exchange reserves have risen significantly,' he said, without giving a figure. A donor consortium meeting in April was called off by Pakistan after Mr Nawaz Sharif's government was sacked, amid fears that donors would not make fresh commitments because of concern over reversal of economic reforms. But Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, and Mr Sharif, the main contenders in the election, favour similar policies of free market reforms.</p>

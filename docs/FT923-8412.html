			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Support fails to buoy rubber RUBBER TRADERS remain unconvinced that prices will climb despite buying at the end of last week by the International Natural Rubber Organisation's buffer stock manager. Inro bought in 4,000 to 8,000 tonnes of Malaysian rubber and an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 tonnes of Indonesian rubber. It was the first time the buffer stock manager had intervened in the market since last December. Traders said that while Inro's action might have prevented a further fall in prices, there was little optimism that market conditions would improve in the short term. Prices for Malaysian rubber are now about 220 Malaysian cents a kilogram, compared with 228 cents a year ago. 'There is still weak demand,' said one trader. 'Factories in the main markets are closing for holidays plus there is no sign of a pick-up in car sales - which means tyre demand is down.' Traders say prices have been helped by purchases by the CIS and China.</p>

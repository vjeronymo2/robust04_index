			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Karadzic warns of Moslem offensive The Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, accused Moslems yesterday of having launched a new military offensive. He warned them to stop it or risk losing territory they might have recovered by negotiations, Reuter reports from Belgrade. Mr Karadzic told a meeting of his Serbian Democratic party, in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka, a big spring offensive, which he claimed had already begun, must be broken. 'If the Moslems continue this, I will order a counter-offensive and then they will not be able to get territory they might get through political negotiations,' he was quoted by Tanjug news agency as saying. 'There is no way anyway that they can get territory on which they are now killing our people,' he added. The Bosnian government-controlled radio has reported that the Moslem-led government army has recaptured some territory from the Serbs around Tesanj and Teslik in north-central Bosnia. UN officials in Sarajevo said on Saturday there was heavy fighting in the area, but could not confirm reports of Bosnian gains. Government and Croatian forces are no longer fighting each other after agreement to form a Bosnian Moslem-Croat federation, but the Serbs have refused to join it.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Argentina fails to please an international audience - A lack of vigour in Buenos Aires Argentina, recently, has disappointed international investors who expected to profit from exposure to one of Latin America's new miracle economies. After quintupling in 1991 the equity market dropped 48 per cent in the second half of 1992; and 1993, so far, has given punters no cause for celebration. The Buenos Aires stock market's Merval index has dipped by 5 per cent this year, yet the economy is expanding by 5 per cent, after 8.5 per cent growth in 1992. Brokers, optimistic as ever, are predicting that the bear phase is over. For once, they may be right. They are hoping that the simultaneous flotation and partial privatisation on July 8 of YPF, Argentina's state-owned oil giant, will kick-start the equities market. The government has earmarked a maximum of 35 per cent of YPF for the local and international investment market. YPF is to be floated in Buenos Aires, New York and London. Federal and local governments, pensioners and unions will own the remaining 65 per cent of the equity. The government, conscious of its responsibility for helping torpedo the stock market last year with a viciously overpriced telecoms flotation, has decided to float YPF at a relatively competitive price. Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, aims to place YPF at only 10 times earnings. In comparison, the market values Astra, a small independent oil producer, on a p/e ratio of 11. Enthusiastic brokers are saying YPF could well be oversubscribed. If all goes well, a resurgent stock market would soon start attracting investors and prices would recover. However, a successful gamble on YPF is not going to solve all the market's problems. Mr Pedro Lacoste, a partner of Alpha, a consulting firm, says: 'There are few companies that are in a good (market) sector, which have a good management strategy, which are well run, with transparent accounts and good dividend policies.' He reckons that there are perhaps no more than five such stocks among the market's actively traded companies. They include two privatised telephone stocks, two banks and the textile company Alpargatas. Smaller, possibly more interesting, companies are plagued by illiquidity. This is why an increasing number of observers are saying that the future of the market depends less on the performance of existing stocks and more on an infusion of new blood. Low share prices have discouraged more than a handful of companies from taking the plunge and going public, even though about 30 have already won regulatory approval for a listing. A strong performance by YPF would help overcome their doubts and tempt them to enter the market. Price and liquidity are not the only problems. Foreign investors also complain bitterly about the lack of transparency in company accounts and suspect even blue chip firms of concealing profits from minority shareholders. Then there is the problem of absorbing a huge overhang of shares bought by highly leveraged players during the 1992 boom. These speculators, mostly small investors, dump shares bought at the top of the market at any sign of price recovery. The most notorious victim is Telecom Argentina, the privatised telephone company floated in 1992, whose share price nosedived by one-third soon after its market debut. Telecom's dreadful performance helped bring last year's bull run to a grinding halt. Another casualty is CIADEA, a car company which makes Renault models under licence. Mr Manuel Antelo, CIADEA's president, reckons his company is worth about USDollars 50 per share - against Dollars 27 now. Last year CIADEA shares were changing hands at above Dollars 70. The narrow Buenos Aires market is highly susceptible to speculative plays by a small clique of well-informed insiders. More listings are unlikely to make much difference to this casino mentality. Foreigners and locals alike say Argentina badly lacks strong institutional investors such as insurance companies or investment funds to give the market liquidity, breadth and stability. Government draft legislation, which would introduce a private pension fund system, has been bogged down for almost a year in Congress, where politicians are gradually watering down the original proposals.</p>

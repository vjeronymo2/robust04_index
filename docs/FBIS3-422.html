			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>   "Crumbling of the Freedom Alliance" -- The Johannesburg  SUNDAY TIMES in English on 6 March in a page-22 editorial states  that "the crumbling of the Freedom Alliance on Friday has  demonstrated the relentless power of the underlying political  forces that are reshaping this country: neither the Inkatha  Freedom Party, nor the white right wing, and least of all  Bophuthatswana, can withstand the pressure." "The immediate  source of pressure, of course, is the election, with its  necessary deadlines." "However, the truly relentless pressures  lie deeper, beyond the reach of mere politicians, and it has  been these underlying pressures that came into play, especially  in Bophuthatswana, this week." "The people who have all but  brought down Mangope's regime are South Africa's hidden actors.  They are million of ordinary black folk who destroyed  apartheid, and in whose hands the destiny of South Africa  lies.....they, and not President de Klerk and his reformers,  ended apartheid." In conclusion the paper writes that "South  Africa needs only political stability and reasonably sensible  economic policies to burst out of the stagnation of the past  three decades, and the elections are the first, necessary, step  towards stability. At the same time, there is an vital role for  men like Chief Buthelezi and General Viljoen to play in  fashioning the final constitution, in curbing the lust for power  which is evident in the ANC [African National Congress], and in  ensuring representation for the widest range of views in  Parliament. Welcome them to the fray."  <H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>   IFP Registration for Election -- "Inkatha Freedom Party  (IFP)  leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's decision to `provisionally'  register for the elections, should be treated with caution,"  begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 6 March in a  page-6 editorial. "It should be remembered that before his  meeting with ANC leader, Nelson Mandela, he shot down the whole  idea of participating in the elections." Buthelezi's  "vacillation" "simply deepens the opinion of political observers  who have found Buthelezi to be a man who is simply interested in  shifting goalposts to avoid the elections at all costs.  Creating an uncertainty about the future has been one of the  effective instruments in creating tension in the black  townships. This has also planted fertile seeds of political  violence and wanton criminal acts of lawlessness." "While the  ANC's commitment to an all-inclusive settlement is commendable,  Buthelezi should not be allowed to delay the long-awaited  elections for his personal reasons." "ANC and the government  should not bend over backwards for Buthelezi anymore. Now is  the time to go forward with or without him."    TEC Standstill Criticized -- In a second editorial on the  same page, the SUNDAY NATION reports that "with less than two  months to go before the April 27 election, the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC] seems unable to perform its tasks  adequately." "As things stand now, the TEC has been unable to  reassure people in Bophuthatswana and kwaZulu-Natal about"  whether or not they will be able to vote. Additionally, items  brought before the TEC are "never finalised immediately after  presentation. They are often referred to later sittings.  Occasionally the TEC has had to wait until certain situations  were out of control before taking a decision." Concluding the  SUNDAY NATION writes that "the TEC really needs to jack up if we  are to continue having confidence in it. We want to believe  that there is no better structure to turn to during this  transition. But the TEC should sharpen its teeth and take its  rightful place in the hearts of our people."  <H6>  RAPPORT </H6>   ANC Propaganda Machine Running Out of Steam -- A page-22  editorial in RAPPORT of 6 March in Afrikaans writes that in the  Western Cape the ANC "is no longer so talkative, and in Natal  this week it was dealt two stiff blows." President F. W. de  Klerk's visit to this province and the type of reception  accorded him should be something that not only Mr. Nelson  Mandela "should sit up and take note of, but also the communist  archenemy, Mr. Harry Gwala. Even those opinion polls that  predict a runaway victory for the ANC have been more cautious  lately. The premature ANC choruses of demands and those big  promises also seem to have taken -- hopefully for good -- a back  seat." Mr. de Klerk's campaigning had resounding successes  among the Indian and colored populations in Natal where he made  no attempt to glorify the National Party's past mistakes, but  instead asked for forgiveness. "But," he asked, "has the ANC  ever said sorry for its wrong deeds? Has it become a new  party?" The second blow for the ANC was Mr. Mandela's meeting  with Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The ANC propaganda machine had  tried to make it appear as if it were the biggest gesture of  reconciliation and a victory for Mr. Mandela. "With dubious  success." It is no longer a question of what did Mr. Mandela  say to Mr. Buthelezi to change his mind, but rather "what did  Mr. Buthelezi say to Mr. Mandela to make him sing a different  tune?" Mr. Mandela's grim face after the meeting told a story.  "The shrewd Mr. Buthelezi had unmasked Mr. Mandela and the  ANC's propaganda."</p>

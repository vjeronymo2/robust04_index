			<p>BFN     [Text] During a news conference by the National Peasant  Christian-Democratic Party [PNTCD] today, the leadership of that  party termed the proposal made by the PL-93 [Liberal Party-1993]  on converting the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] into a  single political party as, quote, a game and a diversion. The  melting of all the groupings belonging to the CDR into a unique  party may actually be interpreted as the efforts of certain  people with dictatorial tendencies, unquote, [PNCTD Chairman]  Corneliu Coposu emphasized, adding that the unification of  parties is made on the basis of the fusion of their interests  rather than on the basis of decrees.    Furthermore, Coposu remarked that the PL-93 proposal may  also  be interpreted as an attempt by that party to divert attention  from the need to reestablish the unity of the liberal movement.    Answering a question related to a statement he had made in  Paris in connection with the form of government in Romania, the  PNTCD chairman confirmed that he had made a statement  emphasizing that, in his opinion, at present the solution for  salvaging Romania would be the restoration of the monarchic  principle. We consider that King Mihai is the sole personality  having the vocation able to concentrate the sympathy and the  aspirations of the Romanian people, Coposu said, also mentioning  that despite the fact that the PNTCD did not vote in favor of  the Constitution, it will observe its stipulations as long as it  is valid. However, this does not exclude the PNTCD's intent to  alter it if it wins the majority in parliament, the PNTCD  chairman added.    Talking about other issues, Coposu commented on the  adherence  of the Romanian Mining Trade Union Confederation to the  principles of Christian democracy, expressing his hope that  future visits by the miners to PNTCD headquarters will be in  accordance with those principles.    Regarding the program for public investments that was  discussed during the 28 May cabinet meeting, Senator Radu Vasile  stressed that the PNTCD will support this idea of furthering  economic revival, provided that the investments in question are  earmarked for works of national interests, our correspondent  Elena Perdichi reports.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Europe launches friendly invasion of US - Laurie Morse examines the appearance in Chicago of the FT-SE 100 index THE launch today of the FT-SE 100 index on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and a corresponding option contract on the Chicago Board Options Exchange is seen as the first wave of a friendly invasion of the US by European-based index futures products. US investors are increasingly buying foreign equities, a trend that US futures exchanges have been quick to capitalise on in their scramble to diversify and maintain their share of global financial trade. The New York-based Comex will begin trading futures on the European Options Exchange's index of most actively-traded European stocks, the Eurotop 100, on October 26, with the American Stock Exchange offering options on the index. US exchanges are also eyeing Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40, waiting for trading and regulatory climates in those countries to ripen to a point where US-based contracts will be feas-ible. The success of the US derivatives on these foreign markets will depend on whether institutional investors find them more profitable and convenient to trade than home-based varieties. US futures exchanges are betting that fund managers will be attracted by their lower costs, familiar trading hours, dollar-denomination, plus familiar American regulations and settlement procedures. In contrast, the big international trading houses - which have global trading capacities and prefer older and deeper markets abroad - are less likely to be tempted. Mr Roger Clarke, president of Los Angeles-based TSA Capital Management, a consulting firm which advises pension fund managers, says that less than 5 per cent of pension fund assets are currently invested in foreign equities. Like others, he expects that to rise to 15 to 20 per cent among more aggressive funds. 'Indexes are a natural way to get that foreign exposure,' he says. Since the US-based contracts are valued in dollars, they also let a fund manager invest in a particular country without taking a position in tumultuous foreign currency markets. But US contracts are expected to be only a moderate success. If the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's two-year-old Nikkei-250 stock index future is an example, strong name recognition, an active underlying stock market and an enthusiastic investment community produce only tepid results. While traders say they have no trouble executing large trades in the CME's Nikkei pit, volume levels are not consistent. The Chicago Board of Trade's stab at the Japanese market, in the form of Topix futures, fizzled out, partly because it was valued in yen rather than dollars. Traders say the new US FT-SE and Eurotop futures are likely to face the same handicap that hobbles the Nikkei. The underlying stocks will be open only for a fraction of the futures trading day, making arbitrage between the cash and futures market difficult. Extended trading days are planned by Amex and Comex to compensate for this problem. 'Trading a stock index future while the cash market is closed is like making a bet on how the (foreign) stocks will open the next morning. There's a lot of risk in that,' a Chicago trader noted. Also, Wall Street analysts say the Eurotop does not have enough name recognition in the retail community to spark interest, and a pan-European index has limited appeal to institutional investors. 'Our clients want to be able to invest in the economies of individual countries. Mixing them up in a cross-European index confuses the currency, political and economic differences,' said TSA's Mr Clarke. The Amex's rival, the Chicago Board Options exchange, came to a similar conclusion when it shelved plans for options on a European stock index called the Eurotrack 100. It has instead turned to launching options on stocks of individual countries. The US-based FT-SE 100 contracts will begin on a stronger footing. The decision by the sometimes warring CME and CBOE to join forces and offer FT-SE futures and options together, with beneficial arrangements on trading fees, will make the product simultaneously available to the two exchange's huge crowds of experienced stock index traders. Options trading generally helps boost futures volume. Trades that bet on economic differences between countries could also develop, since the contract size and other specifications for the CME's Footsie futures are similar to those for the exchange's Nikkei and S and P 500 futures, and could encourage spread trading.</p>

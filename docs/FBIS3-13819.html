			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Likud Knesset faction has requested an urgent  plenum debate, during the Pesah recess, in order to discuss what  it described as the government's far-reaching concessions, which  endanger the status of Jerusalem and disregard the security  needs of the Jewish settlement in Hebron.    Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Knesset Member  David  Mena' has handed the Knesset speaker a list with the 30  signatures required in order to convene the plenum during the  recess.    The NRP [National Religious Party] faction has announced  that  in reaction to Prime Minister Rabin's proposals, it will hold  its next meeting tomorrow in Hebron.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A visiting Arab League delegation, led by Major  General Muhammad Sa'id Bayraqdar, the Arab League assistant  secretary general for military affairs, this afternoon visited  the site where a missile exploded. The missile was fired by the  secessionist, rebellious gang of the Socialist Party last  Tuesday [10 May] on a densely populated quarter of the capital,  Sanaa.    The Arab League delegation saw the destruction caused by the  missile's explosion over the citizens' homes which fell over the  heads of their residents. They also saw the damage caused to  many neighboring houses.    The delegation listened to citizens on the material and  human  losses sustained in the explosion, which claimed the lives of 23  martyrs and left dozens others injured. This is in addition to  the panic caused for women, children, and old people who were  asleep the moment the missile of the secessionists exploded in  the capital of the unity state, targeting the lives of secure  civilians.</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Herbs are the answer - Barbecuing / Some tips for outdoor eating During my first year as a restaurateur, I spent very little time in the kitchen. This was partly because I was aware of the limitations of my culinary knowledge and partly because there were more pressing problems - mainly financial - to occupy me. Business was improving by the second year, however, and having failed miserably as a greeter, seater and waiter, I began to spend more time watching the chefs, especially Martin Lam, now chef/proprietor at Ransome's Dock in south-west London. Lam was so confident of the culinary gulf that separated us that he knew I would not interfere with his work and he was glad of an extra pair of watchful eyes as his brigade grappled with the problems of feeding 200 in 90 minutes from a basement kitchen. Later, to make myself useful during the lunch service, I worked as a grill chef, an area of the kitchen that does not require years of training in making sauces or stocks. There, I had a certain advantage because the cuts of meat and fillets of fish were prepared professionally for me. It became obvious quickly, though, that merely grilling meat or fish, however good the quality, will give neither the chef nor the customer much satisfaction. Lam believes passionately in the flavour-enhancing qualities of herbs. A good handful of any fresh herb, mixed liberally with olive oil into a marinade, can transform the main ingredient of a dish and convince the customer that this is something for which he must come back. Classic examples are fresh sage leaves with calf liver, rosemary with lamb, and thyme with everything from chicken to fish and red meat. Forget the lighter herbs, such as tarragon and chervil, but use plenty of marjoram and oregano with chicken and oily fish such as bass or mackerel. Shred basil on to meat or fish after it has been grilled. If you are barbecuing tuna steaks, make a basil butter including salt and pepper. Throw dried fennel stalks on to the fish on the barbecue at the last minute. With duck, it is better to use spices rather than herbs to bring out the flavours - rub on fivespice then marinade it in vegetable or sesame oil before barbecuing. It is through reading MFK Fisher, the American food writer, that I discovered a marinade for beef that is as successful for roasts as for grills. Marinate the beef in olive oil and rich soy sauce for 48 hours. Half an hour before cooking wash off the marinade, pat dry, and let the meat rest before it is cooked. In Australia, I learnt that with even the very freshest fish and seafood - possibly because it is so fresh - acidity is the key to the finest flavour. Marinate squid, crayfish, prawns or octopus in plenty of lemon or lime juice, crushed garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper and serve with a tomato relish. Ensure that any drinks you serve to accompany the meal stay chilled. In south-west France, I discovered what is, I believe, the finest medium for the barbecue. These are souches - ancient, gnarled vine roots available when vineyards are being replanted. They make wonderful, slow-burning firewood in winter and impart an extra layer of flavour to your barbecued food in summer. For the barbecue chef, the cooking process, including preparation and lighting, can be quite long. I have found the following recipe for potatoes, roasted with olive oil, rosemary and garlic salt, useful as it can be cooked in the oven while you are at the grill. It comes from The Classic Cuisine of the Italian Jews by Edda Servi Machlin (Giro Press New York) and goes wonderfully with grilled chicken, steak or fish. OVEN-COOKED POTATOES serves 6-8 Recipe: 8 large baking potatoes; 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary; 2 teaspoons garlic salt; 4 tablespoons olive oil; black pepper. Method: Peel the potatoes and cut lengthways into six pieces each. Place in a bowl and mix with rosemary leaves, garlic salt, oil and half a teaspoon black pepper, ensuring the potatoes are coated evenly. Place in the oven at 450`F for 25 minutes and then lower the temperature to 350`F for 45-60 minutes.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: HAPPY TAILS TO YOU  </P> <P> Morris the Cat is almost 13 -- nearly George Burns' age, in cat years -- and  he's going strong: a 1990 Morris the Cat calendar, public appearances,  continuing 9-Lives TV spots. Plus that new one for Kitten Dinners, in which  Morris makes a finicky comment about some talkative kitties. Said a 9-Lives  spokeswoman: "He's still very much in the media limelight."  </P> <P> Morris travels three months a year to 25 cities, drawing crowds at state fairs,  military bases, cat shows. etc. He did a segment of "Lifestyles of the Rich and  Famous" last year, was featured on "Entertainment Tonight" and appeared on  regional talk shows.  </P> <P> The original Morris died in 1978 at age 19. Both were found at animal shelters,  and Morris II hasn't forgotten his roots. He's the official spokescat for  "Adopt-a-Cat Month" each June, sponsored by 9-Lives and the American Humane  Assn. He also helps publicize Cat Health Month each September, which 9-Lives  sponsors with the American Veterinary Medical Assn.  </P> <P> His screen persona is no act, insisted the spokeswoman, who claimed to know  Morris personally.  </P> <P> "He really is finicky," she said.

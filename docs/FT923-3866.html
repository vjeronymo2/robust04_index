			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Commons defence group recalled THE cross-party defence committee of MPs has taken the rare step of deciding to meet during the parliamentary recess, to take evidence about the deployment of British forces in the Gulf and in the former Yugoslavia, Alison Smith writes. Just a week after Mr John Major dismissed a request from the Labour leadership to recall the Commons to discuss such issues, along with the economy, the Tory-dominated committee announced that it planned to question Mr Archie Hamilton, the armed forces minister, later this month. Meeting in the recess is not unprecedented for a Commons committee, but it is an unusual move which reflects the concern among MPs over the deployment of British troops. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the Tory chairman of the committee, denied that its decision was a criticism of the prime minister's refusal to bring MPs back to Westminster to debate foreign affairs. It was important for the committee to keep on top of the issue. Six British Tornado aircraft began taking part in the United Nations enforcement of the 'no fly' exclusion area in southern Iraq late last month. Some 1,800 British troops are ready to leave for Bosnia when the UN gives the signal.</p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Letter: Much closer to equality Sir, In his article, 'Delay for equality in senior jobs forecast' (January 19), David Goodhart reported me as saying that 'it would still take 25 years for women to achieve equality with men'. I certainly did say that it would take 25 years to ensure parity between men and women at work, but the 25 years I referred to was a forecast I had made in 1975, when I was deputy chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission. This forecast, as you will appreciate, brings us up to the year 2000, which is also the year Business in the Community's Opportunity 2000 has targeted in its campaign to improve the balance of men and women at all levels in the workforce. Elspeth Howe, chairman, Opportunity 2000, Business in the Community, 227A City Road, London EC1</p>

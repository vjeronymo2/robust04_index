			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Leading Article: Kohl's moment of truth WISE IMPERTURBABILITY or dangerous insouciance? Mr Helmut Kohl gained a well-deserved reputation for the former quality as he presided over the triumphant unification of Germany's two pieces two years ago. But in the last few days, with his governmental coalition facing a rash of internal squabbles and a spreading wave of labour unrest, the German chancellor's unruffled posture has begun to look more like the latter. Either his nerve is stronger than his current trade union opponents imagine, or he is riding for a fall that will have worrying consequences throughout Europe. The challenges are certainly daunting. The last time there were public-sector strikes on this scale was in 1974, and on that occasion - combined with a deep malaise in the centre-left coalition - they spelled the downfall of Chancellor Willy Brandt. In the past few weeks, Mr Kohl has lost three valued ministers; support for his CDU party is slipping in the polls; and his government is having increasing difficulty containing spending in the face of public sector pay demands and the rising costs of unification. It no longer seems fanciful to ask whether the strains will prove too great for the traditional, consensual ways of doing business in west Germany to bear. Unseemly jockeying It would be wrong to overdo the parallels with past crises. Undeniably, Mr Kohl's position has been weakened by the events of this week - especially the announcement by Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the veteran foreign minister, that he intends to step down next month and the unseemly jockeying between and within the coalition parties over the succession. Certainly this is unfortunate at a time when the government's top priority should be - through responsible fiscal behaviour and the Bundesbank's tight monetary policy - to tame inflation without plunging Germany into recession. But there should be no reason for the government to be brought down. Mr Kohl's smaller coalition partners, the FDP and the CSU, may chafe at the allocation of ministerial portfolios, but neither of them could seriously contemplate jumping ship to join forces with the opposition social democrats. The SPD is, if anything, in deeper disarray than the government parties. Moreover, the CDU may be unpopular in the polls just now, but it does not face any elections - at national or regional level - until 1994. As Mr Kohl is well aware, he has a breathing space of about 18 months in which to sort out his government's political and economic problems. Excessive burdens The important question is how he uses it. For if the chancellor is to complete the task he began with unification, and engineer the transition to a market economy in eastern Germany, without imposing excessive burdens on the west, he will need to break with the style in which he has governed up to now. The immediate imperative is to hold the line on public sector pay. No matter what pressure the unions apply, it would be immensely damaging if the government were to climb down now from its determination to keep wage rises below 5 per cent - in terms not just of public spending but also of the signal such a move would send to private sector negotiators, and to the Bundesbank. Beyond that, the government needs to develop a clear and decisive strategy for controlling its own finances in the face of the spiralling transfers to, and debts being amassed in, the east. Such a plan is more easily called for than elaborated, not least because the way revenues and expenditure are apportioned at present between the federal government and the Lander (many of them SPD-controlled) provides little incentive for spending reductions. But Mr Kohl has done it before, in happier times - it was he, after all, who presided over the marked reduction in Germany's budget deficit during the 1980s. Running as a common strand through these issues is the need for candour about the difficulties Germany now faces. The days are long gone when the chancellor could claim that unification would be complete in a matter of three to four years; everybody now knows it is a much deeper, costlier and more enduring challenge. Mr Kohl will not be able to meet that challenge on his own, but neither can it be overcome without him.</p>

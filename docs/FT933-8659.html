			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Unions urge motorists to spurn Shell CONSUMERS will be urged next week to boycott Shell petrol stations at the beginning of a campaign by oil industry workers against alleged union-busting. Oil industry unions have been heavily influenced by organised labour in the US and plan to use alternative tactics to the more traditional strikes, overtime bans and working to rule. The campaign will be launched on Wednesday to mobilise public sympathy against the oil companies, which the unions accuse of colluding to derecognise trade unionism. The initial focus will be Shell UK, which recently decided to withdraw, from September 3, union recognition from 360 process and craft workers at its Shell Haven refinery in Essex. Off-duty oil workers and others are to leaflet Shell petrol stations urging customers to boycott the company's products. Leaflets have already been distributed at Shell filling stations in Essex around the company's Haven refinery. 'Unions will never abandon their traditional use of the strike weapon as a last resort but we believe alternative forms of action exist that we can use to achieve our aims,' said Mr Fred Higgs, TGWU general union national official for the oil industry. 'We plan to apply pressure on Shell without resorting to a stoppage. Striking would play into the hands of the company which would then dismiss workers and avoid paying them redundancy,' he said. During the past two years there has been widespread union derecognition by other oil companies - most notably BP, Esso and Mobil. The five main unions in the industry - the TGWU, AEEU engineering and electrical union, MSF white-collar union, GMB general union and Ucatt construction union - believe there is a concerted attack. 'We are drawing the line at Shell,' said Mr Higgs. 'We have been forced to act.' Mr Higgs believes the new tactics could also be used by unions outside the oil industry as an alternative to strikes. The unions argue that the issue in the oil industry is about human rights, not just an industrial grievance. 'There is no other country in western Europe like Britain where employers can derecognise a trade union with impunity,' said Mr Higgs. 'If we allow this strategy by the oil companies to succeed it will be the beginning of the end for employee influence, decent wages and decent working conditions in the industry.' The TGWU is staging a conference on the issue on Wednesday. It will be attended by representatives from Liberty, the civil rights organisation, and the Brussels-based International Confederation of Chemical and Energy Workers. The unions have lobbied parliament, petitioned the European assembly in Strasbourg, and secured 150 MPs' signatures to an early-day motion in the Commons condemning the derecognition tactics of the oil companies. Trade union organisations around the world have written to Shell to complain. Shell UK yesterday denied collusion with other oil companies in derecognising unions. 'We make our decisions in the light of our own business circumstances,' it said. It refused to comment on the planned boycott.</p>

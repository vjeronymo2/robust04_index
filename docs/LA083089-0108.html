			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> SOME DON'T MIND SECOND FIDDLE ON CDS  </P> <P> Paul White studied the stacked spines of names and titles meticulously. A grin  spanned his face as he made a selection from the sea of sounds at the top of  the rack.  </P> <P> "You see this?" he asked, pointing to the Michael Jackson "Bad" compact disc he  displayed in his right hand. "Over there, in the new section, this cut is  $13.99.  </P> <P> "The same, exact CD is $8.99 in this section," he said with a chuckle. "That's  why I buy my CDs used. The extra five or six bucks I could save on this one  could go to buying me another."  </P> <P> </P> <P> From $2.99 to $8.99  </P> <P> It's a case of simple economics. While the price for the hottest, new compact  discs now ranges from $13.99 to $17.99 and up, used CDs can cost from $2.99 to  $8.99 at area shops.  </P> <P> "CDs (also) don't scratch like records," said Gregory Neal at CD Banzai in West  Los Angeles. "That's why you are seeing a lot of used-record buyers buying used  CDs now. The condition of the CD is more likely to be in better shape than an  album."  </P> <P> Besides their inherent resistance to wear and tear, CDs also produce a  remarkably clear, crisp sound; that sound-quality factor, combined with the  prospect of lower prices, has helped create a burgeoning used disc market,  experts say.  </P> <P> While not an entirely new phenomenon -- record stores have been selling and  buying used LPs since the dawn of the turntable -- the old idea applied in the  high-tech CD Age still makes dollars and sense.  </P> <P> "There is a large demand and supply for used CDs," said Rockaway Records  manager Marty Levy. "Most people are aware of the discrepancy between the cost  of an album and the cost of the disc and are looking for viable alternatives.  Used disc buyers are the types that will buy a used CD for the price they would  pay for a new LP."  </P> <P> Certainly, it's not always possible for collectors to immediately find used  copies of the latest, hot-selling discs; they may not find the range of  selections in used sections that they might find by buying new; and they don't  always get the advantages of the sleek packaging that accompanies some  releases.  </P> <P> But Mike Hash, an assistant manager at Compact Discount in WestLos Angeles,  sees other pluses, beside price, in buying used discs, which usually cost "only  about 60% of the price of a new CD."  </P> <P> Buyers of used CDs can, for example, "listen to the whole album" before their  purchase, and, because the packaging seals are broken on used CDs, they can  examine the discs' accompanying notes and paraphernalia, Hash said. At the  store where he works, there are "three CD players hooked up" to let buyers  scrutinize the quality of their pre-owned product.  </P> <P> The used market, Hash said, is "just more convenient in the long run."  </P> <P> Just because a CD is used doesn't, however, automatically guarantee its price  will fall. Rockaway Records carries used CDs costing up to $350. These special  items include rare concert albums, other unique collectibles or higher-quality  radio station recordings, said Rockaway Records manager Tom Phillipsen.  </P> <P> Quality is important to the CD consumer, explains Paul Rock of Aaron's Records  on Melrose. "I have seen people walk up to the counter and ask a lot of  questions about our used CDs. They want to know about quality. When we let them  listen to it, they can't believe they are getting that great a quality for the  discount price. And they end up buying a lot more CDs."  </P> <P> High turnover is what keeps most swap shops in business. Consumers walk in with  their old CDs, trade them in, then end up buying a new set of tunes. To  encourage this churn, Rockaway Records gives an additional 20% credit to CD  buyers who sell their merchandise for store credit instead of cash; Compact  Discount's trademark is to "buy six, get the seventh free," said Hash.  </P> <P> Industry analysts say the reduction in CD prices already has spurred sales of  players. Not that the devices aren't already hot. CD players, according to  industry estimates, now are in more than 14.5 million American homes; they have  increased sales from 1 million units in 1985 to an estimated 6.5 million by  this year's end, with a projected increase of 2.1 million more players above  that figure in 1990.  </P> <P> Unlike three or four years ago, when classical music made up much of the CD  market, compact discs now also can be found in abundance in the jazz, Top 40  and rock categories.  </P> <P> To potential customers, shops and savvy disc shoppers offer some simple advice  about buying used CDs: Let your ears and eyes beware.  </P> <P> "Listen to the quality of the disc itself," Hash recommended. "Examine the  playing side (the side opposite the label) for deep scratches, fingerprints and  debris. Usually light fingerprints and debris can be wiped off with a dry  cloth."  </P> <P> To get the best bargains, experienced buyers like White also insist that  shoppers must tune their routines to a fine art. White says he scouts stores  often, seeking to find just the discs he wants at just the right time and price  he wants them.  </P> <P> And, if he can't buy they immediately, he's not afraid to tuck them in less  obvious display spots until he can return.  </P> <P> "I have my secret hiding place . . . these are half price. . . right here,"  White says, as he peers to his left, then to his right.  </P> <P> "I didn't expect to buy anything. I had left my checkbook at home," he later  explained. "I hid (some discs) on the top row together and came back later to  get them. They were still there. What a deal! With the money I saved, I can go  out and buy $50 worth of groceries or something."  </P></p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India fears sugar crop will fall to 12m tonnes INDIA fears sugar production in the current season will be at least 10 per cent below target at a little over 12m tonnes, compared with a record 13.5m tonnes in the year to this September. Because of a prolonged dry spell at planting time, India will not only harvest a smaller cane crop, but in several states the crushing operation will be delayed by four to six weeks. Sugar mills will also have stiff competition for cane from indigenous manufacturers of sweeteners like gur and khandsari. The federal government is not worried by the shortfall since the current season's opening stock of 4.7m tonnes can satisfy four and a half months' domestic demand. India's domestic consumption of sugar, which is growing at an annual rate of 6 per cent to 7 per cent, was 11.4m tonnes in 1991-92. According to Mr Om Dhanuka, spokesman for the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), the shortfall in sugar production will not stand in the way of exports, which were begun in 1990-91. Mr G Patil, president of the National Federation of Co-operative Sugar Factories (NFCSF), has asked the government to release one million tonnes of sugar for export during 1992-93. Both ISMA and NFCSF argue foreign buyers will regard India as a 'serious and regular exporter of sugar' if it creates a buffer of at least one million tonnes. The Food and Civil Supplies Ministry agrees, but the final decision rests with the finance ministry.</p>

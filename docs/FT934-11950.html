			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (2): Record surge in new issues - International Bond Markets THE downward spiral in interest rates this year has helped to boost the volume of new issues in the international bond markets above the record level reached in 1992, and the upward trend is showing no signs of running out of steam. New volume stood at Dollars 301.25bn at the end of September, easily surpassing 1992's record total of Dollars 267.7bn, according to data from IFR Securities Data. The fall in interest rates has had a dual effect on the international bond markets, encouraging both borrowers and investors to participate actively. On the one hand, the lower interest rates have encouraged borrowers to lock in long-term financing at what many of them regard to be the bottom of the interest rate cycle. On the other, the erosion of returns on cash deposits has prompted investors to seek higher yields by investing in the bond market. Politics has also played its part in the surge of new issues. Several bouts of turmoil in the financial markets in 1992 and this year, due to uncertainty over the future of the European exchange rate mechanism, have forced some central banks in Europe and the Nordic region to intervene heavily to restore stability to their respective currencies. As a result, they have had to replenish their depleted foreign exchange reserves by borrowing in the international bond markets where they can raise large amounts very quickly. The Nordic countries have also had to increase their funding requirements to finance their yawning budget deficits. Their heavy borrowing programmes placed corporate borrowers from those countries at a severe disadvantage earlier in the year because they were forced to pay significant premiums over the spreads paid by sovereign issuers. However, now that a large part of the sovereign borrowing programmes has been completed, the spreads - that is, the premium over the yield on government bonds - paid by Nordic corporate borrowers have come down sharply. Corporate yield spreads have also tightened because demand for long-dated, non-government paper has far outstripped supply, particularly in the Eurosterling sector. According to SG Warburg Securities corporate unsecured index, the spread over UK government bonds for maturities of 10 years or more has fallen from 153 basis points at the end of 1992 to around 95 basis points. Long-dated paper is in demand because investors are having to look further along the yield curve to secure high yields, since they are no longer available at the short end. In the dollar sector, where yields have fallen to a 25-year low, supply of long-dated paper has fallen dramatically due to tha decision by the US Treasury to auction fewer 30-year bonds. In view of this demand, Italy gave a greater weighting to the 30-year than to the 10-year tranche of its first global bond offering, which was launched in September. Italy's global offering, which raised Dollars 5.5bn, set a record for this type of international bond deal, which permits issuers to tap the large US domestic bond market. The previous record of Dollars 3bn was held by the province of Ontario. The World Bank, which pioneered the global bond concept, has also been an active issuer of global bonds this year. In September, it issued its ninth dollar global bond offering which was priced to yield 10 basis points over the yield on underlying US Treasuries, the tightest spread the World Bank has achieved on its 10-year dollar global bonds. This partly reflected the general tightening of spreads in the market as well as the fact that the offering was significantly over-subscribed. However, the tight spread and the balanced distribution worldwide also show that the World Bank has achieved the main aims of its global bond programme which was launched four years ago. They were to achieve a truly global distribution and a single world price for its bonds. The World Bank has also issued global bonds in yen and expects to launch its first D-Mark global bond in the fourth quarter of this year. This year has also seen a large increase in the issuance of floating rate notes (FRNs) as issuers tap demand from investors for high-yielding instruments at a time of falling interest rates. According to IFR Securities Data, Dollars 45bn worth of floating rate notes were issued from January to mid-September, compared with Dollars 38bn for the whole of 1992. Most floating rate notes offer investors a way to achieve a higher income than they would receive from a fixed-rate bond because the notes tend to pay a premium over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). This year has also seen variations on the floating rate note. One instrument, the 'collared' FRN, has a minimum interest rate and a maximum interest rate. Under this structure, the holder receives a higher return than current money market rates but will not benefit if rates rise above the maximum interest rate set by the issuer. The 'reverse' FRN pays a higher return as interest rates fall. This is achieved by fixing the coupon at a certain interest rate minus Libor, therefore when Libor falls the coupon gets bigger. The activity in the international bond market has overshadowed efforts by individual countries to encourage more foreign borrowers to issue in their domestic markets. However, this process is continuing, principally in Spain and Japan. For example, the European Investment Bank recently gave a significant boost to the Matador market, Spain's domestic bond market for foreign borrowers, by launching a Pta40bn (Dollars 315m), three-year offering, the largest Matador to date. In the Far East, the Asian Development Bank has pioneered efforts to establish the 'dragon' bond market, in a bid to develop the capital markets in Asia and stimulate participation by the region's investment community. The ADB has launched two US-dollar dragon bonds since 1991 and earlier this year General Electric became the first corporate borrower to tap the market, which is targeted at non-Japanese investors in Asia.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> HIP GARB HAS A DEEP-ROOTED APPEAL  </P> <P> Nursing student Cookie Morris celebrated her birthday last year in a standard  cocktail dress. This year, she celebrated both her birthday and her heritage in  a custom-made, three-piece African outfit, topped by an elaborately braided,  gold-trimmed coif.  </P> <P> Following her lead, most of her guests "were dressed head-to-toe African," says  Morris, who explains she first went looking in mall shops for something with an  ethnic feel. Unable to find what she wanted, she headed for "the real thing" at  Beauty of Afrika, a little shop crammed with authentic masks, jewelry, fabrics  and clothing, on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Than a Fad  </P> <P> European designers and American fashion magazines may have made "ethnic" (as in  animal prints, sun-drenched colors, vibrant pattern mixes, heavy bangles and  beads, sarong skirts, batik and tie-dyed fabrics) a hot trend this year, but  among African-Americans, their ever-growing interest in wearing symbols of  their culture is more than a fad.  </P> <P> Blacks say they still can't wear dreadlocks or elaborate traditional clothing  in a corporate setting. But the current fashion trend makes it easier to dress  for work in sashes made of kente cloth (Ghanaian hand-woven fabric), armloads  of bangles, lappas (wrapped skirts), kufis (hats known as "crowns"), drummer  pants and contemporary clothing cut from vividly colored cloth.  </P> <P> Outside the gray-flannel world, anything from anti-apartheid leather medallions  to festive long dresses and matching head wraps are making the scene wherever  and whenever blacks want to look fashionable, dress comfortably and demonstrate  pride in their roots.  </P> <P> More and more, the meaningful clothing and accessories are turning up anywhere  from churches and schools to restaurants, clubs, reggae boat parties and  festivals, such as the Afrikan Culture Day, which is held monthly, and this  weekend's African Marketplace at James H. Whitworth Park (La Cienega Boulevard  and Fairfax Avenue), both in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Stores that for years have quietly specialized in Afrocentric items are finding  business better than ever. And all over the city, new designers and  entrepreneurs are suddenly on the scene, promoting African goods and culture.  </P> <P> Warren Daniel, organizer of both Afrikan Culture Day and the Afrikan Reggae  Boat Parties that go from Long Beach to Catalina Island, explains that he began  the activities after Black History Month this year "to raise the consciousness  of the African community as well as the European community we live in."  </P> <P> To properly promote black history, Daniel says, "something must be done on a  daily basis."  </P> <P> </P> <P> International Lecturer  </P> <P> "Black Americans are starting to reach for the culture. It's coming through in  their dress and their life style," explains Ahneva Ahneva, owner of Crowns and  Gowns, for which she designs $45-$1,500 contemporary clothing with an African  influence. As owner of Designers Network International, she has been kept busy  lately lecturing all over the world (including this year's African Liberation  Day at New York City University and L.A.'s Marketplace) on Africa's fashion  heritage.  </P> <P> At Cafe Afrique (in the Crenshaw District), owned by Safi and Kashif Shaheed,  specialties of the house are Carribbean-African cuisine and an ever-increasing  number of garments sold in the cafe's "little boutique." Priced from $25 for a  pair of tie-dyed drummer pants to $150 for an embroidered gown, the colorful,  "very traditional" clothing is designed by Safi and made in Liberia.  </P> <P> At Africana Imports on West Slauson Boulevard, owner Francesca Anuluoha has  been making clothing out of West African fabric for more than 15 years. But  now, she says, "I can't seem to make enough." Teen-agers, often influenced by  rap stars, start with patriotic leather medallions, "and move from that to  hats, tops, pants and books about their heritage." Prices range from $40 for a  dashiki (top) to $700 for a bubu (long formal dress).  </P> <P> Anuluoha's 14-year-old daughter, Nyambo, is required to wear a uniform to  school. But for parties, she likes to put on African clothing and jewelry and  symbols that show solidarity with blacks in South Africa.  </P> <P> Texas-born Afua Chinue Ifama has often stood out in the crowd in the  traditional African clothing she has worn for 35 years. Retired now, she was an  employee of a major California corporation, and she proudly wore her heritage  to work every day for 27 years. But it wasn't easy.  </P> <P> "People who didn't understand it couldn't accept it. They couldn't tell me not  to, but they did little things to make me uncomfortable," she recalls.  </P> <P> The clothing itself has always been comfortable and durable. Ifama has  15-year-old garments from Africana Imports that "don't go out of style. I get  compliments every time I walk out the door in them." And because she is "100%  traditional," she always wears a head wrap "partly because it's a religious  preference and partly because I think I look so darn good with it."  </P> <P> "The crown of the head is very sacred and that's why it is always covered,"  explains South Africa-born Delphine Wills-Martin, a bookkeeper who makes the  clothing and "crowns" she was selling at the most recent Afrikan Culture Day.  </P> <P> No matter the occasion, she always puts on something that reflects her  heritage, "even if it's just my jewelry or a hat or pants. To me, it's  important. As a black person, it says something about who I am."  </P> <P> Using African fabrics, she turns them into "clothing that's practical for the  office." A typical outfit might be "loose, comfortable pants with some type of  wrap top and a tailored jacket."  </P> <P> In the last month alone, requests for hats (traditionally worn by men but now a  fashion favorite with both sexes) and outfits have increased considerably.  "People are becoming more familiar and more educated about this type of dress.  They realize there is an alternative to what they can find in the department  stores."  </P> <P> And they solve a problem for Wills-Martin, who says: "I don't think Western  clothing is right for my body type. My hips are a lot bigger than my waist.  Trying to wear Levi's is ludicrous. I'm just making things that are meant for  me, that I've seen since I was a child."  </P> <P> But for Jo Keita and Vicki Beya, mixing European-inspired fashion with African  fabrics has turned into a lucrative business. Less than a year ago, the two  invested $1,000 and planned to work only part time on their venture, called  Nubian Princess. Now the unexpected demand for their garments, designed and  made in the Ivory Coast, has them talking about a future filled with an  extensive menswear line, a showroom and their own outlets.  </P> <P> Customers for their "African high fashion" include a number of black  celebrities who buy directly from Keita's home in Los Angeles. And at Sherie, a  boutique in Beverly Hills, owner Sherie Wright says the colorful, unusual  pieces sell well -- at $150 for a tie-dye shorts outfit, for example, or $370  for a three-piece outift -- to "middle-class Anglo-Saxons who are looking for  something different."  </P> <P> The current interest in ethnic clothing reminds many, such as African dance  teacher Tabula Adigun, of the '60s "when we wore the clothing of our  ancestors." She wears both head-to-toe traditional as well as a mix, which  might be a wrap skirt worn with a shirt, tie and boots.  </P> <P> As the fashion industry continues its ethnic bent, Adigun predicts: "We're  going to see more and more people with their hair wrapped in geles and wearing  lappas. If you have your head wrapped," she explains, "you have to stand up  proud."  </P> <P> But even something as small as a bracelet "makes a statement of some sort. You  either love the beauty of the work or it's part of your culture."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--A study prepared by the Arab  League has stressed that the decisions of the Uruguay round of  the GATT agreement will negatively affect the Arab countries in  the areas of development, economic growth, exports, and imports;  will shift the Arab trade balance in favor of the advanced  countries; and will increase the unemployment rate in the Arab  countries as a natural consequence of the liberalization of  international trade.    The study, which was prepared by the Arab League's General  Department of Economic Affairs, on the expected consequences of  the GATT agreement on the Arab economy, said that the outcome of  the principle of liberalization of international trade, which is  the basis of the agreement, will favor the industrial countries  whose products and services enjoy a superior level of quality.  It added that these countries will benefit from the  implementation of the agreement in tackling the unemployment  problem and increasing world demand for their products, and that  the world trade growth rate will increase in favor of these  countries.    The study then said that, according to the agreement's  clauses, special privileges will be granted to members of some  economic groupings--namely countries belonging to the EU's  Maastricht Treaty, the North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA), and the Rome Agreement.    It then explained that the deteriorating Arab growth rates  of  agricultural and industrial production confirm that the  consequences of implementing the agreement will not be in favor  of the Arab countries whose agricultural production represents  only 1.5 percent of the overall world agricultural production  while their industrial production represents only 0.5 percent of  world production.    The study pointed out that the price of agricultural and  food  products will treble as a result of the GATT decisions; this  will absorb a major part of the Arab countries' financial  revenues. It noted that current Arab agricultural imports total  around $21 billion annually.    It said that with the increase in the price of agricultural  imports, the deficit in the Arab balances of payments will  consequently increase; this will, in turn, lead to a similar  increase in the deficits of public budgets.    According to the agreement, agricultural subsidies for the  member countries' production will be repealed and hence the  (?Arab) countries will find themselves at a great disadvantage  vis-a-vis agricultural imports from abroad, as the price of  imported goods will be less than that of local Arab goods. This  threatens to destroy Arab agricultural production in the long  term unless advanced agricultural development is achieved.    The study called for developing systems of Arab  agricultural production, food security, and water availability  in the future to help the Arab states face outside competition.  The study highlighted the need to turn to agricultural  mechanization; improve agricultural packing, transportation,  storage, and marketing methods; cut back on consumption; and  eliminate agricultural waste in production, transportation, and  storage.    The study touched on the GATT's effects on Arab industrial  commodities. It pointed out that the Arab states will face  tough competition in the future in the field of industrial  products, particularly since raw materials represent a  considerable part of Arab exports. In the meantime, the major  industrial states endeavor to develop new alternatives to the  raw materials they obtain from the developing nations, something  that will weaken the competitive position of the Arab world. In  this regard, the study noted that the Arab states have  difficulty promoting Arab industrial products as an alternative  to foreign imports, except in limited areas. For instance, the  Arab world produces 10 million tons of iron annually, while the  Arab markets need more than 16 million tons.    The study emphasized that under the GATT agreement, a number  of Arab industries will be affected by tough international  competition, including petrochemicals, wooden products,  ready-made clothing, paper, printing, and publishing industries.  The study called for applying the rules of research and  development and introducing quality methods and world standards  on specifications to save Arab industries.    On the freeing of trade in services, the study noted that  this will result in unequal competition within the Arab markets  in the fields of banking, insurance, transportation, tourism,  communications, construction, cultural production, and aviation  because the Arab states are importers of services. Meanwhile,  these services are highly advanced in the developed nations.    The GATT has expanded the concept of world trade to include  government purchases, including purchases by the army, police,  local governments, and public utilities, in which the public  tenders will be subject to free world competition. Accordingly,  the advanced states will gain a larger share of government  tenders, which will amount to $100 billion in the year 2000, as  compared to $22 billion in 1990.    The study concluded that the Arab world will be greatly  affected in the fields of government purchases and tenders for  infrastructure and public sector projects. It also concluded  that the Arab states will incur losses in the short and medium  terms in the areas of agricultural and industrial production and  services, while the price of imported commodities is expected to  rise.    The study recommended the need to devise integrated and  modern economic and trade policies that rely on a common Arab  will to remedy the expected losses.    The GATT's decisions were issued during the Uruguay round  last December. There are 115 member states of the GATT and two  observer countries. Among the member states there are eight  Arab countries: Egypt, Bahrain, Tunisia, Kuwait, Mauritania,  Morocco, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.</p>

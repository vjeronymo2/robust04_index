			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Ministers hold key to Swans' EC funding SWAN HUNTER, the threat-ened Tyneside shipbuilder, can be considered for an intervention funding subsidy only if the government can prove the yard is of strategic military importance, the European Commission said yesterday. A delegation of Labour MPs, MEPs and shop stewards from the company, which has been in receivership since May, met Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, to press Swans' case for the 9 per cent EC subsidy on merchant shipbuilding orders. Swans' chances of finding a buyer could be enhanced by funding eligibility, and the delegation argued that Swans was the only European shipyard building merchant and naval ships without any subsidy. Until now the emphasis of the campaign has been to stress Swans' involvement in merchant shipbuilding, for which Continental shipyards have been able to claim intervention funding subsidies. The EC's stance at yesterday's meeting unexpectedly switched the emphasis to Swans' place in the UK's defence capability. Mr Alan Donnelly, Tyne and Wear's Labour MEP, said: 'The only condition that the EC will accept in granting subsidies to Swan Hunter is if the British government can prove the yard is of strategic military importance.' Mr Van Miert had stressed that the argument had to come from the government, particularly the Ministry of Defence.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maurizio Ricci: "Prime Minister Berlusconi's </F> `Reserve Plan'"]    [Excerpts] Rome -- A ceiling on taxation, equality between  public and private education, revisions of the law on police  informers, negative VAT [value-added tax] for people who create  employment, and tax incentives for housing elderly relatives.  On the European level, the federalist ideal of previous  governments is disappearing and a more nationalist, "English"  vision of the future of the European Union [EU] is emerging, to  the extent of demanding a revision of the European Monetary  System [EMS] and a common currency circulating in parallel with  the national currency -- the "hard ECU" that John Major was  proposing before Maastricht. These are just a few of the points  in the government program that [Prime Minister-Designate] Silvio  Berlusconi has illustrated over the last few days in the long  process of consultations with allies, opponents, and social  partners. The draft program is careful not to talk of outright  first-past-the-post voting for electoral reform, and there is no  indication of a separation of posts in the magistracy. It does,  however, insist on tax relief and the rigid containment of the  public debt with respect to national wealth. This is,  therefore, one of the three basic conditions for government  action in addition to the respect of the rights acquired in the  social security reform and the protection of social solidarity,  starting with the family. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Institutions </H5>   It will be up to parliament, and possibly the electorate  (through referendums) to enact constitutional reform. The  government will, on the other hand, be able to propose specific  outlines for constitutional laws, without ruling out the  formation of a new, specific bicameral committee. Electoral  reform will ultimately involve the replacement of the  proportional system with a majority voting system, plus the  abolition of the vestiges of the proportional system. At the  same time, the rules governing both houses will be revised.  <H5>  Employment </H5>   "Full support" will be given, especially through interest  rates, to small companies and the self-employed. In the first  100 days, a series of concrete measures will be implemented:  tax breaks for people creating new jobs, incentives for  part-time workers (especially for women), the liberalization of  the procedures for employment (even if outgoing Minister Giugni  claims that such procedures for selection and direct employment  by small companies are already practiced), the unblocking of  public works contracts, and tax breaks for reinvested profit.  <H5>  Public Finances </H5>   There will be no property tax and no consolidation of debt.  There will be a ceiling on withholding tax with exemptions for  incomes of up to 10 million lire, a "drastic reduction" in  personal income tax rates, and only two VAT rates. Where fiscal  federalism is concerned, at the local level, taxes which finance  services will be distributed locally, while at the national  level will be those taxes which finance the basic tasks of the  state.  <H5>  Health </H5>   The principle here is "the right to benefits" for the  individual, and a "minimum level of coverage" for the less  well-off. There will be room for private insurance and  hospitals will be transformed into competing businesses.  <H5>  Pensions </H5>   There will be increased tax relief to lighten the pension  fund (the "hole" for the Treasury will be covered by the income  generated by investments in these same funds). Compulsory  contributions to the public system will remain. This will  finance the safeguarding of acquired benefits for the weakest.  There will be a link with wages for the lowest 20 percent of  pensions.  <H5>  Education </H5>   There will be freedom of choice between public and private  education. This means that there will be rules "which allow  access to private education under the same conditions as access  to public education." College students will be able to apply  for loans which they will have to pay back when they have found  employment.  <H5>  Justice </H5>   "The laws on informants which have made it possible to  identify major crimes will not be touched." There will be "just  a few minor changes," partly on the basis of [outgoing Prime  Minister] Ciampi's proposals, "to combine efficiency of  suppression with the guarantee of a fair trial." For the CSM  [Higher Council of the Magistracy], there is talk of a  reorganization which "should enhance its efficiency and make it  more independent of any possible type of pressure."  <H5>  Family </H5>   The tax system must be based on a family income tax, with  new  tax deductions. There will be tax breaks for those who assist  their parents.  <H5>  Immigration </H5>   Migratory flows will be stabilized, but there will also be  guarantees on housing, education, and equal access to work.  <H5>  Public Administration </H5>   The Cassese reform will continue, strengthening the  distinction or separation between politics and civil service and  eliminating automatic career advancement.  <H5>  Environment </H5>   There will be a tax on polluters and incentives for  ecological investment.  <H5>  Foreign Policy </H5>   The watchword here is "continuity." However, there will be a  "decisive containment of the EC Commission's interventionist  tendencies," as well as a rethink of the EMS, "which has failed  in objective terms in its Maastricht version. Anyone who  believes in European integration will have to work hard to have  an alternative strategy adopted, such as the strategy of a  common currency."</p>

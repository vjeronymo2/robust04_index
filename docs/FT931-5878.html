			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / British threat over Californian tax A HUNDRED British MPs from all parties will ask their government today to trigger retaliation against US companies if the long-running dispute over California's method of taxing foreign companies is not satisfactorily resolved by the end of the year. Barclays Bank, whose suit is being treated as the test case for California's system of world-wide unitary taxation, is near the final round in its 10-year legal battle against the tax, as it seeks to persuade the US Supreme Court to declare the method unconstitutional. British MPs flew to Washington this week to try to convince the Clinton administration to throw its weight behind the Barclays appeal, and to make clear that their threats of retaliation were real. 'I don't see what else we could do if the courts failed us,' said Mr Nicholas Brown, a UK Labour party spokesman on economic affairs. 'It is a new situation. Retaliation is not the taboo word it was a year ago,' added Sir Roger Moate, Conservative party MP for Faversham. California's unitary system seeks to tax foreign companies' world-wide profits in proportion to their business operations within the state, instead of the usual method of taxing only profits generated in the state. Barclays won decisions against the method in Californian superior and appeals courts. With the backing of the British government and the US Justice Department, the UK bank had argued that unitary taxation infringed the federal government's constitutional power to conduct foreign policy and regulate foreign commerce. However, these decisions were overruled by the Californian Supreme Court last year, and the US Supreme Court declined to review. Barclays is now seeking, for the second time, to have the US Supreme Court take up the case, after further action in the state courts. British officials are watching anxiously to see whether the Clinton administration will follow its predecessors by joining the suit. The UK parliament passed a measure to enable the UK government to retaliate against US companies in 1985, but this has never been implemented. Mr Dan Burt, of the Washington law firm Burt, Maner &amp; Miller, argues that the UK's threats of retaliation will not be believed until they are triggered. Also, retaliation would improve Barclays chances in court by demonstrating that the California tax does interfere with foreign commerce.</p>

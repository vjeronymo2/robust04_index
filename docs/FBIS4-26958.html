			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 27 (CNA) -- Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of  the Council for Economic Planning and Development said Monday  [27 Jun] the government will make moves to reduce the number of  farm workers in Taiwan within the next 10 years as part of its  efforts to lessen the impact Taiwan's membership in the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] will have on them.    Speaking at the Third National Agricultural Conference,  Hsiao  said the government has set a series of measures targeted to  help the agricultural industry, which he said will be the sector  most affected by Taiwan's GATT entry.    The principal countermeasures to be taken will include  grooming farm workers for nonfarm jobs and releasing land  currently used for agricultural production for other purposes.    Hsiao said the government expects to cut the ratio of  agricultural workers in Taiwan from the current 12 percent to  three percent in 10 years. If that goal is reached, a total of  between 700,000 and 800,000 farm workers will have to find work  in other fields, Hsiao noted.    The government in the future will also earmark a sufficient  budget to help the agricultural sector resolve problems that may  hinder the upgrading and the rise of productivity of the sector,  he added.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hire services lifts Allen to Pounds 1.28m A sharp profits increase from its hire services side helped Allen, the Wigan-based housebuilding, hire services and contracting group, lift pre-tax profits by 50 per cent in the six months to September 30. The rise, from Pounds 855,000 to Pounds 1.28m - a figure forecast at the time of the Pounds 5m placing in September - was struck on turnover up 23 per cent at Pounds 30.5m (Pounds 24.7m). On prospects for the second half and beyond, Mr Donald Greenhalgh, chairman and managing director, said: 'No forecasts, but we're smiling, aren't we?' He added that he felt the worst of the recession was past. Hire services raised operating profits by 61 per cent to Pounds 472,000 (Pounds 293,000), of which acquisitions accounted for Pounds 75,000. The division's turnover advanced from Pounds 3.92m to Pounds 5.07m. So far, Allen has spent Pounds 713,000 of the Pounds 2m earmarked from the placing for the hire services side; it bought Centahire's six depots in the north-east of England at the beginning of the month. Contracting profits fell to Pounds 332,000 (Pounds 421,000) on turnover of Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 14.3m). Mr Greenhalgh said that the 2 per cent margin achieved was 'fairly remarkable in the industry', while Mr Ken Fox, deputy managing director, added that the margin was about one point better than he had expected. Mr Greenhalgh thought that there would be no recovery in the sector until late next year. He said he expected the contracting and hire services divisions to expand by acquisition and housebuilding organically. Housebuilding made more at Pounds 822,000 (Pounds 759,000) on turnover up at Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 6.2m). Completions grew to 144 (105) units. Some Pounds 2.5m from the placing has been put aside for the landbank, which is expected to grow to 35 or 36 sites by next November. The property side made Pounds 83,000 (Pounds 41,000) on turnover of Pounds 395,000 (Pounds 330,000). Earnings per share emerged at 3.87p (2.85p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 1.65p on the enlarged capital, and the board is intending to pay a final of 3.35p for a maintained 5p total.</p>

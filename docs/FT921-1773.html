			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Vice-chairman to succeed Hayden as head of Jaguar MR BILL HAYDEN, chairman and chief executive of Jaguar, the heavily loss-making luxury car subsidiary of Ford of the US, is to retire at the end of the month. He will be replaced by Mr Nick Scheele, previously president of Ford of Mexico, and Jaguar vice-chairman since January 1. Mr Scheele must implement the ambitious Jaguar new-product plan devised after Ford's Pounds 1.6bn takeover at the end of 1989. The plan is aimed at boosting production by the end of the decade to more than 100,000 cars a year, four times last year's depressed level. The product programme, which is expected to involve a capital investment of more than Pounds 1bn through the 1990s, will focus on the development of three new model ranges as well as the development of a new engine family. Jaguar's plans for the 1990s include: A revised version of its XJ6 saloon, code-named the X300, to be launched in 1994. A replacement for the XJS coupe and convertible ranges, code-named X100, to be launched in 1996. The launch of a new engine family, first as a V8 - code-named AJ26 - in 1996 but later in V6 form and possibly as a V12. The company is expected to decide later this year whether it will be made at one of its own Midlands sites or built at a Ford engine plant. The launch, probably in 1998, of a smaller sporty saloon, code-named the X200, to compete with rivals such as the BMW 5-Series. Jaguar hopes that this will enable it to more than double annual production from between 50,000 and 70,000 for the other car ranges to between 100,000 and 150,000. Mr Scheele said the 'key challenge' facing Jaguar was to deliver the product programme on time and within budget. The company was still 'grappling' with the issue of the degree to which Jaguar should use common components with Ford. He said Lexus, the Japanese luxury car range, shared many components with Toyota. He said Jaguar planned to raise production this year to 27,500, but 'that assumes a recovery in the second half of the year, and at the moment the signs are not good'. According to Mr Hayden Jaguar's break-even point has been reduced to about 34,000 cars a year. Mr Scheele said the company was seeking to improve productivity by about 25 per cent this year after a gain of 23 per cent in 1991. 'We have got to take another 40 per cent out of our hours per car.' The company is also planning to reduce its workforce by about 10 per cent or some 800 jobs this year, after cutting employment drastically by a third in 1991 to 8,015 from 12,100 at the end of 1990. The company has become alarmed by the fall in owner loyalty in the US, from a traditional level of around 70 per cent to only 30 per cent last year, said Mr Scheele. Jaguar hopes this trend can be reversed by its progress in overcoming earlier quality problems. Mr Scheele said quality had shown a six-fold improvement in the past two years. Jaguar, in loss for the past three years, suffered a record deficit of Pounds 226m last year.</p>

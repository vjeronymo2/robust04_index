			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Bank rate likely to be unchanged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, reviewed monetary policy yesterday amid expectations that they would leave interest rates unchanged at least until their next meeting on February 2. As usual, neither the Treasury nor the Bank would reveal the conclusion of the hour-long talks, which were brought forward from early January because Mr Clarke leaves this week for a 12-day trade promotion tour in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. However, speaking after the meeting, Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury minister, made clear that there would be no change in the thrust of policy in spite of weak consumer confidence. He told BBC radio's The World at One that the government would continue to set interest rates to maintain the momentum of recovery while bearing down on inflation. Analysts said they did not expect any decision to raise rates would emerge because the last meeting, when the chancellor increased base rates by 0.5 percentage points to 6.25 per cent on Mr George's recommendation, was only on December 7. Although the City believes rates must rise further to curb inflationary pressures, there has been little economic news since then. Yesterday's discussions finished before publication of yesterday's report from the Confederation of British Industry pointing to a rise in pay settlements. The talks also came too soon to evaluate retail trends before and after Christmas. The minutes of the November monetary meeting, released last week, showed the chancellor expressing some concern about the effect that tax rises announced before last month's Budget might have on consumer demand. Mr Nelson predicted that the government's unpopular decisions of reducing public expenditure and increasing taxes would yield political as well as economic dividends. The minister forecast that personal disposable income would increase next year in spite of tax increases and that there would be 'further progress' both for government finances and those of the British people. However, the Treasury's monthly monetary report for January said 'continuing steady growth' in the economy was 'concentrated in the company sector'. Bad feeling, Page 8</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An expanded plenum of the Supreme Council and  parliamentary faction of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]  took place in Sofia today. The participants discussed the draft  program of the forthcoming 41st BSP Congress. This is how BSP  leader Zhan Videnov assessed today's plenum:    [Begin Videnov recording] I am very satisfied with the  results of today's open and expanded plenum. The party  obviously has a good potential that allows it to generate ideas  of a really profound and programmatic essence and discuss them  in a calm and civilized manner. I hope that when the drafts,  which have already been prepared, are soon published, this style  of debate will be transferred to the entire party and society.  We are prepared to calmly discuss the results of this plenum at  the congress. [end recording]    The Alliance for Social Democracy was the only faction  within  the BSP that presented its own draft program for the forthcoming  congress. Chavdar Kyuranov, chairman of the Alliance for Social  Democracy, assessed today's plenum in the following manner.:    [Begin Kyuranov recording] Something very important took  place at today's plenum. The plenum steered itself toward  adopting a very democratic decision --to form a commission that  will work on the draft programs and produce a uniform proposal  for the program. This decision differs from previous decisions  on the same matter. As far as our program is concerned, I have  a technical explanation. We were able to submit our draft  rather late. It was disseminated only this morning, so we could  not ask the plenum participants to express their opinions on our  draft program. [end recording]</p>

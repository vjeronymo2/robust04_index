			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: BNL reports 111% rise to L152bn BANCA NAZIONALE del Lavoro, the Italian treasury-owned bank, reported parent company pre-tax profits of L152bn (Dollars 96.9m) for the first six months of this year, up 111 per cent on the L72bn made in the same period last year, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. Operating earnings, net of extraordinary items, soared by 94 per cent to L769bn, from L397bn in 1992. Mr Giampiero Cantoni, chairman, attributed the rise largely to successful securities trading and higher volumes, and stronger earnings from fee-related business. The figures should provide a basis for judging the future health of BNL, still shrugging off the 1989 scandal at its Atlanta branch. BNL's results in the past two years have appeared confusing, due to its reorganisation and transformation into a joint stock holding company. The Aga Khan has reinforced his control of Meridiana, the Sardinia-based airline, by buying an additional 20 per cent from Ifint International, an investment group dominated by the Agnelli family, for an undisclosed price.</p>

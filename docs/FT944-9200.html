			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures moved ahead strongly for the second day running, but it was the surge in activity that mostly caught traders' imaginations, writes Jeffrey Brown. The number of contracts dealt in the FT-SE 100 December contract soared to 19,792 during pit trading in heavy two-way business. Monday's volume was 8,545. At the 4.10pm official close, December stood at 3,151, up 50 points for a two-day advance of 78 points. The premium to the cash market was around 16 points, or roughly twice the fair value premium. There was a substantial 20-point premium to the cash market throughout almost the whole session, with the upward pressure only tailing off in the final hour of trading. December reached a peak of 3,158 just after 3pm, and on the way up broke through a number of chart resistance points, notably 3,130 and 3,150. Traders took encouragement from the way trade sizes widened, although with the December contract dipping to 3,148 in late, screen trade, talk of a firm platform for today's session began to look slightly premature. Traded option volume expanded to 44,538 contracts from Monday's 31,163, with FT-SE and Euro FT-SE activity accounting for just under 25,000 lots. British Gas was the busiest stock option.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Engineers look behind manufacturing decline AN UNDERQUALIFIED work-force, uneven spending on research and development and a shortage of strong medium-sized companies are among reasons for a decline in the UK manufacturing sector, according to a report from the Institution of Electrical Engineers. The 63-page report, compiled by Professor Jack Levy, a leading figure in engineering, is likely to focus new attention on some of the underlying causes for the decline in manufacturing. The report claims to demonstrate 'unequivocally' that services could not replace, manufacturing, which accounts for about 62 per cent of UK exports. It suggests that a trebling in overseas receipts from service industries would be needed to replace manufacturing. On the main indicators of the UK's competitive performance - output, productivity, share of world trade and import penetration - the findings are generally negative. Manufacturing output has grown relatively slowly, while productivity has improved, but is still below that of western Germany, Japan and the US. The UK's share of world trade is falling again after stabilising in the 1980s, and the trade balance is worsening. The survey is intended to be an overview, an independent assessment and a 'compendium of remedies' from a number of recent high-profile reports on manufacturing, including studies by the Confederation of British Industry and the Lords select committee on science and technology. The report finds that the UK workforce, apart from the top level, is seriously under-qualified and that just 12 companies account for half of UK spending on R&amp;D.

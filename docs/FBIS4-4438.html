			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Rangoon Burma Television Network in  Burmese at 1300 GMT on 30 March carried a 50-minute report on  the 30 March National Convention Plenary Session to draw up the  basic principles for drafting the new state constitution, held  in the Central Meeting Hall of the President's Residence  compound on Ahlone Road, Rangoon. The report includes recorded  extracts of proposal papers read by six delegates from the  political parties.    First, U Sai Soe Nyunt, a member of the Central Executive  Committee of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy [SNLD],  presents his party's proposal paper on the chapter headings  relating to the state, state structure, and head of state.  Referring to the chapter heading on state structure, he recalls  that "at the National Convention Plenary Session held on 13  August 1993, the SNLD proposed that the Union of Myanmar be  composed of Kachin, Kayah, Karen, Chin, Bamah [Burmese], Mon,  Rakhine, and Shan States, which are equal. In other words, the  Union should be comprised of eight states. The chairman of the  National Convention Convening Work Committee prescribed that  under the new constitution, the existing seven divisions should  be formed into seven regions and the seven existing states  should be formed into seven states, and that the said seven  regions and seven states should have equal status. Therefore,  this principle is different from our policy."    He suggests some nomenclature changes to be made to suit the  times. He proposes that Union state [pyi-daung-su pyi-ne] be  changed to national state [amyotha pyi-ne], autonomous state  [ko- paing ok-chok-ya pyi-ne] be changed to autonomous region  [ko-paing ok-chok-ya de-tha], and ethnic state [lu-myo-zu  pyi-ne] be changed to national area [lu-myo-zu ne-mye]. He  proposes that members of the Union should be organized into  these three categories.    Addressing the issue of power sharing, U Sai Soe Nyunt  suggests that "union states who are members of the Union shall  be given political autonomy. The states shall not be allowed to  exercise sovereignty, however." He proposes further that  "autonomous regions be given administrative autonomy," and that  "national areas be given cultural autonomy."    He says: "The principle of a Union based on equal  opportunity and status and the second point relating to full  self-determination for the states are two issues that constitute  the very heart of the Union. In other words, it is the very  essence of the spirit of Panglong, and it should not be left  out. Therefore, every time the issue of the Union is raised, it  is necessary to scrutinize constantly whether it is based on the  spirit of Panglong. The Panglong Treaty was signed in a spirit  of unity."    U Sai Soe Nyunt explains that "in order to ensure checks and  balances between the two chambers of Parliament, it is necessary  to have Bamah State, which is comprised of seven regions. Only  then can the two chambers control and balance each other and  serve the country's interests by legislating laws acceptable to  all."    Continuing, he says if some national races are granted  autonomous regions for various reasons while other national  races are not given the same status, despite meeting the  requirements, the latter will be resentful and it will not  benefit the Union. He says: "The British used the  divide-and-rule strategy, and we will be accused of using the  tactics of separate-and-rule in our era." Therefore, it is  proposed that if the status of autonomous region is to be  granted at all, it should be based on common criteria and  fairness.    He says it will be necessary to consider the wishes and  demands of the national races who were ignored when the  constitutions of 1947 and 1974 were drafted. "These national  races are the Tai Lai, Tai Nae, Tai Mau, Tai Sar, Tai Hkamti,  Tai Kadu, Tai Kannan, and Tai Kuan -- various groups of Tai Lian  race -- who are spread throughout upper Sagaing Division and  lower Kachin State." The Tai Lian are a non-Kachin race whose  existence has been ignored. They were known as a Shan-Bamah  race living along the railway line in Sagaing Division and  Kachin State and their original name of Tai Lian has been  forgotten for over 40 years. He says these groups of Tai Lian  meet the requirements to have a Tai Lian autonomous region. He  "appeals for the third time publicly that the following areas be  declared as constituting the Tai Lian autonomous region: All  plains in Bhamo, Momauk, Mansi, Shwegu in Bhamo District; in  Myitkyina, Waingmaw, Mogaung, Mohnyin, Kamaing, (Mumkuam) of  Tanai in Myitkyina District; the former territory of Wuntha  Sawbwa in Katha, Indaw, Tigyaing, Banmauk, Kawlin, Wuntha, and  Pinlebu in Katha District; Kale, Paungbyin, Tamu, Kalewa,  Mawlaik, and (Mokang) in Kale District; and the former territory  of Hkamti Sawbwa in Hkamti, Homalin, and Namyun."    He then proposes that a commission composed of honorable and  impartial persons be formed by the state in order to ascertain  the genuine wishes regarding self-administered areas. He says  if self- administered divisions are granted legislative power  they should have a legislature. In such cases, there will be  too many legislatures and it will contradict the principles  mentioned by the work committee chairman -- each region and  state should have their own legislature. Therefore, he proposes  self-administered divisions not be given legislative power.    Addressing the chapter heading on head of state, U Sai Soe  Nyunt says: "We accept the principle that the president is the  head of state. We differ in opinion, however, on the  president's powers. We want the president as a ceremonial head  of state as in the 1947 Constitution. We want the parliamentary  form of government headed by a prime minister." Continuing, he  says: "If it is determined that the presidential system is the  most suitable for our country, it is suggested that the  president be elected directly by the people, as in the United  States and the Philippines. A person eligible to be elected as  a member of parliament should also be eligible to become  president. Therefore, we should prescribe the principle that a  person who meets the age requirement and whose parents are both  citizens meets the requirement for the post of president. There  should be no other requirements."    U Sai Soe Nyunt concludes his report by saying that "it is  the firm belief of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy  that members of state organs who are to administer the people  should be freely elected and appointed by the people themselves."    Next, U Thein Tun, a member of the group representing  elected  representatives from the National Unity Party, reads his paper.  He first discusses the chapter heading on the state and  requirements for self-administered areas to be formed in the  regions and states under the new constitution. He suggests that  a decision on the matter first be obtained from the convention.  He supports the proposal that "the capital city of Yangon  [Rangoon] be declared a union territory under the direct  administration of the president."    Continuing, he expresses his support for the procedures for  electing the president suggested by the work committee chairman.  He suggests that the president and vice presidents be allowed a  second term, that they not be allowed to accept any other  professional posts or allowed to hold shares in economic  enterprises, and that they be allowed to declare a list of their  assets and those of their family to the Union Parliament each  year.    He concludes his report by offering to work for the success  of the National Convention through consultation and cooperation  and with magnanimity and mutual trust.    After a recess, the plenary session resumes at 1210. U San  Hla, a member of the elected representatives delegate group from  the Union Pa-O National Organization, reads his group's report.  He supports the formation of the state as a union. He points  out the imperfections of the prime minister as a head of state  in previous administrations and endorses the proposal for a  presidential system of government.    Next, independent representative U Htaung Kho Htan reads the  first part of a collective report by himself, U Yankyin Maw of  the Shan State Kokang Democratic Party, and independent  representatives Dr. Hmu Tang. He expresses the need to prohibit  racial and religious discrimination in the new democratic state.  His group report proposes that the name region not be used, and  that all 14 states and divisions should be called states. He  supports the basic principle on the formation of  self-administered divisions or self- administered zones and  proposes the need for prescribing "self- administered areas for  the Kokang, Danu, Pa-O, Palaung, Bamar, and Wa nationals from  Shan State; Chin, Kuki Chin, and Naga Chin nationals from  Sagaing Division; and Asho Chin nationals living in Magwe  Division and Arakan State." He also suggests the formation of a  commission to determine self-administered areas.    Dr. Hmu Tang reads the second part of the report. He  proposes that the capital should be Rangoon and that is should  consist of Sanchaung, Bahan, Kemmendine, Hlaing, Insein,  Mingaladon, Dawbon, Yankin, Tamwe, Thaketa, Thingangyun, South  Okkalapa, North Okkalapa, Mayangon, Ahlone, Pazundaung,  Kyauktada, Mingalataungnyunt, Dagon, Lanmadaw, Pabedan,  Botataung, Latha, Seikkan, and Kamayut townships. The capital  should be a union territory administered by a mayor, elected by  the people residing in the townships, and a city council. He  says the basic principle of the president being the national  leader of all national races should not be adopted, explaining  that the status of national leader does not belong to a person  just because he is a president. It is a status automatically  designated by the people to honor heroes for their selfless  service to the people and country. He also objects to the basic  principal that the president should live in the country for at  least 20 consecutive years to be eligible for election. He says  it only depends on "loyalty to the country and people, love for  the country, and goodwill toward the country." If the 20-year  rule is adopted, it will be like closing the door of opportunity  on the 20 million Burmese women who will never be able to get on  the political stage. He proposes electing a president or vice  president by rotating among the elected representatives based on  equal representation from the Kachin, Kayah, Karen, Chin, Bamar,  Mon, Arakan, and Shan. He finally proposes that any vice  president who is not subsequently elected should not serve as  vice president.    U San Tha Aung, an elected representative from the Mro, or  Khami National Solidarity Organization [MKNSO], is scheduled  present his report next. Becuase he is a member of the panel of  chairmen, he is excused from reading his report, and with the  approval of the alternate chairman his report is put on record.  The television announcer presents extracts of his report. The  report proposes that the Wa; Pa-O; Palaung; Mro, or Khami;  Kokang; Lahu; Naga; Rawan; Kayan; Akhar; Lihsu; and Danu  national races should be allowed to have self-administered  divisions. The report says the Mro national race has lived in a  congruous territory in "Pauktaw, Ponnagyun, Mrauk-U, Buthidaung,  Maungdaw, Rathedaung, and Kyauktaw townships of Northern Arakan  State, and Paletwa township in Southern Chin State, with an  estimated population of 150,000." The report also proposes that  a Mro self-administered division should be established not by a  commission but by the delegates. In the report, he supports the  work committee's proposals on electing the president and vice  presidents and adds a proposal that "in accordance with the  constitution, the president and vice presidents should be given  suitable remuneration, benefits, and housing."    The plenary session ends at 1415.</p>

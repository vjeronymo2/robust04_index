			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by China Center for International Studies: </F> "Practical Significance of Upholding the Five Principles of  Peaceful Coexistence"]    [Text] This year is the 40th anniversary of the  proclamation of the five principles of peaceful coexistence  jointly advocated by China, India, and Burma. Practice over the  past 40 years proves that the five principles of peaceful  coexistence conform to the needs of the times and to the reality  of world development, and therefore they are winning support and  approval from more and more countries and they have become  universally accepted basic principles for handling international  relations.    Advocacy of the five principles of peaceful coexistence  was a great beginning in the history of international relations  and was a new development of the basic principles of  international law in the post-war situation. The basic  principles of modern international law came into existence in  the bourgeois revolutionary period and were the embodiment of  the will of the bourgeoisie. The principle of sovereignty and  the spirit of equality they reflected did not take into account  the vast numbers of colonies and semi-colonial countries. They  served the old international order, which was based on power  politics, and had fundamental limitations. Since the Second  World War, there have been profound changes in international  relations. Following the upsurge of national liberation  movements, the vast numbers of Third World countries that had  newly won independence went onto the international arena, thus  having a great impact on the international order dominated by  major powers. In order to safeguard their national independence  and develop their national economies, Third World countries  opposed all forms of hegemonism and power politics in  international relations, called for the establishment of a new  form of international relations on the foundation of  independence and equality, and hoped for some basic principles  to standardize this type of new international relations.  Advocacy of the five principles of peaceful coexistence was  precisely the reflection of the demand and aspiration.  The five principles of peaceful coexistence have  developed the spirit of the UN Charter in light of the post-war  reality and have concisely and clearly summed up the basic  principles that must be observed in modern international  relations. They provide that all rights and obligations are  premised by the principle of reciprocity and have an equal  binding force on countries with different social systems and at  different stages of development. Moreover, their content  embraces political and economic aspects and form a complete  whole. Therefore, we can say that the five principles of  peaceful coexistence are a manifesto of Third World countries  that call for the establishment of a fair and rational new  international order. Their advocacy marked the beginning of a  new period in the history of international relations. In  past decades, in order to promote the establishment of a new  international order, Third World countries have made unremitting  efforts, struggles, and great progress, changing the face of  post-war international relations to an exceedingly large degree.    Since the end of the Second World War, a number of socialist  and nationalist countries have appeared, ushering in the  coexistence of the two social systems of socialism and  capitalism and of socialist, capitalist, and nationalist  countries. The advocacy of the five principles of peaceful  coexistence and development of the international situation show  that peaceful coexistence is not only needed for countries with  different social systems, but likewise needed between socialist  countries. Only when all countries, despite their power,  strength, wealth, ideologies, and social systems respect each  other's sovereignty, treat each other equally, and coexist  peacefully can the world have lasting peace and prosperity. In  light of the new characteristics in the post-war international  situation and the new practice in international relations, the  five principles of peaceful coexistence have developed into  general principles fit for use by all countries, thus greatly  enriching and developing the idea of peaceful coexistence.    Since the end of the Cold War, the world has had  profound changes and is faced with many problems, so upholding  the five principles of peaceful coexistence in international  relations has greater significance. Mutual respect for  sovereignty is the core and foundation of the five  principles. The equality of all countries, big and small,  the inviolability of territorial integrity, and  non-interference in the internal affairs of another country all  derive from the principle of sovereignty. The principle of  sovereignty is also the cornerstone of the UN Charter.  Safeguarding sovereignty and infringing on sovereignty  have always been a focal point in international relations.  Since the end of the Cold War, international struggles  centering on the question of sovereignty have become  increasingly conspicuous. Major Western countries, taking  advantage of changes in international political and economic  relations, pursue "neo-interventionism," advocate that the  concept of sovereignty is "outmoded," and that "human rights are  superior to sovereignty" in an attempt to achieve the goal of  harming the sovereignty of medium and small countries and  interfering in the internal affairs of developing countries  through playing down the principle of sovereignty. This  practice has seriously endangered the normal development of  international relations. There is no denying the fact that  there have been profound changes in the world's political and  economic situations today. Due to the exceedingly speedy  development of science and technology, the world has already  greatly "shrunk," economic interdependence is increasingly  deepening, activities across national borders are getting  increasingly brisk, and the common problems faced by humans are  increasing. Under the circumstances, it is completely necessary  for more extensive cooperation between nations and for the  international community to take more common action. For this  reason, in safeguarding their own interests, sovereign countries  must at the same time consider the interests of other countries  and the common interests of humanity. But this does not mean  the principle of sovereignty has changed. Under the unfair  international order, strong countries always impose their will  on weak ones, harming their sovereignty. While advocating such  views as sovereignty being "outmoded," major Western powers in  fact do not limit their own sovereignty, but only call for  limiting the sovereignty of other countries. Today as the  economies of the world are getting increasingly integrated,  developed countries are not really keen on solving the problem  of poverty which has a bearing on the whole world. On the  contrary, they are strengthening protection of their own  economies and limitations on immigrants. On the other hand,  major Western countries often use as an excuse the universal  principle of human rights to flagrantly interfere in some  developing countries and demand that they accept Western values,  social systems, and economic patterns. This practice is in fact  a manifestation of power politics under the new post-Cold-War  situation. International reality proves that although the  international situation is greatly different from in the past,  the independence of countries and the equality with which all  countries handle international relations still remain unchanged.  Sticking to the five principles, safeguarding national  sovereignty, and opposing interference in the internal affairs  of another country in any form are still very important in  guaranteeing the normal development of international relations,  in promoting international peace and cooperation, and  particularly in protecting the just rights and interests of vast  numbers of developing countries.    The five principles of peaceful coexistence came into  existence at the high tide of the national independence movement  in the 1950's. At that time, they mainly stressed independence  and sovereignty in national relations, but also applied to the  economic field calling for equality and mutual benefits in  international economic relations. The economic imbalance  between South and North has long been serious, and many  developing countries are faced with social turbulence and  economic stagnation. There are of course internal reasons for  this, but a more important one is the seriously unequal  relations in the international economy. The worsening of trade  terms, the low prices of primary products, the heavy debt  burden, and the prevalence of protectionism and supraeconomic  pressure have seriously hampered the economic development of  developing countries. Developing countries strongly call for  the establishment of a fair and rational new international  order. Since the end of the Cold War, the influence of the  economic factor on international relations has obviously  increased, and therefore upholding mutual respect for  sovereignty and the principle of equality and mutual benefit has  more conspicuous significance. Today as countries around  the world are getting increasingly interdependent and as the  global problems they face are increasing, developed countries  and developing countries should make concerted efforts and  strengthen cooperation and exchanges on the basis of mutual  respect for sovereignty and equality and reciprocity. Only this  is beneficial to world peace and development. Due to historical  and practical reasons, developed countries have an unshirkable  responsibility for narrowing the gap between South and North and  improving the unfavorable position of developing countries in  the world economy and trade. Developed countries should offer  necessary preferential conditions to developing countries in  respect to economic aid, technology transfer, and trade, and  should completely abandon the incorrect practice of attaching  political conditions to trade and economic aid.    Since the end of the Cold War, the world has been  developing into a multipolar one at an accelerated rate. The  five principles will play a bigger role in safeguarding world  peace and promoting development. Multipolarization means  superpowers can no longer dominate the world. Since the  disintegration of the Soviet Union, the strength of the United  States as a superpower has relatively weakened and it finds it  impossible to maintain "one-power domination." The imbalanced  development of the world's politics and economy makes the  strength of major powers tend to be balanced. The economic  strength and political status of West Europe and Japan are  rising. Russia's status in the world's strategic pattern and  its influence on world affairs must not be neglected. Some  developing countries, especially some large countries and  regional groups, have been developing comparatively quickly by  seizing the favorable opportunity of the world's economic  readjustment and have become an important new force in the  multipolar world. The multipolar development of the  world's politics and economy offers an historical opportunity  and extensive objective foundation for implementing the spirit  of the five principles in international relations. The policy  of hegemonism and power politics pursued by superpowers will be  more strongly opposed. Any practice of disregarding the  sovereignty of another country and imposing one's ideology on  another is impractical.    The current transition of the world's old pattern to a new  one has afforded an opportunity for world peace and development.  Sticking to the five principles can help resolve problems faced  by the world today and establish a fair and rational new  international order people have long been looking forward to.  Times are progressing and theories have to be developed.  Compared with the Cold War period, the present transition  period from the old pattern to a new one has many new  characteristics and still needs to be understood through  practice. However, as basic principles guiding international  relations, the five principles of peaceful coexistence still  indisputably possess strong vitality.</p>

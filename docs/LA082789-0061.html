			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATE NIGHT'S GROWING AD CLOUT  </P> <P> With the three major networks' prime-time audience levels eroding steadily for  the past decade, television's late-night arena -- with its much lower costs per  commercial and its young, movie-going and soft-drink-and-beer-swilling audience  -- has become an increasingly tempting alternative.  </P> <P> "Late night is very attractive because you can reach the young viewer," said  John Sisk, senior vice president at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency  in New York. "And we believe that at that time of night, the audience's  receptivity to commercials is better. They have stayed up late and this is  really what they want to watch and so they are attentive and responsive to what  they see."  </P> <P> The total amount of national advertising dollars spent in late night soared  nearly 25% in 1988 over the previous year to more than $1.2 billion, despite  little change in the quantity or quality of the programming available,  according to the Television Bureau of Advertising. The bureau has yet to  compile figures for the first seven months of 1989, but with the significant  programming changes late night has seen this year, programmers and advertising  executives said they expect the total to rise again.  </P> <P> "The increased competition in late night is definitely bringing new viewers to  (that time period)," said Bob Niles, a research and marketing executive at NBC.  "And if you look at the advertisers that are buying into late night -- 10 years  ago (when Carson was the only game in town) it was primarily the packaged goods  companies; now you have import automobiles, movie studios, the soft-drink  companies. There is clearly a change in the kind of advertisers and the amount  of money being spent. Advertisers looking for an upscale audience are flocking  to late-night (talk shows).  </P> <P> "And the syndicators and network programmers see that happening -- they see the  increase in the audience and the flood of advertising dollars and it makes  sense to try to get in the game. With (Carson and Letterman's) success in  drawing the upscale demographic, we've created our own monster that naturally  breeds more competition." STEVE WEINSTEIN  </P></p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Work-out for welfare They're off. The race to cut the cost of social security, and possibly healthcare, has begun. The prize is a politician's dream: lower taxation, and a golden harvest of votes. To win, a party must find convincing ways of rolling back the frontiers of the welfare state. There's a vision for you. It will be a marathon run. Labour's commission on social justice will produce its first discussion papers this summer, but it is not expected to report until a year after that. The government's review of public spending, announced yesterday, may take even longer. Both British parties will benefit from watching the United States, where President Bill Clinton is wrestling with his campaign promise to get people off the welfare rolls and into work, while his wife tries to set up a genuinely national health service at no extra cost. I will not wear you down with too many statistics. We are all aware of the explosive growth in the number of claimants on both sides of the Atlantic since the end of the second world war. But - just as a reminder - in 1948 about 1m people were living on national assistance in Britain. Over the following 30 years that little army nearly trebled, to 2.9m. The payout had by then been renamed supplementary benefit, but that did not make it any cheaper. The latest figure, for 1991-92, is 4.8m. The name has changed again, to income support, but the number is still growing. Invalidity benefit, paid to half a million people in 1976-77, was collected by 1.3m in 1991-92. Retirement pensions were paid to 8.25m elderly persons in 1976-77; today 10m pension books get cashed at post office counters each week. It is no wonder that social security accounts for a third of central government expenditure. The thinking behind all of it is now challenged by both major parties. One result will almost certainly be a gradual reduction in the amount spent on state pensions. Everyone is on to that. Mr David Willetts, the Conservative backbench MP described by the prime minister last week as the newest addition to a 'distinguished list of Conservatism's historians and philosophers', has offered his own contribution to the debate. Mr Willetts is too young to claim a place alongside Disraeli or Salisbury, let alone Burke. He has, however, produced a stimulating pamphlet on pensions*. As he points out, it is wrong to assume that all poor people are old, or that all old people are poor. Between 1979 and 1988 social security benefits paid to retired persons rose by 14 per cent. Occupational benefits rose by 99 per cent and savings income, puffed up by high interest rates, by even more. Yet some three-fifths of pensioners are still heavily dependent on taxpayers. As a general rule, the older the pensioner, the poorer. Mr Willetts' conclusion is that substantially higher rates of benefit should be paid to the over-80s. This implies that, over time, the under-80s should take increasingly less from the rest of us. My guess is that if the government does not pick this one up Labour's social justice commission will, possibly giving it a spin by making the cut-off age 75. This is not out of line with the precepts of the Beveridge report, the founding document of the British welfare state, published 50 years ago. 'It was Beveridge's great insight,' says Mr Willetts, 'that benefits aimed at broad categories of people . . . would be well targeted on alleviating poverty while avoiding the administrative nightmares of means testing.' The same principle, he argues, could be said to support indexation of child benefit for under-fives, while leaving the amount for older children to wither on the vine. None of this is easy. Mothers cannot easily go out to work while infants are below school age. That justifies a higher benefit. Yet as Mr Willetts will discover as his own toddlers grow up, children get more, not less, expensive to run. Can reduction of benefit for older children really be justified? I do not say this merely to tease the author. Universal hand-outs are eagerly collected by the middle classes, the non-poor. Reducing the amounts or taking them away is the toughest kind of politics. Mr Clinton's advisers know this. That is why Medicaid and US social security are thought of as practically untouchable. Schemes aimed at the very poor, like America's aid to families with dependent children, are unpopular with the majority of voters. Mr Willetts also proposes to raise the retirement age for both men and women to 67, with 65 as an interim stage. He rightly regards the dramatic fall in labour force participation by people in their 50s and 60s as 'a dangerous absurdity'. As he says: 'The real problem isn't that too many people live too long, it is that too many people stop working too soon.' What he does not address is the question of how far total employment can be increased, given a long-term trend rate of growth of the economy of, say, 2.5 per cent. The Labour party is better placed to take up the hint given by Mr John Smith in his important weekend speech that a 'new definition of full employment', to include part-time workers, is needed. This is not, however, a matter of mere party politics. The intellectual climate is changing. Labour will steal ideas thrown up by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, in his review. The opposition's proposals will be lifted by the Tories. Pensions are only one part of a much larger story. Every corner of the welfare system will be scrutinised during the next few years. Last week the prime minister threw out a hint about 'workfare'; Labour's commission will have to examine schemes aimed at ensuring that, where possible, the state tries to find suitable jobs for unemployed claimants. The point at which the benefits system is a disincentive to work - the 'poverty trap' - will once again be the subject of endless recalculation. You can feel the time for new ideas ripening. The German social democrats' slogan, 'markets where possible, the state where necessary', was fine when the matter at issue was the exact mix in a mixed economy. Today's task is to reduce the number of dependants. Committees considering this might adopt a new slogan - 'work where possible, welfare where necessary'. It would do for either party. Pin it on the wall. * The Age of Entitlement. Social Market Foundation, 20 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AA. Tel: 071-222 7060.</p>

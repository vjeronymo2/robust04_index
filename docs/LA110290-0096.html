In outlining his new policy last  week, President Alberto Fujimori warned that the forced eradication of coca,  before farmers could develop profitable alternative crops, would risk civil  war.  </P> <P> The policy does not rule out military anti-drug aid in the future but places  greater emphasis on a need for rural economic changes that could be difficult,  slow and costly.  </P> <P> U.S. officials here were disappointed when Fujimori turned down the $36 million  in late September, two months after he took office, but they appear to have no  major objections to his new policy. They privately express hope that he will  accept an offer of $40 million in military anti-drug aid for fiscal 1991.  </P> <P> A diplomatic source said the Peruvians "see a need for military assistance, but  they see it in the context of a comprehensive program" and want more economic  aid first.  </P> <P> Fujimori's rejection of the aid also may have been a temporary concession to  leftists who view U.S. military assistance as a threat to Peruvian sovereignty.  </P> <P> Washington is offering to train and equip Peruvian army troops for anti-drug  operations in rural areas where armed traffickers and ultra-leftist Shining  Path guerrillas are dominant.  </P> <P> Fujimori's anti-drug policy paper said his administration wants to discuss  military action in conjunction with possibilities for farmers to produce crops  other than coca.  </P> <P> "It is imperative to accompany the eradication of coca with substitution by  other crops," the paper said. "Effective repression that left peasants without  alternatives could easily unleash a civil war of unsuspected proportions."  </P> <P> A cornerstone of the policy is to simplify complicated legal and bureaucratic  procedures for giving peasant farmers title to the land they use. Because most  coca farmers are squatters without land titles, they are unable to receive bank  loans, sign contracts and form enterprises for planting, processing and  marketing legal cash crops.  </P> <P> The government has begun to establish a "rapid, simple, economical and  reliable" new system for issuing and registering land titles, according to the  policy paper.  </P> <P> It said authorities will be better able to negotiate crop substitution  agreements with farmers who have land titles.  </P> <P> The policy also calls for deregulation measures making it easier for farmers to  form cooperatives and business enterprises, to receive loans, to transport  their produce and to export it to foreign markets. The paper admits that this  is "an immense task that will require a substantial change in the Peruvian  political system."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Peru will intensify efforts to combat drug traffic, the paper said.  </P></p>

			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Clinton edges closer to budget win PRESIDENT Bill Clinton came a step closer to winning congressional approval for his deficit-reduction budget last night when a senator who had previously voted against the bill announced he was switching sides. Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, who has been under intense pressure from Democratic leaders all week, said he would vote to approve the compromise budget. 'This bill will mean jobs, and overall I think it is a positive thing for the country and for the economy,' he said. When the bill first passed the Senate it was tied at 49-49 and was only approved on the casting vote of Vice-President Al Gore. Since then one senator who voted Yes has announced he can no longer support the bill, leaving Mr Clinton one vote short, assuming no other senators change sides. Mr Gore said yesterday he did not know whether he would be required to decide the fate of the legislation again tomorrow. 'But one way or another, this bill is going through.' Earlier, Mr Clinton had taken the battle to win approval for his budget proposals to Capitol Hill, declaring: 'I do not think the Senate will let this plan go down. I do not think they will do that to the country.' The House of Representatives is due to vote on the budget package today, with the more finely balanced Senate vote due on Friday. Under the compromise worked out by Congress the budget deficit will be reduced by Dollars 496bn (Pounds 332.8bn) over the next five years, achieved by raising more than Dollars 243bn in new taxes and cutting about Dollars 253bn in spending. To blunt Republican criticism that higher income tax charges for the country's top earners were being made retroactive to January 1, a Treasury official said yesterday the back payments could be made in three tranches. The concession, which has been written into the amended bill, would allow the additional amounts for the current fiscal year to be paid on April 15 next year and on the same date in the two succeeding years. Mr Bob Dole, Republican leader in the Senate, has accused the administration of imposing the biggest tax increase in history. Opinion polls underline the difficulty Democrats will have in persuading the public that the new tax charges are fair; according to a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll, about 68 per cent of respondents believed middle-income taxpayers would shoulder the burden.</p>

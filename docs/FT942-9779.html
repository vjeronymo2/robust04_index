			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Time Warner adviser agrees SEC settlement Mr Oded Aboodi, a financial adviser to Time Warner, the US entertainment company, has agreed to pay more than Dollars 900,000 to settle insider trading complaints raised by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr Aboodi, who did not admit or deny guilt, was one of the closest advisers to Mr Steve Ross, the free-wheeling entrepreneur who died in December 1992 after building the company into the world's largest entertainment business. The SEC said yesterday that, in May 1991, Mr Aboodi caused two family partnerships to sell common stock in Time Warner while he held negative inside information concerning a rights issue approved by management. Time Warner's share price slumped following announcement of the rights issue, which was unpopular with investors. Mr Aboodi consented to an injunction against future security law violations and an order to disgorge Dollars 413,700, as well as a civil penalty of the same amount and interest of Dollars 103,677. Time Warner yesterday declined to comment on the matter, but said Mr Aboodi continued to advise the company.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SANTEE COUNCILMAN FINED $6,000 FOR GAINING FINANCIALLY FROM VOTES  </P> <P> Santee City Councilman Ray Woodward has agreed to pay a $6,000 fine after an  investigation found his public votes on the proposed extension of California 52  increased the value of his personal real estate holdings, the Fair Political  Practices Commission announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> The state's political watchdog agency found that Woodward, a Santee real-estate  agent and investor, violated the political reform act on three occasions when  he voted with the council to support the plan and also appeared before the  California Transportation Commission in 1987 to push for the alignment of  California 52 along Prospect Avenue. Woodward voted on the alignment while he  was part-owner of the Buena Vista Business Park, two other office buildings and  a restaurant near the proposed freeway alignment.  </P> <P> "At the time of Mr. Woodward's actions, it was reasonably foreseeable that the  decision to build the Route 52 extension would result in an increase of greater  than $10,000 on the fair market value of the Buena Vista Business Park, and on  each of his other interests," the FPPC said in its findings against Woodward.  </P> <P> The investigation findings and Woodward's decision to pay the $6,000 fine were  released Tuesday in documents to be presented at the FPPC meeting in Sacramento  on May 1, when commissioners can vote either to accept or to reject the  agreement as negotiated by their staff.  </P> <P> Woodward could not be reached for comment late Tuesday.  </P> <P> The FPPC investigation found that Woodward used his official capacity to  enhance his financial holdings when he voted in favor of Santee City Council  actions to urge the state transportation panel to select the Prospect Avenue  alignment. Such a resolution was necessary before the state transportation  commission could proceed with planning the final leg of the freeway, which was  begun in 1961 as a way to ease traffic congestion along Interstate 8.  </P> <P> The investigation found that Woodward voted on March 25, 1987, to approve a  resolution in favor of the Prospect alignment, and again voted on April 22,  1987, to send a contingent of city officials before the California  Transportation Commission to advocate that position.  </P> <P> The next month, Woodward himself appeared before the state transportation panel  and "presented a stack of letters from residents in and around Santee in favor  of the route," the findings say.  </P> <P> In the third vote, Woodward voted Sept. 23, 1987, to approve the alignment and  give Caltrans the final go-ahead from the city to start planning the last leg  of SR 52, which is scheduled for construction next year.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the FPPC found, those decisions benefited Woodward personally.  </P> <P> At the time of the votes, he was half-owner of the Buena Vista Business Park,  10207 Buena Vista Avenue, just north of Prospect Avenue.  </P> <P> Woodward sold his interest in the business park in 1989, when the fair market  value was more than $600,000, the FPPC found. Even after the sale, Woodward  continued as the listing agent for the property.  </P> <P> The FPPC also found that Woodward was part-owner of two office buildings at  8606 and 8781 Cuyamaca Street. The latter building has 25 to 28 tenants, as  well as a restaurant of which Woodward owns 40%.  </P> <P> Because the proposed freeway would have an exit to Cuyamaca Street, it was  "also reasonably foreseeable that the extension of Route 52 along the Prospect  alignment would result in an increase to the rental income from his real  property interests, the broker's commissions from his real estate business, and  the income from the restaurant that he partially owned," the FPPC investigation  found.  </P> <P> The documents released Tuesday said that Woodward cooperated with the agency's  investigation, and noted that other Santee council members voted virtually  unanimously to support the Prospect alignment.  </P></p>

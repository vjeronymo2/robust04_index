			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Several commenters also suggest that the installation of an additional safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feature, in addition to the fact that no failures of the system have occurred, should allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests at ``C'' check intervals. Another commenter states that accomplishment of the tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at ``2B'' check intervals (or 1,100 hours time-in-service) would be more appropriate. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these commenters states that a trial test period of the installation by several airlines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be in order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The FAA has reconsidered the compliance time specified in paragraph (d) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal [identified in paragraph (e) of the final rule] for accomplishment of an initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational test, as well as the interval specified for accomplishment of repetitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational tests. In light of the safety implications of the unsafe condition addressed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the practical aspects of accomplishing orderly operational tests of the fleet during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel will be readily available, the FAA finds that the compliance times specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (e) of the AD may be extended without compromising safety. The FAA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that an interval of 4,000 hours time-in-service corresponds more closely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the interval at which most of the affected operators conduct regularly scheduled ``C''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> checks. Therefore, paragraph (e) of the final rule has been revised to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplishment of the initial test within 4,000 hours time-in-service and accomplishment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of repetitive tests at intervals not to exceed 4,000 hours time-in-service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> One commenter requests that the FAA review the requirement for periodic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational tests specified in paragraph (d) of the proposal because these tests only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address a sync-lock failing in the unlocked state. The commenter states that the sync-lock will be totally transparent to the flight crew. Therefore, if a sync-lock fails in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``locked'' state, the only indication the flight crew will receive is that when reverse thrust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is applied, the reverser handles will be stopped by the interlock system and not allowed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> move into reverse thrust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The FAA considers that the operational tests required by paragraph (d) of this AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are adequate to address both the unlocked state and the locked state. The design of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sync-lock is fail-safe in the locked state; its failure in that state during flight would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in deployment of a thrust reverser. In addition, failure of a sync-lock in the locked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state during landing of the airplane does not present an unsafe condition. The airplane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be stopped within the distance specified in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without the use of thrust reversers. The stopping distance specified in the AFM does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take credit for the additional stopping capabilities of the thrust reverser.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Three commenters request revisions to the compliance times specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (a) of the proposal for accomplishment of initial and repetitive adjustments and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests of the thrust reverser system. One of these commenters requests that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30-day compliance time for the initial adjustments and tests be extended to 60 days to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish these actions on all of the airplanes in its fleet. The commenter believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a compliance time of 60 days is more appropriate in light of the fact that no major thrust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reverser anomalies have been found.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Two of these commenters request that the proposed compliance time for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplishment of the repetitive adjustments and tests specified in paragraph (a) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal be revised to ``3,000 hours time-in-service, or at each `C' check, whichever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurs later.'' One of the commenters believes that the compliance interval specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposal is overly restrictive, and that the suggested revision would allow for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplishment of testing and repairs at a time that coincides with regularly scheduled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The FAA concurs with these commenters' requests to revise the compliance times  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the initial and repetitive adjustments and tests required by paragraph (a) of the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. The FAA's intent was that these adjustments and tests be conducted during a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regularly scheduled maintenance visit for the majority of the affected fleet, when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes would be located at a base where special equipment and trained personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be readily available, if necessary. In light of this consideration, the FAA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that an extension of the compliance time for the initial adjustments and tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 60 days, and an extension of the repetitive interval to 4,000 hours time-in-service, will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not affect safety adversely. Paragraph (a) of the final rule has been revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Several commenters question the references to certain pages of the Boeing 737  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maintenance Manual cited in paragraphs (a) and (d) of the proposal. ATA requests that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement be added to those paragraphs to allow operators to use later versions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maintenance Manual, provided that no substantive change is included in those later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> versions. One commenter points out that since certain Maintenance Manual pages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referenced in the proposal have already been revised, operators must seek approval from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FAA for an alternative method of compliance in order to deviate from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maintenance Manual pages cited in the AD. One commenter mentions that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maintenance Manual page numbers cited in paragraph (d) of the proposal do not exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters state that the specific Maintenance Manual pages referenced in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal include a number of tests that are redundant and unnecessary. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states that the tests specified in paragraph (a) are normally performed after component  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement or after a system error has occurred. The commenter indicates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing the ``Normal Operation Test'' and the ``Auto-Restow Test,'' in addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using the thrust reverser during normal flight operations, will satisfy all testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for the thrust reverser.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Boeing requests specifically that the proposal be revised to include copies of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for the required tests so that reference to the Maintenance Manual is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary. Boeing explains that the Maintenance Manuals are customized for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator to reflect all of the equipment in that operator's fleet. Therefore, the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pages for any given procedure is variable, depending on the number of different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment configurations documented in an operator's Maintenance Manual. Boeing also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that Maintenance Manual procedures are revised periodically for non-technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons. Boeing adds that changes to the structure of the procedures are necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate an upgrade of the publishing system that is currently under way, which, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to repagination, will necessitate the issuance of revised Maintenance Manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BISHOPS RAISE MORAL BARRIERS TO FORCE IN GULF  </P> <P> U.S. Catholic bishops for the first time have raised moral objections to the  possible use of military force by the United States in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, acting as chairman of the bishops'  international policy committee, warned Secretary of State James A. Baker III in  a letter Wednesday that a war "would jeopardize many lives, raise serious moral  questions and undermine the international solidarity against Iraq." The letter  was released Thursday.  </P> <P> Mahony "strongly" urged the Bush Administration "to stay the course" with  multinational economic sanctions against Iraq because of its Aug. 2 invasion of  Kuwait.  </P> <P> The bishops, whose 54 million Catholics constitute the nation's largest  religious group, have joined a growing number of mainline Christian leaders  opposing the use of military force to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> Jewish groups generally continue to support the Administration's action in the  gulf and to urge that Iraq be forced to retreat from Kuwait in order to  neutralize the power of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the Middle East.  </P> <P> But leaders of such religious bodies as the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical  Lutheran Church in America and the National Baptist Convention U.S.A. are  insisting on a diplomatic solution and questioning the moral basis for U.S.  military action.  </P> <P> In a letter to President Bush last week, the Rev. Paul H. Sherry, president of  the United Church of Christ, criticized the "steady drumbeat of war messages"  from the White House. "Do not lead the U.S. into war with Iraq," Sherry wrote.  "War is not the solution to Iraq's immoral invasion of Kuwait and will lead to  severe suffering for untold numbers of people."  </P> <P> Up to now, the Catholic bishops had praised the U.S. decision to "oppose  aggression" while urging that Iraqi civilians not be deprived of food and  medicine, said Bob Bennemeyer, the Washington-based director of the bishops'  Office for International Justice and Peace.  </P> <P> "But because of the (Bush Administration's) heightened rhetoric lately about  using the military option, the bishops feel it is premature to consider war  without certain moral tests being met," Bennemeyer said.  </P> <P> The four-page letter from Mahony to Baker was replete with ethical terminology  and pointed practical questions. Mahony was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> "Is there 'a real and certain danger' which can only be confronted by war?"  Mahony wrote in reference to Catholic principles of "just cause" for engaging  in warfare.  </P> <P> "In order to meet the just-cause criteria, U.S. policy would have to clarify  its precise objectives, measure them by ethical values and demonstrate that  they can only be achieved through the use of force," Mahony wrote.  </P> <P> While Catholic tradition does not absolutely rule out force, "There is a clear  presumption against war," Mahony said.  </P> <P> "The military means used must be commensurate with the evil to be overcome and  must be directed at the aggressors, not (at) innocent people," Mahony said.  </P> <P> Mahony said the bishops realize that "a strong military presence" by U.S.  troops in Saudi Arabia "can give credibility to a vigorous pursuit of  nonviolent solutions."  </P> <P> But he said he is concerned that "the pressure to use military force may grow  as the pursuit of nonviolent options almost inevitably becomes difficult,  complex and slow."  </P> <P> Mahony said he offered the Catholic perspective as part of the "necessary and  growing public debate about whether the use of military force could be morally  justified and under what, if any, conditions."  </P> <P> In mid-October, 26 Catholic bishops, acting on their own, signed a statement  highly critical of the U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia, saying that the  forces already constituted an "offensive threat" to Iraq.  </P></p>

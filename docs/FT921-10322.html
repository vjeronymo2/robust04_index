			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Equities At its close yesterday, the FT-SE had fallen 24 points since the start of the week. In the same period Wall Street had risen 60 points. Such divergence is unsurprising at a time when the UK market has an eye on the German economy. It could also be quickly corrected. Nevertheless, it is a reminder of the increasingly fallible nature of the London-Wall Street connection. It is commonplace among London brokers to argue that Wall Street looks expensive and London correspondingly cheap. But the same argument was being advanced five months ago. Since then, London has underperformed Wall Street by 12 per cent. One of the arguments for London's cheapness rests on its dividend yield. But even before the London market's traditional link with the US was severed by the UK joining the ERM, such comparisons were suspect. Ten years ago, the UK market yielded less than Wall Street. Its yield has risen fairly steadily in relative terms ever since, so that it now stands at 4.9 per cent compared with Wall Street's 2.9 per cent. Nor have high yields been a guarantee of performance within the London market itself. Figures from County NatWest show the London market's two worst sectors in the year to end-January as construction and property, with annual returns including dividends of minus 17 per cent and minus 14 per cent respectively. By this time last month the yield on construction shares had risen to 9 per cent and on property shares to 7 per cent. Even in terms of total return, both have underperformed since. Logically, all this reinforces the argument that if the ERM does its job the UK market is going to be a screaming buy. It still seems a little early for UK investors to bet on it.</p>

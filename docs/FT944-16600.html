			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities surge stimulated by solid earnings Wall Street US share prices surged yesterday as solid earnings news brought sharp gains to stocks across the board, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 55.51 higher at 3,876.83, a little lower than its session best. The index was held back by the triggering of NYSE restrictions on program-guided buying. The so-called 'downtick"rule went into effect at mid-morning, when the Dow pushed past more than 50 points higher than its opening mark. The rally was broad based, as reflected in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, up 6.75, or 1.5 per cent, at 465.79. On the NYSE, advancing issues were leading declines by about a three-to-one margin on heavy volume of 355m shares. The Nasdaq composite also staged a powerful advance, gaining 8.76 to 765.57. The American SE composite, up 1.78 at 457.76, lagged behind. It was the third day in a row in which stocks showed marked improvement. The sustained upturn reflected an easing of concerns over an immediate move by the Federal Reserve to lift short-term interest rates. The rally was given added impetus yesterday by a published report, quoting unnamed Fed officials, which suggested that policy makers would wait until their next scheduled meeting on November 15 before tightening credit conditions again., The shift in sentiment, which had begun when Friday's employment data proved to be weaker than expected, was quite evident in the Treasury market, where bond prices made further progress ahead of this week's inflation news. Meanwhile, equity investors had a smorgasbord of appealing corporate results from which to feast. PepsiCo gained Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 34 3/4 after beating the consensus forecast with net earnings of 68 cents a share. Motorola led the technology sector after revealing impressive quarterly results after the close of trading the previous session. Its shares were marked up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 54 with an upgrading by Merrill Lynch giving the stock added support. Digital Equipment forged Dollars 1 1/4 ahead to Dollars 29 1/2 on news that it had sold another of its marginal businesses. Chrysler was the first of the Big Three car makers to report, but the response to its announcement was restrained, even though its performance was better than most had predicted. The issue added Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 46 5/8 . International Paper's results were a disappointment, and its stock, down Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 77 1/2 , was one of only two Dow industrial components to lose ground. Several other cyclical stocks were up sharply as investors anticipated good news to come. Caterpillar gained Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 55 1/2 , General Electric was up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 48 1/4 and Deere jumped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 70 7/8 . There was something more tangible to boost confidence in Procter &amp; Gamble, up Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 62 1/4 . Its chairman told shareholders that the company had just completed its best quarter ever. Biogen backtracked a further Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 50. The company fell victim to profit-taking for a second day even though it had revealed that clinical trials for beta interferon, a multiple sclerosis treatment, were successful.</p>

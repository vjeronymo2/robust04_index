			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Cristian Nita report from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] Today, the president of the Republic of Moldova,  Mr. Mircea Snegur, received Vladlen Vasev, President Boris  Yeltsin's special envoy regarding eliminating dissensions in the  eastern sections of the Republic of Moldova.    As MOLDOVA PRES reports, Mr. Vasev reaffirmed President  Yeltsin's position, who, as mediator, pronounces himself for the  territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova and for solving  differences solely by political means.    In turn, President Snegur assessed that the parliamentary  elections and the sociological opinion poll `Consulting the  People,' within the framework of which the majority of the  population voted for the independence of the Republic of  Moldova, constitute two essential preconditions for the recovery  of the situation in the east of the Republic by granting that  area a legal status implying a high degree of local  administration.    In this context, it was stressed that laws in the Republic  of  Moldova are in keeping with the norms of a genuine democracy,  which envisage, first and foremost, the observance of human  rights, regardless of nationality.    During the dialogue, which was of a constructive nature, the  two sides also noted that relations between the Republic of  Moldova and Russia are developing fruitfully on the basis of  good understanding, MOLDOVA PRES reports.    The group of experts on behalf of the Republic of Moldova,  who participated in the preparation of the documents for the  meeting of the CIS state leaders, which is scheduled to be held  on 18 April, will conclude its activity today.    In an interview granted to the Moscow-based correspondent of  Chisinau radio, Mr. Iacob Mogoreanu, permanent representative of  the Republic of Moldova to the statutory bodies of the  community, emphasized that the accord on free trade in the CIS  economic area and the one on encouraging multinational  production corporations, associations, joint ventures, and  financial-credit organizations and institutions have been  prepared for signing. The CIS experts have also concluded the  initial stage of drafting a repayment system between the  economic units in CIS member countries.    Mr. Mogoreanu also specified that the proceedings on setting  up an interstate economic committee have begun; this is a body  that coordinates the economic activity, he said, without which  it is impossible for a community to exist.</p>

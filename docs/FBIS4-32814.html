			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the NTV newscast] </F>   [Text] The PRC Foreign Ministry has demanded that all U.S.  sanctions imposed on that country be lifted. The demand was  made after the United States renewed its most-favored-nation  trading status with the PRC. The Foreign Ministry underscored  in a declaration issued in the Chinese capital after Washington  announced its decision that the renovation will create favorable  conditions for strengthening and expanding bilateral economic  and trade relations. Before the Clinton administration's  announcement on trade with the PRC, U.S. businessmen had warned  that interrupting trade relations would cost U.S. consumers more  than $10 billion. Diplomatic sources in Beijing do not rule out  that the existing ties could be reinforced by a visit by U.S.  President Clinton to Beijing sometime this year.</p>

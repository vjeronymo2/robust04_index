			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (5): Era of the multinationals - Foreign direct investment / The development of communications and a change in political climate is altering the face of global manufacturing DIRECT investment by multinational corporations is becoming a hugely important force in the world economy. A recent study from the United Nations estimated that multinationals now control a third of the world's private productive assets. Their stock of foreign investments is now worth Dollars 2,000bn. The turnover generated by these assets in 1992 was bigger than total world exports. In other words, direct investment abroad is now a bigger economic force than world trade. Although investment worldwide has dropped sharply from its peak in 1990, it seems likely that the upward trend will resume. As the UN report points out, growth in foreign direct investment in the past couple of decades has averaged 13 per cent a year. In the period 1986-90 the rate was 28 per cent. That brief and unsustainable spurt was due partly to the economic boom of the late 1980s, partly to one-off changes such as the introduction of the European single market. The underlying arguments for growth in foreign direct investment remain unchanged. In essence, a combination of factors, such as the development of global communications and a change in the political climate towards multinationals, is bringing in an era of true global manufacturing. A company such as Siemens, the German electronics giant, may now start making a product in Germany, where precision and automation are required, then ship it to Malaysia for the labour-intensive final stages of manufacture. At the same time, much of its software research is undertaken in India, which has an abundant supply of cheap computing talent. Foreign direct investment is also proving an important force in the integration of national economies. Ford is developing its 'world car', known as the Mondeo in Europe and to be sold in North America next year as Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique. Components such as engines and transmissions for the car will be made at single locations and shipped worldwide. In semiconductors, Siemens, IBM and Toshiba have formed an alliance to develop the next generation of memory chip. The chip will be supplied to the world market from a single factory, in a country yet to be determined. As the UN report argues, such integration is also important at the regional level. The strategy by Japanese companies of locating production in cheaper Far Eastern countries such as Thailand and Malaysia has done much to integrate the economies of the region. US companies were setting up production in Mexico, for similar reasons, before negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement had even started. There is an important distinction to be made between the kind of integration based on trade, which is relatively simple, and the far more complex links involved in global manufacturing. The report says that 'as integration moves from shallow trade-based linkages to deep international production-based linkages under the common governance (of multinationals), the traditional division between integration at the corporate and country levels begins to break down'. As a result, the multinationals 'encroach on areas over which sovereignty and responsibilities have traditionally been reserved for national governments. This raises new issues of direct concern to the formation of national laws and regulations'. Foreign direct investment tends to transfer assets from the developed world to the developing world. But the pattern is not entirely simple. Last year, of a total of Dollars 126bn in foreign direct investment worldwide, Dollars 40bn - 32 per cent - went to developing countries. This represents an advance on the 26 per cent going to developing countries in the period 1981-85, but the change is not dramatic. In part, this is accounted for by the fact that big shifts have occurred in the composition of foreign direct investment by sector. Increasingly, investment is going into services and high-tech manufacture, rather than basic manufacture and natural resources. As might be expected, foreign direct investment in the developed world is mostly in the former category, whereas in the developing world the emphasis is on the latter. Increasingly, it seems, countries have to reach a basic level of sophistication before they can get in on the act. This is borne out by the fact that last year, the Dollars 40bn of foreign direct investment going to developing countries was spent almost wholly in two regions: east, south and south-east Asia got Dollars 21bn, while Latin America and the Caribbean got Dollars 16bn. The whole of Africa got a pitiful Dollars 2bn, while the sum invested in the least developed countries was too small to measure. Changing this pattern may prove a long job. Simple cash incentives to set up production in a country have little effect, other than on the margin. As any international businessman will tell you, if that is the best reason for going to a country you had better not go at all. In addition, the increasing sophistication of global production means that cheap labour is often not a deciding factor either. What companies often look for is threefold: a skilled local workforce, good infrastructure (especially telecommunications) and a welcoming attitude by government. Acquiring the first two is a long haul. But at least, something can be done about the third. The dangers of antagonising international investors can be illustrated by the case of an economy as sophisticated as that of South Korea which has a real need for inward investment primarily as a means of getting hold of technology. But a streak of xenophobia in the Korean character shades into downright antagonism when it comes to their former colonial masters, the Japanese. Korea traditionally has made things awkward for foreigners in terms of its financial system, its real estate laws and so forth. Last year, Korea saw a net outflow of foreign direct investment, a fact which seems to have brought the government to its senses. A concerted attempt is now being made to be nicer to foreigners. Whether it will reverse the damage remains to be seen. Across the world, the days when it paid to revile the multinationals are long gone. Like it or not, too much depends on them.</p>

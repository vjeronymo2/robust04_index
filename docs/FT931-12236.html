			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei clears 17,000 on interest rate hopes RENEWED hopes of a cut in the official discount rate and active buying by life assurers bolstered sentiment, and the Nikkei average surged by 3.4 per cent, clearing the 17,000 level for the first time since December 29, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index moved lower in early trading, falling to the day's low of 16,471.76, but moved ahead on late afternoon buying, hitting the day's best of 17,086.79 just before closing 553.73 ahead at 17,063.41. Volume rose from 220m shares to 300m, the highest since December 18. Advances overwhelmed declines by 862 to 123, with 128 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks climbed 31.77 to 1,291.87. In London, however, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 1.20 to 1,049.12. Short-covering by dealers and active buying by public funds and foreigners also pushed up share prices. Rumours that financial authorities and politicians were trying to oust Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, who has been seen as leading the opposition to easier monetary policy, prompted hopes of a discount rate cut. Some market participants speculated that the sudden surge was prompted by the Ministry of Finance, which has been nervous over recent market talk of a February crash. 'It seems as if the MoF is doing some arm-twisting,' said one analyst. Shipbuilders stayed active on calls by the Transport Ministry for regulations to prevent oil spills, including requirements for tankers to have double hulls. Sasebo Heavy Industries rose Y18 to Y543, Mitsui Shipbuilding put on Y20 at Y387 and Hitachi Zosen gained Y26 at Y516. Interest rate-sensitive electric power issues gained ground. Tokyo Electric Power moved ahead Y70 to Y2,570 and Tohoku Electric Power advanced Y80 to Y2,440. Isuzu Motors, the most active issue of the day, rose Y14 to Y364 on speculative buying by dealers on the 'restructuring' theme, which also lifted Oki Electric by Y11 to Y386. High-technology issues gained on short-covering. NEC, which had been weak recently on earnings worries, advanced Y33 to Y650 and Pioneer Electronic added Y130 at Y2,400. Mitsubishi Electric, which weakened in the morning on reports of lower than expected earnings, rebounded to finish Y8 up on balance at Y493. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 405.02 at 18,290.36 in volume of 51.2m shares. Roundup TOKYO'S rise left some Pacific Rim markets unimpressed. HONG KONG was marked broadly lower amid selling by overseas funds after renewed Chinese attacks in the Sino-British row. The Hang Seng index shed 135.39, or 2.28 per cent, to 5,804.50 in volume of HKDollars 2.58bn, up from Wednesday's HKDollars 2.03bn. Bank of East Asia's 36 per cent increase in 1992 profits, announced shortly after the afternoon session opened, was below some estimates. The shares slipped 25 cents to HKDollars 35.75. AUSTRALIA staged a slow advance after the release of data showing the annual inflation rate at just 0.3 per cent; but share prices fell away towards the close after the federal government downgraded its 1992-93 economic growth forecast to 2.5 per cent from 3.0 per cent. The All Ordinaries index ended barely above the day's low, down 8.1 at 1,526.7. Turnover was a light ADollars 230.64m. SINGAPORE failed for the second successive day to sustain an intra-day record high. The Straits Times Industrial index touched 1,607.91 in morning trade but profit-taking left it a net 4.84 down at 1,598.23. Volume improved to 65.47m shares from Wednesday's 56.86m. Singapore Press Foreign moved forward 60 cents to SDollars 15.70 amid reports of analysts rerating earnings and rumours of a cover price rise. SEOUL's composite index declined for the third day in a row, by 6.78 to this month's low of 687.79. MANILA was firmer and the composite index appreciated 16.56 to 1,340.90 in higher turnover of 4.3bn shares, compared with Wednesday's 2.4bn. KUALA LUMPUR was generally lower, with the composite index weakening 6.48 to finish at 618.41. Tenaga shed 30 cents to MDollars 9.20 in active trade, while Telekom lost 50 cents to MDollars 13. BANGKOK saw selling of leading bank stocks and the SET index slipped 8.87 to 974.54. BOMBAY climbed again on budget hopes, the BSE index rising 50.23 to 2,645.36 in hectic trading stimulated by this week's visits by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Banks 'may be breaking law' to obtain use of data BANKS may be both evading their own code of practice and breaking the law in the way they obtain permission from customers to use personal and account details, the office of the Data Protection Registrar said yesterday. Mr John Lamidey, assistant data protection registrar with responsibility for financial services, said he was seeking a meeting with the British Bankers' Association to raise concerns over how banks were obtaining and using data. Mr Lamidey said he was worried about the methods used by some banks to ensure that their customers gave permission for them to send out details of financial services and to try to sell the customers other products. He said clauses in some application forms which say that a customer must allow personal financial data to be used by all the bank's subsidiaries could amount to an evasion of the banking code of practice introduced last March. He also said that he was examining whether they contravened the first principle of the Data Protection Act, which says information held on computer databases must be obtained and processed fairly and lawfully by companies. The intervention comes after Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, launched an inquiry in December to discover how details of the Access credit card account of Mr Norman Lamont appeared in The Sun newspaper. The data protection office is also drawing up guidelines to ensure that companies understand the implications of the Data Protection Act's requirement that they should protect their data from disclosure by 'appropriate security measures'. Mr Lamidey said he was concerned at a clause in application forms for Barclaycard credit cards which says the bank can hold and process any information received about the customer by any Barclays Group company. The banks' code of practice says they should not disclose details of customers' accounts except in tightly controlled circumstances, such as when consent is given. Barclays Bank said last night it believed it was complying with both the code of banking practice and the Data Protection Act. It retained the right not to deal with new customers who did not want to give such permission. The British Bankers' Association said it was unaware of the data protection registrar's concern over the issue and had no reason to believe that members were breaching either the law or the code of banking practice.

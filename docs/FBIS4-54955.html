			<p>BFN     [Text] President of the Republic Sali Berisha received  Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi and Ministers Xhaja, Musaraj,  Manushi, and Halili in a long meeting. They informed the  president about the problems created by the strike as well as  the demands of the strikers, who represent families evicted as a  result of the construction of dams and hydropower stations.    At the meeting Prime Minister Meksi stressed that the  government has been and still is seriously engaged in treating  all the problems of evicted families as well as their reasonable  demands, despite the fact that in these demands there are some  things that are financially absurd and cannot be afforded.  Concerning these reasons, he is going to meet the  representatives of the evicted families on Sunday.    The ministers, who have established contacts with  representatives of the strikers, also said that the strikers'  claims constitute serious and fair demands in themselves.  Minister Halili noted that upon the government's order, the  Agriculture Ministry has compiled and continues to compile lists  of all evicted families and, according to its decision, will  present it to the government for examination by the end of May  to enable the government to take concrete measures to resolve  the problems of these families.    President Berisha said that he has studied the petition and  the demands of the evicted families, understands them quite  well, and is sensitive to the created problems and the  difficulties they have faced as a result of the eviction from  their land and houses.    Concerning yesterday's events in Kukes, he pointed out that  we have to deal with two realities: First, we have to deal with  several fair demands and serious difficulties of the evicted  families. Thus, in case there exists any absurd and  unreasonable demand, this does not mean that this factor should  darken, though little, the solution of the other fair demands.    Second, if two, five, or 10 elements of Enverist convictions  or evil aims managed to get among the strikers and disorient  them, the other reality represented by several separate  extremist elements should in no way lessen the urgent interest  of the government to treat the fair demands of the evicted  families with priority, because these manipulators who undertake  to usurp state buildings and block national roads have nothing  in common with the troubles and sorrows of the evicted  population.    The government should have shown and must show itself to be  more active in resolving their problems. It is necessary to  complete the registration of these families, to identify who has  received land according to the law and the ones who are left  with no land, who are employed and who are not, who have  received homes and who have not, and to start a program quickly  to solve the problems of these evicted families and compensate  them according to possibilities.    I am convinced that after seeing that the government is  concretely solving their problems, they will themselves  understand that several demands are unacceptable and will  abandon them. That is why the government and the parliament  should consider the problems of the evicted with priority and in  their complexity, President Berisha stated.</p>

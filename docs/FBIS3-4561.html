Gaviria, who arrived in Japan on Saturday for a five-day  visit, expressed interest in joining APEC at a meeting with  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the officials said.    Gaviria also said he wants Japan to become a "bridge" in  strengthening ties between Colombia and the Asia-Pacific region,  they said.    Hosokawa told Gaviria Japan welcomes the strengthening of  ties between Colombia and the Asia-Pacific region and that he  thinks bilateral ties between Colombia and Japan will increase.    In the November APEC meeting in Seattle, Mexico and Papua  New  Guinea won membership to the forum, while Chile was named to  become a member this year. The group froze further membership  applications through 1996, however.    Ministry officials said Japan will take into account  Colombia's bid and will convey the intention to other members of  APEC.    Also during the 20-minute meeting at the prime minister's  official residence, Hosokawa told Gaviria Japan has decided to  extend yen loans to Colombia for an agricultural development  project along the Ariari River, the officials said.    Japanese and Colombian officials are currently negotiating  the amount of the loans, they said.    Hosokawa said Japan is considering sending a mission to  Colombia within fiscal 1994 to study participation in a project  to improve the traffic network in the capital city of Bogota.    Japan will also extend a cultural grant-in-aid of 45 million  yen to Bolivar Memorial Museum for its purchases of audiovisual  equipment, Hosokawa said.    Turning to economic relations, Gaviria urged Japan to import  tropical fruits from Colombia and to have cut flowers  quarantined in Colombia before exporting them to Japan, the  officials said.    He also said Colombia wants to export coal and petrol in the  future.    Japanese ambassador to Colombia Masaki Yagi, who accompanied  Hosokawa in the meeting, said the matters concerning tropical  fruits and cut flowers should be discussed when Colombia's  agricultural minister visits Japan in April and that the coal  and petrol issues should be discussed among the private sector.</p>

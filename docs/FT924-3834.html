			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Yeltsin could bypass Congress PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin could bypass the increasingly hostile Russian Congress of People's Deputies and appeal to the people for extra powers and approval for a new constitution if votes go against him in the assembly today. Deputies will vote for a series of amendments to the constitution - already a palimpsest of the old Soviet constitution - which in sum would force Mr Yeltsin to gain their approval not just for the appointment of a prime minister but also for the naming of every important figure in the cabinet. In a brief speech yesterday, Mr Yeltsin said that many of the amendments would 'reverse the development of Russia's statehood. . . the country would get a weak government, whoever was its leader.' Later, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary, said the Congress would be 'out of its head' to oppose the president. He hinted that Mr Yeltsin would go to the country with a demand for extra powers and for the approval of a new constitution if deputies get the required two-thirds majority for their amendments today. Drafts of an appeal to the nation were said by aides to be under preparation yesterday, though neither Mr Yeltsin nor any of his ministers made further attempts to influence the vote. The deputies will vote in secret on these vital clauses, and much of yesterday's business was devoted to selecting which of the amendments merited this treatment. The anti-government, even anti-presidential, mood of the assembly was demonstrated yesterday when the deputies voted 668-210 to support in principle a resolution thoroughly critical of the progress of economic reform, calling it 'contrary to the interests of most people'. The motion did not, however, call for the government's resignation and government supporters intend to seek changes and deletions when it is debated clause by clause. The government's opponents also have a steep hill to climb. A constitutional amendment requires two-thirds of the available votes of 1,040 deputies. Inevitably, some deputies will fail to turn up at the session, thus weakening the chances of attaining that figure: yesterday's attendance was around 930. Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, a centrist deputy who is also secretary of the constitutional commission, pointed to one possible solution when he said he would vote for some of the general amendments curtailing the president's powers - thus firing a warning shot at Mr Yeltsin - but would not support the detailed amendments which spelled out the number of ministers who must be confirmed by the parliament. Even if the amendments are not passed, however, the problem of the division of powers among the president, the Congress and the government remains. Mr Yeltsin has proposed a massive shift of authority, especially over economic reform, in his direction. But there is almost certainly not a simple, let alone a two-thirds, majority in the Congress for that. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, said in a speech that 'the position of our government is stable enough, our determination is strong enough, not to allow a revanchist reversal in international affairs'.</p>

Shanghai's economic and urban  construction as well as social development will enter an  important phase in 1994 with more emphasis being laid on the  financial front.    Huang Ju passed on these remarks when he addressed the  Shanghai municipal financial work meeting yesterday. In his  speech, Huang Ju fully affirmed results achieved by the  financial system. [passage omitted]    On work to be carried out in 1994, Huang Ju said: Various  reform and construction programs to be carried out in Shanghai  this year will be very arduous; their implementation will depend  on the financial circles' support. He forwarded four demands to  Shanghai's financial system:    First, it is necessary to conscientiously study Volume Three  of "The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," thoroughly understand  its spirit and substance, unify thinking and understanding, and  make efforts to create a new socialist financial situation under  which financial departments will be charged with the  responsibility of exercising macroeconomic regulation and  control. Second, it is necessary to firmly implement the  state's monetary policy by placing total credit volumes under  strict control. Shanghai must foster the concept of taking the  whole nation as a chess game and resolutely carry out the  central authorities' policies. On the premise of placing total  credit volumes under strict control, various financial  organizations should intensify fund-raising and financing,  broaden sources of both credits and funds, strengthen funds  deployment, speed up cash flow, and gradually enhance and  improve the ability to flexibly exercise macroeconomic  regulation and control. Besides, Shanghai's financial  departments should contribute to economic restructuring by  stepping up research on enterprise reform and the creation of a  new enterprise system. Third, on the basis of correctly  handling relations among reform, development, and stability,  Shanghai's financial circles should grasp the opportunity to  actively and steadily promote financial reform and opening up.  Fourth, we should persist in maintaining the high quality of  financial personnel. Leaders at various levels should attach  greater importance to fighting corruption and building a  management system, prevent and curb economic crimes, and uphold  the principle of "fostering both material progress and cultural  and ideological progress" by strengthening the building of  spiritual civilization within the financial system.

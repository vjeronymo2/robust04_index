			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> GARRY SHANDLING, HIMSELF, TO LIVE  </P> <P> Reports of the death of Garry Shandling's character on the final "It's Garry  Shandling's Show" are premature.  </P> <P> The last show's theme is death -- Shandling's, specifically.  </P> <P> And though the lead character is killed off, in the tradition of television  series endings, there is a surprise.  </P> <P> In its inevitable style, "It's Garry Shandling's Show" ends with Shandling  talking right to viewers at home.  </P> <P> "People always say, 'Is it your show or is it your life?' " Shandling says to  the camera. "This is just a show."  </P> <P> The final episode of the show, which made its debut four years ago on the  Showtime cable network, is slated for telecast on June 1.  </P> <P> "We both made this decision a long time ago," co-creator and producer Alan  Zweibel said during a taping of the final show earlier this week. "It's time to  try something else."  </P></p>

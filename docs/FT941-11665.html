			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Technology: All at sea from the safety of a warehouse - Simulators are being used for training, design and crisis management Standing on the bridge of a crude oil tanker, manoeuvring towards the entrance of Tokyo Bay, our course is compromised by a cargo vessel coming from the starboard. Curious to see how the ship simulator handles a collision, I take aim at the cargo vessel and ask the first mate how long we must wait for the moment of impact. The answer is a patience-testing 'about five minutes'. More sophisticated than a video game, but slower with the thrills and spills, the Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industry (IHI) simulator is intended to give a ship's crew experience at the helm in the safety of a small warehouse. Because standard instruments are used on the bridge, the simulator has a reality that is more than virtual and the sound effects that come with a collision are convincing. But even so, it is difficult to get away from the sense that you are in a big room in central Tokyo surrounded by a video screen, and this detracts from the tension of the experience. IHI, the first Japanese company to build a simulator, in 1975, has just sold a Y1bn (Pounds 6m) version to a maritime college in Bombay, and claims the ability to recreate any international port setting or narrow-necked strait for training purposes. All the company needs is a collection of images and relevant information about the shifting currents in the area. To imitate conditions on a real ship, IHI has put speakers under the floor of the bridge, providing the crew with the vibrations that would come from an engine beneath them. From behind the nautical instruments, the video projection extends 225 degrees, covering the entire field of vision with five overlapping screens. A shipbuilder by trade, IHI has put standard instruments on the 'mimic bridge', as it is called. The customer can then choose the type of mother ship it requires - a tanker, car carrier, a ferry or large fishing vessel. Potential obstacles range from a dimly-lit buoy to an errant yacht in the shipping lanes. Yoshitsugu Matsuura, the manager of the simulator project group at IHI, is a little touchy when reminded of the similarity between an arcade video car-racing game and a state-of-the-art ship simulator. 'They are on a different scale and very different in their sophistication. A video game has a video base and the simulator is a collection of different technologies.' It is very sophisticated. When our vessel eventually collided with the cargo vessel, there was a realistic scraping of metal, giving the impression that we were badly holed and taking on water fast. On a separate simulator model, designed to give the impression of being behind the wheel of a twin-hulled jet propelled cruiser, our vessel passed silently through the video image of a container carrier at the moment of impact. IHI has paid attention to detail in creating the sea's texture, knowing that the simulator's effectiveness will be devalued if trainees do not sense that they are at sea. The blue bubbles and whirling currents are a blend of computer graphics and video images. When the computer programmer turns down the lights for night navigating, the simulated sea becomes convincingly dark and forbidding, with the lights of land flickering in the distance. After setting an obstacle course, the teacher is able to record the response times of trainees at a separate terminal, returning after an exercise to point out the faults of a clumsy attempt to dock or the dangers of failing to give way at the entrance of a simulated harbour. Apart from teaching trainees to avoid accidents, the equipment can be used to recreate an accident scene. By programming the course of two vessels, and copying the surrounding sea and weather conditions, whether it be a fog-shrouded harbour or the rushing waters of high tide, investigators are supposed to be able to experience an accident themselves. Demand for the simulators is still a little slower than the cruising speed of a very large crude carrier. Matsuura said IHI expects to sell one every year or two, though the increasing sophistication of the electronic components means the simulator is coming closer and closer to the real thing and could generate interest from colleges which have so far preferred to do their training at sea. The equipment is part of the management justification for IHI's own investment in electronics which has little direct relevance to the building of ships, oil rigs or the other heavy industrial structures in which it has most expertise. Japanese shipbuilders and steel companies have been enthusiastic converts to the semiconductor and computer industries, believing that as steel has traditionally been the country's 'industrial rice', the chip is the industrial rice of the present and future.</p>

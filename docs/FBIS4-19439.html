			<p>BFN     [Text] Fighting and slaughters are probably continuing in  Rwanda, but reports have become very sparse. Most foreigners  have left, including journalists. However, Kigali has still not  fallen into the hands of the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF], but the Rwandan capital is totally surrounded.    Captain Witner was among the paratroopers on the ground. He  came back this morning with others. He was able to observe the  strategy of the RPF and that of the Rwandan Armed Forces, their  adversaries. Listen to the explanations he gave earlier to  Francoise Walminck:    [Begin Witner recording] From a tactical viewpoint, the RPF  behaves in a much more consistent, more ordered manner than the  Rwandan Armed Forces. One can see that these people have been  trained in Uganda. Very often their leaders were trained in  England, and that can be seen in the way they work. They are  officers, they wear the same uniforms, they are much more  disciplined than the Rwandan Armed Forces. From a tactical  viewpoint, each ground attack is preceded by artillery  preparation which is methodical, systematic, and ordered.    [Walminck] What is their strategy?    [Witner] Well, we do not have much information on the forces  present around Kigali. I imagine that they work mainly in small  groups on foot. They infiltrate at night around the positions  of the RPF and the noose is tightening more and more around  Kigali. However, it is very difficult for the moment to assess  the number of troops given the way they work. There is no  classical front such as those in normal conflicts, but they  infiltrate, they are light infantry.    [Walminck] A few days ago, it was believed that the RPF was  about to take the town any minute. However, the presidential  guard seems to be resisting.    [Witner] The presidential guard is getting ready for the  siege of Kigali. It goes without saying that the RPF has  practically cut off Kigali from any external reinforcements,  from any possibility of external reinforcements.    [Walminck] Is the presidential guard confining itself to the  inside?    [Witner] It has barricaded itself in, it has used as much  armament as possible on the main accesses to the town. It is  waiting. I believe that it will not let the town of Kigali go  easily.    [Walminck] Do you think they can hold out for long?    [Witner] This could last longer than we expect. [end  recording]    Captain Witner, whom you have just heard, is one of the  officers who returned this morning. These officers took part in  the repatriation of foreigners. On board the planes which  arrived in Brussels earlier today were 43 paratroopers from  Flavinne, companions of the 10 who lost their lives in Rwanda.  The leitmotiv in their mouths when they arrived was that rules  of engagement and the limitation on the use of weapons which  they had to heed is absurd and criminal in their eyes.</p>

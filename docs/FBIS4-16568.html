			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, </F> by Larysa Troyan, on 30 March, place not given: "Political  Pressure Will Be Neutralized by Political Resistance"]    [Excerpts] [Troyan] My first question is to warm you up:  Do you like being president?    [Meshkov] That is some warm-up! Frankly speaking, I have  had no time to think about it.    [Troyan] How would you comment on the results of the  Ukrainian Supreme Council elections?    [Meshkov] Outright fascists in legislative seats are too  dangerous for anybody. This is an extremely unfavorable  situation for the Crimea.    [Troyan] Why did you appeal to the Crimeans not to vote for  Ukrainian Supreme Council deputies and to take ballots home  instead?    [Meshkov] This was an attempt to protect ourselves from the  extreme forms of nationalism.    [Troyan] How would you assess the preliminary results of the  Crimean legislative elections?    [Meshkov] The results denied the claims that at the  presidential elections our electors, the citizens of the  Republic of Crimea, voted against the former administration  rather than for a concrete candidate and a concrete program. It  has turned out that they voted for the "Russia" bloc.    [Troyan] Do you think that this stance is a kind of  reproach, a challenge for the Ukrainian leadership, an overt  orientation toward Russia, or something else?    [Meshkov] This was normal human reaction to the  demonstration of extreme nationalist trends tolerated by the  current Ukrainian leadership. Thus, the leadership has in a way  become a promoter of nationalist policies. This was an attempt  to abandon unwise economic and social policies. Besides, the  Crimean people are part of the Russian nation.    [Troyan] How would you evaluate the results of the Crimean  poll? I interpret these results in the following way: Crimeans  have embarked on the road to unconditional autonomy. Am I not  right?    [Meshkov] Crimeans cast their votes for having the right to  be the masters of their own fates, to independently build normal  and logical economic relations, and to determine the optimal  variants of these relations. Over the last two years, economic  here reform has been artificially blocked. Unwise tax and  customs policies, as well as many other stupid things have been  forced on us, although they are absolutely unacceptable for the  Crimea. All these measures have been dictated by the ambitions  of people with nationalist views.    [Troyan] Are you not expecting similar "forcing" on the side  of Russia?    [Meshkov] I am not. We are speaking about maximizing the  ability to pursue independent economic policies in cooperation  with both Russia and Ukraine. This is not a drive toward  separation, once characteristic of Ukraine in its relations with  Russia. On the contrary, this is a desire to unify economies  and enter the common economic space with Russia and republics  like Kazakhstan, which are ready for such unification. The  Crimean citizens are ready for this too, and this was confirmed  by recent events. Our people are not driven by purely economic  considerations. They also need a new kind of, let me put it  this way, labor motivation. When unacceptable barriers are  removed between Russia and Crimea, when there are no more  customs houses and checkpoints favored only by inefficient  officials, everybody will gain from this.    [Troyan] If I properly understand what you mean, the Crimea  aims to float between Scylla and Charybdis of Russian and  Ukrainian problems to achieve a breakthrough in economic reform.    [Meshkov] We have potential to carry out reform rapidly. We  are not burdened with the gigantic mass of unresolved problems  resting on Ukraine's shoulders. Neither do we have problems  like those Russia has, given its vast territory and colossal  economic structure.    [Troyan] Do you believe that the Crimea might become a kind  of experimental project, a future model for the expeditious  introduction of reform in both Russia and Ukraine?    [Meshkov] We do not aim to become a model, the so-called  "five-year plan heroes," although we would have nothing against  becoming "production leaders." I believe that we will have  enough wisdom to choose the most optimal economic scheme, all  the more so since we are not limited by any ideological or  nationalist restrictions. The influence of the Communist Party  in the Crimea, unlike Ukraine and Russia, is virtually minimal.    [Troyan] In other words, you believe that Crimeans are  standing on the ground of sound pragmatism.    [Meshkov] Yes. I would say that Crimean mentality is rather  individualistic due to the kind of life that we live. The  Crimea has been a melting pot of various civilizations and  cultures -- this has always been accepted without antagonism or  hindrance. In other words, here we are dealing with a higher  degree of self-respect, and thus respect toward other people.    [Troyan] Does this mean that your favorite book is Vasiliy  Aksenov's "Island Crimea"?    [Meshkov, laughing] It is one of my favorites.    [Troyan] If this is no secret, what prompted your choice of  Mr. Saburov for deputy prime minister? Was that age-long  friendship or political sympathy?    [Meshkov] It is still too early to talk about this. There  are a lot of arguments in favor of Saburov's candidacy....    [Troyan] How long have you known him?    [Meshkov, disregarding the question] ....and I accepted  these  arguments. [passage omitted]    [Troyan] Who will form your new Cabinet of Ministers? Will  Saburov be granted powers for this?    [Meshkov] Of course he will. Saburov and I shared  responsibility for the future of economic reform in the Crimea,  and now we are going to share responsibility for the forming of  the government.    [Troyan] In an interview conducted on 27 March, Leonid  Kravchuk said: "The Crimea will remain in Ukraine regardless of  a further scenario, given that both the Crimea receives drinking  water and supplies for sowing from Ukraine." How would you  comment on that?    [Meshkov] President Kravchuk probably meant something else,  but this phrase could be understood as follows: If the Crimea  remains in Ukraine, it will have both drinking water and seeds  for sowing; if it chooses to live without Ukraine, Ukraine will  not supply either water or seeds. I do not like the ambiguity  of this statement, because in this case the problem can be posed  differently: If Ukraine's attitude toward the Crimea is normal,  Ukraine will receive both gas from Turkmenistan and electric  power from Russia. The very Dnieper water then, so to say, will  be supplied by Russia. I would not like to talk this way; I do  not want to accept this unfriendly tone. There would be no  unfriendly attitude if we spoke about our share in Ukraine's  national wealth. This [Ukraine's] stance is yet more proof that  the Crimea is alien to Ukraine.    [Troyan] According to President Kravchuk, Ukraine is ready  to delegate vast economic powers to the Crimea. Here is another  quote from Leonid Kravchuk's interview: "Rumors about the  introduction of any other currency are absurd. However, we  should remove political issues from the Crimean agenda."    [Meshkov] We would be more than happy to remove political  issues from the agenda, provided that nobody meddles in our  economy. We have no other intentions.    [Troyan] Are you going to create a free economic zone?    [Meshkov] We are going to create a normal economy and  planning to provide it with appropriate legal acts. Our only  request is: Do not interrupt us; do not force on us those laws  that were adopted to satisfy somebody's whims and have nothing  in common with economic principles.    If we are permitted we will take care of the Crimean economy  without anybody's help. If somebody attempts to exert pressure  and reap political dividends from letting us overstep some  foolish law; if somebody attempts to use the formal discrepancy  between our and Ukrainian normative acts for political pressure,  in this case we will react by means of political methods.  Political pressure will be neutralized by political resistance.    [Troyan] Speaking about political pressure you only mean one  side, namely Kiev. Does this mean that you totally dismiss  similar actions on the side of Moscow?    [Meshkov] I do not expect such actions from the Russian  side. It would be blasphemy if somebody told us that we would  receive gasoline and lumber only as long as we stay with Russia.    [Troyan] Thus, your relations with Russia are developing in  a more favorable manner?    [Meshkov] No. But the Russian leader will never utter words  similar to President Kravchuk's.    [Troyan] The press has reported your interest in Mr.  Yavlinskiy. What prompted it?    [Meshkov] In light of my professional skills (economic  issues were treated very seriously at Moscow State University  and I have acquired a taste for economy), I believe that I can  rather impartially evaluate Mr. Yavlinskiy's propensities and  the correctness and logic of his suggestions. That is the  source of my deep respect for this talented economist.    [Troyan] Does this mean that Yavlinskiy will take part in  drafting the economic model of Crimean reform?    [Meshkov] I would be extremely grateful to Mr. Yavlinskiy  for any kind of assistance. By the way, I want to point out  that East European economists are ready to render us similar  aid. According to preliminary reports Lady Thatcher is also  ready to do so, although she has not confirmed this yet.    [Troyan] Are you really determined to ensure simultaneous  circulation of both rubles and karbovantsi? There are also  rumors about dollars and German marks.    [Meshkov] We will be happy to accept yen, guldens, and  pounds too.    [Troyan] What do your economic advisers say about this?  What do they predict?    [Meshkov] They predict an inflow of capital.    [Troyan] Do Crimeans believe that there will be a stream of  foreign investments?    [Meshkov] No. There is no euphoria or anticipation of  streams of investments. We are ready to provide possibilities  to earn money in the Crimea on the basis of mutual advantage and  sober calculation. Our citizens will grant assistance. I do  not mean exploitation of people. I want to underline that we  are devoid of all kinds of ideological dogmas. Participation in  developing the Crimean economy is profitable.[passage omitted]    [Troyan] Do you guarantee that there will be no corruption  in your executive bodies?    [Meshkov] I do!    [Troyan] How are going to fight this evil phenomenon? As  far as I know, humankind has not invented an efficient medicine  to cure this disease.    [Meshkov] There is medicine, and a very strong one. It will  be applied. [passage omitted]    [Troyan] Why do you tend to avoid speaking about Mr.  Zhirinovskiy?    [Meshkov] First of all, because he is my university mate;  there exists an unwritten Moscow University brotherhood of a  special kind. Secondly, this is undoubtedly a talented person.  A certain newspaper reported that I admire Mr. Zhirinovskiy.  There is no admiration; however, I developed respect for his  political talent regardless of anybody's views. [passage omitted]</p>

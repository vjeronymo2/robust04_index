			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hoechst declines 7% in first quarter PROFITS at Hoechst, the German chemicals group, have fallen by around 7 per cent in the first quarter of the current year, Mr Jurgen Dormann, finance director, said yesterday. The year had got off to a 'miserable' start and there was no sign of improvement, according to Mr Wolfgang Hilger, group chairman. Price pressures had increased, and there were now fears that volume sales would be hit by falling demand. The continuing decline in Hoechst's profits, following a 17.7 per cent pre-tax fall during the whole of 1992, and a 26 per cent slump in the first three months of last year, would force the group to make further savings, he added. 'This has become the bitter truth, not only in chemicals but in other important sectors,' Mr Dormann said. Uneconomic plant would be shut and the German workforce, reduced by 4,100 last year to 81,000 would fall further. Some 3,000 places would go at the parent, reducing the payroll there to 50,000. Around 3,900 people were currently working on short-time in Germany and they would be joined next month by a 500 PVC film workers. Although Mr Dormann gave no details, he said the German business, which accounts for almost half of group turnover, had been hit especially hard in the first quarter. Pharmaceuticals sales had fallen 17 per cent in the first two months, under pressure from health spending cuts. Mr Hilger added that while the group's overall foreign turnover fell 2 per cent in January and February, domestic business had declined by an 'alarming' 15 per cent, resulting in a 5 per cent decline to DM7bn. Sales had fallen in all sectors. The company spent DM770m during 1992 on restructuring, of which DM565m went on job reductions.</p>

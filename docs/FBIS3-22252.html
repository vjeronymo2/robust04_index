The consignment of copper and zinc, described on import  documents as ``micronutrients for use as a fertiliser,'' was  impounded by the Sao Paulo State Environment Protection Agency  and found also to contain the poisonous metals arsenic, lead,  mercury and cadmium.    Copper and zinc could be used in minute amounts to enrich  tropical soils deficient in trace metals.    Produquimica, the Sao Paulo fertilizer company which  received  the shipment, said it was supplied by the Islington firm, London  Metals.    The Warwickshire Waste Regulation Authority said the  cocktail  of metals involved were capable of poisoning people, plants or  animals.    The environmental group Greenpeace said the materials,  regardless of how they were described, were waste, because they  were the residue of an industrial process.    They are seeking to hold up the incident as an example of  the  legal loophole under which toxic waste, properly described, may  be exported to Third World countries for ``recycling,'' though  exports of waste for dumping and incineration are banned.    The company which supplied the material to London Metals,  Metallic Extractors of Water Orton, Birmingham, describes the  material as a ``standard product'' controlled under regulations  governing the recycling of metals.    Metallic Extractors confirmed the material included lead,  cadmium, arsenic and mercury in small quantities and that it had  supplied a complete analysis of the product with it. The company  said it did not know the material was going to Brazil. London  Metals refused to comment.    Jose Roberto Falconi, regional director of the Agency, said:  ``The material was being shipped back yesterday on our orders  after tests showed it did not fulfil import requirements.''    At the least, say industry sources, the incident proves that  the legal definition of what constitutes waste is far from  clear. If the material is legally found to be technically waste,  it could yet be proved that London Metals should have had  different export documents.    The Department of the Environment is investigating the  incident.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama yesterday confirmed his huge  popularity in the city of Beira. More than 20,000 people  gathered at the city center's CFM [Mozambique Railroad] square  to watch and listen.    They began gathering at 0600 as scores of people arrived  from  within and outside the city. The rally was scheduled to begin  at 0800, but the Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] leader  only arrived at 1230. Despite the long delay, everybody stayed  put.    The rally ended at approximately 1500. People nearly invaded  the tribune. The atmosphere of popular sympathy for Dhlakama  was at one stage opposed by a group of war crippled who showed  up, holding placards demanding compensation and the "return" of  their limbs.    There were instances of violence -- which did not stop the  rally -- when Renamo sympathizers surrounded the crippled and  took their placards which were then destroyed.    Dhlakama's speech was basically a triumphant and emotional  one, centering around his own image. The Renamo leader left the  rally saying that "I have already won" in Beira.    His speech was marked by a lack of any reference to Renamo's  program for the future. This was an issue raised at the 22 June  meeting with Beira's businessmen. A local businessman told  MEDIAFAX that the audience heard Dhlakama reiterating his  solidarity with the Mozambican business sector and his  commitment to a market economy; that pleased businessmen. The  source added, however, that businessmen left the meeting with  the impression that Dhlakama has no concrete economic program to  present.    After yesterday's rally and at journalists' request,  Dhlakama  gave a news conference during which he reiterated his opposition  to war. A journalist asked him why he only asks for money for  Renamo and not for reconstructing the country whenever he  travels abroad.    He replied that "the priority" right now is to establish  Renamo among the people and that economic matters are "for the  government." He added that he would deal with he country's  economic matters once he was in government.    All our sources have told us that Dhlakama's visit to Beira  proceeded without unrest between Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation  Front] and Renamo sympathizers and served to confirm what was  expected -- that the country's second largest city is the main  center of electoral support for Renamo and for Dhlakama in  particular.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Turkey's patent law ready MR Kaan Dericioglu, an Ankara lawyer, has spent 10 years on a government commission preparing a patent law for Turkey. The current draft, the eighth since 1951, is now back in the cabinet in-tray awaiting ministerial approval before being submitted to parliament. The patent law, a major bone of contention with both the US and the EC, is seen as a test case of Turkey's commitment to liberalise its economy. At a symposium in Ankara this week, Mr Tahir Kose, Turkey's trade and industry minister, predicted a new patent law would be passed before the year ends. The new draft, despite some shortcomings, is welcomed as a 'vast improvement' by western diplomats in Ankara. But problems remain. The draft updates a 1879 patent law. As originally drafted, it included full protection for pharmaceuticals, which was explicitly excluded in earlier proposals. Since the commission finished its work in 1990, the State Planning Organisation (SPO) has moved to water down the draft. Already, the law is only to apply to drugs after a 10-year transition period. Turkey is also to introduce compulsory licensing, which requires a foreign company to license a drug with a local producer even if he does market it in Turkey. The law provides no protection during the so-called pipeline period, during which new molecules are registered, and the drugs go through clinical trials before going to the health ministry for approval. 'Taken with the transition period, this means that for the next 22 years no new molecule will be protected in Turkey,' one foreign executive said. Mr Ergun Ozsunay, professor of civil law at Istanbul University and a member of the commission, believes that even if the draft gets through cabinet in its present form, it may meet opposition in parliament, where nationalist sentiment on issues such as patent remain strong. Remembering the bitter experience of earlier failures, Mr Dericioglu suggests it might be advisable to exclude pharmaceuticals, at least to have some form of patent protection on the statute books. For many ordinary Turks, the commercial priorities of the foreign multinational drug companies seem increasingly at odds with the health needs of Turkey's poor. But the battle lines are now drawn between the foreign pharmaceutical concerns, and the health ministry and its supporters among big local producers. Industry officials point out, of total world market of about 3,000 drugs, just 72 products are now under patent. In Turkey, patentable products account for 20 per cent of total annual drug sales of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m), the rest being generics or cheap copies of patent brand-name drugs. Of the 72 products, 24 are imitated by some 200 local copies. The health ministry, backed by the large local drug concerns, is arguing that patent law would provide carte blanche for foreign companies to raise prices. Foreign drug companies estimate the cost to Turkey of a new patent law at just Dollars 25m - the difference in unit price between the patented product and the copy. Those opposing the law fear losing market share to foreign competition. Eczacibasi, Turkey's largest drug company, with 16 per cent of the market, is arguably well able to compete with foreign companies, and publicly is committed to protection. But Mr Ayhan Suskun, the technical director, argues for a transition period to let local companies catch up. 'If you are planning to be in the international market, you have to have a patent law. The question is, how soon it should be applied,' he says. Industry officials are concerned any backsliding on the patent law will deepen a worsening crisis in the sector.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / China lifts stakes in HK standoff CHINA raised the stakes yesterday in its tense standoff with Britain over Hong Kong when it warned that it would scrap the colony's legislature after 1997 if the two sides fail to reach agreement on arrangements for an orderly transition. Mr Jiang Enzhu, China's vice foreign minister, issued what amounted to Beijing's clearest threat yet that it would not abide by the results of elections if they had not been held under rules agreed between the two sides. 'If an agreement cannot be reached, there's nothing extraordinary about that either. Under that circumstance, the organs elected in 1994 and 1995 will terminate on June 30 1997,' Mr Jiang told reporters. China's chief negotiator was speaking before sitting down for the 13th round of talks on the vexed Hong Kong issue with Britain's ambassador in Beijing, Sir Robin McLaren. Hong Kong governor Chris Patten warned last week that within a 'matter of weeks' he would be obliged to present to the Legislative Council (Legco) a bill extending the franchise for local elections due in 1994 and Legco in 1995. China is bitterly opposed to Mr Patten's democratic reforms, claiming they run counter to agreements reached in the 1980s over the future of the colony which reverts to Chinese rule in July 1997. Mr Jiang's threat would mean that, in the absence of agreement between Beijing and London there would be no 'through train' after the handover. This refers to legislators elected for four years continuing to serve after the Chinese takeover. British and Chinese officials declared that their talks in Beijing on the future of Hong Kong were at a 'crossroads'. Sir Robin McLaren agreed that the talks were at a 'crossroads', and said 'the question at issue is whether we can make a success of these talks or not'. 'We believe that if the political will is there on both sides, and working within the framework we have set for ourselves . . . it should be perfectly possible to reach agreement on arrangements for 1994-95 elections which are open, fair and acceptable to Hong Kong.'

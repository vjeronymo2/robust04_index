			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Shares in Guernsey A Guernsey resident, non-domiciled for UK tax purposes, has a portfolio of UK company shares registered in a Guernsey nominee company. Does this afford any protection against liability to UK inheritance tax? Is the ultimate protection to have them owned by an offshore company or trust? Assuming the shares are registered on a UK register, a liability to UK inheritance tax arises since the determining factor is the beneficial and not the legal ownership. Even if assets remain liable to IHT, there is a Pounds 150,000 nil rate band which is available to UK and non-UK domiciled individuals alike; therefore, any transfers of up to this amount will not suffer a UK inheritance tax charge. If the value exceeds this figure, you might wish to consider transferring the beneficial ownership of the shares to an offshore company. (Answer by Barry Stillerman of Stoy Hayward). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

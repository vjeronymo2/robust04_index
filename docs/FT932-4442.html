			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Universities allowed to charge top-up fees for tuition UNIVERSITIES are free to levy top-up tuition charges on students, Mr Tim Boswell, the higher-education minister, said yesterday. Mr Boswell told a conference of lecturers' unions that academic autonomy meant it was 'up to individual institutions whether they decided to charge top-up fees'. His comments follow a proposal by the London School of Economics to charge its students an extra tuition fee of between Pounds 500 and Pounds 1,000 for the academic year of 1994-95. They were interpreted as an attempt to soften up public opinion on the issue. Cuts in funding for tuition have been mooted as part of the review of public expenditure being conducted by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury. The LSE emphasised that its proposal, which it expects to ratify by the end of this term, was a result of the government's decision to cut the tuition fees it pays for classroom-based courses next year from Pounds 1,850 to Pounds 1,300 a student. It said bursaries would be available for all those who at present receive no contribution from their parents towards living costs. An official said: 'We have no intention of excluding anyone because they cannot pay.' However, wealthier parents, many of them Conservative voters, would have to pay the extra fees in full. Mr Boswell sought to distance himself from the LSE's decision by saying the move had not been initiated by him or the education department. 'We have no plans either to move towards overall fees or to encourage institutions to do so,' he said. 'If they were imposed without some matching system of bursaries, they could be regressive in their effect.' Mr Jeff Rooker, Labour's higher-education spokesman, said: 'The government is encouraging universities to charge extra fees by manipulating the notional fee mechanism.' He predicted that a handful of universities at most would be able to follow the LSE, creating a 'two-tier education system'. The Higher Education Funding Council for England, which distributes public funds to universities, endorsed Mr Boswell's stance. Mr Graeme Davies, its chief executive, said the council would not take a university's extra sources of funding into account when allocating funds, and that a decision on extra fees was 'within the arena of institutional autonomy'. Few other universities seem likely to follow suit in the near future, according to the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals.</p>

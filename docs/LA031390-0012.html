			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 ARMENIAN TEEN-AGERS HELD IN RACIAL  INCIDENT  </P> <P> Glendale police said Monday they have arrested two Armenian teen-agers in  connection with racial slurs and vandalism directed at black and Korean  residents last month.  </P> <P> Authorities said the case stood in contrast to last year's trend, in which six  of the eight hate crimes recorded in Glendale in 1989 were directed at the  city's growing Armenian community.  </P> <P> Officer Christopher S. Loop said that in the most recent incidents, the youths,  both 17, are suspected of shouting a racial epithet and hurling a beer can at a  black man and woman whose car was stopped at Brand Boulevard and Glenoaks Drive  on Feb. 6. The youths also are accused of spray-painting Nazi symbols and  racial slurs Feb. 1 on the walls of the predominantly Korean Glendale Calvary  Presbyterian Church on Kenneth Road.  </P> <P> Loop said investigators would seek charges of racially motivated vandalism and  violation of civil rights against the teens.  </P></p>

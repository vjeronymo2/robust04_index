			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 17 (YONHAP) -- The Supreme Public  Prosecutor's Office took over an American soldier convicted of  homicide from U.S. military authorities at 11 a.m. Tuesday and  sent him to Chonan city prison. The soldier, Pvt. Kenneth  Markle III, filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Supreme  Court last Friday asking not to be handed over to Korean  authorities, but Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist turned it  down. Markle, 21, of Keyser, West Virginia, was convicted last  year of murdering a Korean woman, Yun Kum-i, 26, in her boarding  room in October 1992, but had been confined in a U.S. military  prison at Pyongtaek under the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)  between South Korea and the United States.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Seven Asymmetries"] </F>   [Text] The Argentine Industrial Union (UIA) has asked the  government to postpone the Mercosur [Common Market of the South]  commercial integration program until 30 June 1994. The Union is  seeking the six-month delay because of marked imbalances between  the Argentine and Brazilian economies. "If protective measures  are not taken," it warns, "Argentine productive activity will be  totally replaced by Brazilian imports."  <H5>  Seven Asymmetries </H5>   Argentine manufacturers point to at least seven areas in  which there are cost differences compared with their Brazilian  counterparts.    These are the so-called "asymmetries," the euphemism used to  avoid mention of something even more formidable: the advantages  which Brazil extends to all manufacturers to help them penetrate  the Argentine market.    The Argentine Industrial Union's missive spells out a few,  while avoiding the mention of a source of irritation to Minister  Domingo Cavallo: Nowhere is any reference made to the gap  between the Argentine rate of exchange and the constant  devaluation in Brazil. It merits only passing mention even  though it is the favorite argument used by Itamar Franco's  government to counter demands made by Argentine industry.    The UIA cites the following Brazilian economic factors that  affect Argentine manufacturers:    1) the enormous difference in the cost of electric power,  which the UIA believes has resulted from the failure to amortize  government investments in the hydroelectric plants that generate  over 90 percent of all electricity used in Brazil;    2) the extremely high rate of tax evasion, which Brazilian  authorities put at a minimum of 55 percent;    3) competition between Brazil's states to attract  investments  by granting high tax exemptions to investment and production  projects;    4) the lag in real wages;    5) financial benefits for exporters that charge the daily  exchange rate while paying for consumable expenditures,  services, raw materials, and personnel at the old rate;    6) the existence of subsidies in certain cases where raw  materials are supplied by government-owned enterprises; and    7) long-term financing for sales of capital goods at very  low  interest rates.    For the first time, the association of Argentine businessmen  has demanded officially that the government temporarily suspend  all of the central issues of the integration treaty with Brazil.    The drastic and unusual request is included in a document in  which the Argentine Industrial Union warns of a grave danger to  the entire Argentine economy. It emphasizes that if special  safeguards are not put in place, "productive activity will be  totally replaced by Brazilian imports" in many manufacturing  sectors.    Brandishing these dramatic arguments based on the manifest  economic imbalances of Brazil and the productive disadvantages  of our own national industry, the manufacturers are urgently  demanding drastic measures to check the wave of Brazilian  imports.    In other words, they are asking for time and do so in the  following terms: "It is imperative that we draft necessary  amendments or extend the transitional period provided for in the  treaty, which essentially grants sufficient time so that our  main Mercosur partner may make indispensable adjustments in  order to coordinate its macroeconomic policies with the  remaining countries."    The demands are included in a letter which the Argentine  Industrial Union has sent to the head of the Ministry of Economy.    The five-page letter is dated 18 November and spells out the  negative effects suffered by Argentine business. Jorge Blanco  Villegas delivered the letter to Minister Domingo Cavallo in  person.    It states textually that: "It is our view that the  deep-rooted asymmetries currently existing between Argentina and  Brazil and which are commercially favorable to the latter will  increase immediately, aggravating the problems and harm suffered  by many Argentine industries."    The manufacturers therefore ask that "play be halted"  throughout the process of integration with Brazil. They are  specifically asking for a general postponement lasting  approximately six months.    They do so straightforwardly: "We propose to set a period  ending on 30 June 1994 (rather than 31 December) in order to  enable the countries involved to draw up new schedules for the  Mercosur commercial liberalization and special lists."    In case any doubt should remain, they continue: "We also  propose the date of 30 June 1994 for determining the common  foreign tariff and new guidelines for sectorial agreements."    The following are among the urgent measures requested by the  manufacturers' association:    1) temporary suspension of the commercial liberalization  schedule, meaning that the deadline of the end of December would  be removed;    2) temporary suspension of the reduction in the list of  exceptions so that the 20 percent set for the end of this year  would not take effect;    3) modification of the Las Lenas schedule to permit a fairer  and more appropriate drafting of the common foreign tariff; and    4) a modification of current guidelines for sectorial  agreements.    The manufacturers' association issued its strong demand in  order to mediate the internal dispute raging in the government  over Argentina's position vis-a-vis Brazil.    The Foreign Ministry intends to implement the agreement to  the letter. Such is the gist of the position taken by Minister  Guido Di Tella and Secretary Hector Gambarotta. In contrast, the  Ministry of Economy is more sympathetic to problems caused by  the invasion of imports because it throws the convertibility  plan off balance.    In the letter, which is signed by top-ranking officials  Jorge  Blanco Villegas and Eduardo Faena, the Industrial Union paints a  dark picture of the effects which integration will have on  production if the government fails to take protective measures.    Those effects include the following:    Brazil's imports are replacing efficiently made local  products.    Small and medium-size industries have curtailed their  productive capacity because of the wave of imports.    Other manufacturing sectors have postponed and abandoned  reconversion programs because of the commercial advantages of  complementing sales with the same products imported from Brazil.    Tempted by temporary marketing advantages, some industrial  sectors are totally replacing their production with imports,  maintaining their share of the market and profits while gaining  the added advantage of simplifying business.    All these difficulties stem from the unequal process of  bilateral trade. Manufactured goods make up 90 percent of all  purchases from Brazil. Argentina's exports of manufactured  products comprise only about half (47 percent) of all goods sold  and include agricultural products.    The UIA therefore emphasizes that the problems and ill  effects suffered by many industrial sectors will be complicated  as of 1 January and become even worse if no changes are made by  the beginning of 1995.    The manufacturers argue that there is little time left and  that a decision is urgent. They do not want to condemn Argentina  to the role of supplying fuel and grain.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["J.R." report: "Anguita Says Origin of Corruption Lies in </F> Executive's Economic Policy"]    [Text] Julio Anguita, the general coordinator of the United  Left (IU), said that the origin of the corruption lay beyond  personal actions. "The evil runs deeper than the Roldan and  Rubio affairs. It lies in a specific economic policy which is  itself corrupt and also the origin of corruption," Anguita  emphasized during the presentation of the IU's European campaign.    Yesterday, the leadership of the United Left approved, with  two abstentions, a resolution demanding that Prime Minister  Felipe Gonzalez resign immediately as the best way of ensuring  that the people can regain confidence in the institutions.  "Gonzalez has repeatedly and sufficiently demonstrated his  inability and his lack of willingness to rectify things. He has  systematically failed to comply with all of his election  promises. He does not have a shred of credibility," the  resolution said. It also demanded the resignation of Carlos  Solchaga, Jose Luis Corcuera, and Jose Barrionuevo.    However, for Anguita, the corruption scandals are only the  fifth reason why the prime minister must go. According to the  IU, Gonzalez is also responsible for the rise in unemployment,  the destruction of industrial textiles, the economic policy, and  the rise of the right.    As he has done in some of his latest public actions, the  general coordinator emphatically called for "serenity, calm, and  rationality" at this time, and made it clear that his group  would in no case support a motion of censure which might be  submitted by the People's Party. Anguita will turn a deaf ear  to requests that he support a catharsis. These were made by  various social sectors and the media. "We are not going to make  it easy for either Gonzalez or Aznar," he added.    Anguita was confident that at the election on 12 June the  "example of honesty, transparency, and clean hands" being set by  the IU will be translated into votes. The IU hopes to gain at  least seven seats in the European Parliament at the European  elections. It currently has four. To this end, it will spend  125 million pesetas during the campaign, plus another 360  million on campaign mailings, according to the person in charge  of the elections, Felix Martinez de la Cruz. The campaign  slogan will be "Get a move on," and will be present at more than  1,000 events.    The IU's leading candidate, socialist Alonso Puerta, has  predicted that the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] will  suffer a setback similar to the one suffered by their French  counterparts at that country's last elections. He was confident  that, "within this framework of anxiety," the citizens will be  able to figure out that not all politicians work the same way.  Puerta let slip the possibility that, after the elections, the  IU would give its MEP's-elect the task of submitting an  initiative to improve the ethical standards of European public  life.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS WORK OUT RACIAL RIFTS  </P> <P> As major school activities go, picking up litter in the East San Diego  neighborhoods surrounding Crawford High School last month was fairly  low-profile.  </P> <P> But, for the 25 or so students with their green trash bags, the mid-morning  exercise was an important, albeit small, step in both rebuilding the school's  tarnished image and improving racial tolerance.  </P> <P> After an hour of cleaning up lawns and curb gutters, the students adjourned for  a hot-dog barbecue to continue informal conversations that administrators hope  will break down stereotypes among the whites, blacks, Latinos and Indochinese  who people the campus in large numbers.  </P> <P> The push toward getting students to get along better with each other -- if not  necessarily to always like each other -- has been given a higher priority at  Crawford since incidents last fall when racial fighting broke out between  Indochinese and other ethnic groups, in particular blacks. The fighting was  touched off by an off-campus shooting in which one student was slightly  wounded.  </P> <P> The media attention caught Crawford students and faculty off guard, and,  although they protested that such tension is not unique to their campus, they  also acknowledged that Crawford was not doing enough to minimize it.  </P> <P> After the immediate furor calmed and administrators put a damper on the rumor  network that usually follows school conflicts, Principal  </P> <P> Nancy Shelburne convened a student leadership  </P> <P> group, with members chosen for their leadership ability and influence with  peers.  </P> <P> The group now meets regularly to discuss racial issues, plan campus activities,  improve student-police relations, all within the context of avoiding situations  similar to what happened in October. Counselors from the Urban League and from  the Indochinese Mutual Assistance Assn. have worked with black and Indochinese  students to explore ways to lessen ethnic animosity.  </P> <P> There have been signs of progress, many measured in small increments such as  persuading students to let a fight, if one breaks out, to take place  one-on-one, without friends and supporters of the two antagonists choosing up  sides and turning an incident into a racial free-for-all.  </P> <P> "I think we've made some sort of change with our group," Crawford student Tony  Pordullo said while picking up litter with a couple of friends he invited along  for the activity. "Sure, not everyone likes others, and the hardest thing is to  get everyone together and realize that we're all equal, even if you think some  people are better."  </P> <P> The group scheduled the litter pickup after some students suggested that, if  they could show more pride in their school and neighborhood, perhaps that might  rub off on student attitudes about each other as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Talking About Things  </P> <P> "We are students who have a lot of friends, and who talk about things to other  friends," said student Anthony Wise. "We talk about gangs, about graffiti,  about stereotypes, about all sorts of things."  </P> <P> While bending down for a beer can, Wise pointed to the "SWP" painted on a  manhole cover a block away from Crawford. The phrase stands for "student white  power."  </P> <P> "Something like that, that's how fights get started," Wise said. "And it gives  the entire student body here a bad name, it ruins things for the rest of us."  </P> <P> Many students stressed the "code of honor" that they are trying to establish  when fights do break out.  </P> <P> "Fights should be one-on-one," Andrew (A. J.) Hinton said. "If we can limit to  two rather than a whole group or gang, I think that really helps."  </P> <P> But Hinton, a senior, has also tried to get his friends to understand that  feelings do not have to be carried out in physical challenges, especially  between blacks and Indochinese.  </P> <P> "There is a language problem," Hinton said, referring to the large numbers of  Indochinese, mainly Cambodian students, who are not yet fluent in English.  School district human relations counselors found that some of the animosity  last fall stemmed from a basic lack of communication.  </P> <P> "If I drop my pencil and a (Indochinese) tries to tell me I did so, it's  sometimes hard for me to figure out what he's saying . . . it all depends on  how you handle the situation. It can be laughter -- an ice-breaker -- or  tension.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I May Not Understand'  </P> <P> "If someone steps on my foot accidentally in the hall, he may apologize but I  may not understand so you have to smile, use your hands maybe, to show that  everything is OK, just say 'excuse me.' Otherwise, there's immediate tension,  and then there's a fight."  </P> <P> Added senior class president Charma Hendricks: "It's hard for us at first to  understand the life style of the Indochinese." The Indochinese students,  especially those not yet comfortable with English, are less likely to take part  in non-academic programs and are sometimes seen as working too hard in school.  Many non-Asian students have little knowledge of the harrowing experiences that  these refugees went through in escaping to the United States.  </P> <P> Although Crawford students are making an effort at better interpersonal  relations, some of their younger peers at neighboring Mann Middle School are in  the midst of some of that school's worst racial antagonism in several years.  </P> <P> Principal Maruta Gardner said that, during the past two weeks, about 15 Asian  and 15 black males have been involved in periodic fighting, casting a pall over  the school's atmosphere. Although the students have been placed in counseling  -- and some have been expelled or transferred to other schools -- name-calling  and stare-downs have continued at lunch time and during passing periods, and  some confrontations have taken place after school. Gardner called in parents of  the students on Friday to impress upon them the volatility of the situation.  </P> <P> Gardner traced the latest problems to an incident in which several black  students beat up a Vietnamese student in retaliation for what they said was a  black student being harmed by Indochinese in nearby Colina del Sol park after  school.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Never-Ending Problem'  </P> <P> "And these kids are going to be going to Crawford from here," Gardner said.  "It's just a never-ending problem we have to work on." Mann has been praised in  past years for positive effects of its race/human-relations program -- which  all schools are required to take -- but the teacher responsible for  coordinating multi-ethnic activities was promoted to another district position  last fall.  </P> <P> "So a lot of the program just died," Gardner said, referring to "lunch bunch"  groups in which teachers volunteered to sit down over lunch with students and  talk about any and all problems that they had with classes or with one another.  </P> <P> "The fact is that we don't have them this year, because you can't force  teachers to do it, and I think it has made a (negative) difference in the tone  at the school," Gardner said.  </P> <P> Gardner has called in black and Indochinese counselors from the school district  to sit down with the most active combatants, in a manner similar to what Urban  League and Indochinese Mutual Assistance counselors began doing at Crawford  last fall.  </P> <P> "Counseling cannot guarantee that things will get better, but at least  Cambodian students will come to understand the situation better," said Senyint  Chim, a district counselor who has been talking with Crawford students.  </P> <P> "You try to explain that fighting, responding with force, is not going to solve  the problem of attacks and that they should instead come to the counseling  office and try and get help that way," Chim said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Anti-Black Conditioning  </P> <P> Chim believes many Cambodian students are conditioned to see blacks  unfavorably, in part simply because the Khmer Rouge, who killed up to 1 million  Cambodians in the late 1970s when they ruled the country, wore black.  </P> <P> "Also, they do not see many blacks in positive roles in America, and they also  believe that most of the robberies in their East San Diego neighborhoods are  committed by blacks," Chim said. "They don't see many bad white guys robbing  them, so stereotypes get established real quick.  </P> <P> "I think solutions will come only slowly."  </P> <P> By the same token, Urban League program specialist Charles Howard said some  black students do not understand the background of Asian students and the  reasons they are reluctant to involve themselves in after-school programs such  as dances and sports rallies.  </P> <P> Many of those black students have had attendance and minor behavioral problems  as well, leading to jealousies toward other students and a lack of self-esteem,  which Howard's program is trying to address by arranging counseling and  part-time employment.  </P> <P> "Quite a few kids, 20 or so, have taken advantage of our offer to get them some  work experience after school," Howard said, pointing to jobs offered by  business like Pizza Hut and nonprofit organizations such as the YMCA. The Urban  League is planning a larger Youth Employment Partnership Program, in  coordination with other social-service organizations, to try to turn more  youths away from gangs and drugs.  </P> <P> Howard said students at Crawford and other schools are "not foreordained to  clash" over ethnic differences, despite the continuing tension and  misunderstandings. "They've got 1,600 kids at Crawford, and I see both a lot of  kids mixing together and ethnic kids also hanging with their own, and all of  that is normal behavior," he said.  </P></p>

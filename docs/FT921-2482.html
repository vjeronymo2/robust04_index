			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Brierley and GPG reduce joint offer for ACIL BRIERLEY Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment and trading group, and its UK-based associate, GPG, plan to reduce their joint offer for Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL) to 20.5 Australian cents a share from 23 cents a share, AP-DJ reports from Sydney. Sir Ron Brierley said in a letter to ACIL that the proposed takeover offer was being reduced because the target company last week announced an agreement to pay ADollars 14m (USDollars 10.6m) to settle a claim from the liquidators of Spedley Securities. Sir Ron wrote on behalf of Rossington Holdings, a company jointly-owned by BIL, his former investment company, and his new investment vehicle, GPG. BIL owns 40 per cent of GPG. Sir Ron said ACIL's payout was inconsistent with previous indications that the Spedley claims were 'tenuous as best.' He said the 'gratuitous capitulation' by ACIL seemed like 'gross incompetence' by the directors. Sir Ron said the 2.5 cents-a-share reduction in the offer price brought the value of the bid down ADollars 14m. He said Rossington had applied to the Australian Stock Exchange for the necessary approvals to lower the proposed bid.</p>

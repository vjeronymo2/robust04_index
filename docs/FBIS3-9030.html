Hungary would like to see rapid progress, following changes  caused by the Gabcikovo hydroelectric dam in Slovakia, over  sharing Danube water, which looks particularly urgent in light  of the imminent growing period in Szigetkoz, when water is vital  to plant growth. (While Hungary has already accepted the  European Union's recommendation on water sharing, Slovakia has  not yet done so.)    Also important to Budapest is the implementation of Council  of Europe recommendations. (When Slovakia was admitted to the  Council of Europe, it was asked to permit use of Hungarian town  and village name-plates and registration of Hungarian family  names.)</p>

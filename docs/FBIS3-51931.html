Our correspondent in Jacmel, Pierre Nazon Beauliere, reports:    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Beauliere] The representatives  of the Group of Citizens of the Southeast met with the press on  25 January to explain to the population what they discussed and  adopted in the 18 to 20 January congress in Port-au-Prince. The  group called for a mobilization of Southeast citizens to support  the resolution that emerged from the congress. For Mr. Ducles  Louis, member of the Group of Citizens of the Southeast, the  resolution of the congress will allow a solution to the crisis  that the country has been facing for 28 months. The committee of  the Group of Citizens of the Southeast is sending invitations  throughout the region for people to participate in the  installation of the Government of Public Security.    [Louis] [Words indistinct] most likely that we will have to  install within the next 48 hours. Thus, our tasks right now in  the Southeast... [changes thought] We left Port-au-Prince with  the project of coordinating the bureau there, and we returned  home to call for mobilization to Port-au-Prince for the  installation of the Government of Public Security. [end  recording]    [Beauliere] The resolution of the Congress for National  Salvation did not get the approval of all political sectors in  Jacmel. Some groups do not agree because not all the sectors are  represented within that government. Others stated that they did  not have enough information on the decision: Will it allow the  embargo to be lifted and national reconciliation to take place?    The formation of the Group of Citizens of the Southeast and  formation of the delegation representing the Southeast in the 18  to 20 January congress in Port-au-Prince created great division  within the sector always opposed to Father Aristide. They  criticize one another over the people chosen to represent Jacmel  in this congress. They think those choices were made in camera  for personal interests.    This has been Pierre Nazon Beauliere in Jacmel for Radio  Metropole. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Soft on the hard Ecu THE BRITISH proposal for a hard Ecu, originally put forward by Mr John Major when chancellor in 1990, was not without its merits. But whether it will become more than a marginal talking point again in the aftermath of the near-terminal upheaval in the exchange rate mechanism seems altogether questionable. The case for a parallel currency which would never depreciate against any existing currency within the ERM was originally made in the context of a very powerful impetus towards economic and monetary union. While the Maastricht timetable for Emu remains theoretically intact, monetary union inevitably looks more remote after recent events. The D-Mark - a softer option than the hard Ecu - has anyway proved too much even for the franc fort. In short, the problems of the EC after Maastricht are not ones to which the hard Ecu looks relevant. The important thing now is to ensure that Europe gets its larger priorities right. The first essential is to absorb the message implicit in the ERM's loss of credibility in the markets. The pressure on the system came mainly from the idea that the attempt on the part of France and other countries to retain a fixed relationship with the D-Mark in the period of German unification was doomed to failure. With Germany running a combination of tight monetary policy and lax fiscal policy, the ERM became a mechanism for transmitting a needless recession across Europe. Macro-economic stringency was thus added to the micro problems of Europe's over-rigid labour markets. The resulting upward pressure on unemployment numbers raised doubts about the political commitment to a hard ERM, notably in France. On this the markets judged better than the politicians. And in seeking to establish what can be salvaged, it is important to recognise that the level of interest rates appropriate for the German economy is unlikely to make sense for much of the rest of Europe for some time to come. It follows that any response to the ERM debacle that involves the French government in seeking a swift dash for monetary union would simply compound the damage. It would also perpetuate the chief political error in the Maastricht process, whereby the integrationist instincts of Europe's political elite ran far ahead of public opinion. It seems unlikely that such a move would anyway appeal to Germany, where opinion polls suggest considerable hostility to the loss of the D-Mark. Nor will an early narrowing the ERM bands amount to much more than an invitation to market participants to test the resolve of the central banks once again. The more pressing need is for some wider rebalancing of economic policy. A more responsible German fiscal policy will no doubt take time. But the Bank of France's decision yesterday to cut short-term rates by a quarter of a point was a modest but useful step in a sensible direction: a lot more of the same is required.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Franc emerges 'intact and reinforced' The franc has emerged 'intact and reinforced' from last month's monetary crisis, Mr Jacques De Larosiere, the Banque of France governor, said yesterday, writes David Buchan in Paris. Almost half of the FFr160bn (Pounds 18.7bn) spent in supporting the franc's parity against the D-Mark was flowing back, as speculators gambling on the franc's devaluation had to buy it back at an unchanged rate, he said. The governor gave no details of last month's intervention, but it is believed that half came from French reserves and the remainder from the Bundesbank. He said Germans had done all they could to help the pound and the lira.</p>

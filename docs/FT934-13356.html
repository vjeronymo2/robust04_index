			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Commonwealth takes up trade reform struggle COMMONWEALTH leaders yesterday opened their five-day summit in Cyprus, stressing the urgent need for a new international trade agreement and reaffirming their commitment to human rights. Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating used his first appearance at the forum to make an attack, clearly aimed at France, on countries holding up progress in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, while leaving no doubt his country's move to republican status would not undermine its Commonwealth ties. In a speech designed to refocus the 50-member association in the wake of apartheid's demise, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, its secretary-general, made trade reform a priority. He linked the outcome of the Uruguay Round talks to efforts to promote democracy within the Commonwealth and elsewhere. 'Like armies, democracies march on their stomachs. The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round promises an annual addition to global income of Dollars 213bn by the year 2002,' Chief Anyaoku told the heads of government. 'Yet that crucial step now looks uncertain, threatening not merely the loss of the huge potential gains but a spiralling descent into protectionism and isolationism.' Mr Keating's contribution was the first stage in a co-ordinated effort by Australia and Britain to enlist support for trade reform from an association whose membership spans Francophone Africa, the Cairns group and many of the world's poorest countries. Taking the offensive in the opening session, Mr Keating warned: 'Time is very short for us to prevent the Round's collapse.' Clearly referring to France, he went on: 'Some 'rich countries' still seem to believe they can avoid making difficult concessions but still reap the advantages of the Round. I think they are completely wrong, and are likely to bear the opprobrium and contumely of the whole world.' Mr John Major, UK prime minister, made the issue the centre of his contribution later in the day, when the conference went into closed session. He echoed Mr Keating's call on Commonwealth leaders to 'make every effort to examine what the Commonwealth can do to help bring about an outcome from the Multilateral Trade Negotiations to benefit each of us and the world at large.' Mr Major also highlighted the problem of third world debt, conceding that more needed to be done to ease the burden on developing countries. In particular, he called for rapid implementation of the Trinidad terms, which provide for a write-off of 50 per cent of official debt. But he went further by holding out the prospect of improved Trinidad terms. 'The neediest countries, with a track record of economic reform, should be granted two-thirds debt reduction on their whole stock of official debt,' he said. 'In some cases this should be a high as 80 per cent.' Mr Major added that in all too many places 'the age of the warlord is returning', placing greater demands on the Commonwealth and the UN. But objectives must be realistic and linked to a political process. 'What we cannot do, we should not pretend to do. But what we decide to do, we must do well.'</p>

Safarov: </F> "Why Is Meat Rising in Price?"]    [Text] Yevlakh--The situation in livestock raising has  become quite strained lately, as we know. Of course, the sector  can be revived once and for all only after the occupied  territories are liberated. But is there a possibility the  situation can be at least alleviated somehow?    "I think we can," said F. Aliyev, director of the Yevlakh  combine. He stressed that the economic ties that were broken  with partners in the near abroad must be restored to overcome  the crisis.    In past years, Agdam and Yevlak provided mixed feed to  livestock raising farms not only in Karabakh, but several dozen  other rayons in the republic as well. Various components came  from 20 cities in the former union republics--from special salt,  chalk, and cottonseed meal to oats and fodder grain--to turn out  the finished product.    It has now been several years since the stabilized ties with  suppliers were broken. Moreover, we cannot count on the Agdam  combine for the present. And the production volumes in Yevlakh  are now being measured in just hundreds of metric tons, not  thousands. While mixed feed of five varieties was turned out  here before, only one form of the product--a feed mixture from  local raw material--is being prepared and delivered to the farms  now.    My interlocutor is undoubtedly right. But on the other hand,  the repeated increase in prices for deliveries from the near  abroad cannot be disregarded, either. Consequently, the prices  for mixed feed will rise as well. Accordingly, the livestock  raisers will be selling their product at a higher price.    Well, it is possible that this is only the first stage in a  solution of the problem--achieving definite saturation of the  market for livestock products. And as far as the future is  concerned, we have to ensure that prices for meat, milk, and  dairy products are at least stabilized, if not quickly lowered.  It is up to the market.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Vasilyev article: "Nagorno-Karabakh: The Lull </F> before the Peace?"]    [Text] Under the plan proposed by Russia on Monday at the  meeting of the defense ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan and  the commander in chief of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's  defense forces, the Russian Federation president was due to sign  a detailed plan today for the introduction of Russian  peacemaking and disengagement forces into the region of  hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh and in five days' time, on 24  May, the actual disengagement of the opposing forces was due to  begin along the entire front. But the process has been  suspended. Temporarily, according to the Foreign Ministry and  the Defense Ministry. The representatives of Armenia and  Karabakh accepted the Russian plan, but the Azerbaijan defense  minister needed additional information and left for Baku without  signing the document or taking leave of his colleagues. Special  envoy Vladimir Kazimirov, leader of the Russian delegation at  the talks, then went to the Transcaucasus. On Tuesday and  Wednesday he discussed the prevailing situation with local  political leaders on the spot. It transpired that the protocol  had not been signed "because it contained certain defects." And  in particular because a session of parliament had been fixed for  Tuesday, at which deputies were demanding a report on the  Azerbaijan leadership's actions in connection with the situation  in Karabakh.    In the conflict zone itself calm is being maintained at the  moment. On the whole the sides are fulfilling the cease-fire  accords reached in Moscow.    Is there a hope that the lull which has set in will end in a  peace agreement? Well-informed Azerbaijani sources are accusing  Yerevan of disrupting the detailed peace settlement plan, while  the Armenian permanent mission blames Baku for the breakdown of  the talks. Nevertheless, no one is rejecting the idea of direct  contacts between the defense ministers and the commander in  chief of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic through the mediation of  Army General Pavel Grachev. At the Russian Foreign Ministry  they also believe that the chance of peace has not been lost and  that 24 May could mark the start of a new life for the two  neighboring peoples. Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev,  Russian deputy defense minister, who is responsible for the  peacemaking forces' activity, has even expressed confidence that  Azerbaijan will sign the protocol in the near future. And Pavel  Grachev himself tends to view the military's actions as an  effort to achieve peace. Even though, in his words, certain  forces still exist which "are getting rich out of the Karabakh  war." In addition, "the people who give the order to wage war  never go to the front line; they always command from the rear,"  Pavel Grachev added.    Time will tell whether these hopes are well founded.</p>

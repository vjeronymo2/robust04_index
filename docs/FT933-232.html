			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Japan to import at least 1m tonnes of rice MR Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, said yesterday the country will be forced to import rice after typhoons and an unusually cold summer left production an estimated 20 per cent below the average annual harvest. But the government insisted that the decision was a once-only response to a poor harvest, and other countries should not take the imports as a sign that the firmly closed Japanese rice market is now open. Agriculture Ministry officials indicated that over 1m tonnes of rice would be imported, about two thirds of the amount for consumption at Japanese tables and the remaining third for use in processed foods. It is expected that the US and Australia will be the leading contenders to supply the table rice, while Thailand and Vietnam were suggested as the most likely suppliers of rice for crackers and other processed foods. Japan has resisted attempts to open the rice market as part of a settlement in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, though the country is expected to open the market if the US and EC reach agreement on farm trade. Mr Hosokawa has indicated that he would be willing to allow imports, but has also insisted that rice is not the issue holding back the Uruguay Round. If he does push for an opening, the prime minister will have to overcome the opposition of rice farmers and the Social Democratic party, one of the seven members of his coalition government. At 1m tonnes, the imports would be equal to about 10 per cent of average annual Japanese output, though government officials have privately suggested that, if the market is opened in the future, the initial ceiling on imports would be between 3 and 5 per cent. The government is due to announce the rice harvest index today, but officials have suggested it will be about 80, compared with the 100 of an average year, while the index in Aomori prefecture, in the north, is said to have slipped to 32.</p>

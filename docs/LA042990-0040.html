			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THE WILD BUNCH;  </P> <P> 'WEEKEND WARRIORS' ROUND UP FUN, BRUISES AT CONEJO VALLEY RODEO  </P> <P> Tim Boyle describes himself as a "weekend warrior." But rather than playing a  hard game of basketball or football in his spare time, the 32-year-old Simi  Valley resident likes to rope calves.  </P> <P> On Saturday at the annual Conejo Valley Days rodeo, Boyle and his brother Mike,  in front of about 2,500 spectators, galloped full-tilt into the arena after a  calf that was doing its best to avoid their lariats.  </P> <P> They lassoed it in 9.8 seconds.  </P> <P> "That isn't a good time for us, but it's a respectable time for this area,"  Boyle said.  </P> <P> Boyle and his brother grew up on a Simi Valley ranch and although horses have  been a way of life for both of them, they didn't begin competing on the rodeo  circuit until about five years ago.  </P> <P> "If you can't afford it, don't do it," he said.  </P> <P> Boyle added that if the Conejo Valley Days rodeo wasn't close to home, he and  his brother would not bother to come each year because the prize money isn't  very big.  </P> <P> The top four winners in each of the seven events at the rodeo are rewarded,  "but they don't have good money," Boyle said. He and his brother expect to take  home about $400.  </P> <P> Top rodeo riders who compete full time in bareback riding, steer wrestling,  bull riding and calf roping can make about $100,000, Boyle said. But most rodeo  competitors have regular jobs and are "weekend warriors" who perform only in  area rodeos, he added.  </P> <P> Boyle owns a welding shop in Simi  </P> <P> Valley and his brother is a wrangler who takes care of horses for movie  companies.  </P> <P> While a professional rodeo competitor may hit 150 rodeos annually, Boyle has  gone to only 17 rodeos in the past two years. Expenses such as entry fees,  horse equipment and transportation add up, and several hundred dollars can be  spent on just one weekend rodeo, Boyle said.  </P> <P> In addition to the financial demands that have increased over the years for  rodeo riders, the competitiveness has also intensified, said Ron Warne, who has  more than 30 years of experience.  </P> <P> Warne, a 48-year-old Moorpark resident, competed Saturday against Boyle and his  brother in the team-roping competition. Warne and his partner, Billy  Washington, lassoed their calf in 9.2 seconds.  </P> <P> "They've got it down to a real science. It used to be that cowboys would tie a  calf in 15 to 20 seconds. Now they can do it in 7 or 8 seconds," Warne said.  </P> <P> Warne, who owns a horse transportation business and who does part-time coaching  of his own, attributed the change to better training. "They've got the  opportunity to learn these skills at a younger age than the older generation."  </P> <P> Like many rodeo competitors, Warne was exposed to horses at an early age. His  family owned a ranch in Northern California, and when he started riding in  rodeos at 16, that was not unusual among his peers.  </P> <P> Over the years he has broken several ribs and has had to have some knee  operations. From 16 to 35, Warne rode "rough stock," meaning bulls and  bareback. At 35, when he was beginning to "slow down," Warne decided to confine  himself to calf roping and team roping.  </P> <P> Like the Boyles, Warne has been coming to the Conejo Valley Days rodeo for many  years. According to Warne, the Thousand Oaks rodeo is unusual for its large and  enthusiastic crowd.  </P> <P> "They always have a spectacular crowd at every performance. At some rodeos  there isn't that big a crowd. Here they really get into it," he said.  </P> <P> Warne's partner, 32-year-old Moorpark resident Billy Washington, began  competing on the rodeo circuit about five years ago. Before that, he competed  full time in karate tournaments, ranking in the top 10 in the U.S. for  full-contact and point karate. Like the others, he is a weekend cowboy who  works full time as a bodyguard in Hollywood.  </P> <P> Patting his horse "Gold Dust," before his event, Washington explained that in  calf roping, the horse does 70% to 80% of the work.  </P> <P> "You have to depend on him to do everything," he said.  </P> <P> Washington advised those interested in joining the rodeo circuit to find  excellent instructors to avoid learning bad habits. When he was starting out  and inexperienced, he cut a finger off while competing in team roping, he said.  </P> <P> The appeal for him is the competition and the atmosphere. "It kind of takes you  back in time," Washington said. "I'll probably stay in it until I get old or  break a bone or something."  </P> <P> The Conejo Valley Days rodeo rounds up today, with shows at 1 and 4 p.m. Events  are bareback riding, steer wrestling, saddle bronc riding, team roping, women's  barrel racing, bull riding and calf roping.  </P></p>

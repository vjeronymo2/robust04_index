			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): On your marks for the great tax paperchase - An accountant explains the details / A look at how the changes will affect European and non-EC companies alike The 1993 VAT changes will affect only the movement of goods between EC countries. The present rules and systems will remain for all imports and exports of goods from non-EC countries; services, except for those such as transport, freight handling and similar services, will not be affected. Businesses exporting to or importing from both EC and non-EC countries will have to cope with at least two separate systems. A non-EC business, which owns goods located in the EC and sells across EC borders, will also be affected, even if it only acts as an invoicing company. Until now, EC tax authorities have controlled the payment of VAT due by monitoring each shipment of imports. But with the removal of border controls, this will no longer be possible; instead, the controls, including the requirement for payment of import VAT, are being transferred to the premises of the importer and exporter. A UK company importing goods from other EC countries will have to apply the reverse charge to the value of all its imports. This procedure (which already applies to many services) involves the company charging itself output tax and, at the same time, taking relief for the same amount of input tax - in other words, grossing up both sides of its VAT account. For a business which can recover all VAT paid, there will be no cost with this procedure. But partly-exempt businesses, such as banks and other financial institutions, which cannot recover all their input VAT, will suffer the same VAT cost as if they had acquired the goods from a UK supplier. A UK supplier exporting to another EC country will need to obtain the customer's VAT registration number (if the customer is registered for VAT) and quote it on the sales invoice. If it can be demonstrated that the goods have left the UK, the supplier will be entitled to zero-rate the transaction. This procedure applies not only to 'sales' in the conventional sense, but also to many other cross-border movements of goods, such as transfers between branches within the same legal entity. If the customer is not registered for VAT, is a private individual, and the UK supplier arranges delivery or transport, then the supplier will charge UK VAT on exports up to an annual limit per country of Ecu 35,000 (about Pounds 24,500) or Ecu 100,000. Over that limit, the supplier will have to register for VAT in the customer's EC country and charge 'local' VAT. EC countries are able to choose which limit to apply, and it appears currently that most will go for the higher. If the non VAT-registered customer is a legal entity, for example a governmental organisation, then it will have to register locally if the level of its imported goods from other EC countries exceeds the local annual limit, which must be at least Ecu10,000. Once the customer has registered, the procedure will be the same as for any other VAT-registered customer; below that level the UK supplier will have to charge UK VAT. There are also special export rules which principally apply to new cars, boats and small planes, and require the purchaser to account for VAT in the EC country of use. As a further control, exporters will have to submit to Customs &amp; Excise aggregated listings of all such zero-rated sales per customer and per country on a quarterly basis. Customs will exchange these listings with the tax authorities in other EC countries. But that is not an end to the paperwork. Importers and exporters with annual intra-EC trade in excess of Pounds 135,000 a year will also have to provide detailed trade statistics on a monthly basis. Each item exported in the month must be aggregated according to the Customs Tariff commodity code and then a further 10 separate pieces of information supplied per code. The return is due within 10 working days from the end of the month. This will be a particularly onerous requirement for businesses, many of which have hitherto relied on freight agents to compile and submit the documents. Freight agents can of course continue to be used, but the information will have to be aggregated, and this could cause problems where more than one agent is involved. Many businesses will, for the first time, have to register and charge VAT in another EC country. In addition to the circumstances already described, this is most likely to occur where the business holds stock in other EC countries or is involved in 'triangulation'. This occurs where the invoicing route does not follow the movement of the goods, for example where A sells to B who on-sells to C (who are all in different EC countries) but the goods are transported directly from A to C. Many multinational companies operate in this way. The UK and some other EC countries are pressing for simplification measures in order to avoid a multiplicity of VAT registrations across the EC. The UK and two other EC countries have provisionally introduced their own simplification measures, and are pressing for their adoption across the EC, but this is still under discussion. Registration is a complex administrative and compliance burden, with additional costs arising from multi-currency and multi-rate VAT invoicing in another language. Tax representatives or fellow-subsidiaries may be used as agents, although local subsidiaries may not be able to cope with their current resources. Registration can also bring direct tax problems as well as considerable cash flow costs in countries such as Italy if the business is to be in a VAT repayment position. There are, as always, penalties both in the UK and elsewhere for compliance failures. But the biggest risk for exporters is that if they fail to obtain and quote their customers' foreign VAT registration number and retain proof that the goods have left the UK, they will be liable for UK VAT at 17.5 per cent. Proof of export from the UK will not be easy where the customer arranges the transport. While Customs have suggested that a deposit for the UK VAT could be required from the customer, this may be difficult commercially.

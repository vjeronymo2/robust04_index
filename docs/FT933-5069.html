			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Pick-up expected in pay increases A MODEST increase in pay rises to between 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent, in line with inflation, is likely early next year, Industrial Relations Services says today in its forecast for the coming 12 months. IRS, an independent research organisation, expects companies to make greater use of merit pay and profit-related increases. It adds that company performance and the ability of an employer to pay will be the most influential factors in deciding the level of awards for the next 12 months. More than half the 300 companies involved in the survey said they planned to offer lower wage rises than they had in the past 12 months. While almost 30 per cent said they would provide higher rises, 25 per cent said they would give the same increase as previously. IRS says that basic wage rises are levelling off at about 2.5 per cent. Pay comparability between wage levels in the same industry was a factor in deciding levels, according to half of the companies. The survey found that the constraints on wage growth over the next 12 months will 'remain intense'. Almost 60 per cent mentioned 'poor company performance' as particularly influential as a downward pressure on pay deals. But there are signs in the IRS survey that companies will be less ready to cut their workforces in the next 12 months. More than two-thirds of them said they would not be shedding jobs in the next year. More manufacturers than service enterprises were planning job cuts. The survey is based on the views of personnel and industrial relations practitioners and pay decision-makers in 315 private-sector companies employing 771,400 people between them. More than half the organisations are in manufacturing and 37 per cent in private services. The survey was carried out in July. Pay and Benefits Bulletin 335.

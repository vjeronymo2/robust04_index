			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Britain will not act hastily or alone to withdraw  troops from Bosnia, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd pledged  tonight. "We remain committed to sustaining our contribution  through this winter, and working to improve further its  effectiveness," he said.    But Mr Hurd betrayed his anger at the "constant obstruction"  which humanitarian aid troops face on the ground. "I was there  last week. The outlook is bleak. The latest round of talks in  Geneva made no progress. The prospect is for continued  fighting, which may intensify in the spring," he told the  Diplomatic and Commonwealth Writers Association at Marlborough  House, London.    Mr Hurd said the achievements of British troops were  threatened by the deliberate obstructiveness of the parties.  "Aid is stuck in warehouses in Croatia. The road the British  troops hold open could carry many more convoys. Our engineers  are working to keep open power stations in central Bosnia, but  essential spare parts are being blocked. No wonder then that  people ask how long we can sustain this involvement, in the face  of constant obstruction on the ground. We have to consider  carefully, and with the others who contribute troops, how long  we can reasonably be expected to sustain this involvement and  how meanwhile we can improve its effectiveness."    Mr Hurd said that no decisions had yet been taken. "We shall  not act hastily or alone to withdraw our troops. We remain  committed to sustaining our contribution through this winter,  and working to improve further its effectiveness. Because the  Serbs carry the main responsibility for starting the conflict,  sanctions against Serbia must remain in force."</p>

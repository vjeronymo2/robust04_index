			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Employers protest at EU subsidies for trade unions In a move which points to a growing divergence between business and organised labour, Unice, the European employers' federation, has called into question the principle of subsidising the European trade union movement through the EU budget. Mr Zgymunt Tyszkiewicz, Unice secretary general, raised the issue of union funding during a weekend speech in which he also called for a shake-up of the European Commission to correct alleged pro-union bias in preparing EU legislation. He told a Brussels conference on the future of European social policy on Saturday that business was concerned about the level of subsidies for trade union activities, much of which was earmarked by a sympathetic European Parliament. 'Employers don't believe that balanced support exists,' he said. Unice has identified Ecu26.49m (Pounds 20.3m) in direct subsidies for the European trade union confederation (Etuc) and closely related bodies in the 1994 EU budget. Though the money represents only a fraction of the annual Ecu70bn budget, Unice is pressing for greater transparency in the allocation and use of funds. The employers' federation is focusing on the Ecu17m set aside for unions ahead of the Brussels directive on works councils expected to pass into law this year. The money is to help trade unions to put in place new systems of information and consultation at company level. Etuc officials dismissed the Unice criticism as unwarranted, noting that large European companies get far bigger subsidies through funding of research and development and other areas of the EU budget. Unice's challenge marks a new line of attack in its campaign against the works council directive, which it regards as unnecessary Brussels-led interference in the management of individual companies, threatening to set back efforts to improve competitiveness. The directive requires companies to comply with minimum requirements on consultation with elected works councils, but only if the companies fail to agree a voluntary pact sought by 100 employees or their representatives in at least two member states. It is expected to pass into law later this year under the German presidency.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree with respondent. Respondent mischaracterized the Department's verification of this expense. The Department only verified the total interest expense for NZKMB. NZKMB did not provide any supporting documentation for specific interest on dumping deposits ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Department's verification report for NZKMB, dated April 16, 1994, pp. 14&hyph;15). Given the Department's inability to verify the interest incurred for dumping deposits, there is no evidentiary basis for making the adjustment claimed by respondent. Therefore, the issue of the Department's practice in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Antifriction Bearings  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is moot. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent argues that the general and administrative (G&amp;A) expenses should be reduced by revenues from sales of salvaged packaging, which were posted to two accounts in NZKMB's general ledger. Respondent contends that the Department verified the items in one account and declined to examine the second account, citing lack of time. Furthermore, respondent claims that the Department traced the total amount in the second account to the general ledger and that the Department's unwillingness to go behind the ledger for this account is not sufficient grounds to doubt its accuracy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree. The Department informed respondent, prior to verification, in a letter dated March 4, 1994, that ``it is the responsibility of the respondent to be fully prepared for the verification. If (respondent) is not prepared to support or explain a response item at the appropriate time, we will move on to another topic. Due to time constraints, it may not be possible to return to that item and we may consider the item unverified.'' Respondent did not bring its claim for the adjustments in question to the Department's attention prior to the start of verification. In fact, these adjustments were first brought to the Department's attention on the third day of a five-day verification. Due to respondent's considerable delay in bringing the information to the Department's attention and subsequent lack of preparation in providing the supporting documentation, the verification team was only able to verify fully the amount reported for tender revenue packaging. The Department was unable to verify fully the amount reported in the sundry on-shore packaging account because of respondent's inability to provide supporting documentation in a timely manner. Accordingly, no adjustment has been made to G&amp;A for the sundry on-shore packaging in the final results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent argues that the Department should add the delivery premium for sales in the United States to the U.S. price rather than deduct it from U.S. price. NZKMB asserts that it charges a delivery premium for sales in the United States made on a delivered basis. This amount is charged to the customer as a premium above the gross unit price. Thus, according to respondent, it should be added to the gross unit price to yield the actual price paid by the customer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with respondent that the delivery premium should not be subtracted from the gross price when calculating the net U.S. price and have added it to the gross unit price so that our calculations reflect the full price paid by the customer. We then have adjusted the U.S. price for actual movement expenses respondent incurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 4 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent contends that the Department incorrectly used a weighted-average price for the entire period of review (POR) in the calculation of foreign market value (FMV). Respondent argues that the Department should use monthly weighted-average prices in the calculation of FMV. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with respondent and have used monthly weighted-average prices in the calculation of FMV for the final results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 5 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent contends that the Department improperly treated interest expenses by including the growers' interest cost in the cost of manufacture (COM) rather than accounting for it as a general expense in accordance with the Department's practice. To remedy this alleged error, respondent suggests that the Department subtract the growers' interest from COM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, respondent contends that, when calculating the constructed value (CV) interest expense, the Department double-counted the growers' interest by including it both in grower's COM and in CV interest expense calculation for NZKMB. According to respondent, the amount reported as CV interest expense in NZKMB's response to the Department's grower cost questionnaire, represents the total interest expense, for both NZKMB and the growers, that should be added to CV. Respondent suggests correcting this alleged error by subtracting the grower interest from COM and multiplying the result with CV offset proposed by NZKMB in its response to the Department's questionnaire. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners contest respondent's claim that the growers' interest expense should not be included in the COM but rather should be accounted for as a general expense. Petitioners note that respondent's claim overlooks the distinction between NZKMB's and growers' costs. Petitioners point out that the interest expenses incurred by each grower are directly related to the kiwifruit operations for each grower and that the loans relate directly to individual growers' costs of cultivation and are not ``general'' in nature nor are they a general expense of NZKMB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners also dispute respondent's claim that the interest expense reported in NZKMB's response to the Department's grower cost questionnaire represents the total interest, for both NZKMB and the growers, that should be added to CV. According to petitioners, the amount for CV interest expense used by the Department is much less than the actual interest incurred by either the growers or NZKMB because of an offset of interest expense with interest income that was not related to the grower interest. Petitioners argue that the Department should not allow any offset to growers' interest expense. Instead, petitioners argue that any offset that the Department chooses to make should only be subtracted from the interest expense of NZKMB. Furthermore, petitioners maintain that this offset should be in the form of a whole number instead of an estimated ratio used by respondent in its response. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree, in part, with both respondent and petitioners. We disagree with respondent's first argument that the growers' interest cost should be excluded from the COM. The Department's objective is to calculate the cost of production (COP) of the subject merchandise sold by NZKMB. This COP includes the cost incurred by the grower to produce the kiwifruit as well as the selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) incurred by NZKMB to sell the kiwifruit. The financial expenses incurred by growers are a part of the costs associated with producing the kiwifruit. That is, these financial expenses are directly related to individual growers' COM and are not NZKMB's general expense. NZKMB's financial expense is treated as the general expense of NZKMB and added to the grower's COM to arrive at the total COP of the kiwifruit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to respondent's argument that the Department double-counted growers' interest expenses, the Department agrees with respondent in part. We agree with respondent that the Department double-counted the growers' interest by including it both in grower's COM and in CV interest expense calculation for NZKMB. However, we disagree with the specific amount of the CV offset proposed by respondent. The CV offset proposed by respondent is a percentage factor that is applied to total interest of growers and NZKMB which was adjusted for deposits made for estimated antidumping duties. We have recalculated respondent's proposed adjustment by disallowing respondent's deduction for the interest incurred on its duty deposits. (For an explanation of the Department's position on this issue,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 1.) Furthermore, we have allowed this offset only to NZKMB's financial expenses because, as noted above, the Department does not consider financial expenses incurred by growers to be a general expense of NZKMB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Anatoliy Sliva, chairman of State </F> Duma committee, by Karl Rendel; place and date not given:  "Deputies Will Have Things To Work On"]    [Text] On 18 March the president issued an edict  suspending a decree of the oblast government on holding a  referendum on the draft Statute of Leningrad Oblast on 20 March,  thus dispensing with the plans of the oblast leadership, which  had counted on approving its own "minor constitution" before the  formation of the representative authorities. The failure of the  decree to comply with Article 66 (Point 2) of the Federal  Constitution, according to which a statute may only be approved  by a legislative assembly, was grounds for taking this step.    As is known, the oblast government tried to collect certain  dividends. On 20 March a poll of the population on the draft  statute was held. Although not legally binding, it made it  possible for the government to enlist the support of residents  of the oblast. A majority of the electorate--54  percent--approved the draft.    How does this document square with the reform of local  self-government? Our correspondent put that question to Anatoliy  Sliva, chairman of a State Duma committee:    "Thank God, the draft statute was not put up to a  referendum,  after all! In the greater scheme of things they do not have  local self-government there at all. I believe that it is better  to wait but to adopt such oblast laws as it actually needs.    "The reform of local self-government should be implemented  with regard to each city and inhabited locality. This is an  all-Russian problem. First of all, reform of the budgetary  system of the Russian Federation and a clear-cut separation of  financial sources at all levels should be at issue. All cities  should know ahead of time what funds they have at their  disposal, and build their social policies around this.    "Municipal property has yet to be generated. This problem  has  not yet been solved at this point. Ownership has not been  codified by the relevant acts; property is being stolen.  Privatization of municipal property frequently proceeds under  programs confirmed in Moscow. This cannot be done. Programs  should be regional or, better yet, local.    "As far as the structures of local self-government go, the  population is their object. However, the mechanism of local  referendums has not been set in motion yet. We must definitely  come to this. I think that the future statutes of cities should  be ratified by the entire population after relevant preparation  and discussion.    "At present, the issue of a representative organ of local  self-government is very acute. If there is no such organ, what  discussion of local authorities can there be?! The number of  deputies, representatives, or municipal counselors (call them  what you please!) is not the point. That the population is tired  and does not see a perspective is not the only reason for which  the people do not turn out for elections at present. They do not  believe that the representative organ will have a regular budget  of its own."</p>

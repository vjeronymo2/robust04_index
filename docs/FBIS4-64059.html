			<p>BFN     [Text] President Yeltsin stated that Russia needed reliable  and efficient special services. "We must shake off the burden  of totalitarianism, but do away with the destructive moods in  the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FSC]," he told the  FCS's national conference on Thursday.    To quote Yeltsin, Russia must play a worthy role in the  world  community and efficiently protect its independence, territorial  integrity and historical traditions.    He also said that new approaches must be laid to the system  of Russian security. "We must have a systematic and exhaustive  information about the situation in Russia and around it," he  said. Yeltsin expects the Federal Counterintelligence Service to  provide clear-cut estimates and ideas on ways of neutralizing  and eliminating threats to Russia's security. He also said that  the FCS must give forecasts and proposals on possible political  decisions. The FCS has a sufficient potential for analysis and  operational forecasts, said Yeltsin.</p>

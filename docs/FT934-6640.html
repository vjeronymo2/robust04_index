			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Clarke outlines basis for decision The chancellor issued this statement yesterday: Following consultation with the governor of the Bank of England, I have decided that a further reduction in interest rates of  1/2 per cent is sensible and fully consistent with the government's inflation target. Since interest rates were last reduced in January 1993: M4 growth has remained close to the bottom of its monitoring range; M0 growth has been relatively stable recently; although the growth rate has continued to exceed the 0-4 per cent monitoring range, in part this is the expected result of previous interest rate reductions; house prices have risen only slightly, although prices of financial assets have increased more quickly. The exchange rate index is now around 3 per cent higher than at the end of January; there have been significant reductions in interest rates in other member states of the European Union; the growth rate of underlying average earnings has fallen from 4 3/4 per cent to 3 per cent; underlying inflationary pressures remain weak and inflation forecasts generally have been scaled back significantly; market inflation expectations implied by the yield differential between conventional and index-linked gilts have fallen by around  1/2 per cent. . . . Weighing up these factors, and taking full account of the measures I will announce in the Budget on November 30, I have decided that a  1/2 per cent cut in interest rates is warranted. I asked the governor to implement this decision at the time he judged most appropriate. . . . From now on the precise timing of interest rate changes will be a matter for the Bank to decide.</p>

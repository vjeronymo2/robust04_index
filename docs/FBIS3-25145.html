The summit was held a few hours after the official  funeral of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who died on 7  December.    According to Ivorian Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan,  the  14 African member states and France took stock of the situation  following the decision made at the 10 and 11 January Dakar  summit to change the CFA exchange rate. Kablan Duncan, who was  the summit's spokesman, told newsmen that France did not make  any new commitments on back up measures aimed at reducing the  negative effects of the devaluation on the economies of the 14  African partners within the franc zone. Mr. Duncan further said  that Paris has, however, decided to continue backing them at the  Bretton Woods institutions and has urged them to speed up their  economic integration.    Cameroonian President Paul Biya says he is encouraged by  France's confirmation that it is willing to support efforts made  to get Africa out of the economic crisis. He therefore called  on the IMF and the World Bank to "set up the announced back up  measures as soon as possible." The Cameroonian president stated  that "the risk of social explosion increases with each passing  day." He denied that his country intends to withdraw from the  franc zone and to create its own currency. He concluded by  saying that the "franc zone is a zone for solidarity and for  people to wage a better struggle as a group."    The summit started at 1900 and was expected to last 30  minutes but it ended nearly two hours later. Those who attended  the summit included French President Mitterrand, French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur, heads of state of seven West African  Monetary Union countries, as well as the heads of state of six  countries belonging to the Bank of Central African States.

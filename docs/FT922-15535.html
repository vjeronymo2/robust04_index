			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / World Trade News: Perot draws support from across the US as the Not-Bush-or-Clinton candidate MORE than one American in five would vote for H. Ross Perot, the Texas businessman, in a three-way presidential contest with George Bush and Bill Clinton, according to a nationwide poll conducted for the Los Angeles Times. The degree of discontent with what is still the most likely match in November is underlined by the extraordinary fact that a third of those surveyed said they knew virtually nothing about what Mr Perot stood for. Fleshing out his proto-candidacy as an independent, Mr Perot has named retired Admiral William Stockdale, who spent eight years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, as his 'interim' vice-presidential running mate. He needed to identify a number two by name in order to qualify for the ballot in 28 states. He has said he will run only if he is on the ballot in every state. The poll, of 1,521 adults conducted last weekend, gave Mr Bush 37 per cent, Mr Clinton 35 per cent and Mr Perot 21 per cent in a three-way contest. Without Mr Perot, Mr Bush held a slim 48-46 per cent edge over Mr Clinton, who, in turn, led Mr Jerry Brown by a wide 53-25 per cent in preference for the Democratic nomination. The latter findings will come as some relief to Mr Clinton, otherwise pressed at every turn by Mr Brown's insurgent campaign in advance of the New York, Wisconsin and Kansas primaries next Tuesday. One New York TV poll, which did not predict a Clinton-Brown result, confirmed that the state's voters harbour ever increasing doubts about the front-runner's integrity. It suggested that Mr Perot's putative support was drawn equally from Mr Bush and Mr Clinton. But its most telling finding was that 72 per cent of those surveyed thought the country was 'heading in the wrong direction'. Mr Brown has also capitalised on this sentiment. Some caution obviously is in order. Independent candidacies often look better in the spring than in the election proper and, in all postwar elections, only one - the regional favourite, George Wallace from Alabama - scored in double digits, in 1968. At about this time in 1980, a comparable Los Angeles Times poll gave John Anderson 23 per cent, which fell to a mere 7 per cent of the vote in November. But 1980 was a very different political year. Mr Anderson, a liberal Republican, ran as an alternative to Ronald Reagan's conservatism and President Jimmy Carter's indecision but was eventually squeezed out by the two main party juggernauts. Neither is now running on all cylinders and the electorate is more clearly disenchanted. In this vacuum, Mr Perot, inundated with telephone calls urging him to run, must be encouraged by national poll findings like this one and has the financial resources to wage a campaign.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Spanish Government Bonds: Caution the watchword as orthodoxy prevails THE Spanish government bond market has performed well over the last month, recovering from last autumn's currency turbulence. But it seems likely the market may be close to the top of the rally, and already any monetary easing during this month has been discounted. It was clear midway through January that a change of perception had taken place on Spain. The bond market gained strength from a stable peseta within an improved European exchange rate mechanism, and rallied strongly as interbank rates eased. The Treasury saw its chance and took it. Altogether it is thought to have raised Pta2,900bn (Dollars 25.36bn) during January - or Pta380bn more than required. The reversal in the market trend set in after the peseta's devaluation in late November, which marked the currency's second realignment within the ERM in just over two months. Foreign investors started to return to the Spanish market, and by the end of December the accumulated Spanish debt held by non-residents rose to Pta1,870bn from a low of Pta1,600bn in mid-November. The recent rally in the debt market enabled the Treasury to cut the marginal yield on one-year Treasury bills by around 70 basis points to 13.041 per cent at last Wednesday's tender. More importantly, it awarded Pta803bn when the redemptions due only totalled some Pta476bn. The wobble came immediately afterwards, with a general brake on lower interest rate expectations throughout Europe and amid renewed tensions in the ERM. The peseta lost 0.7 per cent of its value in a single day. The Bank of Spain reacted promptly, raising its daily intervention rate by 10 basis points to 13.60 per cent and injecting only Pta100bn into the interbank market. The net financing that took place during January, on the back of the considerable volume awarded in the course of the month, suggested that the Treasury was already seeking to implement a set of new rules which, with effect from January 1994, will bar it from borrowing from the Bank of Spain. The Bank of Spain's rapid response to the end of month wobble suggested that the Bank, which under the terms of the new guidelines will enjoy a Bundesbank-style autonomy next year, was prepared without hesitation to defend the peseta as soon as it came under pressure. The Bank of Spain cannot be faulted on caution. Ten days ago it announced, with considerable justification, that the peseta had put the troubles of the currency upheavals behind it and that normalisation was on line. And yet it brought the benchmark intervention rate down by only a half-point, from 13.75 per cent to 13.25 per cent. Independently of any future tensions within the ERM, it is this strict sense of domestic orthodoxy that has prompted the market to discount further easing. The authorities are still a long way from being satisfied that spending is under control and that wage settlements are indeed moderating. Furthermore, there is still probably at least Pta1,000bn of debt that will require refinancing before the first quarter is out. The fixed-income research department of Madrid brokers FG is forecasting a conservative policy in forthcoming bond auctions. Large volumes are likely to be awarded with placing rates standing a little higher than what is being offered in the secondary markets. The market should be expecting yields of 12.30 per cent for three-year securities, 12.05 per cent on five-year notes and 11.75 for 10-year bonds.</p>

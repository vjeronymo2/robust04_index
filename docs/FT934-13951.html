			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India meets challenge of locust invasion - The worst swarms for more than 30 years have been neutralised INDIA HAS succeeeded in controlling what the ministry of agriculture claims was the worst locust invasion in more than three decades. The massive Rs100m (Pounds 2.1m) locust control operation launched early this year has averted what could have been an agricultural crisis of frightening dimensions, with India's richest agricultural land under threat. The Indian government is becoming increasingly concerned, however, that locusts are not being adequately dealt with in the Red Sea area, where they originate. India, with its 200,000 square kilometres of desert, forms the eastern-most edge of the world's biggest scheduled desert area and is particularly vulnerable to the locust menace. Beyond the deserts of Rajasthan and Gujarat lies the country's richest agricultural belt, spanning the Punjab and beyond. The civil wars in Sudan and Somalia have hampered international locust prevention operations and the voiracious insects, which breed mainly in the desert areas of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Somalia, have this year travelled east to India from breeding grounds in Yemen and Oman, across the Arabian Sea via Pakistan. The first mature yellow locusts, 62 swarms of them, flew into the Kutch and Rajasthan desert areas between July 5 and August 23. The agriculture ministry had anticipated the swarms when the winds came eastward, but had hoped that Pakistan, with the help of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, had managed to kill most of them before they could fly into India. Ministry officials complain, however, that Pakistan failed to warn India about the magnitude of the swarms. Worse, Indian officials accuse the Pakistani authorities of conciously neglecting the problem, which was confined to their desert area, knowing it was only a matter of two weeks before the wind direction changed and the swarms were blown into India. Officials in the ministry of agriculture say that Pakistan, because of her strained diplomatic relations with India, did not reveal the extent of the locust infestation. 'They deliberately withheld information from us, even lied about the number of swarms,' says a senior official in the ministry of agriculture. 'They did not warn us nor did they bother to kill the locusts,' he said. The second wave of locusts came into India in the last week of August, till September 20. These 100-odd swarms were not yellow mature locusts, but the newly-hatched pink hoppers, particularly dangerous because they can fly nearly ten times faster than adult locusts. 'This year's invasion was more severe than our worst-ever year in 1959-1960, when the locusts reached Amritsar in the north,' says Mr Inderjit Singh Malhi, joint secretary in the ministry of agriculture, in charge of plant protection. 'These swarms were allowed to develop across our western border (the eggs of the mature yellow swarms were laid in the Pakistani desert) and are particularly difficult to control because they fly 70-80 km in a single day, and settle on crops after dusk.' The pink swarms travelled as far as Jodhpur and Nagaur in Rajasthan, causing a panic in the area. Fortunately, less than 10 per cent of the area is under cultivation, and the locusts could be curbed with aerial spraying. The ministry says there was negligible crop damage because the locusts prefer to feed off trees. Helicopters were used to spray melathion and fenitrothion, effectively neutralising the swarms. Only the few locusts that survived at the periphery of the swarms escaped, regrouping into fresh swarms. A great depression in central India in mid-September caused a change in wind direction and the locust swarms invaded Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh, before being sucked back into Rajasthan. Political parties campaigning for state assembly elections in November sought to make locusts an election issue but could not do so because the operations were so effective. 'The real success of our co-ordinated control measures is that we have neutralised most of the swarms without any damage to the crops,' says Mr Malhi. 'We have ensured that new swarms are not allowed to develop on our soil.' Officials claim that India's Locust Control Organisation (part of the agriculture ministry), has been more successful than any other country in the world in dealing with the menace. Farmers in Rajasthan, and in Fazilka, Punjab, where the locusts reached in the first week of October, say that the government measures this time were very effective, compared with 1988, when the last invasion, a much milder one, occurred. Mr Malhi says his operation achieved its two objectives - to protect the crops and to ensure that no reverse migration took place when the wind direction changed last week. The ministry is now busy with mopping-up operations, with the help of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, and there is no danger of another wind change till the first week of July. But Mr Malhi says other countries, especially Pakistan, should co-operate and pool their resources to help fight the locusts where they originate. 'Otherwise reverse migration occurs, and then it is too late.'</p>

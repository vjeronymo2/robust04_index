			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso received  the IMF's support today in Washington for his economic  stabilization program.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Paulo Henrique Amorim]  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso came to Washington to begin  negotiations with the IMF on a loan for Brazil. After a long  lunch, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus read a communique  praising the Brazilian economic program, the conclusion of an  agreement with banks, the fiscal adjustment cutting government  spending, the privatization program, the strong Brazilian  position on the balance of payments, and the liberalization of  trade. The communique says the IMF promised to work closely with  Brazil to defeat inflation. The implementation of the new  currency, the real, could coincide with a loan for Brazil. I  asked the IMF managing director if a loan would only be granted  with the implementation of the real. He replied that the new  monetary unit could be a powerful anchor and an important  instrument for a possible loan. He said Brazil has to face the  key issue of hyperinflation. Does this mean, minister, that it  will first be necessary to create the real to get the IMF loan?    [Cardoso] No, it means that the IMF already considers the  plan positive. We do not need an IMF loan; what we need is that  positive signal to conclude negotiations with the banks.    [Amorim] Do you interpret this communique as support for  your  economic policy?    [Cardoso] It was expressed in that sense. He clearly said  that the Brazilian Government's policy has his support. He saw  the seriousness of our program. Camdessus went even further than  that; he personally conveyed his support to me and I am  conveying it to the president of the Republic. [end recording]    The economic team is concerned about the finance minister's  political future. We have a live report by Alexandre Garcia from  Brasilia:    [Garcia] The minister left Brasilia saying he is tied up  with  the Finance Ministry because of the economic plan. He really  wants to make quite clear that despite the insistence of  political leaders to become a presidential candidate, the  economic plan should not be mixed with electoral goals. But  today the Finance Ministry economic team said the plan's most  difficult part already has been done, that the team alone can  continue implementing the program in the ministry. The team said  the minister can be more useful as a senator by returning to  Congress to help in the constitutional reform, to do the other  part of the plan to eliminate the structural causes of  inflation, such as the excessive size of the state, that affect  the people's pocketbooks. The economic team believes the  minister, since the plan is a long-range plan, should begin to  think about next year, and this is why the economic team wants  the minister to become a presidential candidate, to guarantee  the conclusion of the plan. Because if government guidelines are  changed next January, the plan will fade away.</p>

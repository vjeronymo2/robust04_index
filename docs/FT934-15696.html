			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / UN plans to aid nearly 3m in Bosnia THE United Nations yesterday launched an appeal for nearly Dollars 700m (Pounds 463m) to feed and shelter 4.26m people in former Yugoslavia between now and next June, writes Frances Williams. Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said some 2.74m people in Bosnia - 1.1m more than last year - would need help to get through the winter, but repeated earlier warnings that 'without peace, the humanitarian relief effort will be unable to avert catastrophe'. Mrs Ogata added: 'With fighting and ethnic cleansing continuing, never has there been so much intolerance and misery in the region.' The responsibility for the agony in Bosnia lay with the political and military leaders. No amount of humanitarian assistance could overcome this stark reality, she said. Bosnian Serbs have agreed to allow the UNHCR to send relief convoys this weekend to Maglaj and Tesanj, two besieged Moslem enclaves cut off from aid supplies for more than 100 days, the UN said yesterday, Reuter reports from Geneva.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> A MARTYR IN THE STRUGGLE FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY  </P> <P> Make him bigger than life. Make him King Kong. Because the bigger (he is), the  more the powers that be (will be) forced to see the conditions of  (Mexican-Americans.)  </P> <P> Even our own immigrant population doesn't know the struggles we've had to go  through. (They) don't realize that we've had to struggle like hell and that  people died, Ruben died, a couple of others died, in the struggle for equal  opportunity.  </P> <P> It's important that they know that it's been a struggle and that they've got to  pick up the torch. Every time he's honored, it makes the majority community see  the problems in our community -- the lack of self-determination and political  equality. He forces the community to see we exist. Sometimes they want to  believe we're subliminal. Ruben forces people to see us in our plight and  forces people to see their own attitudes toward (Mexican-Americans).  </P></p>

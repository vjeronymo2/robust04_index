			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Beijing to press for Gatt support CHINA will press the European Community this week to support its entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, arguing that orderly international trading would be better served by its membership. Mrs Wu Yi, the new minister of China's powerful ministry of foreign trade and economic co-operation, will head the country's team in the 12th session of the China-EC joint commission on trade and economic co-operation. The Sino-EC meeting assumes more than usual importance this year because of the Gatt issue, and because of continuing European misgivings over China's large trade surplus of Dollars 13bn with EC member states. Speaking on the eve of her departure for Europe, Mrs Wu called on the EC to be more understanding of China as a developing country with low average per capita income. 'We still need international understanding and support, including that from the EC,' she told China Daily. Beijing has been disappointed by the tough US attitude to its Gatt entry. The US is making the running on resolving details of Chinese access to the world trading body. One of Mrs Wu's aims will be to loosen EC support for the US position, which China believes is partly dictated by US domestic concerns.</p>

Yeltsin: A View From His Inner Circle."]    [Text] Before New Year's there appeared in the NEW  YORK TIMES an article by William Safire written as if it were by  Boris Yeltsin. The situation that had developed before and after  the elections on the Russian political scene was represented as  the result of Yeltsin's clever moves, everything having gone  precisely as planned: I had to show the democratic reformers how  much they depended on me, and to do this I introduced and ran  Zhirinovskiy, and, moreover, he is a counterbalance to my "main  problem"--Yavlinskiy, and so forth.    The old faithful hard-working chance put me in touch  with people from Boris Yeltsin's inner circle, which resulted in  the recording I was permitted to make without naming names. It  seemed interesting and necessary to give the Russian reader a  different view of this president's inner world from the one  conceived by the American.    [Kuchkina] What do you think, was the very form in which the  article was written ethical? To what extent does the mode of  thinking ascribed to Yeltsin correspond to his real one?    [Answer] Genres may vary. We have already read what was  supposed to be a letter from B.N. in response to the letter to  him from Vitaliy Tretyakov, and this is similar to a certain  degree. There are no complaints against the genre. But the  character, world view, internal content, and sequence of  thoughts of the person represented are in no way accurate, they  are altogether different. This is some kind of laboratory test  model, and the author has no need to feel the national character.    [Kuchkina] When you read articles like this, how do you feel  about them, are you offended or insulted?    [Answer] Yes.    [Kuchkina] But you remain silent?    [Answer] We are not being silent. We are drawing our own  conclusions. We have emotions just like anyone else, but the  main thing are the conclusions: This means that somewhere  something was missed, was not explained. Because such  conjectures begin when there is no information.    [Kuchkina] At his last news conference the president  announced that he wanted to expand the channels of independent  information. What lies behind this?    [Answer] The need to improve and increase the effectiveness  of the work of structures of government and administration. For  which it is necessary to arrange contacts with independent  experts outside the Kremlin. Assessments inside the Kremlin may  be subjectively slanted even in spite of a person's will.  Independent experts frequently give unpleasant information.    [Kuchkina] Does he read the newspapers?    [Answer] Information from the newspapers comes to him  directly. He has many newspapers and he reads them all himself.    [Kuchkina] According to rumor he read something in  NEZAVISIMAYA and threw it down saying: Get this paper out of my  sight.    [Answer] As I recall, something similar happened with  PRAVDA.  When the tone is insulting to him, when the words are  insulting--that kind of reaction is possible. But the next day  this newspaper still must be lying there on his desk.    [Kuchkina] A sharp reaction--is that his human character or  his obkom [oblast committee] character?    [Answer] Human. He does not get angry, he does not get  wrathful, this offends him, and he takes it hard.    [Kuchkina] Is he given the mail that comes to him?    [Answer] There is a department that reads letters,  generalizes them, and submits summaries. The clearest and the  most profound and serious are given to him.    [Kuchkina] And abuse?    [Answer] Sometimes he asks to see these himself. But if it  is  nothing but vulgarity and nothing else, then no.    [Kuchkina] But does he know that there is mail like this?    [Answer] In all of the summaries they write down in detail  and with candor the subjects, the problems, and the attitudes.    [Kuchkina] The outline of events for 3-4 October is largely  known. I recall that one commentator said on the radio at that  time: Thank you, Boris Nikolayevich, and now go--to a monastery,  wherever you want, shovel away a little more dirt and then leave.    [Answer] As for his feelings, these hours and days were  probably the most difficult in his life. It was a tragedy. When  he uttered this word in a speech on television it was his  personal assessment. He felt sympathy both with the disturbances  and with the victims. How did he cope with this--and he did cope  with it--is very difficult to say. But regarding the monastery,  regarding the sin--he felt that. And no matter what he did, even  if he were to leave his post, he had the feeling that this load,  this burden would be on him for the rest of his life. He wakes  up in the middle of the night, that is, it is always with him  now. Recently he uttered the sentence: I do not believe in God  but perhaps I will believe. Mainly because he feels the burden  of these victims. This is his cross to bear.    He arrived at the decision to storm the White House after  much torment and he made it with immense difficulty. He had to  break something or twist something inside himself, and this same  thing had to be done by his inner circle, the people in power,  and Dmitriy Antonovich Volkogonov, who as a part of the  operations group had to spend a long time persuading B.N. after  the seizure of the mayor's office and the battles near Ostankino  that it was necessary to break up this group, there was no other  solution, otherwise everything would be in vain because, as we  imagined, the very next morning if they were to remain there  they would arrange all kinds of communications, a certain part  of the army could be on their side, and then a real civil war  would break out. Possibly B.N. would not have resorted to the  edict of 21 September if he had known what would happen on 4  October. Not even on the 3d, but the 4th. We are not yet  familiar with all the documents, but that autumn opponents of  the reforms, conventionally speaking, declared a season of  battle, everywhere there was information about growing tension,  about a whole series of actions scheduled apparently for 7  November--the day when Soviet power was to have been restored.  To a certain degree the edict was to forestall these events. And  the entire power line was calculated so that there would be no  bloody developments. He emphasized that repeatedly. There was a  sense of what we cannot allow. What we could not allow. On the  3d, after the disturbances had already begun at the Crimean  Bridge, he understood that it could not be avoided.    Incidentally, while aggravating the situation, Rutskoy,  Khasbulatov, and Baburin, apparently, were not counting on such  harsh measures in response from the president because they knew  him. And knowing him, they thought that he would appeal to the  people, the components of the Federation, the international  community, and perhaps he would defend the Kremlin and that  would be all....    [Kuchkina] As a good person he considers the development of  events on one plane, but events proceed on another. Perhaps here  it is not enough to be a good person; it is necessary to be a  good analyst, or a good analyst must be nearby so that it will  be possible to follow thinking different from his own.    [Answer] Yeltsin himself is a very complicated person. He is  so big that it will take more time to get to know him. Even we  who have been working with him for many years are always  discovering something about him. So far we have been speaking  about his human qualities. But there is also Yeltsin the  politician who has a cold intellect and deep and far-sighted  understanding. And all the events after 21 September and after 3  October were calculated with a cold intellect. He prepared the  edict himself. And how events would develop if he made a  mistake. He is aware every moment that he is the president of an  immense country and bears responsibility for this country, he  feels this responsibility with his bones, with his mind, with  every cell. But politics is not chess, and reality can always  bring surprises.    [Kuchkina] That is, all the mythology that he merely signs  things and that all of his inner circle plays the role of king,  and the king may go to Zavidovo and sit there, as Zhirinovskiy  says, does not square with reality?    [Answer] This, incidentally, is another conscious means of  evoking additional negative emotions. It is clear that it is  impossible to do without analysts, without aides, and without an  inner circle because the volume of work performed by the  president is gigantic. But the president and his inner circle  must not exchange places. There can be certain edicts that are  signed in error, but he has the ability to recognize his own  mistakes. Gorbachev would not admit his mistakes for anything.  He would find some way to wriggle out of them and not admit his  mistakes. B.N. has learned to admit things. But it is not even  that: He is also able to correct his mistakes.    He has a clear mind and a phenomenal memory. He takes a text  and reads it down the middle while managing to cover everything  on the left and right. He will say, I have already read it. Some  people will answer him: That cannot be. He will recite the text  of the document by heart. He selects people he trusts for their  abilities and their orderliness in work and preparing documents.  As long as the person does not make a mistake. Then he starts to  watch them more closely. There are many problems, and there are  also problems that are new to him or that have been  underestimated so far. But the many problems on the fundamental  or strategic plane he knows in detail.    Before becoming the chairman of the government he worked  with  the economy on the scale of the oblast. Market reform on a  practical plane was something new for him. When Gaydar began his  work we went to all the sessions of the government. We saw that  he began to speak with them as equals fairly quickly. Of course,  Gaydar knows more, and of course, he speaks in the language of  economic categories as a scholar who has gone into this in  depth. But even after a month and a half they recognized B.N. as  the informal leader of the government and began to work as a  unified team.    Or here is an example from international practice. The main  topic of one of his conversations with Major was nuclear  disarmament. At first they spoke on one level, discussing the  political aspects of the problem, and B.N. went deeper and  deeper, and reached a point where the other person simply threw  up his hands. Major recognized him as a specialist with a  thorough knowledge of his subject. This is a unique quality  which remained with him from the previous system: He understands  the significance of responsibility.    [Kuchkina] Did he also sign the last edict on the KGB, to  use  the old name, himself?    [Answer] The peculiarity of the last edict consists in that  he understood the system with which he was dealing and that even  if he had entrusted someone else to sign the edict, within a  couple of hours or minutes this would become known. Therefore he  prepared the edict himself. At the news conference he even  called it not an edict but an operation which he conducted.    [Kuchkina] Was the president not too late? Perhaps the  historic moment had passed? Was it done on the wrong wave of  expectations?    [Answer] Perhaps on the propaganda plane he was too late.  But  the essence of the matter is that the KGB is not an organ you  can joke around with. After all, the president had been hearing  reproaches about this for a very long time. But if you have no  forces and no capabilities and you offend it, this monster, it  will tear down everything, destroy everything, and it will tear  you down too in a couple of hours. One has the feeling that he  was waiting for the proper moment and waited until it came. On  the eve of the edict in the Ministry of Security some people  were working for the president, some people were working for  others, and some people were drinking. And the fact that B.N.  selected the moment when nobody even said oh-oh....    [Kuchkina] Are you trying to say that he is able to choose  the right moment?    [Answer] Yes. He comes up with an idea and then carries it  through.    [Kuchkina] In your opinion, are there strategic tasks which  the president has set for himself for the term of his presidency?    [Answer] The main task is for Russia to be an economically  strong power, and it can be this only through the assimilation  of market management mechanisms. This means that it is necessary  to conduct market reform. The communist Soviet system is  completely obsolete and holds things back, it must be reworked,  and this requires the Constitution. And so forth. As president  it seems that he recognizes his role, which consists largely of  raking up the dirt. But what can he do? He must rake it up so  that he can lay a foundation for the future. Others will take  the work up later.    [Kuchkina] With this kind of portrait how do you feel, for  example, about his last statement about Ukraine during his  meeting with Gore to the effect that the Ukrainians are being  deceptive and that it is difficult?    [Answer] He is a human being and sometimes an idea which  should be expressed more subtly is blurted out and draws more  attention to itself than it should. This complicates matters.  The idea is noticed and people begin to quote it right and left  without paying any attention to the context. At the same time  they complain that all the information is classified as it was  before and his style is not candid, forgetting what happened  yesterday. For instance whatever Brezhnev said off the cuff, not  on paper, almost failed to become public. But now there is TV  everywhere, there are reporters everywhere, and somebody is  bound to hear you, if not a journalist then some random person,  if not from one group then from the opposing one.    [Kuchkina] What do you think, why do so many people hate  him?  From certain people he evokes a truly pathological feeling of  hatred. Does anyone think about this here?    [Answer] Yes, of course, this is analyzed. The president is  not a person who is perceived in subtle tones. The hatred of his  opponents contains a certain element of indirect recognition of  his power. B.N. is straightforward and categorical in his  communication. This has a strong negative effect on some people.    Additionally, there are objective reasons why some people do  not accept him. A period of severe breakup is linked to him. The  people lost the Soviet Union. Those who are living and working  with this breakdown, who have lost a sense of being a citizen of  a great power, may blame him for this. When we flew with him to  Almaty for the signing of the declaration of the Eleven and then  returned we had tears in our eyes because we had all grown up in  the Union, we understood it with our minds, but our hearts had  not yet accepted this metamorphosis.    [Kuchkina] And how did he himself experience this?    [Answer] Also painfully. Very.    [Kuchkina] But does he consider himself to blame?    [Answer] This is an objective process which is beyond any  human capabilities. The crisis of the system is objective.  People who point the finger at B.N. are frequently playing  tricks, and sometimes deliberately. A peculiarity of human  perception is that we consider what we have to be the worst  possible scenario for the development of events. Without taking  into account what might have been and would have been much worse.    [Kuchkina] Let us move on to the present situation. How does  the president evaluate it? What, in his opinion, will happen in  the near future? What do you think about this and what do you  know?    [Answer] The results on the Constitution are of primary  importance for the president. For in essence this is the second  referendum of the year. The political overload is absolutely  terrible and it is surprising that people are still  participating in political actions. That would not have happened  anywhere else; in any other country, they would have simply said  to hell with politics and voted with their legs. Well, about the  elections--there was, of course, the element of surprise, linked  mainly to Zhirinovskiy's success.    [Kuchkina] How does the president feel about this?    [Answer] He sees it as a serious new problem. He did not  support any single bloc in the election campaign. That was  illogical to the president. In terms of their programs the  democrats are very similar; Shakhray's party is not very  different from Yavlinskiy's. It would be wrong to participate in  the deepening of a schism: to support some of them and push some  of them away. To a certain degree there was an experiment going  on in determining the real values, the real capabilities, and  the independent rating of each democratic movement. And it was  fairly unexpected that the rating would be low without the  president. We had counted on more. Nonetheless the president is  geared to work seriously with this parliament. But one of the  problems that has always bothered him, along with the KGB, is  the army: Why did some of them vote for Zhirinovskiy. B.N.  understands that there are vulnerable national sensibilities  here--everywhere we are being persecuted, made the fall guy,  offended, insulted....    [Kuchkina] And does he understand that Rutskoy had already  loosened this soil well?    [Answer] Undoubtedly. And he is very concerned about how to  change the situation there. Another problem that torments him is  the course of the reforms. When he analyzed the materials from  the election campaign and Zhirinovskiy's success he understood  that we had voted not "for" anything but "against" the way the  reforms were being conducted. Some people had won, some had  suffered less, some more, but most people had lost. Things had  become easier in the sense that it was possible to go and buy  everything, but there was not enough money. One can sense that  this bothers him greatly from the documents he requests, what he  reads, and what he discusses with us. The reforms need a second  wind, they need adjustments.    [Kuchkina] If you will allow me, in this connection I would  like to say something which, perhaps, you also know, but it is  now important to place emphasis on it. In the first place, it is  necessary to speak with the people, to defer to the people,  joining forces, because when the people, the society, are the  passive part of the reforms and not the active part, not the  part doing the work, when they are not joined together with the  government, then we have what we have. In the second place,  America went everywhere in the automobile. What can we ride in,  what are the most difficult and neglected things here? Housing  and roads. We must begin to build housing and roads for  everyone. These should be declared national programs. Perhaps  the army could be brought in here. The people would pay for  this. In the third place, when the people know or hear about  out-and-out bribery, out-and-out corruption, this makes the  situation much worse, nobody believes in anybody or anything,  they do not want anything, so it is necessary in fact and not in  words to get rid of corruption and corrupt people.    Zhirinovskiy's party and to a certain degree his electorate  include healthy young men from 20 to 40 whose arms and muscles  are itching, and all the work threatens to go beyond the  parliamentary framework. Is this a problem for the president?    [Answer] If this party and this leader in any way overstep  the bounds of the Constitution--nobody will try to persuade them  to come back into bounds. This would present a danger to society  and the president would be resolute. But the Zhirinovskiy  phenomenon is one of the serious problems for him and for us. In  the broad sense of the word. The phenomenon of ideology. He  claims to respond to the moods of many, to respond to the needs  of those who want to cling to what is simple and comprehensible,  casting off the burden of self-determination and placing it on  someone else's shoulders. If you want to fight--go ahead, we  will let you fight. If you want to engage in business--engage in  business. If you cannot do anything, we will feed you, give you  gifts, and so forth. For people from the country and the city,  for women and men, for old and young. All this taken together  means a strong Russia with expanding boundaries. If it is cold  in your home--you will have a warm sea. People in the east will  expand to the west. People in the west will take Alaska along  with the Kurils. For everyone. The phenomenon of this deceptive  ideology is an indicator that state thinking and national  self-awareness are in a crisis. Since back in 1990 the president  has been making the assignment of gathering everything that  could be given by the best minds regarding the general national  idea, where we are going, not at the level of intuition but at  the level of in-depth theoretical developments. For now,  unfortunately, the progress is insignificant. The task has  turned out to be difficult both for the institutions and for the  individuals.    [Kuchkina] There is no philosophy of a common cause. Well,  who would be attracted by these definitions--bourgeois society,  market society? Can a market really inspire you? It is much  better to speak of a society of free initiative. It is necessary  to keep in mind all the time that the artificial world in which  we lived was or seemed harmonious to us. When you sit in your  cell, everything you have is placed along the shelves, here is a  little grain, there is a little vodka--everything, in general,  is not so bad. But when instead of a cell you have the whole  world, you do not know where to run or what to do. It turned out  that we had lost our religious and spiritual orientation. It was  impossible to turn over to Anpilov or Zhirinovskiy that which  had always been valued in Russia: honesty and justice. And it  seems to me that the president must make some kind of vivid  gesture. Not vivid in form, but in essence. Not giving up his  car or apartment--he is the president of Russia, he should not  be living in some kind of shed made of boards, but he could  declare and consistently adhere to a new policy: We will do this  and that together with you.    [Answer] There are things that are not clear, and once you  clarify them, everything goes back into place. They talk about  his moving into Gorbachev's dacha. He did not want to move there  himself, but they told him: It has all the communications  systems in place, if you move to a different place it will be  necessary to reinstall all the communications, all these  buttons, approaches, to provide for security--millions will be  spent again.    If we are to speak about the new politics, there is a sense  of this turning point: Yeltsin as the implementer and defender  of the market course is returning to the former Yeltsin but on a  new basis. Yeltsin as the defender of the people. The defender  of their daily life. The defender of their security. The  defender of their incomes. In two years the people have become  tired, society as a whole has become tired. We need new people  and new ideas.    [Kuchkina] But that also means that Zhirinovskiy objectively  becomes stronger. Here he is: a new person with a new idea. And  so far you have nothing to oppose him with. We have nothing. In  addition to everything else, his roots lie not simply in the  electorate but in the party of revanche. Having studied the  mistakes of the State Committee for the State of Emergency and  the "Octoberists," having studied the history and the coming to  power of this one and that one, it is possible to turn in the  direction of whomever he wants and whatever he wants.    [Answer] We are well aware of this. And the president knows  it. But we must not exaggerate the degree of danger. Society and  the powers also have other deep and growing roots which will not  give the revanche party enjoy revanche. Ultimately we are  dealing with a president who not only experiences everything in  his soul and is not only capable of adopting a decision, but who  also has not exhausted himself as a politician. It is not  without reason that we have spoken about this very complicated  giant of a man, about his extraordinariness as a politician and  a human being. The game is far from over.    [Kuchkina] Does this mean that we will have one person  again?    [Answer] Everything in history is personified and it is  foolish to forget this in favor of one to whom it is  advantageous to brush any person aside.</p>

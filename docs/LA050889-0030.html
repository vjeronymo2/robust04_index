			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Developer Donald Trump did not authorize the use of his name in an  advertisement appearing Friday in support of "shock TV" show host Morton Downey  Jr., according to Trump's secretary and spokeswoman, Norma Foerderer. The  full-page advertisement in USA Today, which says, "We believe in Mort" and that  "the First Amendment protects the rights of the 'Morton Downey Jr. Show' and  any show, regardless of its content," lists the names of 25 supporters --  including Trump, Robert Goulet, Harvard law professor Allen Dershowitz and  Broadway producer Jerry Cohen. Foerderer said Trump is upset and "thinks it's  horrible and unfortunate" that his name was used without his permission. Rachel  McAllister, a spokeswoman for Downey's public relations firm, said: "All the  people listed on the ad contributed to it." . . . In other Downey developments,  the talk show host is being sued by two songwriters who claim that they wrote  the theme song for his syndicated show and have never received any money for  it. John Beland and Floyd Guilbeau filed the lawsuit Thursday in Chicago  federal court. They are seeking an unspecified amount in damages and royalties.  SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

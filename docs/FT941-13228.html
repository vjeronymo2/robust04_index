			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average firmer on foreign buying Renewed hopes of economic stimulus supported sentiment, and share prices firmed amid thin trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue Nikkei average gained 295.12, or 1.6 per cent, at 18,648.36 on active buying by overseas investors. The Topix index of all first section stocks rebounded 20.32 to 1,519.38, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.11 to 1,257.48. The Nikkei opened at an intraday low of 18,427.44 and gained ground on steady demand from foreign investors. Arbitrageurs were also seen buying in small lots after the Liberal Democratic party, the leading opposition group, accepted the coalition's proposal to discuss the setting up of a parliamentary joint committee, and the index hit a high of 18,662.27 in the last few minutes of trading. Although an agreement before Saturday, the deadline for the reform bill, seems to be unlikely, some investors expect Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, to announce economic support before any other political decision is reached. Volume amounted to 280m shares, with gainers leading losers by 852 to 184, with 98 issues unchanged. Leading stocks recovered ground, with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone advancing Y9,000 to Y849,000 and East Japan Railway firming Y12,000 to Y473,000. Reports of a business tie-up boosted Honshu Paper by Y16 to Y571 and Takasaki Paper Y44 to Y291. The companies announced that they will share distribution and purchasing networks. Foreign investors bought construction companies, which have been laggards recently because of the spate of bribery scandals involving the sector. Obayashi rose Y13 to Y628 and Sato Kogyo gained Y24 at Y790. Real estate companies were also higher, with Mitsubishi Estate ahead Y48 at Y1,020. Banks, which had been battered on Monday, recouped their losses. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y70 to Y3,150 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank moved up Y30 to Y1,890. Profit-taking by corporations ahead of the March book closing hurt some retailers. Ito-Yokado, the supermarket chain, receded Y30 to Y5,170. Hokuetsu Bank, a regional bank, slipped Y7 to Y552 on corporate selling. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 200.66 to 20,401.22 in volume of 57.7m shares. Roundup Local issues affected the region's markets yesterday. KUALA LUMPUR tumbled 4.5 per cent on renewed worries over forthcoming provincial elections, and further unwinding of positions following the market's year-end rally. The composite index shed 50.53 to 1,014.02. Some analysts also pointed to the fact that excess liquidity was being drained by two large public share offers which are coming up: Petronas Dagang, the retail arm of Petronas, the oil group, and Hicom, the state industrial company. SINGAPORE went down a further 2.7 per cent as sentiment was affected by the sharp fall in Malaysia. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 62.22 weaker at 2,256.05. HONG KONG closed lower, pressured by late weakness on the futures market, after a day of seesaw trading, brokers said. The Hang Seng index lost 109.15, or nearly 1 per cent, to 11,490.94 in HKDollars 8.5bn turnover. Hutchison Whampoa put on 25 cents at HKDollars 41.25 after stating that it was raising its stake in Hong Kong International Terminals to 77.5 per cent. Property companies fell steadily on profit-taking after recent strong gains. Cheung Kong lost 50 cents to HKDollars 48.25, Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 66.50 and HK Land 30 cents to HKDollars 27.70. Banks were also depressed, with HSBC Holdings retreating HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 115 and Hang Seng Bank surrendering HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 72.50. BOMBAY saw solid buying by foreign institutions, particularly from the US, lift equities by more than 3 per cent, and the BSE index gained 123.52 at 3,978.96. Power companies were favoured, with Tata Power rising Rp170 to Rp2,140. Elsewhere, Associated Cement moved forward Rp45 to Rp3,270 and Tata Iron and Steel added Rp7.50 at Rp254. SEOUL moved up on bargain hunting in Kepco, the electricity monopoly, which ended the day's limit up at Won24,500, as well as activity in the banking sector. The composite index added 4.10 at 892.06, its third consecutive rise. TAIWAN dipped by 2.1 per cent in thin turnover, with activity dampened by increases in short-term money market interest rates. The weighted index ended 122.37 down at 5,835.51 and turnover contracted to TDollars 60.4bn from Monday's TDollars 69.3bn. BANGKOK dived below the 1,450 level on profit-taking in the textile, property and banking sectors. The SET index fell 13.99, or 1 per cent, to 1,447.60. Turnover came to Bt18.9bn. AUSTRALIA ended slightly easier in spite of better than expected CPI data. The All Ordinaries index dipped 2.6 to 2,221.9.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> DISTRICT TO STOP PAYING FOR USED NEWSPAPERS  </P> <P> Newspapers won't be worth even a penny to the Ventura Regional Sanitation  District starting Monday.  </P> <P> Despite its goal of recycling papers to reduce trash, the sanitation district  announced Friday that it can no longer afford to provide a major incentive to  recyclers -- cash.  </P> <P> The sanitation district, the last recycler in the county to pay for used  newspapers, said it will no longer pay the $4 per ton it has been offering.  </P> <P> District officials said, however, that they will continue to accept newspapers  at the Oxnard landfill from people who are willing to recycle without payment.  </P> <P> Mike Ewens, resource recovery manager for the district, said the measure could  reduce the volume of newspapers that are diverted from the landfill to the  recycling center.  </P> <P> The bulk of customers who bring large volumes of paper in are nonprofit clubs  who collect old newspapers to raise money, he said. The district paid out $226  to newspaper recyclers last month.  </P> <P> "All we can hope is that they will continue to do it from an environmental  effort," Ewens said.  </P> <P> The district, a public agency supported in part by tax dollars, set recycling  as a high priority this year in an effort to extend the life of the Bailard  Landfill in Oxnard, which the district operates.  </P> <P> The landfill's permit expires in 1993, and the county does not yet have an  approved site for a replacement landfill for the western part of the county.  </P> <P> Recycling efforts will prevent the landfill from filling by 1993 and will allow  the district to continue using the site if it can get the required permits,  district officials have said.  </P> <P> The sanitation district and other recyclers receive about $20 per ton for the  newspapers they send to Golden State Fiber, a paper recycler in Pomona that  produces newsprint from recycled paper.  </P> <P> But rising labor and transportation costs make newspaper recycling a losing  proposition, said Ewens and private recycler John Evetts.  </P> <P> "If you figure in the hauling costs, I lose money on it," said Evetts, who  operates D &amp; J Recycling Service in Ventura.  </P> <P> It is unfair, Ewens said, to use taxpayer money to continue paying for  newsprint when other recyclers pay nothing, even if the net result reduces the  volume of trash.  </P> <P> "It is not appropriate for us to keep absorbing a loss, particularly when it  places us in competition with private recyclers," Ewens said.  </P></p>

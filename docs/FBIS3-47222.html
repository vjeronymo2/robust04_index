The officials said they want the government to call off the  project. Japan is the only major country with a nuclear power  generation program which has not abandoned or postponed its  attempt to develop a fast breeder reactor.    The Greenpeace experts have been in contact with groups in  Fukui Prefecture opposed to the fast breeder since their arrival  in Japan in October.    The plutonium-fueled Monju, which is operated by the power  reactor and Nuclear Fuel Corp., is on the Sea of Japan coast in  Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture.    Naoki Ohara, a Greenpeace Japan executive director, said the  organization's strength lies in its ability to gather  information worldwide and then apply it locally.    "We consider (the fast breeder) to be unsafe and we want to  halt its operation," Ohara said.    Fast breeder reactors use reprocessed plutonium as fuel but  produce more plutonium than they consume.    Monju has the capacity to generate 280,000 kilowatts of  electricity. Construction of a full-scale fast breeder reactor  is also scheduled to begin around 2000.    The United States has halted its fast breeder program  because  of the low cost of uranium and as a measure against the spread  of nuclear weapons which rely on plutonium. Britain and Germany  have also decided to halt their programs.    France's super Phoenix fast breeder has been out of  operation  since July 1990 after a series of problems, including the  leaking of air into the coolant.    But the Japanese Government plans to have Monju reach  criticality in April, followed by about 18 months of experiments  to confirm its operating capability, leading to full operation  by December 1996.    Japan's plan to ship 30 tons of plutonium for its fast  breeder program from Europe over the next 20 years has sparked  concerns in countries which fear accidents or terrorist attacks.</p>

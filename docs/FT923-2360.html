			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Mortgage lenders in rates plea MORTGAGE lenders and housebuilders yesterday begged the government not to rush back into the European exchange rate mechanism. They said ministers should take the opportunity to reduce UK interest rates further to ease the burden on homeowners. Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said: 'The government has freed itself from the straitjacket of the ERM and now has a golden opportunity to put the UK economy on the road to recovery.' Leeds Permanent Building Society said: 'If we stay out of the ERM it is likely rates will fall. If we rejoin it will depend on the terms and conditions, but the government will be very wary and not want to see a repeat of the last few days.' Sir Brian said confidence in the housing market would have sunk even lower as a result of the events of the past two days. 'Even though interest rates finished no higher than they had been at the beginning of the week, I cannot see anybody wanting to rush out and buy a home.' The best way of salvaging the situation would be to assist the housing market. That would have a beneficial knock-on effect on the rest of the economy. The government would need to do more than lower interest rates. It should also raise the ceiling on mortgage tax relief from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000 and remove stamp duty from house purchases, he said. Building societies echoed the call for further interest rate cuts. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy group chief executive of the Woolwich, said: 'The return to 10 per cent base rates is a relief and obviates rate increases that would have further depressed the housing market and worsened problems of arrears repossessions. 'This should not mask the underlying need for positive action to restore market buoyancy. Such action should now embrace interest rate cuts to reflect sterling's lower market-related value,' he said.</p>

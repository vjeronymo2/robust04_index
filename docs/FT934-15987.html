			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Merivale Moore sees better trend After a year of advance Mr Grenville Dean, chairman of Merivale Moore, the property company, felt able to give an upbeat message with the results for the year to June 30. 'At the half year I was brave enough to indicate that the company was no longer helplessly bleeding to death. I am pleased therefore to have some good all-round news and progress to report, albeit not yet meriting the ringing of bells.' The shares rose 17p to 55p. Net assets per share were 76.7p, against 77.3p a year earlier. Net debt was cut from Pounds 49.3m to Pounds 29.6m, resulting in gearing of 283 per cent. There was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 939,000, after an exceptional credit of Pounds 2.36m relating to the settlement of a damages claim less exceptional charges. The comparative loss was Pounds 23.6m, restated for FRS 3 and after an exceptional charge of Pounds 19m. Turnover was Pounds 24.3m (Pounds 30.3m). After a tax credit of Pounds 2.71m (Pounds 1.14m) earnings per share were 12.9p (losses 164.5p). Mr Dean thought the company had been able to achieve its initial objective of rebuilding the balance sheet and now expected growth. Merivale had started the present year in better financial health than the last and in a 'far more promising business climate'.</p>

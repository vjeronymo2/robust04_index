			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Wage deal for Danish workers EMPLOYERS of 200,000 industrial workers in Denmark yesterday claimed that a new two-year collective wage and working conditions agreement was 'the cheapest ever,' writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The employers said it would raise hourly wage costs by about 1 per cent in the current year and 1.5 per cent in 1994. The main innovation is the right to full pay for the first 14 days of sickness. The minimum wage rate for the lowest paid will go up in three tranches over two years to DKr70 (Dollars 11). The deal is expected to set the pattern for other agreements in both the private and public sectors.</p>

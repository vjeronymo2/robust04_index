			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUD SCANDALS AND SAM PIERCE  </P> <P> The headline of your July 13 editorial about the HUD scandal, "Plugging Up the  Loot Holes," prompted the following afterthought to the recent exchange of  letters on the difference between liberals and conservatives:  </P> <P> If liberals want to use conservatives' money to help people, it is obvious that  conservatives want to use the people's money to help themselves!  </P> <P> I salute the editor who dreamed up the term "loot holes." It describes  perfectly the hypocrisy of the empty conservative ideology that puts profits  before people, and symbolism over substance.  </P> <P> MICHAEL L. LIFTON  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P></p>

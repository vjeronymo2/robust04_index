			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Amcor expands with ADollars 415m paper purchase AMCOR, the Australian packaging and paper manufacturer, is buying the paper manufacturing and distribution operations of North Broken Hill Peko, the resources group, for ADollars 415m (USDollars 273m) Amcor, which has faced tough import competition in the white papers market recently, said the expansion of this business should help it to reduce costs and become more competitive. NBHP said the disposal was part of its strategy of concentrating on natural resources. It will retain ownership of its forestry business, including the wood chip export operations. The businesses being sold comprise the pulp and paper manufacturing and paper merchanting operations - including three mills at Burnie and Wesley Vale in Tasmania and at Shoalhaven on the New South Wales coast - along with three paper merchanting businesses. Last year, the operations produced a profit before interest and tax of ADollars 29m. No turnover figure was disclosed, but it is understood to have been between ADollars 600m and ADollars 700m. Amcor, which is funding the deal from internal resources and borrowings, already has a significant interest in the white papers market through its Australian Paper Manufacturers division and a 46 per cent interest in Spicers Papers. 'Amcor is not earning a satisfactory return on its significant investment in these industries,' admitted Mr Stan Wallis, managing director, yesterday. The proposed acquisition, he suggested, would give Amcor 'broader involvement in the marketplace - which is essential for a viable domestic industry'. Amcor has discussed the proposed deal with the Trade Practices Commission. 'At this stage, the Commission has indicated it is unlikely to oppose the proposed acquisition,' said the company. The Australian Council of Trade Unions said it welcomed the deal and hoped it would end the lingering bitterness surrounding the Burnie mill in Tasmania. Burnie was the centre of a fierce battle, which led to strike action last year, when NBHP attempted to change work practices. Amcor has pledged to consult the ACTU. Shares in Renison Goldfields rose sharply on speculation that NBHP, enriched by the sale of its paper assets, might now launch a takeover bid. Renison shares gained 22 cents to ADollars 3.42, while NBHP added 5 cents to ADollars 2.93, and Amcor advanced 4 cents to ADollars 8.78.</p>

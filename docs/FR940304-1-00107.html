			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department included solar pre-heating as a design option for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric storage water heaters. Baltimore, Maryland was used as the location  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for evaluating the solar water heating systems. Baltimore was chosen as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one site that most closely approximated the population-weighted average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> climate of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Design Options for Instantaneous Gas-Fired Water Heaters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association commented that reducing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of water within instantaneous water heaters would reduce the heater's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to provide sufficient heated water. The Gas Appliance Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association further noted that instantaneous water heaters do not utilize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flues to transfer heat to water. Design options which concern flue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvements are not applicable to instantaneous water heaters. (Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on these issues. Reducing the amount of water in the heater and flue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvements were not considered in the analysis of instantaneous water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Natural Resources Defense Council recommended that DOE consider an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermittent ignition device for instantaneous water heaters as a design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 27).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This design option was included in the analysis of instantaneous water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Reducing Water Heater Setpoint Temperature <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another comment on design options dealt with a design to limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature of the hot water produced by a water heater. National Wildlife  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federation proposed that DOE consider the promulgation of a design standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covering the factory setting of water heater temperature controls. It stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that 140 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F water can cause burns, and reducing this temperature could lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidents. In addition, the energy savings would be substantial. (National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wildlife Federation, No. 21 at 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department did not consider the hot water setting as a design option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for water heaters. While it is true that reducing the hot water temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will save energy at the water heater, hot wash cycles in clothes washers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dishwashers with 140 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F water are required for certain conditions. All clothes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> washers and dishwashers would have to contain electric resistance booster  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters to maintain this utility. The use of these electric resistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> booster heaters would mean that some water heating currently being performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by gas water heaters would be performed by electrical resistance heating with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a corresponding loss in overall efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other Comments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Fuel switching. One of the most discussed consumer issues involved the impact of increases in initial purchase price for gas water heaters, since standards could alter consumer fuel choice, resulting in increased electricity consumption at the expense of gas consumption, and increased environmental degradation. (Middle Tennessee Natural Gas Utility District, No. 1 at 1; Wisconsin Southern Gas Company, No. 9 at 1&hyph;2; Colorado Interstate Gas Company, No. 14 at 2; Peoples Natural Gas Company, No. 28 at 1; Wisconsin Blue Flame Council, No. 33 at 1&hyph;2; WGL, No. 37 at 5; Columbia Gas Distribution Company, No. 45 at 3; Northern Indiana Public Service Company, No. 48 at 4; ENTEX, No. 58 at 2; Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company (Peoples), No. 65 at 1; Mobile Gas Service Corporation, No. 66 at 2; Northern Minnesota Utilities, No. 68 at 1; Delta Natural Gas Company, Inc., No. 73 at 1; Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc., No. 74 at 4; and Southern California Gas Company, No. 79 at 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concern was expressed that if standards imposed on gas water heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include automatic ignition, requiring electric service, there will be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sizeable increase in the prices of gas appliances. The comments argued that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> builders are concerned with initial purchase prices, not life-cycle costs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus, a switch to electricity consumption will occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is sensitive to fuel-switching issues. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated available data about fuel shares in new housing and replacement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> markets, based on historical purchase patterns, in the Lawrence Berkeley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Laboratory Residential Energy Model. Additional data to quantify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitivity in the market to first cost and to operating cost were obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, sensitivity analyses were performed in the forecast of shipments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

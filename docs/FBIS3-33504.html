Before leaving on a private flight, the  Panamanian president said: "I am going to harvest what we and  President Gaviria have been cultivating for more than a year."  Endara referred to Gaviria as "the godfather of democracy" in  Panama.    Foreign Minister Raul Mulino and more than 60 businessmen  are  travelling with President Endara to participate in the fourth  meeting of the Neighborhood Commission created by the two  nations to promote the integration of their economies and to  resolve border conflict.    Presidents Endara and Gaviria will sign an agreement that  will permit the free trade of sixty items and the implementation  of a sea line between Cartagena de Indias and Colon. The  agreement will be implemented after a year of negotiations by  the Neighborhood Commission. The two states are committed to  keeping this agreement from hurting national production. For  this reason, the initial list (of more than 200 items) was  greatly reduced, an official of the Panamanian Foreign Trade  Institute who worked in the drafting of the list has reported.    In Medellin, Endara and Gaviria will also sign an agreement  on the special status of people without legal documents. This  agreement will allow the status of one country's nationals who  live in the other country and who are able to prove that they  have resided there continuously for more than two consecutive  years to be legalized.    The presidents will review the Neighborhood Commissions'  work  on security and border matters, the repatriation of arrested  people, deportation procedures, and issues related to the social  development of the two nations.    Panama and Colombia initiated rapprochement in March 1991,  when Gaviria visited Panama for the first time. This  rapprochement led to the creation of the Neighborhood  Commission, whose work began in 1992. July 1993 in the Colombian  city of Cartagena de Indias, Panama and Colombia signed a letter  of understanding to encourage business cooperation and to  increase trade relations to more than $300 million annually.</p>

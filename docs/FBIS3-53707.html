Here is our colleague with the latest Afghan developments.    [Correspondent, reporting from Peshawar] Despite the  reduction in the severity of the battles in Kabul, reports  coming from northern Afghanistan indicate that there has been  heavy fighting between the forces supporting and opposing the  president in Konduz and Samangan provinces. Sources affiliated  to the Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society] say that in those two  areas they have achieved some victories and are preparing for a  new assault against Mazar-e Sharif.    On the other hand Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party] sources said  today that forces opposing the government have taken the town of  Qal'eh-Zal in Konduz Province and are advancing toward the  important city of Shir Khan Bandar.    Meanwhile a 15 member delegation comprising military  commanders from five Afghan jihadi parties, which met with  Afghan Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar in Charasyab, has  stated that the Jami'at-e Eslami party has given it absolute  authority to arbitrate and decide on the current fighting and  the means to end it.    On the other hand Hezb-e Eslami sources stressed today that  it and the other groups opposed to the government have  categorically dismissed the principle of arbitration and  decisionmaking by the aforementioned commanders. This came  today when, according to reports in Jalalabad, the 15-member  military commanders council from five jihadi parties, situated  in the east of the Afghan capital, called on the warring sides  in Kabul to cease fire from tomorrow morning and recall their  forces from the battlegrounds in Kabul. The representatives of  the Jabha-ye Nejat-e Meli-ye [National Liberation Front], Hezb-e  Wahdat-e Eslami [Islamic Unity Party], Hezb-e Harakat-e Eslami  [Islamic Movement Party] led by Ayatollah Mohseni, and the  Mahaz-e Melli [National Front] party are not among the  commanders who have put forward that proposal.    Meanwhile, Homayun Jarid, deputy leader of the Hezb-e  Eslami,  announced that a four member delegation from the government  opposition front -- the Afghan Coordination Council -- will  arrive in Peshawar today from Charasyab, 25 km south of Kabul,  to meet and confer with the Pakistani foreign minister and other  officials as well as a group of the Afghan jihadi group leaders.</p>

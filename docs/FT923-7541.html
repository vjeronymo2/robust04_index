			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Major keeps open troops option: Prime minister to interrupt holiday for emergency talks on Bosnia crisis BRITAIN yesterday left open the possibility that it would contribute ground troops to protect aid convoys in Bosnia as Mr John Major, the Prime Minister, announced he was interrupting his holiday for emergency talks on the crisis. British officials, however, said Mr Major was as determined as ever that British troops should not become embroiled in a peacekeeping role in Bosnia, while President George Bush reiterated that the US would not involve US troops in any multinational force 'for the time being'. British officials emphasised that Mr Major's return to London tomorrow from Spain for talks with senior cabinet colleagues did not signal the imminent despatch of ground troops to the former Yugoslav republic. The prime minister instead planned a detailed review of the options following last week's UN resolution authorising the use of 'all necessary measures' to ensure that humanitarian aid convoys were protected. The resolution, watered down by the UK, fell short of advocating military force. Mr Major's decision to raise the UK government's profile in efforts to restore peace to the former Yugoslav republic is partly in response to criticism that his government, which holds the EC presidency, has not done enough to co-ordinate international action to end the fighting. His decision coincided with a stinging criticism of Serbia by Mr Douglas Hogg, the foreign office minister. Mr Hogg said next week's London peace conference on Yugoslavia, sponsored by the EC and UN, would make it clear to Serbian leaders that their country would remain a 'pariah' state until it reversed the policy of 'ethnic cleansing' in Bosnia. But a US diplomat in Belgrade yesterday said it was 'naive' to believe that ethnic cleansing could be reversed, or that the former status quo in Bosnia could be restored. EC officials will meet in Brussels today to discuss measures to stop violations of UN sanctions imposed last May against Serbia and Montenegro, its remaining ally from the former Yugoslavia, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Mr Bush, meanwhile, said during a television interview shown yesterday: 'I don't want to commit a soldier to battle unless I know that we've got the wherewithal for them to win, and win fast.' He added: 'The US cannot be the world's policeman.' An eight-truck UN relief convoy reached the relative safety of Sarajevo last night after delivering food to the besieged Bosnian town of Gorazde, a UN official said. The convoy, which had been delayed on its return by a mined bridge, was rescued by UN forces. Moslem and Serb forces had refused to unblock the bridge, a UN spokesman said.

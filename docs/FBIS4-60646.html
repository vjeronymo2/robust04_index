			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Lutfi Shatarah in London, </F> Najib Sadiq in Aden, and AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT bureaus in Sanaa and  Cairo: "Sanaa Leans Towards Negotiations and Aden Fights to  Regain Shabwah"]    [Excerpts] A new tendency has appeared in the North Yemeni  command in Sanaa indicating "a willingness to start a dialogue  with Aden" with the aim of stopping the fighting between the  northern and southern forces as a result of which 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP],  proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Yemen in the south, ending  the four-year old unity between the two parts of Yemen.    That tendency was reflected in a statement by Dr.  'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning and development minister and  member of the General Committee (Political Bureau) of the  General People's Congress [GPC], who said that "contacts are  underway between YSP leaders and the government of Sanaa to  agree on holding a dialogue." [passage omitted]    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned from sources of arms dealers  in  Europe that Jordan has expressed willingness to purchase arms on  behalf of the northern forces command in Sanaa after numerous  states banned the sale of arms to Sanaa and Aden as long as the  war between their forces in Yemen continued. The sources said  that Jordan acted in the same way to purchase arms for Iraq  throughout the years of war between Iraq and Iran. [passage  omitted]    While the intensity of the battles generally eased after  fierce fighting on the Kharaz-Bab el Mandeb front on the western  axis the day before yesterday, the most important battle  yesterday was in the Shabwah Governorate. Shabwah Governor  Ahmad Bin-Farid al-Suraymah has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the  southern forces have captured the northern part of 'Ataq, the  capital of Shabwah, and that fighting was raging in the  southwestern part of the town.    In an exclusive telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT via  satellite from the battlefield, the Shabwah governor said that  the remnants of the northern forces consisting of a Republican  Guard brigade, a shock brigade, a paratroopers brigade, and the  6th Brigade "withdrew from parts of the town after their  soldiers looted people's property and acted like thieves."    He confirmed that the southern forces recaptured several  towns including al-Sa'id and al-Musayni'ah after inflicting  losses on the northern forces including hundreds of casualties.  He emphasized that "the liberation of the Shabwah Governorate  will be completed within two days at the most." [passage  omitted]</p>

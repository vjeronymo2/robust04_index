			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Banks praised on change in approach to lending THE west Midlands regional group of chambers of commerce said yesterday there was growing evidence of a more flexible approach by clearing banks to customers. The group, representing 13 chambers and more than 600 companies, said the clearers were looking more closely at balance sheet performance when arranging loans for finance expansion. The Bank of England has received complaints in recent months over clearing banks' lending policies, which have been criticised for linking loan risk solely to fixed assets, rather than performance. The latest quarterly economic survey from west Midlands chambers of commerce says: 'Banks are now being more innovative in their attempts to assist companies.' These innovations include restructuring loans, converting overdrafts into term-borrowing and considering taking deferred equity as security. Mr Roger Dickens, deputy chairman of the regional chambers, said the change in tactics reflected determination by banks to reduce receiverships and associated losses on loans. The main innovators had been Midland and Lloyds. Burra Burra, the Birmingham-based computer company, said its expansion had been made possible by its bankers drawing up new loans. Midland Bank said it was planning to launch a regional enterprise fund to raise venture capital of Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 150,000. Lloyds claimed it had reduced reliance on short-term finance and had set up 'business customer panels' to deal with complaints. The chambers said expansion in the region had been undermined by a fall in export orders. Its quarterly economic survey showed that orders in the past three months were flat or falling for most companies. Companies reporting growing overseas sales fell from 32 per cent in the second quarter to 30 per cent. The downturn was partly offset by an increase in domestic orders, up from 34 per cent to 40 per cent.</p>

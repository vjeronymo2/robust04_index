			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing March 10 (XINHUA) -- The political subject  panel of the Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory  Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)  met in Beijing on March 29-30 to discuss questions concerning  public servants.    Through the media here, the members of the panel answered  some questions which have aroused suspicions among public  servants in Hong Kong.    The panel noted that according to Article 100 of the Basic  Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, public  servants in all Hong Kong Government departments, including the  police department, working before July 1, 1997, can continue  their work in the Government of the Hong Kong SAR.    The panel noted that today's achievements in Hong Kong are  the results of high-quality public service and an effective  system governing public servants in Hong Kong.    The members of the panel sincerely expect public servants  now  working in all of Hong Kong's departments to continue their  service for the SAR Government and the people in Hong Kong.    The panel noted that according to Article 101, foreigners  can  be employed as public servants, but not chief officials, in Hong  Kong Government departments after 1997. However, foreign  employees must hold permanent identity cards of the region or be  working in public service in Hong Kong before 1997.    According to the Basic Law, foreigners cannot become heads  or  deputy heads of major departments of the government after 1997.  The chief secretary, the commissioner of police, director of  the Customs Office, chief judges of the Court of Final Appeal  and Supreme Court in Hong Kong must be Chinese after 1997.    On the question of pay, allowances and benefits, the panel  noted that according to the Basic Law, public servants serving  in all Hong Kong Government departments, including the police  department, before the establishment of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region, may all remain in employment and retain  their seniority with pay, allowances, benefits and conditions of  service no less favorable than before.    The Government of the Hong Kong SAR shall pay to public  servants who retire or who leave the service in compliance with  regulations before the establishment of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region, or to their dependants, all pensions,  gratuities, allowances and benefits due to them no less  favorable than before.    On the question of the "Plan of the Right of Abode in  Britain," the panel noted that the Chinese Government's solemn  stance against "The Plan of the Right of Abode in Britain" is  not to the individuals who have gained the right, but to the  British Government's practice and political attempt which  violated the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR.    It noted that the public servants who have gained the right  can continue to work in the government of the Hong Kong SAR  after 1997, but their so-called "identity of British citizens"  will not be recognized by the Chinese Government and they cannot  enjoy the British counsel protection in the Hong Kong SAR and  other areas in China.    The panel said that such people cannot serve as chief  officials in the government of the Hong Kong SAR.    The panel also said that the saying of Chinese armed police  to be stationed in Hong Kong after 1997 is groundless. [sentence  as received] According to the Basic Law, the Hong Kong SAR  Government will take charge of public security in the Hong Kong  SAR. The Chinese armed police will not be sent to Hong Kong  after 1997.</p>

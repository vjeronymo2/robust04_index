			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / People: Main course for GrandMet's Lowes Grand Metropolitan has brought Robert Lowes, 48, into the role of chief executive, Foods Europe, following the departure of the incumbent, Peter Thompson, 47, to become president and chief executive of Walkers Smiths Snack Foods, part of PepsiCo Foods and Beverages International. Lowes has been with GrandMet since December 1989, when he joined as chief financial officer of Pillsbury, based in the US. In April 1992, he moved to London to become deputy group finance director. GrandMet Foods Europe recorded profits of Pounds 958m in the year to September 1993. Immediately before joining GrandMet, Lowes spent 12 years with Philip Morris/General Foods in a variety of roles, ultimately as corporate controller with Philip Morris in New York. His new job at GrandMet will be based in Paris. Lowes' experience in the food business stretches back to 1975, when he first joined H J Heinz as an assistant manager in commodities and finance. Stepping into the vacated deputy group finance role - though the title is now group controller - is David Rickard, 47, currently chief financial officer of Pillsbury and of GrandMet Foods America. Like Lowes, a US citizen, Rickard joined GrandMet in two years ago from an 18-year background in various finance posts with Kraft General Foods in the US and Europe.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUBLIC BREAST-FEEDING  </P> <P> As a breast-feeding mother, I was appalled at Chasen's statement regarding  breast-feeding policies at its establishment -- "We don't get those kind of  people here" ("Restaurants Rethink Their Nursing Policies in the Wake of  Lawsuit," by Laurie Ochoa, June 28).  </P> <P> I am a college-educated professional and a mother of two (I even read the  newspaper) and have (gasp!) nursed both of my babies in premier restaurant  dining rooms.  </P> <P> I don't know what "kind of people" frequent Chasen's, but you can be sure it  won't be me -- breast-feeding or otherwise.  </P> <P> SUE MAZZARINO  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

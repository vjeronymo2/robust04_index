			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Sphere proposes creation of new packaged share SPHERE Investment Trust, a split capital trust, has revealed proposal to create a new packaged share, combining the current income and zero dividend preference shares. The move reflects concern at the trust that its investment performance was being obscured by the volatile nature of the different classes of capital. Split capital trusts are designed to maximise demand by creating securities that have tax advantages for different classes of investors. In recent years, there has been an explosion of split issues, particularly linked to Personal Equity Plans, where income and profits are tax-free. Some critics feel, however, that such structures can be complex and risky and may result in confusion among small investors. The Sphere change is designed to create a security with similar characteristics to those of ordinary shares in a conventional investment trust. The Package unit will comprise 8 ordinary income and 7 zero dividend shares. It should be less volatile than either of the existing classes of share.</p>

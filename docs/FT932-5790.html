			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Hard pedalling on the comeback trail: The Big Three US carmakers are clawing back market share from the Japanese Honda, the car company which for years symbolised the Japanese threat to America's automotive industry, is suffering a dismal year in the US. Chrysler, which used to be regarded as the weakest of Detroit's Big Three vehicle manufacturers, is enjoying an extremely successful one. The shift in fortunes underscores a significant change in the dynamics of the US automobile market: Detroit, having spent more than a decade losing ground to seemingly invincible Japanese competitors, is starting to claw back market share. It still has a long way to go. General Motors, the biggest US company, is restructuring, but it is still extremely inefficient compared with its rivals. And the US revival is due in no small measure to special factors, which could prove temporary. One of the most important is the strength of the Japanese yen, which has made most American cars substantially cheaper than their Japanese rivals. Yet there is probably greater optimism in Detroit now than at any time since the early 1980s, when the Japanese began capturing a larger and larger slice of US vehicle sales by manufacturing at plants in the US - their so-called 'transplant' factories - as well as exporting from Japan. Mr David Cole, a motor industry specialist at the University of Michigan, says the American industry is improving a lot faster than many experts had forecast. 'It's like a chemical reaction. You put in nine ingredients and nothing happens. You add a tenth and there's an explosion. 'The idea of the 1980s - that it was just a matter of time before the Japanese conquered the world - may not be accurate,' he adds. Take Honda, for example. It is only Japan's fourth-largest vehicle manufacturer, but it has occupied a particularly important position in the US since 1982, when it became the first Japanese company to set up a US manufacturing operation. That, and the reputation of its cars for quality and fuel efficiency, allowed it to oust Chrysler in 1991 from its long-time position as the third-largest selling car company in America. Now, however, Honda's share of the US car market has shrunk from 9.8 per cent in 1991 to 7.5 per cent in the first four months of this year. Its ageing Accord mid-sized vehicle, which for three years until last autumn was the top selling car in America, is now only the ninth most popular, and Honda has begun offering discounts to dealers to boost sales. To cap it all, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating allegations that some Honda dealers paid bribes to Honda company employees in the 1980s to win franchises and to secure adequate supplies of the company's vehicles. Honda is still an important force in the US market, with a core of loyal customers, and its sales may revive in the autumn when it brings out a remodelled and more powerful version of the Accord. But the current difficulties have tarnished its once golden aura. Compare that with Chrysler, which just three years ago seemed in such dire straits - financially stretched, lacking strong new products - that many analysts believed it could not long survive as an independent company. But it has staged an extraordinary comeback, thanks to fundamental changes in the way it develops new vehicles, a rigorous clampdown on costs and, most important, a range of exciting new models. Its share of the car market has soared from 7.9 per cent in the first four months of 1992 to 10.3 per cent this year, thanks mainly to its innovatively designed, mid-sized 'LH' vehicles - the Chrysler Concorde, Eagle Vision and Dodge Intrepid. The LH range seems to be winning over a substantial number of motorists who previously bought foreign cars. It is also selling well in one of the most crucial segments of the market - among the youngish, fashion-conscious, more affluent buyers, who deserted the Big Three in droves in the 1980s. Chrysler provides the most startling example of Detroit's revival, but Ford has also been increasing its market share, and even General Motors, while still losing share, can point to a number of successes that offer rays of hope for the future. For example, Saturn, the small car project GM began in the 1980s to try to show that America could compete using the most modern manufacturing and sales methods, is producing one of the country's hottest selling vehicles, with a particularly high reputation for quality. Nor is Honda the only Japanese manufacturer to suffer a setback in sales. The market shares of Toyota and Mazda are also down significantly this year, although Nissan, long a laggard in the US market, has bucked the trend with a sharp rise in share, thanks to a boldly designed and cheaply priced new car, the Altima. The upshot is that the Big Three's car market share rose from 65 per cent to 67.7 per cent in the first four months of this year, while sales of Japanese branded vehicles dropped from 29.6 per cent to 27.2 per cent. Adding in light trucks, the Japanese total is down from 24.3 per cent to 21.9 per cent, with the Big Three up from 72.2 to 74.9 per cent. Chrysler and Ford have been much more adept than their rivals at designing hit vehicles in the fast-growing markets for mini-vans and sports utility vehicles, which are classified as trucks. Why the change? First, the Americans have learnt an immense amount from the Japanese about speedy vehicle development, 'lean' or super-efficient manufacturing techniques, and the need to build the highest quality into their products. Chrysler, for example, radically changed the way it operates after studying Honda. It set up close links with suppliers, which are brought into discussions early in the development of a new vehicle, and it created new teams, bringing together disciplines like engineering and design, to work together on the development of models. Japanese vehicles still tend to lead American ones in quality surveys: Toyota, Nissan and Honda occupied 10 of the top 12 slots in a study of vehicle quality released last week by J D Power &amp; Associates, a consultancy firm. But the quality gap between US and Japanese companies has narrowed to the point where consumers are prepared to give greater weight to other factors, such as styling, price and dealer service. And on price the Americans are at present far more competitive. The Japanese manufacturers have repeatedly raised prices in recent months to offset the appreciating yen, which has risen 16 1/2 per cent against the dollar since the start of the year. In the past, strong financial results at home allowed the Japanese to be more flexible with US prices, but the sharp downturn in their domestic market has eliminated that luxury. Japanese cars are now on average Dollars 2,300 more expensive than American equivalents. At the same time, President Bill Clinton's tough trade rhetoric, and the problems at General Motors, may have encouraged the Japanese to temper their previously aggressive expansion in the US - at least for the time being. They will not want to antagonise Democrat Congressmen, who are threatening to press for the current 25 per cent import duty on trucks to be extended to all sports utility vehicles and mini-vans. None of this means that US auto makers can afford any complacency. Trade and currency factors can change quickly, and a recovering Japanese economy will eventually give the Asian companies a firmer financial footing. The Americans, for all their improvements, still suffer some big disadvantages relative to the Japanese transplants. For example, observers reckon that they have to pay on average Dollars 600 to Dollars 700 a vehicle more for workers' health insurance than the transplants, with their younger labour force. The US companies also face delicate negotiations in the next few months with the United Auto Workers' union over a new labour contract, which is likely to focus on health costs and companies' freedom to cut jobs. The transplants, by contrast, are generally non-union shops with more flexible labour forces. Above all, General Motors' new management team still has a long way to go in its battle to cut costs, produce cars Americans want to buy, and earn a reasonable return on its capital. But at the very least the market upheavals of the past few months have taught Detroit that it can be a winner, and that the Japanese are by no means invincible. There might be an important lesson here for the Europeans.</p>

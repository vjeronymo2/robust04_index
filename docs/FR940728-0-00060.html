			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Used Oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's rule does not affect petroleum facilities' obligations under the Used Oil Rule. See generally, 57 FR 41566 (September 10, 1992) and 59 FR 1994 (March 4, 1994). Today's rule excludes from RCRA Subtitle C requirements only recovered oil as described. Whether or not recovered oil excluded under today's rule is subject to the used oil management standards depends on whether or not the recovered oil does or does not also meet the definition of used oil.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency recently issued a final used oil rule on March 4, 1994 (see 59 FR 10550) which affects the definition of used oil and deals with issues similar to those in today's rule. According to this final used oil rule,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> quantities of used oil that are incidentally captured by a refinery's wastewater treatment system and subsequently recovered along with other oil in a refinery's recovered oil system are not regulated as used oil. 59 FR 10550 (March 4, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Enforcement; Effect of Today's Final Rule on RCRA 3007, 3013, 7002 and 7003 Authorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's action today affects only the final regulatory definition of solid waste. It does not interpret the scope of the term ``solid waste'' for purposes of the non-regulatory authorities in RCRA Sections 3007, 3013, 7002 and 7003. See 40 CFR &sect;261.1(b). Thus, for purposes of those authorities, the Agency (or citizens in the case of citizen suits under Section 7002(a)(1)(B)) would have the benefit of the full jurisdictional reach of the statutory definition of solid waste. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comite Pro Rescate de la Salud v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 888 F. 2d 180, 185 (1st Cir. 1989),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cert. denied <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 494 U.S. 1029 (1990) (upholding reasonableness of applying narrower definition for regulatory purposes than for purposes of imminent and substantial endangerment authority);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Connecticut Coastal Fishermen's Association  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Remington Arms Company <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 989 F. 2d 1305 (2d Cir. 1993) (noting potential appropriateness of applying narrower regulatory definition of solid waste for determining scope of Subtitle C regulation, but applying broader statutory definition in non-regulatory contexts such as RCRA Sections 7002 and 7003).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> XI. State Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Applicability of Rules in Authorized States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States to administer and enforce the RCRA program within the State. (See 40 CFR Part 271 for the standards and requirements for authorization.) Following authorization, authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility, although EPA retains enforcement authority under Sections 3008, 7003 and 3013 of RCRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (``HSWA''), a State with final authorization administered its hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in that State. The Federal requirements no longer applied in the authorized State, and EPA could not issue permits for any facilities in the State which the State was authorized to permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgated or enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority within specified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect in an authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

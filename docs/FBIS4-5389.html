			<p>BFN     [Text] The SRV Ministry of Foreign Affairs' spokesman on 11  April issued a statement as follows:    1. According to the latest news, a massacre of Vietnamese  residents was carried out at 1815 on 9 April at Hamlet No. 8,  Troeuy Sla commune, S'ang district, Kandal Province in Cambodia.  A total of 13 Vietnamese were killed and 27 others were  injured. Among those killed were nine children and a women who  had recently given birth. The mother was killed, while her  baby's arm was amputated. Public opinion in the locality held  that the massacre was conducted by the Khmer Rouge in the area.    2. After a series of brutal massacres of Vietnamese  residents  in Cambodia in the past, this act once again seriously threatens  mankind's conscience and boldly tramples on human rights  recognized by international conventions. This serious brutal  act is obviously aimed at inciting national hatred and damaging  the fine tradition of friendship and good-neighborly relations  between the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples.    3. The SRV Government resolutely condemns this new hostile  act. It urgently asks King Sihanouk and the Royal Government of  the Kingdom of Cambodia to take prompt and effective measures to  ensure the safety of the Vietnamese residents in Cambodia so  that they may live a peaceful life as citizens of other nations  in Cambodia, thereby meeting the spirit and letter of the 3  April 1994 [year as heard] joint communique.    The SRV Government urgently asks the United Nations and  signatory countries to the Paris Accord on Cambodia, and  justice-loving people in the region and the world to seriously  denounce and take resolute actions to stop this brutal act  against Vietnamese residents in Cambodia, thereby helping to  ensure a peaceful life for them in accordance with the spirit of  the Paris Accord and other international documents on human  rights.    The SRV Government expresses its profound concern that if  the  Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia does not take  resolute actions against this brutal and barbarous act of the  Khmer Rouge, a series of massacres may recur in Cambodia,  thereby bringing about unpredicted consequences.    Dated 11 April 1994</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Dresdner advances 11% to DM1.04bn at midway Operating profits at Dresdner, Germany's second-biggest bank group, rose 11 per cent in the first half to DM1.04bn (Dollars 660m) in spite of a 2 per cent decline at the parent, Dresdner Bank AG. Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman, yesterday forecast an above-average rise in earnings for the full year - at least 10 per cent more than in 1992, the last 'normal' period. Record profits in 1993 included extraordinary items of DM240m. As with the other leading banks which have reported in the past two weeks, Dresdner's own-account trading suffered badly from market turbulence. Income from financial transactions slumped 90 per cent to DM39m, mainly because of heavy write-downs on its bond holdings, according to an interim report. However, lending and financial services were strong, helped by persistent demand for mortgages. Net interest income rose 14 per cent to DM3.4bn and commission earnings were up 17 per cent at DM1.63bn. Group interest earnings were bolstered by results from derivatives operations, especially those of BIP, the bank's French subsidiary. In line with other German financial institutions, Dresdner reduced its provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Across the group, the total set aside fell just over 1 per cent to DM747.5m. Provisions at the parent were down 11.5 per cent at DM491m, reflecting rising domestic optimism over industry's recovery prospects. However, Mr Sarrazin stressed, no-one should conclude that the risk situation had been defused. Corporate and private demand for credit, particularly long-term loans, improved slightly in the review period, the report said. This tendency is consistent with industry's apparent reluctance to invest in the early part of the year. But since most economic indicators are pointing steeply upwards and domestic orders for capital goods have increased lately, German banks seem likely to benefit from rising demand for loans as the year progresses. According to Dresdner's calculations, the west German economy grew 2 per cent in the first half, while the east recorded a 10 per cent surge. For the year as a whole, it said it expected real pan-German growth of 2.5 per cent growth.</p>

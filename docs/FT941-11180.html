			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / International Company News: Paccar secures its 'king of the road' crown - The US truckmaker is in good shape In a cyclical business renowned for heady peaks and deep troughs, Paccar, the US heavy-duty truckmaker, has earned a reputation as a profits powerhouse, as robust as the Kenworth and Peterbuilt trucks which roll off its assembly lines. 'Paccar is probably the best-run truckmaker in the world,' said Mr Gary McManus, an analyst with Kemper Securities in Chicago. The classic lines of its truck designs have inspired a fierce loyalty among truckers, particularly the independent operators. The Bellevue, Washington-based company recently announced that net income surged 118 per cent, to Dollars 142.2m, in 1993, while sales climbed 31 per cent. Heavy trucks now account for about 70 per cent of revenues. Indeed, it was a banner year for the entire industry. Orders have jumped as manufacturers and freight-hauling companies anticipated a sharp rise in demand for trucking services. However, in 1991, when the heavy-duty market was mired in its worst downturn in a decade, Paccar was the only one of the six leading US heavy truck manufacturers to have turned in a profit, analysts say. That year, Paccar generated net income of Dollars 39.7m, on Dollars 2.38bn in revenues. By contrast, Navistar International, the only other independent company in the sector, suffered a Dollars 165m loss on Dollars 3.26bn in revenues. The others - all US operating divisions of big international automotive groups - also fared poorly. With sales of class 8 vehicles - mostly trucks used to pull heavy goods trailers - now at their highest level since 1979, all six manufacturers are working at full production levels. However, with the significant exception of Freightliner, the aggressive Daimler-Benz subsidiary, only Paccar is generating handsome earnings. Navistar's position remains uncertain. In its fourth quarter to the end of October, it surprised Wall Street by returning to profitability with net income of Dollars 22m, but reported a full-year net loss of Dollars 501m. When orders return to a more normal single-digit growth level, it may have difficulty staying in the black, analysts say. In 1993, Paccar managed to hold its market share steady at between 22 and 23 per cent during a boom driven mostly by large fleets sales. However, the independent operators, Paccar's traditional constituency, have shown more reluctance to buy new equipment, and their number is shrinking. Fleet operators, which typically place orders of 100 trucks or more, have the clout to command big discounts. As a result, the industry has been reduced to wafer-thin margins during most of the year. Mr Steve Mook, owner of the New York Metro Peterbuilt dealership in the Flushing section of New York city, says on average he makes only about Dollars 1,000 a sale on trucks selling for about Dollars 75,000 each. One of the reasons Paccar has remained profitable, analysts say, is because it has been more successful at resisting pricing pressures. Mr Mook says Paccar increased its wholesale prices twice in 1993, by 2 per cent and then 4 per cent. 'We have never been out to buy market share,' says Mr Stephen Buckner, the company's director of public affairs. Mr McManus at Kemper Securities, however, says the weak pricing environment and unfavourable customer mix have affected Paccar. He estimates operating margins at 4 per cent, against 6-6.5 per cent in the late 1980s. Mr David Garrity, who follows the company for McDonald &amp; Co, a Cleveland securities house, says Paccar stays profitable partly because its operations are leaner than most of the competition. Its workforce is younger, and it has avoided the high post-retirement costs which nearly crippled Navistar before it restructured its benefits programme last summer. Why do Paccar's sales remain so strong despite the price rises? Its Kenworths and Peterbuilts, produced by two separate Paccar divisions, are renowned for quality engineering, as well as their distinctive - and perhaps flashy - styling. Peterbuilts, in particular, are often dripping with chrome accessories. 'When you buy a Peterbuilt, you buy the king of the road,' explains Mr Mook. There is a strong sense of tradition at the Pacific northwest manufacturer, which began at the turn of the century as a railway and logging equipment supplier. Kenworth was acquired in the 1940s, followed by Peterbuilt in 1957. In the late 1980s, Paccar bought Foden Trucks of the UK. Its chairman and chief executive, Mr Charles Pigott, has been described as a grave figure, resembling a Bible Belt preacher. It is no surprise to learn he is a grandson of the founder, given Paccar's tight-lipped, no-nonsense corporate culture. As for the current year, analysts say the smaller fleets and owner-operators which began entering the heavy-duty market in the second half of 1993 are expected to help sustain sales momentum through the first six months of 1994. With the new customer mix, margins have started to increase. Paccar is better placed than its rivals to take advantage of the trend, and its reputation as the king of the road seems to be assured for a while.</p>

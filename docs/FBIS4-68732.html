			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yakov Berger, under rubric "Central </F> Asia--China": "`Trip to the West': New Version -- China Feels  Out the Ground for Cooperation With the Central Asian States"]    [Text] Geopolitical position, economic interest, and  cultural roots -- everything is directing China's chief  aspirations to the East. The future beckons. In the conviction  of Beijing strategists, the Asian-Pacific Ocean region [ATR],  and primarily East Asia, will become in the twenty-first century  a center of world development -- instead of the North Atlantic.  A pledge of this is the fact that in our time the states in the  region -- first Japan, then the "four small dragons," and,  finally, the other ASEAN countries and, of course, China  --discovered unparalleled capabilities for dynamic development.    China's main trade partners are located in the ATR. The  basic  foreign capital investments arrive from there. Linked with the  immediate southeastern "underbelly" is the most ambitious plan  for the immediate future: to create a "Large China" that would  include not only Hongkong, which is returning to the mainland  bosom in 1997, but also, they hope, Taiwan with its powerful  industrial-financial potential, and possibly also, later on, the  ethnically related Singapore.    Why Does China Need the West?    Nevertheless China, which always considered itself to be the  center of the world, is not forgetting the three other points of  the compass, including the West, which, true, is perceived  chiefly in the distinctively Chinese way. It is not the West  that, for the European, traditionally opposes the East, but the  one that, for him, is an inseparable part of the East. We are  talking about Central and Middle Asia. Those are the specifics  of the view from China.    As long ago as the time immemorial of the first Chinese  empires on the threshold of our era the Great Silk Route, which  economically linked China and the West, was laid. Then, during  the early Middle Ages, Buddhism began to spread in China, from  India by way of Central Asia. It was by that route that the  famous travelers came from China to gain secret knowledge. In  order to reach their goal, they crossed the extremely high  mountain ranges and burning deserts -- "the refuges of evil  demons and burning winds", where the only markers along the way  were the bleached bones of people who perished en route from  hunger and thirst.    The Chinese people created dozens of legends concerning one  of these travelers, Xuan Zang. In those legends he is presented  as a hero who, with the aid of his true friends, overcame 9981  obstacles and finally achieved his cherished goal -- the Western  Kingdom.    Today it is much simpler to travel from China to the West.  And it is other interests that lead the travelers there: for the  most part, economic and political ones.    The dynamic growth of the Chinese economy in recent years  has  been fraught with the aggravation of many contradictions, among  which the ones that definitely do not occupy the last place are  the territorial contradictions: the growing split between the  northern and southern regions of China, and between the western  and eastern. The fact of the matter is that it is not China as a  whole that is gravitating toward the East, but primarily its  eastern and southern maritime region. It is precisely that  region that is winning more than any other region from the  course aimed at opening China to the outside world from the  creation of free economic zones and the attraction of foreign  capital. The territories within the continent, specially the  western ones, are lagging considerably behind in economic and  social development from the maritime region that has gone far  ahead.    Further aggravation of this situation is dangerous. It can  create in the long run a threat to the integrity of the country  and can even lead to its disintegration, especially in the event  of the political cataclysms that are almost inevitable in the  future.    During the years when China followed the Soviet model, the  territorial differences between eastern and western China were  artificially equalized, primarily at the expense of restraining  the economic growth of the eastern territories. Today this  method is inconceivable. It is necessary to maintain at least a  relative balance by another method: by creating incentives for  the laggards. It is in regard that the economic ties with the  Asian part of the former Soviet Union take on special importance.    Kinsmen Neighbors    Therefore something that is increasingly important is the  interaction between China's borderland western territory  --Sinkiang-Uigur Autonomous Region -- and the former Soviet  Central Asia and Kazakhstan. The contacts between them go very  far back into the past. Historically, ethnically, and  culturally, this is a single region.    Living along both sides of the border are either peoples  which are one and the same, or are related: Kazakhs, Kirghiz,  Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Uigurs. With the inclusion, obviously, of  the population that has immigrated -- in the one instance, from  Russia, and in the other, from internal China.    In the twenty-first century the interests of two empires  striving for expansion collided here: the Russian empire and the  Manchurian empire. Unresolved border problems have remained from  those conflicts. The fact of the matter is that it is unusually  complicated to mark the border here: in some instances the  border is lost in the unpopulated high mountains, and in others,  on the contrary, it is supposed to divide pastures that are  being intensively used on both sides.    The crossing of human beings and livestock across an  imaginary border line is an ordinary matter, although formally  it is reprehensible. There have also been frequent mass  migrations. Large Kazakh tribes left Russia and went to Sinkiang  after the suppression of the uprising in 1916 and during the  1929 collectivization. Tens of thousands of Uigurs fled Sinkiang  to the Soviet Union during the starving 1962.    The flourishing of Soviet-Chinese friendship in the first  half of the 1950's enlivened the trade ties with Sinkiang. The  Soviet Union imported various kinds of products from animal  husbandry and raw materials, and exported machinery and  equipment. For the sake of friendship N. S. Khrushchev, in a  broad gesture, made China a present of a number of joint-stock  companies that had been created in Sinkiang with the  participation of Soviet capital. Soviet or Soviet-Chinese  geological and other expeditions that studied the natural and  economic resources for the development of that area operated on  the territory of Sinkiang.    Chinese Colonization    Since time immemorial the western territories were viewed by  the Chinese as one of the potential reservoirs for placing the  excess manpower from the overpopulated eastern part of the  country, with a small amount of land. The relatively unpopulated  steppe areas, which seemed, to the Chinese who were accustomed  to population density, to be boundless. Actually, however, those  areas could be assimilated for vegetable husbandry only at the  expense of the vital interests of the local livestock growers.    Actually the colonization always occurred only under armed  guard, and most frequently military personnel were the settlers.  In the nineteenth century they were Manchurian banner troops,  and after the creation of the CPR the land was settled by an  armed army corps of members of the Kuomintang, which was renamed  the production and construction corps of the Chinese People's  Liberation Army. It is obvious that this could not fail to cause  dissatisfaction on the part of the local population.    Today, when China's rapid economic development makes it  possible to lessen the demographic pressure somewhat, the  country has ben given the opportunity to shift manpower from  vegetable husbandry to trade, services, and construction, and  the nature of the colonization of the West is also changing.  Therefore, one would scarcely think that the former Soviet  Central Asia and Kazakhstan have any basis for fearing the mass  penetration of Chinese with the purpose of settling their  territory and assimilating it for vegetable husbandry.    But the intensive use of raw-material resources is another  matter. Under conditions when the ties between a Russia that is  experiencing an economic slump and this region have been  weakened, that region, naturally, turns toward China. If the  situation does not change radically within the next few years,  there is a serious danger that the Central Asian region will  change from an agrarian, raw-materials appendage of Russia, to  one degree or another, into a supplement to the economy of the  Eastern giant.</p>

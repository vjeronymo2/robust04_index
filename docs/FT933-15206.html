			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Province of Ontario back with CDollars 1.25bn issue THE Province of Ontario returned to the international capital market with yet another large global bond offering yesterday, heading a list of new issues in the Canadian dollar sector. Ontario, which has an AA2/AA credit rating, is a frequent borrower, and normally prefers to launch global US dollar or Canadian dollar deals. Yesterday's much-heralded CDollars 1.25bn, 10-year global bond issue was well-received, attracting interest from mainly institutional investors. The bonds were re-offered at 98.125 giving a yield of 8.02 per cent. Merrill Lynch, the global co-ordinator, said the yield spread over the Canadian government bond narrowed from 70 to 69 basis points. Last month, Ontario launched a USDollars 2bn, seven-year global bond offering, and is over halfway through its 1993-94 borrowing requirement of CDollars 10bn. Two other borrowers took advantage of the investor demand to launch Canadian dollar deals yesterday. The Province of Quebec's water purification agency - Quebec Water - joined the torrent of issuers to raise CDollars 125m in 10-year bonds. The deal was priced to yield 80 basis points over the government bond, giving an annual yield of 8.29 per cent. The lead manager said the deal is orientated towards retail investors. Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Denmark launched a CDollars 200m, four-year deal which was thought to have been swapped given that there are reasonable swap opportunities at the shorter end of the curve. The Eurosterling sector of the market continued to see plenty of activity, as dealers pointed out that domestic and overseas investors are eager to snap up sterling paper. Ladbroke Group, the gaming and property group, launched a Pounds 125m, 10-year issue. The proceeds will be used to repay short-term bank debt, extending the group's debt maturity profile as a result. Ladbroke does not have a credit rating, but BZW, the lead manager, said it looked at a recent Eurosterling issue from Forte as a guide to the price. Forte, which is BAA1/A-, has bonds trading at a spread of 129-130 over the gilt. Ladbroke's bonds were priced to yield 127 basis points over the gilt, narrowing to 125 basis points over. National Bank of Hungary made its debut in the Eurosterling market with a Pounds 100m, 10-year issue. The bonds have a 10 per cent coupon and were priced to yield 260 basis points over the 8 per cent gilt due 2003, giving an overall yield of 10.13 per cent at the re-offer price.</p>

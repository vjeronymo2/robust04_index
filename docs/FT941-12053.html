			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Credit Local bucks sector trend Credit Local de France (CLF), the specialist French banking group, yesterday reported an 8.5 per cent increase in net profits to FFr1.29bn (Dollars 210m) for 1993 from FFr1.19bn in 1992 despite the general downturn in the French banking sector. The French banks have had a tough time in the past two years due to the sluggish state of the credit market and the impact of the economic recession on corporate loans and property holdings. However, CLF has remained unscathed due to its specialist niche in the local authority loans market. Mr Pierre Richard, chairman, said that the group, which last summer became the first candidate for the Balladur government's privatisation programme when the state sold a 30.5 per cent tranche of its equity, managed to beat its original profit targets for last year. Net banking income rose by 8.8 per cent to FFr3.08bn in 1993 from FFr2.83bn the previous year. However, operating costs increased by 14 per cent to FFr653m from FFr574.4m over the same period and gross operating profits rose by 5.5 per cent to FFr2.32bn from FFr2.19bn. CLF is raising its dividend for 1993 to FFr16.50 a share, which represents an increase of 17 per cent over 1992. On the trading front CLF managed to raise the value of its total loans by 8 per cent to FFr277bn during the year, partly due to an increase in new loans. Mr Richard said that, despite the recession, French local authorities had maintained relatively high levels of investment. However, CLF, which expanded rapidly during the late 1980s due to the impact of the socialist government's decentralisation policy that gave French local authorities greater power over expenditure, is proceeding with its long-term policy of international expansion to reduce its reliance on the French market. The group last year opened a new business based in Madrid.</p>

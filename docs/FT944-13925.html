			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Army scales down patrols in N Ireland The army has scaled down patrols in parts of Northern Ireland. Troops have been withdrawn from the streets of Londonderry and in Strabane and Omagh, County Tyrone. The return to barracks by members of the King's Own Royal Border Regiment and the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment was confirmed yesterday. Army Headquarters at Lisburn, County Antrim, stressed that there had been no troop withdrawal from the province. There are just less than 18,500 soldiers, the same as before the IRA ceasefire announcement. Soldiers have been taken off security checkpoints on the Londonderry-Donegal border. Four checkpoints were removed at the weekend from border crossing points in County Donegal, and another lifted in County Leitrim. Meanwhile, nationwide raids by Irish police on terrorist targets at the weekend provided the first evidence of opposition in republican circles to the IRA ceasefire and the peace process. The raids by Gardai officers in four counties near the Ulster border resulted in the seizure of guns, ammunition, hand grenades and detonators belonging to a previously unknown group called the Irish National Republican Army. The operation will underscore the Irish desire to accelerate the peace process and harness Sinn Fein and the broader republican movement to the peace process. The operation follows a meeting between Mr Reynolds and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, last Thursday. A Gardai statement said the raids were directed against 'breakaway factions such as Republican Sinn Fein and the Irish National Republican Army' which were involved in 'criminal and subversive activity'. Republican Sinn Fein is a splinter group established after a break with Sinn Fein in 1986, when Mr Adams abandoned the movement's policy of boycotting elections in the republic in a bid to raise local support. The RSF, with the more extremist IRA offshoot, the Irish National Liberation Army, has refused to endorse the August 31 decision to call a ceasefire.</p>

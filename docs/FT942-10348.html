			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Recruitment: Management techniques lost in translation - Western businesses are seeking ways to develop their home-grown talent for eastern and central European operations The recruitment market for management in eastern and central Europe is becoming increasingly sophisticated as more western companies establish operations in former communist regimes. The initial flow of management from west to east has slowed to a trickle as more companies are seeking to recruit and develop home-grown managers. Where outside management is still required, companies are becoming increasingly selective. Tony Goodwin, managing director of Antal International, a specialist recruiter working solely in eastern Europe, says that the three areas of western expertise most needed are in finance/accounting, sales and marketing, and general management. 'Their education systems were geared towards technicians,' he says. 'There is no end of engineers, physicists and chemists to be found there, but because of their former political system there are gaps in some commercial skills.' Among the placements Antal has made recently was a Welsh finance manager of Romanian stock for a business in Bucharest and an Estonian-born accountant living in Leicester found for the Getech Corporation. In that case the accountant's wife, also Estonian, is a doctor, so the recruitment was doubly beneficial to the Baltic republic. Over the past four years, recruitment organisations have been scouring expatriate communities in different parts of the world. Australia has proved a rich source for Polish professionals and Paris has a strong Russian contingent. A continual problem has been attracting good western managers, particularly those with families, to eastern Europe. But a revival in the old-style cafe society culture in Budapest, Prague, even Warsaw, and improvements in schools is attracting better candidates. Recruitment has been concentrated among the central European republics. The former Soviet republics have been far more resistant to western management which, coupled with political volatility, may have contributed to Russia's sharply decreasing industrial output. Mr Tamas Toth, managing partner of the Vienna-based H. Neuman International Management Consultants, one of the biggest recruiters into eastern and central Europe, has carried out a study of the transfer of management know-how from west to east. After an initial period of wariness, where eastern and western managers were suspicious of their respective merits, he says, a better spirit of understanding was reached. Toth found that local managers did not value western managers for their organisational skills but for their expertise in financial management. Western managers in turn reported low morale among their eastern counterparts and said many were not well trained for their jobs. Both sets of managers placed differing economic experiences and eastern bloc-western mentality ahead of language problems when assessing the biggest obstacles to successful co-operation. Toth concluded that the transfer of management theory among those companies he surveyed was virtually complete, even if its effective application had still to be achieved. The challenge now for recruiters moving into eastern and central Europe is to identify and foster home-grown talent. Advocates of personality testing argue that their approach is ideal in circumstances where there has been no previous western-style selling, marketing or management culture. Herbert Greenberg, chairman of Caliper Human Strategies, a New Jersey, US-based consultancy, is seeking to apply US-style selection techniques among businesses in the Czech Republic. In a preliminary study, the company examined some sample profiles from neighbouring Poland to see whether it could find profiles of young entrepreneurs to match those it had identified previously in the US. The fear was that years of totalitarianism would have crushed any drive for selling. Part of the problem, said Greenberg, was the definition of sales among many eastern and central Europeans. The tendency was to equate sales figures with production figures. 'Somebody will say they sold 10,000 cars when 7,000 of them are still in the showrooms waiting to be bought. What they mean is that they produced 10,000 cars,' he said. The client sending the profiles was choosing sales staff from former state-run companies. 'Then he sent us a profile that looked like a sales person and we said 'This is the guy'. Our client drew breath and told us that we'd picked someone who had been working in the black market for 25 years,' said Greenberg. The potential recruit was unacceptable but the exercise did tell them that such people could be found. Subsequent research has suggested that the proportion of eastern Europeans with what Greenberg calls 'ego drive' is something like 30 per cent, about the same as that in the US. Recruitment may, however, be facing a more complex market than that envisaged by raw capitalism. The recent re-emergence of socialism as a political force suggests that doing business the western or US way may be losing its lustre in the east. Therefore organisations developing in the east may find it useful to consider the German model of consensus capitalism if they want to get the best out of their home-grown management and workforces. Sue Fernie and David Metcalf at the London School of Economic's Centre for Economic Performance say they received 600 requests for their recent paper which concluded that human resource management did nothing to improve management-employee relations. Expanding on earlier research, they have produced a new paper*, which finds that while HRM may not, by their measures at least, have delivered better industrial relations, it has improved productivity in the workplace. When they looked at both growth in productivity of organisations between 1987 and 1990 and comparisons of productivity levels, they found those workplaces that used HRM techniques produced better results than those which did not. The difference was even more marked when the comparison was made with strongly unionised workplaces. Absenteeism rates in such workplaces were almost double those of the HRM users although the same rates were recorded by those employers without unions or HRM, indicating that HRM was not a factor in this. Neither did HRM appear to be a strong differentiating factor for the rate at which people left their employers. It was noticeable that the leaving rate was much lower in organisations with strong unions. Fernie and Metcalf have leaned heavily on their findings covering industrial relations to criticise HRM. Having first removed the caring halo from HRM and its affect on industrial relations, their wider study does put its use in a broader context. If anything, it shows that the use of human resource management is closer to what the words might suggest - systems or strategies for getting the best and most out of people. The study also suggests that HRM may deliver what management has wanted most - more productive workforces. The notion that it should be viewed in any other light, such as representing a paternalistic approach, would seem misplaced. The study is based upon a Department of Employment workplace industrial relations survey of more than 2,000 UK employers, each with more than 25 people. * What has HRM achieved in the workplace?

It is "very important" for economic-related ministries to  craft measures that would lead to a "visible" reduction in black  ink within half a year, Economic Planning Agency director  general Manae Kubota told a news conference.    Kubota proposed a regular monitoring of Japan's trade  balance, for example on a monthly basis.    She said the EPA, as part of surplus-cutting efforts, wants  to formulate ways to improve access to Japanese markets and  narrow the gap between domestic and overseas prices.    Measures should be worked out before the finance ministers  of  the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations get together in  Germany on February 26, she said.</p>

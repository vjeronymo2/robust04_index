			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: US operations take toll on Quiligotti QUILIGOTTI, the USM-quoted manufacturer and installer of terrazzo floors based in Stockport, has incurred an attributable loss of Pounds 1.11m after paying compensation of Pounds 371,000 net to its previous family directors in the wake of an Pounds 8m management buy-in last September, writes Ian Hamilton-Fazey. In November the company said there would be a trading loss of Pounds 444,000 in the six months to September 30, because operations in the US lost Pounds 860,000 and more than wiped out profits of Pounds 672,000 in Britain and Ireland, and because of Pounds 256,000 bad debts provision. However, the full interim figures announced yesterday revealed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 646,000 (profit Pounds 1.08m) after an exceptional Pounds 202,000 for reorganisation of the UK business. To this is added compensation for the Quiligotti family - founding father and two sons - which is charged in the accounts as an extraordinary Pounds 371,000 net of tax; gross payments being nearly Pounds 571,000. The buy-in team initially hoped to work with the family. Losses per share were 2.53p (earnings 2.41p) and the interim dividend is passed (0.76p).</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW DROPS OFF 2.77 AS TRADERS MULL STATISTICS  </P> <P> Stock prices slipped a bit from record levels today while traders assessed  inflation statistics that came in close to expectations.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 0.92 Tuesday to its second straight  closing high, dropped 2.77 to 2,819.68.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 703 up, 792 down and 520 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 159.81 million shares, against 165.73 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index lost .17 to 193.14.  </P> <P> The Labor Department reported this morning that the consumer price index rose  0.2% in April, compared to 0.5% increases in the two preceding months.  </P> <P> Analysts said that reinforced recent evidence inflation was not reviving to the  extent that traders had feared through much of the winter and early spring.  </P> <P> At the same time, they said, the market seemed largely to have anticipated the  news with its rise to record highs earlier in the week.  </P> <P> It appeared that investors now are looking for signs that inflationary  pressures and interest rates can continue their recent decline.  </P> <P> Bond prices fell amid profit-taking today despite the government's reports on  inflation.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which fell 13/32 point on Tuesday, was  off 5/16 point, or about $3.10 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises  when prices fall, edged up to 8.64% from 8.61% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Market observers pointed to heavy selling in the futures market, which spilled  over to the cash market. They suspected that some traders were taking profits.  </P> <P> Elizabeth Reiners, a vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said there  was "no reason, no information, no rumors" that would have prompted the  selloff. "It might have been profit-taking," she said.  </P> <P> Still others suggested that market participants were looking beyond the April  inflation figure to the fact that inflation for the first four months of the  year was running at a 6.8% seasonally adjusted annual rate, despite last  month's improvement. That's up from 4.6% for all of 1989.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  were 3/8 point lower to 1/32 point higher, intermediate maturities between 1/32  point to 1/8 point lower and long-term issues were down by 3/16 point,  according to the Telerate financial information service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer,  fell 1.14 to 1,148.76.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.91% as the discount rate rose 2  basis points to 7.66%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.09% as the discount  gained 1 basis point to 7.68%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.22% as the  discount rose 2 basis points to 7.65%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at  maturity.  </P></p>

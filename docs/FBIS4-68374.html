			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Timofeyeva: "A Quiet War With Invisible </F> Victims: Over the First Quarter Novosibirsk Militia Confiscated  Almost Half of Tonne of Drugs"]    [Text] She got very scared; this was obvious to  experienced operatives from the department for combating illegal  drug distribution. And of course she did! She had spent several  days on a train. Could not sleep properly--kept watching this  milk can; she would have put it under the pillow, but this was  not possible--honey would spill out. She just walked into the  hotel room; just breathed a sigh of relief. And then everything  collapsed instantly. Here it is, this milk can on the  table--there are three kilograms of raw opium in it, hidden in  the honey. In monetary terms--more than R40 million. Outside her  window, free, city sparrows were chirping welcoming the spring,  while she was facing...    ...Novosibirsk Oblast is among the 10 regions in Russia  where  due to the activism of antidrug departments registered  drug-related crime is on the rise. There is no contradiction in  this. Illegal distribution of drugs--growing, manufacturing,  transporting, storing, and distributing--are a latent--in other  words, hidden--crime. (Alas, drug use has been taken off the  list of criminal offenses during the past few years). This means  that the better the operatives' work is organized, the more the  personnel are informed--the higher the figures. Over the last  three months of last year, 302 criminal cases were initiated;  now there are 470 over the first quarter. This is against the  background of an overall decline in the crime rate. Almost half  a tonne of drugs (marijuana, poppy straw, and so on) have been  confiscated, as compared to 1,200 kg over all of last year.  Including 15 kg of raw opium. Calculate the value, keeping in  mind that one kg costs R15 million. Also confiscated: 400 kg of  controlled substances--narcotics, hallucinogenics, or substances  enhancing the effect of real medicines (tranquilizers,  antidepressants, etc.). Despite the ban, they are still sold in  the streets and in commercial kiosks. Where does it all come  from at a time when there are not enough drugs in hospitals, and  some are not in pharmacies--or if they are, it is at prices  beyond anybody's reach? The old supply and distribution  disbalance is playing into the hands of those who make money on  anything.    To win the battle against drug dealers, one must have, using  modern terminology, a data bank. "We control the situation in  the sphere of drug use," is the simple explanation given by one  of the senior people in the department. Criminal investigation  goes from crime to a criminal. In the Department for Combating  Illegal Drug Distribution [ONON], they go from a criminal to  crime. Naturally, the woman with the milk can was "escorted" all  the way to the hotel room. About a month ago there was a  burglary in an apartment in Leninskiy Rayon. The owner of the  apartment was messed up so badly that he did not make it to the  hospital. Several hours later a suspect was detained: The trail  had started with the victim who was known in the drug addicts  circles.    Approximately 40 percent of the pot consumed by Novosibirsk  drug addicts is manufactured within the oblast. Which is not  surprising, since poppy does grow here, as well as hemp, which  has contaminated 27,000 hectares. Nobody is in a hurry to remove  it--rural residents are busy with other things, and the militia  has limited resources. The transparency of so-called borders,  plus being at a crossroads, attracts drug business from Central  Asia, the Caucasus, and Ukraine. It is brought most often by  train or car. In increasingly larger consignments. Only a year  ago one kg was considered a large consignment. In January almost  12 kg were confiscated from just one courier. It is not rare to  encounter consignments of eight, five, four kg. In specialists'  opinion, the bulk of raw opium (one gram of which is equivalent  both in effect and in cost to a cup of poppy straw) is brought  from Afghanistan through Tajikistan.    I have heard the opinion expressed that militia efforts to  combat the drug business only increase it. It does not make  sense, they say, to catch small-time dealers because others take  their place. It is a superficial and erroneous opinion. ONON  works in different directions. A one-time catch of three kg of  opium is not a small-time deal. In some operations just one  seller unloads the drugs to 100 or more buyers. They get  registered, and the seller will face a trial. Drugs cost money,  and a drug addict as a rule does not work. The more distributors  are isolated, the fewer the number of mercenary-type crimes. The  department has an interrayon unit for investigation of general  drug-related crimes. There were 100 of them solved in the first  quarter. More than 20 units of firearms uncovered, not counting  ammunition. In one commercial kiosk, together with marijuana  they found two shrapnel grenades. A gun disguised as a pen was  found in possession of a female drug seller. One charge was  sufficient to kill a person. The next day, a home-made revolver  was found. A certain T., who has committed 16 apartment  burglaries and an assault, was detained.    Almost half a tonne of confiscated drugs has a street value  of R410 million--this is just for three months. This is the  amount taken out of criminal circulation. This means that this  money will not be used to support crime bosses; will not be used  to set up organized groups and gangs; will not be used to  purchase arms or hire contract killers. And these millions,  which is also important, will not have flown to near-abroad  countries, where they are like dollars for us--hard currency.  Because over a three-month period criminal charges were brought  against 54 couriers and distributors from the former republics.    What is the prognosis? The demand--which means the  supply--will keep growing. Increasingly, more young people and  teenagers get drawn into the horrible game. A drug addict does  not live long. He is lucky if he makes it to 40. Drug-related  crime committed by juveniles last year increased by more than 20  percent as compared to 1992, and over three months of this year,  by 19 percent. Crime committed in the state of drug intoxication  is on the rise. As a rule, distributors do not use their own  goods. Of more than 300 persons (80 of them women) charged with  distribution of drugs, only two had previous convictions. Fresh  people--which means that the drug business does not surrender  its positions. There is also a trend toward the use of synthetic  drugs, which destroy a person 20-100 times faster.  Trimethylphentanil, one gram of which is enough to make 1,000  doses, and crack have not yet reached us. Choice drugs cost  incredible money. The situation is under control. Last year two  labs were liquidated in the city, which had the needed set of  chemicals to produce "synthetics." The number of poly-drug  addicts--those who can use anything, whether it is hashish,  marijuana, or vodka--is growing.    Meanwhile, many bitter words are being said in different  departments on the subject of combating and preventing drug  addiction. The result is practically zero. It is like the shouts  "Halva! Halva!" do not make sweet taste in the mouth. While  medical practitioners for drug addiction have a clear picture of  the terrible danger, it looks like our educational system does  not intend at this point to enlighten children and their parents  openly and on a broad scale. ONON personnel have enough  conversations with fathers and mothers who refused to notice the  strange behavior of their offspring and the suspicious glitter  in their eyes. Where are our hygienic-educational measures,  which used to be quite strong in the past?    The drug business is essentially a part of organized crime.  It is also smuggling. It has to be interdicted at customs and by  the endlessly reorganized KGB. Yes, they also work on it. But  the lion's share of the work is still left to militia.  Meanwhile, the department that deals with it has only five cars.  There are probably rich, decent, and concerned people in our  city, too. The perfidy of drugs also is in that they do  distinguish whose son (or daughter) jokingly, in pretense,  inhales that first puff. And then progresses to a needle...  Perhaps they would find it worth it to help in this quiet war,  because it is indeed a war against a formidable enemy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Michel Samahah in Beirut </F> -- live]    [Text] The cabinet held an extraordinary meeting chaired  by the prime minister this evening. It discussed various media  issues and approved the amendments to Legislative Decree 104  dated 30 June 1977. I will read the basic amendments to this  decree:    1. Concerning publications, the amendments cancel the  administrative suspension of a publication on a basis of a  decision by the information minister. They cancel the  suspension of a publication by the attorney general or by a  court decision before a final verdict is issued. They cancel  the penalty of withdrawing the license or terminating the  franchise regardless of the repetition of the crime and  regardless of its nature.    2. Concerning the press, the amendments cancel the  precautionary detention of journalists in all press crimes.  They cancel the penalty of imprisonment for crimes not  specified in the penal code.    Concerning the procedures of trials, the amendments cancel  the judiciary's power to order precautionary detention  regardless of the kind of crime. No measures will be taken to  suspend a publication or a newspaper before a final court  verdict is issued. The trial period will be shortened. The  publication court must start a trial within three days and issue  a judgment within a week from the date a case is referred to it.  The appeals court must begin a trial within five days and issue  a judgment within 10 days from the date an appeal is submitted  to it.    Concerning penalties, the amendments adopt the same fines  adopted by operating laws. They reduce those fines which exceed  these limits. The amendments cancel the penalty of imprisonment  for crimes unspecified in the penal code.    This concerns Legislative Decree 104. The National News  Agency will release the verbatim text of the amended decree this  evening.    The cabinet then discussed the news transmitted to Lebanon  by  satellite and picked up by satellite dishes. On the proposal of  the information minister, the cabinet decided to make an  exception: Until the issuance and application of the clauses of  the law organizing radio and television media, it will allow  local radio and television media services to re-transmit the  newscasts and political programs of the following world media  services: CNN, Super Channel, BBC, NBC, Sky News, Antenne 2,  ITN, MBC, TFR, Euro News, Telefunken, and Dubai Television  picked up by satellite dishes after the approval of the  information minister within the framework of safeguarding the  copyrights of the material transmitted.    The cabinet then discussed in depth the subject of radio and  television media in accordance with all the proposals submitted  to the ministerial committee and the cabinet. It gave the main  directions for the options in this subject so that the committee  can discuss all the options and possibilities within the  framework of diversification and within the framework of  constitutional principles, operating laws, and the nature of the  Lebanese people. The cabinet took into consideration that the  television and radio media law resembles in no way the  publication law, either from a technical point of view, or in  its options, or in its penalties. Consequently, the committee  that will meet tomorrow will start on a new draft inspired by  the diversification options that the cabinet instructed it to  use this evening.</p>

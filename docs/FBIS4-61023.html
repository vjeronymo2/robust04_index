			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, 2 May, BNS -- A high-ranking Russian  Foreign Ministry official should come to Lithuania to discuss  relations between the two countries, Lithuanian Foreign Minister  Povilas Gylys said Monday [2 May] after his meeting with  President Algirdas Brazauskas.    Gylys told reporters that he and Brazauskas spoke about the  exchange of letters between Lithuanian and Russian presidents,  as well as the problems discussed in them. "There are things to  negotiate about," Gylys said, but noted that preparations for  further talks only started.    Brazauskas last Friday received Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's letter implying that the implementation of bilateral  economic treaties is bound up with the problem of Russian  transit to the Kaliningrad region through Lithuanian territory.    Minister Gylys emphasized that Russian transit through  Lithuania is currently carried out according to Lithuanian  rules. The minister said he intends to discuss the strategy of  transit talks with the head of the working group for talks with  the CIS, Virgilijus Bulovas.    Gylys said he and Brazauskas also discussed the results of  the minister's recent visits to the United States and several  Latin American countries. The minister said they analyzed  proposals for political, economic, diplomatic and cultural  cooperation brought from Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, and  Argentina.</p>

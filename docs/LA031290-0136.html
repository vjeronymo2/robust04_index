			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> OPENING DAY PARADE STRIKES OUT  </P> <P> Cincinnati's traditional parade for the opening day of the baseball season was  called off today because of the uncertainty created by the contract dispute  between owners and players.  </P> <P> "This would have been our 70th consecutive parade," said chairman Tony Bare of  the sponsoring Findlay Market Assn.  </P> <P> "We're just going to have to postpone it until the next time."  </P> <P> "I hate to see something like this scrubbed," said Bare, a meat merchant at the  Findlay Market, a street market near downtown Cincinnati. "I've been involved  in the parade for 20 years. It's been a tradition in my family, as well as all  the other merchants and folks down at Findlay Market."  </P> <P> Bare said the parade cannot be rescheduled because it is a volunteer event and  its participants cannot all rearrange their schedules for whenever club owners  and players reach a collective bargaining agreement and start the season.  </P> <P> Cincinnati has annually been the traditional site of the National League's  season opener because the city is regarded as home of the nation's oldest  professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, predecessors of today's  Cincinnati Reds.  </P></p>

It set aside a special place for daily meetings at the  embassy and appointed an intelligence team that tells the  queuing petitioners every morning that "any Iraqi with important  information to declare should step forward?!"    Eyewitnesses said three Iraqi women stepped out of a queue  of  150 persons when they heard the question and were immediately  taken into the embassy. That day only these three women were  granted visas while all other applications were rejected.    An applicant said the U.S. Embassy introduced two surprising  articles and questions into the amended visa application forms.  These are: Do you have important information [to declare], and  do you know anything about underground and terrorist  organizations and their places? Applicants say Palestinians,  too, might be asked these questions.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Meyer at Pounds 14.4m and senses slow recovery MEYER INTERNATIONAL, the timber supplier which owns the Jewson chain of builders' merchants, said the UK housing market was poised for recovery, but warned that it could be slow. Mr Richard Jewson, chairman, said: 'Housing starts have been up each month since December 1992 and housing transactions rose slightly in March and April. 'It is in the level of housing transactions, which drive repairs, maintenance and improvement expenditure, where the group looks for an increase; but the directors remain cautious about the pace of recovery.' Meyer, which launched a Pounds 70m rights issue in April, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.4m in the year to March 31, compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 19.9m, restated under FRS 3. Turnover fell from Pounds 1.13bn to Pounds 1.09m, although it increased marginally for continuing businesses. Operating profits were flat at Pounds 32.5m (Pounds 32.8m), but declined 15 per cent for continuing businesses. Property profits fell back sharply, from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 500,000. Earnings per share of 10.5p compared with a restated loss of 23.3p. As announced at the time of the rights issue, which achieved a 93.7 per cent take-up, the final dividend is cut to 5.8p (12.3p), giving a total of 10p (16.5p), covered 1.05 times. The number of Jewson builders' merchant branches fell by 11 to 191, a level the group said it was now content with. Operating profits fell from Pounds 18.1m to Pounds 11.6m on sales of Pounds 394.1m (Pounds 409.2m). Recession had taken particular toll of smaller customers, and bad debt charges increased. The forest products division raised operating profits to Pounds 8.8m (Pounds 8.5m) despite a slight fall in sales from Pounds 212.5m to Pounds 205.8m. The laminates division, which since April 1 has been combined with forest products, increased operating profits from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 8.8m. Mr Jewson said: 'Our priority must be to drive up operating margins from the present unsatisfactory level and thus restore a reasonable return on capital. Provided expectations for the UK housing market are not frustrated, I am confident that we shall make progress.' He said business in the US had improved but the outlook was less certain in the Netherlands and Germany. See stock market report</p>

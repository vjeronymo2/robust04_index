			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STARS &amp; STRIPES OMBUDSMAN NAMED  </P> <P> A former foreign editor for the Washington Post was named Thursday as ombudsman  for the Stars &amp; Stripes military newspapers, a post created in response to  allegations of censorship.  </P> <P> Philip M. Foisie was executive editor of the International Herald Tribune after  spending 26 years at the Washington Post, including a long stint as foreign  editor. He is credited with originating the ombudsman position at the Post.  </P> <P> Foisie's job will be to monitor the journalistic performance of the newspapers  and to argue with military brass over news coverage and decisions on behalf of  reporters and editors.  </P> <P> He also will be able to write a column, spotlighting errors or discussing the  manner in which news judgments are made. Foisie will be paid about $70,000 a  year, the Pentagon said.  </P> <P> Reporters who have worked for the papers say they must walk a tightrope between  reporting the news and satisfying military commanders who are worried about  sensitivities in the host country.  </P></p>

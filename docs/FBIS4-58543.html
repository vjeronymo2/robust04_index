			<p>BFN     [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry  issued a statement today expressing satisfaction at the  dismantling of apartheid in South Africa and the victory of the  African National Congress in that country's elections. The  statement announced: Our country is ready to do all it can to  expand bilateral relations in all fields.    The statement refers to the Islamic Republic of Iran's  support for the struggle of the people of South Africa to  eliminate racism and for cooperation with black struggling  groups and adds: The Islamic Republic of Iran has always  supported the establishment of a popular government in South  Africa through a general election in which all races  participate, and which is based on the principle of one person,  one vote. It is in that respect that Iran has sent four  diplomats, through the United Nations, as observers to the  elections in South Africa.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: MATERIAL GIRL MADONNA WILL BE PERFECT AS 'EVITA'  </P> <P> "I WORSHIP the paper he writes on!" That's what Madonna says about the prolific  and talented Andrew Lloyd Webber -- and with good reason. Any minute, there  will be an official announcement stating that the star of the coming "Dick  Tracy" movie is definitely set to play the long a'borning female protagonist in  the film version of "Evita."  </P> <P> I know, I know -- Madonna was up for this movie once before and it didn't work  out. Then-to-be-director Oliver Stone wanted her to audition for him before she  could be cast; he says Madonna refused. (As you know, practically every actress  who can even hum has been considered for the role of the late wife of the  Argentine dictator, Juan Peron of the '40s.)  </P> <P> Stone went on actually to audition and then hire Meryl Streep for the part. The  actress bowed out some months ago, saying she was exhausted. This was in the  middle of her back-to-back filmings of "She-Devil" and "Postcards From the  Edge." Now Stone is also out of the "Evita" project.  </P> <P> This time, no director has yet been chosen. But the movie will begin filming in  the fall. I think Madonna was born to play Eva Peron and she may just be  brilliant as the infamous first lady who sings Tim Rice's immortal words,  "Don't cry for me, Argentina!" If everything goes according to plan, Webber  will be a very busy man from now until at least the end of the year. He'll have  two of the biggest movie projects in show biz history -- "Evita" and "The  Phantom of the Opera" being filmed at the same time.  </P> <P> OH, FORGET those ridiculous gloom and doom rumors about liquor bottles hidden  under her bed and just know that Elizabeth Taylor is doing just fine. She is  already 43 pounds lighter and in good spirits. The other day, Shirley MacLaine  came to visit La Liz at St. John's Hospital, bearing a large chocolate cake in  an unmentionable male shape. She also brought along a naughty X-rated movie.  The two famous ladies devoured half the cake and hooted and howled at the film.  </P> <P> MTV HAS shown us Cher's nearly naked backside (after 9 p.m. at night, that is)  and they've offered up Madonna in chains. But the powers that be at MTV draw  the line at "male" bondage. At least they weren't too thrilled with the group  Revenge and their "Pineapple Face" video.  </P> <P> Directed by Playboy's Suze Randall, this offering has been deemed  "unacceptable," because -- among other things -- it features male band members  wearing chastity belts around their necks.  </P> <P> Just remember how fastidious MTV can be the next time they show you some half  nude woman squirming and writhing under male domination. MTV does have its  limits -- sort of. Chauvinistic ones.  </P></p>

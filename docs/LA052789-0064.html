			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE STUDENTS PROTEST IN BEIJING  </P> <P> We have expended hundreds of millions of dollars and millions of chest-puffing  phrases resisting and speaking out against communism. We have sacrificed  thousands of our young men in Vietnam and Korea; we have sold our soul and  trashed our Constitution to supply the Contras in Nicaragua; we have toppled  governments all over the globe to support drug-dealing dictators -- all to  fight communism. Three decades ago, the Hungarian Freedom Fighters were  brutally crushed by Soviet tanks because the U.S. lacked the guts to stand up  and be counted in their struggle.  </P> <P> Now millions of Chinese are standing up to their government, waving  mini-Statues of Liberties and quoting from Jefferson and Lincoln while our  President cowers behind microphones and makes feeble, wimpish noises,  cautioning the Chinese students from going too far.  </P> <P> Who does Mr. Bush speak for? Is he speaking for our boys who died in Korea and  Vietnam? Is he speaking for America? Or is he speaking for Premier Li Peng and  the Chinese Communist Party?  </P> <P> BILL LEONG JR.  </P> <P> Bakersfield  </P></p>

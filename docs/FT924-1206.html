			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Winning is not enough for Singapore prime minister A BY-ELECTION in Singapore is not an earth-shaking occasion. But the ballot today has sent nervous tremors through Singapore's body politic and prompted government warnings about the dire consequences of any change. The People's Action party (PAP) has been in power for more than 30 years, for much of that time unopposed in parliament. Mr Goh Chok Tong, who took over as prime minister from Mr Lee Kuan Yew in late 1990, went to the polls in August last year to seek a popular mandate. The PAP won 77 of the 81 seats in parliament, polling 61 per cent of the vote - a result which anywhere else would have politicians puffing with delight. But to the PAP the result was little short of a calamity. Four opposition MPs, more than ever before, had won seats in parliament. Mr Goh had lost a two percentage point share of the popular vote. This by-election, in the middle class area of Marine Parade, is, according to the PAP, a general election rerun. Mr Goh is one of four candidates up for election. Last time he was returned with 77 per cent of the vote. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, speaking at an election rally this week, said if Mr Goh's percentage of votes was reduced then the prime minister would lose his moral authority to govern. Mr Goh would become like Mr John Major, with his position challenged at every turn. A wave of uncertainty would sweep Singapore. Foreign investors might stay away. The economy would suffer. 'He (Mr Goh) will lose that moral authority both in the government and with the public. You put the whole of the government, his policies, his credibility with investors, with foreign governments, in doubt,' said Mr Lee, now Singapore's senior minister. Though the opposition has been fragmented, the small Singapore Democratic party (SDP) has made an unexpectedly strong showing, with thousands turning up for its rallies. There are very few who think Mr Goh will lose his seat today. But there are many who feel the PAP has seriously misjudged the amount of discontent with PAP policies, particularly over health care. Mr Goh might not achieve 77 per cent of the vote. That, in the unusual world of Singapore politics, would mean a defeat for the PAP.</p>

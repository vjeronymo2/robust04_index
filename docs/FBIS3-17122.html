Among other  things it suggested abolishing the post of head of state and  introducing a parliamentary form of government. In addition, in  a joint statement the opposition turned down the proposed  cabinet in full.    Eduard Shevardnadze was blamed for all the troubles and  difficulties of the country from the loss of South Ossetia and  Abkhazia to general starvation.    However, despite the protests from the opposition the  approval of the cabinet began. The very first candidate to the  post of Vice Premier Irakly Menagarishvili was approved by the  majority.</p>

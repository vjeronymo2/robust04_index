			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Arts chief accused of corruption MR Francesco Susini, the director-general of the Culture Ministry and for more than a decade the most influential official in the Italian arts world, was yesterday arrested on charges of corruption and abuse of office. His arrest coincided with the arrest of Mr Fernando Pinto on charges of masterminding the October 1991 fire that severely damaged the Bari opera house of which he was the director. Mr Pinto was alleged to have acted in concert with two local mafia bosses to reap benefit from the destruction of one of Italy's best known and recently refurbished opera houses. Magistrates have been investigating the Culture Ministry for three months. A former minister has already been implicated. However, Mr Susini, who helped establish the ministry in 1977, has been the most powerful figure controlling its large budget. He was arrested in connection with an allegedly inflated L28bn (Pounds 12m) contract to restore an 18th-century castle at San Nicoal Arcella, near Cosenza in Calabria. Also involved in the same investigation is Mr Maurizio Misasi, the son of the principal Christian Democrat boss in the region. In another development, Mr Adriano Aragozzini - the former organiser of the San Remo song festival, Italy's most popular song competition - was held after allegedly having paid kick-backs to political parties over the organisation of the contest.</p>

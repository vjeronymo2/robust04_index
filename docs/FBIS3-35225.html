			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] His Excellency President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Yemeni Presidential Council, left Amman for home  this afternoon after taking part in the signing of the Yemeni  accord document in Amman yesterday under the patronage of His  Majesty King Husayn. [passage omitted]    In a statement to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY, President Salih  thanked the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, represented by His  Majesty King Husayn, for hosting the signing of the accord  document. He said: On the sidelines of the occasion, we held  consultations on issues of interest to the Republic of Yemen and  the Hashmemite Kingdom of Jordan, and we discussed several  issues pertaining to our Arab and Islamic nation--issues on  which both countries maintain identical positions and views.    Although we have overcome the challenges of the crisis in  our  Yemeni homeland, we, as Arabs, still face more general and more  comprehensive challenges, which we should confront seriously and  honestly. This will not take place unless we patch up our  differences and consider higher national interests above other,  narrower regional interests. These other interests are  distracting our countries' attention from promoting collective  pan-Arab action and formulating the situation in accordance with  a responsible desire to restore and enhance Arab solidarity. We  must do this in order to meet the minimum aspirations of our  peoples at this time, a time in which we see a new trend of  regional relations that conflicts with the collective action for  which we yearn.</p>

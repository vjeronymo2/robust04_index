			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rebels warn coal plans face defeat PROSPECTIVE REBEL Tory MPs yesterday responded to the leaking of a draft white paper on coal by warning that the government faces a Commons defeat if it goes ahead with the plans. Mr Winston Churchill, the Conservative MP for Davyhulme, said the proposals did not go far enough and would prompt a revolt 'big enough to defeat the government on the floor of the House'. He was supported by Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, the Tory MP for Batley and Spen, who said the plan 'looks like a quick fix for the coal industry. What was written this morning was not acceptable to a lot of people.' The warnings came after it emerged that the government's draft plan envisaged expanding the market for domestic deep-mined coal by about 12m tonnes a year for five years. The package has been widely interpreted as implying the rescue of only a dozen or so pits - based on the traditional scale equating 1m tonnes of coal to one pit and 1,000 jobs. But British Coal said yesterday that productivity improvements over the last year had raised average pit output to about 1.5m tonnes per year. This rendered the old rule of thumb invalid. The government draft also came under attack from Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the trade and industry committee, whose report on coal yesterday's proposals largely passed over. Mr Caborn said the plans would 'do no more than provide a breathing space for a limited number of pits. It may offer the government a quick political fix but it would . . . deny the country a unique opportunity to develop a rational and balanced energy policy.' But Mr Caborn's decision to call a press conference to 'clarify' last month's committee report, whose recommendations he said were not 'an a la carte menu from which government can pick and choose', was itself criticised by some Tory MPs on the committee. Mr Keith Hampson, the Conservative MP for Leeds North West, said the matter would certainly be raised at a future committee meeting. Mr John Butterfill, Tory MP for Bournemouth West, disagreed with Mr Caborn's assertion that the recommendations were a package to take or leave. Mr Caborn's statement had not been discussed with or approved by the committee. Mr Caborn was accompanied at the press conference by Mr Gerard McCloskey, a specialist energy journalist, who said the report indicated there should be 'a short-term life' for six pits and an extended life for the other 25. Later, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, promised a government response to 'every one' of the committee's recommendations. The government's draft calls for the market for deep-mined coal to be expanded by adopting a four-pronged approach: blocking imports of orimulsion, a bitumen-based fuel; slowing the planned rundown of coal stocks; cutting output from open-cast mines; and using subsidies to halt growth in coal imports. One of its chief attractions to the government is that no new legislation would be needed.</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG WEST ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> IRVINE LOSES TO UTAH STATE IN OVERTIME  </P> <P> UC Irvine blew a 14-point second-half lead and lost in overtime, 95-94, to Utah  State Thursday night in front of 3,361 in the Bren Center.  </P> <P> The Anteaters, 11-5 overall and 8-9 in Big West play, will probably have to  play in the qualifying round of the Big West tournament next Wednesday at the  Long Beach Arena.  </P> <P> The Anteaters are currently tied for seventh place with Fresno State. However,  they still could end up in a three-way tie for sixth with Fresno and Cal State  Fullerton. In that case, they would avoid playing a qualifying-round game  because they would be seeded No. 6 due to tiebreaker rules.  </P> <P> Utah State (12-14, 10-7) outscored Irvine, 14-0, in a span of less than three  minutes late in the second half after trailing, 74-60, with 7:07 to play.  </P> <P> Still, Irvine had a chance to win the game in regulation when Ricky Butler, who  scored 22 to lead Irvine, missed a 10-foot baseline jumper with two seconds  left.  </P> <P> Irvine trailed by as many as six, 92-86, in the overtime when the Aggies had  their biggest lead of the game, but Justin Anderson's three-pointer with six  seconds left pulled the Anteaters to within one, 95-94.  </P> <P> Irvine quickly fouled guard Reid Newey, the conference's best free-throw  shooter at 81%, but the senior guard missed the front end of the one-and-one  and Irvine freshman Elgin Rogers grabbed the rebound, dribbled to midcourt and  flung the ball out of bounds on what was either a poor shot or an errant pass.  </P> <P> Newey, who had 26 points in Utah State's 104-71 victory earlier this season,  picked up his fourth foul with 16:24 left but managed to keep from fouling out.  </P> <P> Three Anteaters weren't as fortunate. Senior Mike Doktorczyk, Irvine's leading  scorer, andguard Kevin Floyd and Butler fouled out.  </P> <P> With Rod Palmer ill, Irvine's Mike Labat got his first start since the team's  Big West opener at UC Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Labat scored eight first-half points and did a good job of defending Newey, who  had only 15 points.

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (10): A three-way strategy - Professional services MANY OF Cardiff's striking new office buildings are occupied by the city's leading accountants, solicitors and architects - visual evidence of prosperity and growth in the mid and late 1980s, when annual fee income rose between by 30 and 50 per cent each year. However, the economic downturn has now reached the city professions, albeit in a mild form. Hywel G Jones, South Wales senior partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the UK's largest accountancy firm, points out that it would have been unrealistic to expect the growth rates to continue at such levels: 'We were seeing growth rates in our firm of between 40 per cent and 50 per cent a year. It was obviously not going to continue at that level. I do not think the professions will have it as good in the next 10 years as they have in the past 10.' But most large professional firms expect growth rates in fee income this year of between 10 per cent to 15 per cent. The smaller professional practices, concentrating on private-client and domestic work, have been hit hardest. The larger firms still have the benefits of Cardiff's dominance of service provision in South Wales, the work from inward investment projects, strong working relationships between the public and private sectors, and efficient networking facilities. The gap is widening between the large firms and the rest. Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, Peat Marwick, Touche Ross, Ernst &amp; Young, and Price Waterhouse all have substantial offices in Cardiff with national and international work as well as local. Most is generated, rather than referred from other practices in their networks. Professional polarisation has also had an impact on architects. Firms such as Hoggett Lock-Necrews get about 40 per cent of their work from outside Wales. The only profession not to see polarisation is the Bar, which is not organised on partnership or firm lines. The four sets of chambers operating from Cardiff are still expanding, but commercial solicitors tend to instruct barristers from specialised commercial chambers in London. Mr Robert Ellis, the partner in charge of accountants Touche Ross, points out that professional services in Cardiff have increased continuously in expertise, and that clients who 10 years ago would have automatically gone to London for advice now seek professional services in Cardiff. Three common factors have emerged in the way the professions are coping with the present situation, and their plans for the 1990s. These are: to widen the markets they serve on a geographical basis; to deepen the level of specialties they offer; and to build up links with practices in other European Community and overseas countries. The first means, in effect, that firms are competing not only in the local market but nationally. All the city's leading firms judge themselves by City of London standards, and believe that, apart from projects involving large numbers of people or very specialised functions, they can compete in quality and price. Professional fees in Cardiff are considerably lower than in London. The hourly rates of the leading Cardiff solicitors are between one third and a half of those of top City solicitors. The accountants have a price differential of around a third less than London. Cardiff's lawyers and accountants are seeking to exploit this by combining it with niche products and geographical access. Phillips &amp; Buck, with 22 partners and 100 lawyers, has joined the Eversheds network to gain access to a national spread of offices. Mr David Vokes, managing partner, says this trend of increasing the geographical access (both nationally and through association with other European Community practices) fits in with the move to growing specialisation. 'We are in the business of solving clients' problems. While most of our business is based in South Wales, we are able to call on resources elsewhere. This provides flexibility.' he said. A speciality where Cardiff firms have a competitive edge nationally is professional advice on inward investment. Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, for example, has built up a centre of excellence in work of this kind, and most major projects are now referred to the Cardiff office by the group's other UK practices. The second thrust of the strategy is to widen and deepen the levels of specialisation on offer. Huw Williams is a partner at Edwards Geldard, the law firm, and is in charge of the its work for the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. He is a specialist in planning and environmental law. 'In the past, the legal work on the Bay would have gone straight to London,' he said. 'I think that what we have proved is a speedy response of specialised units which are based locally. Specialisation is the key to success, and that is what we have been concentrating on.'. The accountants have been at the forefront of the move to greater specialisation with the Cardiff majors providing a full range of financial, corporate and management consulting services. Hugh Thomas is the partner in charge at Price Waterhouse and a strong proponent of accountants becoming more involved with clients. 'I think we feel we are contributing more and as Wales becomes more entrepreneurial, there is a need for wider and wider advice,' he said. One example of this is the computer consulting business established by Ernst &amp; Young in Cardiff. Ieuan Griffiths, the senior manager in charge, believes such services are now a crucial part of the overall package on offer: 'We can start from scratch and go straight through with the client in implementing strategy. Projects in some cases last a few months, in others more than two years.' The third part of the strategy and the most difficult to assess is the development of links with professional practices in other Community countries. The accountants have had a head start with their existing international links and the law firms have concentrated on developing relationships on non exclusive terms with continental law practices. Cardiff's professions have promoted awareness of the European single market in a vigorous fashion. Today, for example, Edwards Geldard and Ernst &amp; Young host a seminar on business in Europe - appropriate in a city where two of the main roads are named after Nantes and Stuttgart, Cardiff's twin cities.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / The shrewdest deal for Docklands: The government can drive a bargain Environment Secretary Michael Howard has declared that the decision to move government employees to Canary Wharf will be taken on hard-nosed value for money grounds. But what does value for money mean when the government itself has the power to transform the viability of the troubled development simply by moving civil servants down-river and proceeding with the Jubilee Line? There is a risk that Whitehall negotiators will, in the jargon of the property market, undervalue their own 'covenant': their status as providers of the most reliable income stream in commercial property. The government's bargaining position at Canary Wharf is overwhelmingly strong. There is no other comparable tenant in sight. That points to a rock-bottom initial rent and flexible lease terms that exclude upward-only rent reviews. But that is not enough. Simply by moving people eastward in bulk, the government will be creating capital value. Ministers have it in their gift to reduce the banks' write-offs and provide a profit for any successor to the Reichmanns. A private sector tenant in a comparable position would exploit the fact by taking an equity interest as a reward for restoring a lame duck. There is no reason why the government should not do the same, if enough space is taken to alter the scheme's finances materially. Should a developer try to buy Canary Wharf from the administrators, he would inevitably seek to treat with government, not least in its capacity as a potential tenant. The government would be selling the taxpayer short if it failed to respond commercially. The negotiation of the relative equity stakes would hinge on valuations of Canary Wharf with and without the government, adjusted for respective contributions to the Jubilee Line. The state's equity interest could then be subject to an agreement to sell on completion of the whole scheme. Alternatively, it could be securitised - turned into the equivalent of a unit trust for institutional investors just as American mortgages are turned into mortgage-backed securities. Yet none of this is likely to happen. First, Lord Wakeham, who co-ordinates government efforts on Canary Wharf, has asked the administrators to negotiate with Whitehall departments individually. This brilliantly undermines the government's negotiating strength by inviting the opposition to divide and rule. Then there would be practical objections about valuation. Such things, invariably surmountable in the private sector, are taken frightfully seriously in Whitehall. Finally, there is the ideological hang-up. Ministers feel that entrepreneurial activity by the state contradicts the logic of privatisation. The government's property advisers might well respond by suggesting a less conspicuous form of equity. It would be possible, for example, to structure the lease so that rents rose to, say, 70 per cent instead of 100 per cent of market value on periodic rent reviews. The snag is that while this de facto equity would have been valuable in the inflationary property market of old, the huge oversupply of London offices makes it of questionable worth today. The value that the government should be seeking to capture derives less from rental inflation than from further development many years down the line. There are other opportunities to manage existing government assets more imaginatively which seem equally unlikely to be grasped. A feature of today's otherwise severe property slump is that there are plenty of buyers for property let to first class tenants. No better tenant exists than the government, since its creditworthiness is supported by the power to tax. At a time when the impetus behind the privatisation of state corporations is inevitably waning, the sale and leaseback of more government property would be an attractive way of taking pressure off the gilt-edged market. It would reduce funding costs and make the fiscal convergence criteria of the Maastricht agreement - if they survive the present Danish fracas - more easy to attain. There are plenty of so-called trophy buildings, the kind that appeal to big international investors, in the government's portfolio. Whitehall has a stunning collection of them. Yet the ownership of the land, bricks and mortar in Whitehall is still sacrosanct, untouched by the Thatcher revolution and undisturbed by Majorism. This seems odd. Unlike the coal industry or British Telecom, the building that houses HM Treasury is no more than a passive asset. The only reason that the City is not humming with plans to privatise or securitise Great George Street is that it is simply unthinkable. The objections are all based on the idea that government tenants are somehow different - arguably true of the Ministry of Defence, but not of much else. Perhaps the Number 10 policy unit could summon up a shocking thought or two, to help ease the government's funding burden. Selling the ground from under the Treasury would bring a whole new dimension to Whitehall's turf war.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, Mar. 31 (A.A.) -- Ankara Chief Prosecutor  Nazmi Sarvan said today that his office took under protection  ballots which were found in various places and launched a  preliminary investigation.    As the fundamentalist Prosperity Party emerged as the victor  of Sunday's [27 March] local elections, huge amounts of stamped  ballots were found in various places, casting a shadow on the  election results.    Sarvar told the Anatolian Agency that experts were to  examine  the authenticity of the ballots and will also receive the  testimonies of officials who were on duty at the precincts  during the election.    "The necessary announcement will be made at the end of the  investigation," he said.</p>

Kopylov, Moscow] </F>   [Abstract] The search for new sources of electric power  prompted an attempt to consider the power of the ocean--the  principal store of energy on the planet--from the viewpoint of  general electromechanics. The approach to developing commercial  power plants for generating large quantities of electric power  necessitated an examination (qualitative, at first) of the ocean  power from the viewpoint of electromechanical energy conversion.  To this end, the planet Earth is considered as an electrical  machine whose magnetic field is created by a longitudinal  current on the boundary of the solid core and liquid magma as  well as radiation belts in space. The design of a unipolar  electric motor is cited, and the planet Earth-electric machine  is simulated by a machine which combines a magnetohydrodynamic  (MGD) generator with an MHD motor in a single electromechanical  system. It is assumed that the Earth rests on space just like  electric machines working in parallel with a network of infinite  power in engineering electromechanics. The sine-shaped curve of  transverse current on the planar Earth projection is plotted,  and it is noted that the sinusoidal curve coincides with the  great oceanic currents, i.e., the Gulfstream and the Great  Pacific Current. The effect of retardation of the Earth's  spinning speed is taken into account. The high probability of a  global change in the geomagnetic field and its consequences call  for setting up state programs aimed at addressing the resulting  global issues. The conclusion is drawn that electromechanical  energy conversion has a certain role to play in our planet's  evolution and that electromechanical energy's fraction of the  total energy balance of the planet is on the same order of  magnitude as thermal energy.

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (10): Food supplies - the biggest threat to political stability / Farmers face formidable obstacles and agricultural machinery is prohibitively expensive 'THERE'S going to be a war here,' declared Mr Sergei Boyakov, a fighter on the front line of Russia's battle to switch agriculture from Communism to capitalism. One of Russia's fledgling fyermers (private farmers), Mr Boyakov, 41, is the proud owner of 228 hectares of land in Russia's rich southern Penza region. He has already made more than a million roubles raising cattle for meat and dairy production. But for months, his biggest headache has been trying to persuade local state farmers to keep their cows off his pasture. 'I cleared this land and planted grass on it, and now they bring their cows to graze on it. I won't have it,' he fumes. Despairing of a negotiated settlement, he is going to hire police to guard his fields. But he fears the quarrel will end in bloodshed. Mr Boyakov's battle with members of the 'Shining Path' state farm goes to the heart of the difficulties of reforming Russian agriculture, six decades after Stalin herded peasants into collective and state farms. After millions of peasants died in resisting collectivisation, their descendents are now too used to being paid by the month, with fixed holidays, salaries and social benefits, to go it alone. Or at least they are waiting to see what happens to those who do. This returns Russia roughly to where it was at the beginning of this century, when Pyotr Stolypin, the reformist tsarist premier, started land reforms to break up the prevailing communal system and develop a class of private farmers. Before they had time to make real headway, the reforms were interrupted by World War One, and then buried by the Bolsheviks. As a result, a country which before 1917 was a leading exporter of grain, is today one of the world's biggest importers. Today, the collapse of food supplies, which helped trigger the 1917 revolution, is again the biggest threat to the country's political stability  -raising fears of a golodny bunt (hunger revolt) this winter. It is with this fear in mind that western governments, to the delight of their own farmers, are likely to continue subsidising grain exports to Russia for some time to come. President Boris Yeltsin has ordered the accelerated distribution of land to private peasants, and the 're-organisation' of the kolhozy (collective farms) and sovhozy (state farms) which account for the bulk of agricultural production. This includes cutting off subsidies to loss-making state farms. But it will still take at least a few years before Russia is able to begin meeting its own needs. Practice shows that the state is still unable to support private farmers on any significant scale, even though their number doubled to 100,000 between January and April of this year. Meanwhile, the re-organisation of the state sector on market principles  - which would have the benefit of maintaining the economies of scale of large scale farming - is so far too superficial to make any difference to its effectiveness. In Mr Boyakov's Pachelma district for instance, local authorities said they were planning to introduce the unpromising concept of 'private collective property.' On one farm which had been reorganised in this way, peasants said the main benefit was that lazy people could be expelled - but they had a very hazy idea of what it meant to hold shares in their farm. On another state farm, the director helplessly complained that unless he received more money from the state and the government maintained subsidies on energy supplies, he would sink. In one small sign, however, that new financial pressures may be having some positive impact on state farmers, he also let slip that he planned to raise some cash to pay salaries by selling some produce to a local fair the following day. But even if some progress is made at farm-level, time and investment are also needed to rectify the structural problems which account for the loss of a third of whatever is produced. These include an inefficient state-dominated transport system, a monopolistic trade system, and a dire shortage of storage and processing facilities. Agricultural machinery is also prohibitively expensive because of a lack of competition among the state enterprises which produce it. In Pachelma district, both state and private farmers complained they had no facilities to pasteurise and refrigerate fresh milk, giving them no alternative but to turn most of it into butter. It is not difficult to see why milk is still so hard to come by in Russian cities. Mr Boyakov's main complaint is the absence of a developed wholesale market which often forces peasants to use shady intermediaries to find buyers. 'They rake off huge percentages and call it marketing,' he jokes bitterly. Another brake on reform is the fact private property in the strict sense of the word is not yet allowed because of the Russian parliament's refusal to endorse the sale and purchase of land. Land given to peasants by local authorities can be resold only after ten years. Given deep psychological resistance to change, it is hardly surprising that two signs put up by Mr Boyakov proclaiming 'Private Property' have been torn down over the past year. The first, made of wood, was chopped down. The second, made of steel, was ripped out of the ground. The principle is indeed difficult to comprehend for peasants used to being looked after by a state on land which was supposed to belong to everybody and yet belonged to nobody. Running deep in their psychology is a preference that all should be poor together, rather than allow the more enterprising to be better off. Wearing a neat jeans outfit and trainers, Mr Boyakov looks every bit the part of the 'kulak' (the historical word for rich peasant) as he takes on one of his 'enemies' - Volodya, a state peasant with a crudely stitched scar on his cheek and a tattered cloth jacket falling off his shoulders. Mr Boyakov reiterates an offer to lend his tractors and equipment for them to clear pasture land, while Volodya looks unconvinced and questions his right to the land in the first place. Another headache is theft of his equipment by neighbours. Mr Sergei Papshev, the former local Communist party chief turned head of the local administration, says he is doing his best to help private farmers. But he claims his efforts are hampered by 'the unpreparedness of a material basis' for private agriculture. Mr Vladimir Yeskin, director of Valovaisky state farm, explained why he himself would not dare strike it out on his own. 'Where would I get fuel and tractors from? 'Where is the guarantee people won't burn my grain or poison my cattle? 'Who will stop drunks coming to my farm and doing whatever they want? There is no protection from the law.' Despite all the obstacles, it is clear that farmers like Mr Boyakov, an engineer in a big city before he moved to the countryside, will survive. But as he himself admits, he is really the exception who confirms the rule. 'I succeeded because I knew how to manage, because I could express myself, because I could argue my case, because I knew how to ask for things, and whom to give money to and who not to give money,' admits Mr Boyakov. 'Only this has saved me. But it is much more difficult for peasants who have lived in the countryside all their lives because they don't even know the basics of doing business in this country.' Since he received land in December 1990, Pachelma district has registered 57 private farmers, who have got under plough 2718 hectares of arable land - a modest start in comparison to the 80,000 hectares held by the district's 14 state farms. Because it is in his interest to have allies, Mr Boyakov is now trying to help six brothers make a success of their private farm near the Valovaisky sovhoz. But the obstacles may prove insurmountable for the weaker farmers who do not even know where to turn for help. Three months ago, Ms Galina Knitchkova, a former nurse turned 'fyermer' in the Smolensk region west of Moscow, could look to the future with optimism. She had bought machinery, built a house, and been given both land and soft loans by the local authorities. Since then, her house has been burnt down and she has run out of money to buy seeds. Unless she is able to raise Rbs131,000 by the end of the month, she will miss the sowing season, and the chance to begin repaying her bank loans. If she fails, all the soft loans spent on her so far by the state will simply have been wasted, and a dream of a lifetime shattered beyond repair.</p>

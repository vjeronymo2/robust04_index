			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (4): Threat to the company car - The Cash Option AS recession has deepened, unemployment has climbed and the personal tax burden on company cars has risen further, the survival of the company car as an integral part of the business scene has become more than an academic question, writes John Griffiths. According to this year's annual Company Secretary's Review of company car policies, which monitors the fleet activities of nearly 600 UK companies, more than half of the companies surveyed are considering offering a financial alternative to the company car, although relatively few expect to act before the fine detail of the Inland Revenue's revised taxation of company cars can be properly digested. Significantly for vehicle makers in particular - because of the high business car content of their sales - the Review research showed that the 'cash-for-cars' option is being considered by 60 per cent of companies operating larger fleets, of 50 cars or more. The evidence of a strengthening 'cash-for-cars' trend is not quite so conclusive in another prominent company car policy survey, conducted by the Monks Partnership. Its research shows that 20 per cent of the 200 companies it surveyed had instituted a cash alternative, but that it appeared to be unpopular with employees. Only around one in 10 had taken it up. Nevertheless, Monks' finding that another 20 per cent of companies may change their policies this year and are also considering a cash option does indicate that a much closer evaluation of company cars is now on the corporate agenda. Mr Simon Rodwell, a director of Monks Partnership, is convinced that companies are holding back until the taxation uncertainties are resolved. 'If higher priced cars were to be more heavily taxed under any new rules, this might make a cash alternative more attractive which, in turn, could affect a company's attitude towards the design of its cash allowance scheme.' Companies which have already made the switch include a number in the financial sector, such as JP Morgan and Bankers Trust. Others have studied the issue closely but have opted to retain their cars and subject them to much tighter purchase and operating controls. There is even a very small minority which has simply withdrawn its cars and offered only partial or nil compensation. But these have tended to be companies fighting off receivership. During the 1980s boom years of jobs chasing scarce skills, such debate as there had been about 'cash-for-cars' tended to focus on whether it might benefit employees whose cars were primarily a 'perk' and part of their remuneration package. Now, with employers not only ravaged by recession but also having to pay, for the first time last year, National Insurance contributions on their employees' benefit for the private use of their cars, the issue is being examined from the viewpoint of potential cost savings to the company. Because company cars are embedded in the UK business culture, the cash-v-car assessment cannot be wholly financial. Employees place an obvious non-monetary value on them as tokens of status and esteem within a company; They also, surveys show, value the 'no-hassle' aspects of their company cars, such as not having to worry about maintenance bills. Factors such as these help explain the decision of National Westminster Bank, which operates a widely-varied fleet of 11,500 cars, to reject the cash alternative and simply to operate the fleet more cost-effectively. According to NatWest's Mr Allan Robertson, 'despite rises in taxation, most managers, if offered cash representing the true time cost of a car to a company would be worse off if they had to provide themselves with a car. Yet in most instances companies will not even offer what it costs them to provide a car.' NatWest's approved list of manufacturers has been cut from 29 to seven and its fleet controllers themselves specify the cars and level of equipment, based on whole-life cost. Replacement takes place only when market conditions are favourable. When a car is disposed of, it still usually goes to auction but NatWest sets the reserve. Employees who have failed to take care of a car can face disciplinary action. Diesels are being introduced without the option. In the first 18 months of the new regime, Mr Peter Parkinson, head of group vehicle purchasing, claims to have made savings of Pounds 1,750 a vehicle - or Pounds 20m in all and big savings continue to be made. Contract hire gets short shrift. 'Would you hand over your wallet or purse to a contractor who is trying to make a profit from you?' he asks. There are other potential pitfalls. For instance, one executive was an essential car user in frequent contact with his company's customers. He took a cash option for his middle management car and bought an elderly Ford Escort for which he claimed over 18,000 miles of company reimbursed mileage  -at 40p a mile. That is why Midland Bank, for example, insists that employees covering 18,000 or more business miles a year must have a company car, while offering lower mileage employees a cash option. Fleet managers are starting to learn to their cost that the closer they look at the cash-v-car issue, the more complications seem to arise. Another recent one, arising from soaring car thefts and so-called 'joyriding', is the rise into four figures of the typical premium for the GTis of young City executives. Factors such as these do so much to complicate the efforts of fleet management analysts to come up with a relatively simple formula by which the cash versus car benefit can be calculated. However, Mr Clive Tulloch, a partner of Coopers and Lybrand, argues: 'If the cash is an alternative which the employee can choose instead of a car, it need not be set at a generous level, especially if the purpose is to provide an alternative to the car for those for whom the car is an expensive option. If cash is an option which employees are free to ignore if they wish it could simple be set at a figure which does not increase the employer's cost.' If a mandatory cash scheme were introduced for all employees it would theoretically require - because of mileage and other factors - that different amounts should be paid to those who had been provided with the same level of company car. In practice, however, employers would be likely to offer the same cash sum to all employees who had operated similar cars. And since that would create winners and losers, the overall cost would rise as a result of the company's understandable desire to minimise - for morale and associated reasons - the number of 'losers'.</p>

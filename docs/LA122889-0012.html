			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: RAMONA  </P> <P> A Ramona child molester was granted a new attorney Wednesday. Michael Murphy  will now represent Ezra Adams during the sentencing phase of his trial.  </P> <P> Adams was found guilty of 86 counts of child molestation in November by  Superior Court Judge Louis Boyle. Adams waived his right to a jury trial,  leaving Boyle to decide his guilt or innocence.  </P> <P> Murphy asked Superior Court Judge David M. Gill for two months to review  transcripts of Adams' trial to prepare for sentencing and a possible motion  requesting a new trial.  </P> <P> On Dec. 20 at Adam's request, Boyle relieved attorney Roy Gunner from the case.  </P> <P> Adams faces 330 years in state prison for his convictions of molesting an  11-year-old San Carlos girl and six girls from Ramona.  </P> <P> Boyle found Adams guilty of 86 lewd and lascivious acts, but found him innocent  of eight other counts and dismissed two other charges.  </P> <P> Adams will be sentenced Feb. 28.  </P></p>

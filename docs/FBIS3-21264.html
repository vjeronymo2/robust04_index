Summary of Evaluation Research on the Durability of  Materials Used in Nuclear Power Plants </H3> <H5>  (1) Perspectives of Durability Evaluation Research </H5>   It is essential to ensure the durability of equipment and  materials to provide for system safety and economy, and also to  improve the performance of operational plants such as light  water reactors and large reprocessing facilities. In the  development of new plants, such as high-temperature gas-cooled  reactors and nuclear fusion reactors, the social acceptance and  expandability of such plants are often governed by the  durability of structural materials, although achievement of  performance goals also is necessary.    As Figure III-1 illustrates, to achieve a breakthrough in  materials technology, both durability evaluation and the  development of new materials are required. Therefore, in  evaluating the durability of metal structural materials, the  expansion and generalization of research results have been  implemented through the comprehensive development of a series of  research themes, such as deterioration analysis of materials  used in the target environment, selection and development of  quantitative and prompt evaluation test methods to predict  operational life time, and the collection of data on corrosion  and environmental cracks, together with the development of  databases on various environmental, material, and dynamic  parameters. In addition, improving material performance, and the  development of new materials based on the results of durability  controlling factor analysis are underway.       Figure III-2 illustrates the relationships between  differences in the durability control factors of nuclear plant  materials and the use environment, that is, temperature and  mechanical factors. Since slight modifications of reactor  engineering design in the development of new types of plants  affects the conditions of the operational environment, the  development of evaluation and material production methods having  a high degree of adaptability are being emphasized as key  technologies. Because suitable nuclear properties related to  environment safety in addition to durability will be required of  structural materials for future plants, as illustrated in Figure  III-3, the development of elements and nuclides as sources of  radioactive cladding, improved adhesion in surface tissue and  corrosion, and the development of criticality safety materials  for reprocessing equipment are in progress.        <H5>  (2) Development of Durability Evaluation Methods </H5>   Corrosion in the nuclear environment -- such as that  produced  by high-temperature water, high-temperature helium, and  reprocessed nitric acid -- can vary drastically due to small  amounts of impurities and coexistent elements. For this reason,  efforts are underway to develop and improve durability  evaluation and analysis methods -- including the generating  surface and gap that are specific to practical structures, as  well as environmental changes at the time of accidents -- using  advanced equipment analysis and environmental management  technology. Mass transport analysis in the same system as  corrosion emission elements, which has an important effect on  system maintenance and control, has been conducted with regard  to the new environment of high-temperature helium and  reprocessed nitric acid. Corrosion monitoring technology can be  used to improve various conventional corrosion sensors used for  electrochemical measurement, thereby serving as an on-site  technology that can be adapted to the radioactive environment.  Another goal is to develop methods appropriate for state  resolution, such as optical and acoustic measurements. As  quantitative evaluation methods to assess the extent of  corrosion or changes in the quality of materials, work on  activation analysis and fission track analysis using nuclear  reactor facilities is in progress, in addition to various  surface analysis and micro analysis technologies.  <H5>  (3) Analysis of Corrosion Damage Due to Age Deterioration </H5>   Many nuclear materials are used in radioactive and corrosive  environments for dozens of years. In such cases there are  examples of damage due to age deterioration that would not  appear in general industrial use. The JAERI facilities have  played an important role in forecast studies for age  deterioration phenomena. These include a hair-crack analysis of  JPDR that led to research on stress corrosion cracks (SCC) in  stainless steel in high-temperature pure water containing  dissolved oxygen. In recent years, SCC and pitting corrosion at  temperatures under 60C were discovered on the stainless  steel pipes of the primary cooling system of a nuclear reactor  that was over 20 years old. Thus we learned that adequate water  quality control and materials measures equivalent to those used  for a high-temperature primary cooling system were necessary. At  the time of long-term loop operation during a power stoppage for  "Mutsu," a nuclear vessel, pitting corrosion on coated pipes was  analyzed. The soundness of the fuel element was ensured by a  thorough inspection, and by replacing defective components,  after which the rest of the experimental sail was completed.  Precious data concerning the generation and growth of partial  damage produced by the effect of concentrations of very small  amounts of chlorine in gaps, as well as by copper dissolved from  the same circuit, were also obtained. An example of pitting  corrosion that was observed after a long period of service in  low-temperature pure water is illustrated in Figure III-4.  Although the actual pitting corrosion depth obtained by  destructive inspection is deeper than the results obtained from  measurements using such ordinary methods as a mechanical tracer  or the optical visual field depth method, there is a certain  proportional relationship that indicates stable growth between  aperture diameters. If they are of the same type, the depth of  pitting corrosion in those for which destructive inspection  cannot be conducted can be estimated quite accurately. We have  experienced a number of problems with the materials that are  used in the current generation of power plants, such as solid  phase deposition by gas-air separation on the high-temperature  heating surface of the liquid waste enrichment can, gap  corrosion and SCC due to alkali concentrations, and the  accumulation of radioactive crud through the selective elution  of Co for the stellite hard metals in the high-temperature  sealing section. Therefore, basic research related to  operational control and countermeasures to protect materials  have been implemented.     <H3>  2. Examples of Forecast Method Development for Materials  Durability </H3>   The following is a summary of various studies on  high-temperature gas-cooled reactor heat-resistant alloys,  reprocessing plant materials, and water-cooled reactor core  materials conducted by JAERI. All of these studies involved  issues related to the evaluation of the durability of materials  used in nuclear plants, as described in the previous chapter.  <H3>  (1) Long-Term Durability Forecast for Heat-Resistant Alloys  for High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor </H3>   As described in Part II, hastelloy XR was developed at JAERI  as a high-temperature structural material for use in HTTR, and  various performance evaluation tests related to its soundness  and long-term durability have been conducted. This section will  present methods for search testing for age deterioration damage  modes, which control durability, for the purpose of developing  rapid evaluation testing methods for assessing long-term  durability, as well as rapid evaluation testing methods for  material change due to high-temperature gas and surface  responses.    [1] Search for Age Deterioration Damage Modes That Control  Durability    In determining the high-temperature structure design plan  for  the HTTR, assumed damage modes are extracted using the  characteristics related to materials durability and operational  conditions. Taking these into consideration, the structure is  designed so that there is a sufficient safety allowance to  prevent damage to the materials. However, among the damage modes  assumed in the design of the HTTR, it was found that the safety  allowance for creep rapture and creep fatigue rapture was the  smallest, and that creep property evaluation for extended use  was important.    As described in Part II (2), the creep strength of hastelloy  XR for relatively short periods of about 1,000 hours can be  radically improved by adjusting the boron content to 40-60 ppm.  This improvement is also valid, as illustrated in Figure III-5,  for creep properties for longer use periods, which is important  for long-term durability. The figure illustrates the  relationship between stress and rapture life time for hastelloy  XR with a low boron content of 10 ppm or less, and for hastelloy  XR-II at 50 ppm. The comparison is shown using dotted lines and  full lines, respectively. (Hastelloy XR-II conventionally is  used to distinguish it from hastelloy XR, which is defined as  having a boron content of 100 ppm or less.) Compared to  hastelloy XR, the creep properties of hastelloy XR-II show  greater improvement at the lower temperature range of  700-900C, and on the side of low stress and long hours. The  results indicate the possibility of evaluating long-term  soundness for creep rapture in structural materials in the real  equipment environment by setting the boron content at 30 ppm for  HTTR-specified materials, while using changes in the boron  content of the alloy by aging as an index.       [2] Preliminary Examination of Creep Life Time Evaluation  Based on Boron in Alloys    Since the boron content of the alloy was expected to diffuse  and deviate from the inside due to surface response, variation  by aging was measured using heating temperature, environment  (air and impure helium), and test piece shape as parameters.  Figure III-6 illustrates the results of measuring variations in  the boron content of the alloy over time after heating round  bars with three different diameters (1.6, 6, and 10mm) at  950C and 1,000C. A prominent reduction in the amount  of boron can be observed in the 1.6mm diameter round bar heated  in helium at 950C and in the 10mm diameter round bar heated  in the atmosphere at 1,000C. The former began to lose boron  within several hours, and almost all the boron was diffused from  the test piece after several hundred hours. By contrast, the  latter began to lose boron in the perimeter after about 3,000  hours, and continued to decrease to several ppm after about  5,000 hours. There was no observable reduction of boron up to  several thousand hours at 950C without load in any  environment.       These results verify that, as a method for evaluating the  long-term durability of HTTR high-temperature structural  materials, long hours of environmental effects can be  accelerated by adjusting the size of test pieces without  changing temperatures, in other words, by using test pieces with  a larger relative surface area.    [3] Examination of Accelerated Testing Method for Durability  Evaluation    Using the results of search testing to determine the boron  content in the alloy under different heating conditions,  combined with a method for analyzing the diffusion of boron in  the alloy, various methods for predicting the long-term  durability of high-temperature structural materials for HTTR  were examined. In order to obtain this index, test pieces that  were systematically varied in size were analyzed to determine  their average boron content after being heated in various  atmospheric conditions, and were evaluated using a model based  on diffusion theory.    a) Analysis of Diffusion Behavior of Boron in the Alloy    For a preliminary examination of the diffusion behavior of  boron in the alloy, the hastelloy XR base with 1 ppm boron was  welded using hastelloy XR-II with 40 ppm boron as a filler  material. The welded joint was heated at 950C for 3,000  hours, and then cut and sanded. The density distribution of the  boron on the surface of the welded cross-section was analyzed  with an ion microanalyzer. The results are illustrated in Figure  III-7. Boron is distributed symmetrically on the welded line as  a result of being heated at 950C for 3,000 hours in the  atmosphere. This is true for all cases including the axis from  the welded metal to the back of the metal plate (circle), the  axis of jointing at one-quarter T of the plate (triangle), and  the axis of jointing at one-half T of the plate (square). Figure  III-7 also includes the results of an analysis of the behavior  of boron as an unsteady element in a one-dimensional  interdiffusion model. The profile of the test values of boron  distribution coincides well with a diffusion model when the  boron diffusion factor is assumed to be D = 1 x  10[.sup]-9[/]cm[.sup]2[/]/s. Analytical treatment of this  kind is considered possible.       (b) Examination of Accelerated Evaluation Method Using Size  Effect    Boron diffusion behavior in such practical structural  materials as round bars and plates also was analyzed -- assuming  unlimited length with limited diameter and thickness -- using  the diffusion factor D for boron that was obtained as described  in the previous section. Figure III-8 illustrates the  relationship between the heating time required to reduce the  boron content in solid round bar test pieces and heat  transmission pipes, made of hastelloy XR-II with 50 ppm boron,  heated to 950C to 5 ppm, and the diameter of round bars and  thickness of heat transmission pipes. Changes in the boron  content as a result of heating solid round bar test pieces 10mm  in diameter over 20,000 hours can be observed after several  thousand hours by using solid round bar test pieces 4mm in  diameter instead. Such a tendency is even greater with heat  transmission pipes. It should be possible to predict material  changes in heat transmission pipes over a long period of time  from the results of tests using round bar test pieces.       Based on the results of the examination introduced here,  basic research concerning various accelerated testing methods is  in progress to ensure the long-term durability of  high-temperature structural materials for the HTTR.  Comprehensive development of a life time evaluation system using  such analytical methods is also underway.  <H5>  (2) Corrosion-Resistant Alloys for Reprocessing Plants </H5>   Current large-scale commercial facilities for reprocessing  spent light water reactor fuel use the purex process, which  involves the use of organic solvents dissolved in nitric acid.  It is planned to improve this method for use as a group  separation technology in future. On the historical side of  material technology, however, the durability of stainless steel  equipment has become an important issue, since the object of  reprocessing switched from low burn-up metal fuel to high  burn-up oxide fuel, as illustrated in Figure III-1. For this  reason, work on durability evaluation methods, material-related  technologies, the development of corrosion damage data, and  analytical codes as the basis for a life time forecast database  is in progress. This involves implementing analytical research  on the chemical properties of nitric acid solutions; research on  durability control factors for various conventional materials --  such as stainless steel, zirconium, and titanium alloys -- in  the nitric acid environment; and the development of evaluation  testing and analysis methods. In addition, work is underway on  the development of stainless steel, high-chrome compound  converted alloys, and refractory metal alloys suitable for use  in the corrosive environment of nitric acid for three levels of  oxidation.    [1] Development of Testing Methods and Evaluation of  Environmental Corrosion    Based on chemical analyses of nitric acid solutions, the  corrosion of stainless steel in reprocessed nitric acid is  controlled largely by the chemical condition and the  electrothermal ebullition condition of various elements  dissolved from spent fuel, such as FP and TRU. Therefore, to  characterize the environment, equipment analysis and  electrochemical measurement methods -- such as state analysis  and reaction generated gas (NO[.sup]x[/]) analysis of micro  ionic species based on ion chromatography and high-frequency  plasma emission analysis -- were established. Subsequently, "the  on-site analysis method" using the laser Raman method was  developed. At the same time, we also developed a number of  evaluation testing methods, such as various corrosion testing  methods focusing on the corrosion acceleration factors specific  to the nitric acid environment of fluid condensed nitric acid  and electrothermal ebullition, slow-speed skew-speed tensile  testing (SSRT), corrosion fatigue testing, and fletching.    As illustrated in Figure III-9, SUS 300 stainless steel,  which is an ultra-low carbon steel, with sufficient  sensitization showed a high level of corrosion resistance to  oxidative acid, which tends to become passive. However, it was  found that an accelerated corrosion peculiar to reprocessed  nitric acid took place due both to the dissolved chemical  properties of nitric acid itself, and to changes in the  condition of dissolved ions, as indicated in the results of the  chemical measurement shown in Table III-1. Because the pyrolytic  response of nitric acid increases at higher temperatures in the  ebullition condition, the effect of temperature on the corrosion  speed for the steel in question in the depressurized ebullition  condition presents two-step changes, as indicated in Figure  III-10. Also, oxidation generation from trivalent chromium to  sexivalent chromium occurs only in the theoretical pyrolytic  temperature range. Furthermore, with regard to heat  transmission, the corrosion potential rises to the transpassive  region, as shown in Figure III-9, due to the effects of A and B  reactions, and general corrosion with prioritized corrosion is  further promoted. The acceleration of corrosion on the  generating surface can be understood as a function of the amount  of evaporation and corrosion accelerating ion parameters. Such  findings were useful as guidelines in establishing operational  conditions for the equipment used for generation boiling of  evaporation cans, methods for material selection, and the  development of corrosion-resistant alloys with a high level of  safety allowance.             [2] Durability Evaluation Testing and Materials    a) Ultra-Low-Carbon Austenitic Stainless Steel    For this material, the effects of alloy elements and  impurities on corrosion in the high potential range from the  passive state to the transpassive state were studied. It was  found that the microsegregation that occurs during cooling to  reach a liquefying processing temperature can cause  intergranular corrosion with the presence of a few ppm of  dissolved elements that weaken the cohesion of metal elements  such as P and B in the transpassive state. Furthermore, based on  a close examination of cut-out stainless steel parts from a  demonstration test reactor at the current plant, gradual and  accelerated growth of corrosion damage (general corrosion  intergranular corrosion tunnel corrosion corrosion  crack) of the stainless steel used in high-oxidation nitric acid  solutions was studied quantitatively. The results of this  evaluation were reflected in the development of life time  evaluation methods and new materials.    With regard to materials, a compound method for metal  structure control by adjusting by alloy components combined with  changes in the intermediate production process was examined as  illustrated in Figure III-11. Using a compound means of  purification and a microgranulation to improve grain boundary  purity based on the electronic beam solution method, as well as  the skew aging mid- and high-temperature recrystallization  method, intergranular corrosion, and progressive increase of  corrosion speed by aging, which is characteristic of the  transpassive region, did not occur. Tunnel corrosion was  prevented as well. Furthermore, by examining alloy elements in  detail to improve corrosion resistance from the passive to  transpassive regions, as illustrated in the lower diagram of  Figure III-9, a high-chrome compound addition RW alloy, which  has more corrosion resistance than stainless steel, was  developed by the compound addition of a suppresser element (Si)  for cathode reaction -- which is a reduction response to  high-oxidation ions and nitric acid -- and film generation  elements (Cr, W) to suppress anode response. As illustrated in  Figure III-12, the corrosion resistance of alloys especially  developed for use in high-oxidation nitric acid is far superior  to that of conventional steel, and it confirms the effective  role of Si and W compound additives.          b) Refractory Metals Such as Ti and Zr    It is necessary to isolate durability problems, and to  develop quantitative evaluation and analysis methods for  materials designed to serve as replacements for stainless steel,  which has transpassive characters, for use in reprocessing  equipment. Ti has a high degree of auto-ion dissolution in low  concentration nitric acid. Therefore, analysis of such phenomena  as corrosion work and pitting corrosion in fresh condensate  nitric acid under evaporation-condensation conditions,  separation by hydrolysis, and escape to the gas phase by  compound formation with thermodynamic instability illustrated in  Table III-1, which displays new mass transport phenomena, has  been promoted.    Meanwhile, work also has been done on Zr, which has good  corrosion durability in all ranges of nitric acid concentrations  in spite of its SCC. Its stress corrosion crack sensitivity was  evaluated by the slow-speed skew-speed tensile testing (SSTT)  method, and it was found that the TG (thorough granular) SCC of  false cleavage crack with sensitivity loss was created in  boiling nitric acid in several standards. The reduction of  rapture life time by SCC as a result of increased nitric acid  concentration, as illustrated in Figure III-13, is greater in  the test pieces with the densest plane of dense hexagonal  crystals being oriented in the direction of crack development.  It was also found that Zr crystals, particularly in softer  materials, tended to rotate at the tip of cracks as a result of  low-temperature creep, where stress was concentrated. This  promoted crack development by orienting the densest plane toward  the direction of the crack development, and accounted for more  than 50-60 percent of the fracture factor in false cleavage  cracks. As there has been insufficient use of the metal in  question with dense hexagonal crystals as a thick structure  material, analysis of durability controlling factors by fracture  mechanic methods, including low-temperature creep and fatigue  effects, and the development of evaluation methods is underway.       Because corrosion improvement of the metal in question  requires alloying measures that take into account the  crystallographic anisotropy specific to dense hexagonal  crystals, methods for improving corrosion resistance focusing on  the ion radial effect of alloy elements and corrosion crack  existence have been developed. To improve the corrosion  resistance of Ti, the addition of corrosion-resistant elements  such as Ta, which has a similar ion radius, has been found to be  effective. As for the corrosion crack resistance of Zr,  improving low-temperature creep by adding corrosion-resistant  elements with a different ion radius has proved to be effective.  <H5>  (3) Water-Cooled Reactor Material </H5>   From the standpoint of thermal neutron economy, a material  with small cross-section for thermal neutron absorption is  preferable for the fuel elements of power generation reactors.  Coated pipes for a new type of light-water reactor with a hard  neutron energy spectrum, and the primary wall of water-cooled  nuclear fusion reactors require high mechanical strength in the  mid-and low-temperature range, as well as a high level of  several radiation resistance. Austenitic stainless steel in the  SUS group is one of these candidates. It has been found that the  major factors governing the life time of this steel in heavily  irradiated high-temperature water are reduced ductility, and  radiation-induced stress corrosion crack (IASCC). Analyses of  material transformation caused by heavy irradiation in the mid-  and low-temperature range, as well as the development of  radiation-resistant steel have been conducted. For the former,  electrochemical measurements such as EPR after heavy  irradiation, quantitative evaluation methods for sensitivity  using various corrosion tests, and SSTT test technology for  high-temperature pure water have been developed.    [1] Analysis of Durability Reduction Mechanism by Mid- and  Low-Temperature Irradiation    The sensitivity of stainless steel at temperatures below  500C was thought to be equivalent to the model for  M[.sup]23[/]C[.sub]6[/] separation and Cr-depleted layer  formation along with the grain boundary shown in Figure III-9.  However, it has become known that it is promoted by the spinodal  decomposition-type microsegregation of atomic layers by the  interaction between transfer and dissolved elements as a result  of the increasing over-saturation of dissolved elements,  including such major elements as Cr, caused by the reduction of  stabilization of the austenite phase. In addition, among  interstitial atoms that are spun off under neutron irradiation,  Ni, P, and Si, which have a smaller ion radius than Fe, begin  selective diffusion. A phenomenon called radiation-induced  segregation (RIS), where the concentration and depletion of  specific elements occur, has been confirmed with STEM. It has  been found, however, that the P amount of grain boundary  segregation, and SCC fracture phase factor are not closely  related.    Figure III-14 illustrates the different effects of  temperature on the high-temperature sensitization of  M[.sup]23[/]C[.sub]6[/] separation, low-temperature  sensitization (both by evaluation of latent periods for  sensitization based on Straus's test) by distorted aging, and  the EPR test results for a heavily irradiated material. The  activation energy of the former two is equivalent to the body  diffusion of Cr, but the activation energy of the latter  indicates a low value equivalent to the diffusion of  interstitial atoms (Cr, etc.) of a radiation-induced Frenkel  defect. This suggests that segregation and depletion occur  easily on a supersaturated specific surface because of the  reduced stability of the austenite phase, even at low  temperatures, as long as it is being irradiated. Much of the  rapture surface of irradiated SUS 316 steel after the SSTT test  presents a mixed crack mode consisting mainly of TGSCC on the  low-temperature side. The IGSCC rapture factor as an IASCC index  as well as the temperature increases, but there is a lack of a  corresponding relationship with rapture life time. Concerning  the evaluation of IASCC sensitivity for heavily irradiated  materials, the corrosion potential and the transformation mode  are important factors, as illustrated in Figure III-9, and a  system to implement a detailed comprehensive examination has  been developed. This includes the development of ultramicro  analysis technology for metal structures, and for constituent  segregation, using evaluation test methods and FEM, which has a  high level of space resolution.       [2] Examination of Methods To Improve IASCC Resistance    It is hard to produce He brittleness on stainless steel with  heavy doses of radiation at mid- and low-temperature. Therefore,  we have improved the stability of the austenite phase by  adjusting the Fe/Ni ratio, and by reducing electronic hole  density. At the same time, we have examined methods designed to  reduce the supersaturation level of impurities to cause RIS at  the same time. Since the comprehensive properties of stainless  steel are optimized when its composition is about 35 percent Ni,  we have developed 35 Ni-18 Cr-25 Mo steel with a purified grain  boundary, and reinforced microgranulation. In doing so, we  introduced purification by the electronic beam production  method, as well as a distorted aging technique called SAR, and  thermal processing of recrystallization at middle and low  temperatures. Compared to the conventional steel, our newly  developed steel displayed a high level of void swelling  resistance, and a high level of heat flux resistance, without  reducing low-temperature sensitivity or ductility at middle and  low temperatures.  <H5>  3. Development of Materials Database </H5> <H5>  (1) Significance of Database for Nuclear Materials </H5>   As described in Part 1, nuclear development is facing a  number of problems that cannot be solved by the application of  conventional materials technology. Thus we anticipate the  development of new materials that will break through the limits  of existing materials, together with corresponding application  technologies. In the past, the research and development of  nuclear materials in Japan was primarily aimed at meeting  minimum requirements for individual projects. Therefore,  research programs and the establishment of databases relied on  the initiative of individual organizations, and were not  centralized. Because of the lack of systematic development in  such projects, they had only a limited impact on the industry.    The revision for FY 1987 of the "Long-Term Plan for Nuclear  Development and Use" by the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan  urged the prompt development of a comprehensive database as the  crucial item for basic research on nuclear materials. First,  individual research organizations were to develop a database for  their area of specialization, and then link them to share  intellectual properties, and to promote activities to facilitate  the effective use of such data.    In the next section, we will present an outline of the JAERI  Material Performance Database (JMPD), a comprehensive nuclear  materials database being developed by JAERI to aid in the  development of materials for nuclear reactors and facilities,  together with the characteristics needed for behavior  evaluation, structure design, and safety evaluation.  <H5>  (2) JAERI Material Performance Database </H5>   As illustrated in Figure III-15, the JMPD is based on a  general-purpose database management system (DBMS) for large  computers for storage and search. In addition to this core  section, it includes a data input and output section, and a  section for network development. The information to be included  in the database include data needed for materials design, such  as radiation-resistant materials, materials to limit induced  radioactivity, and chemically resistant materials; data needed  to ensure the safety and durability of the equipment and  structures introduced in the previous section; and data for  evaluating the production and performance of new materials, such  as ceramics and compound materials. There is a problem in that  it is difficult to determine an appropriate data structure,  since new and important data are continuously being generated,  and the significance of data items can change radically in some  cases. Therefore, a relational database has been selected for  the DBMS in view of the need for a flexible data structure, and  for ease of data renewal. Information that cannot be described  in the current data structure, but that is likely to become  important in future can be included in the section for remarks.  Considering the characteristics of the base data for nuclear  materials, a data structure capable of uniformly describing data  items related to radiation, and the nuclear-specific chemical  environment has been selected.       As for data output, because flexibility of the retrieval  system is the most significant factor, a program with the  following features has been developed internally: [1] it can be  operated freely without a special knowledge of computers, [2]  retrieval can be made without referring to the design document  for data structure, and [3] the relative importance of data  items can be alternated easily to follow the results of  development of research. Figure III-16 provides a comparison of  retrieval processes based on (1) ordinary SQL commands, and (2)  the internally developed program, to indicate the performance of  the newly developed retrieval program. It confirms that the  method developed in the current program makes it easier for  ordinary materials researchers to conduct a data search. User  friendliness has been improved by the development of a unit  conversion function, a data listing function, a retrieved data  storage function, an interconnection (with different computers)  function, and an on-line help function.       Data for about 7,000 test pieces drawn primarily from  materials research at JAERI have already been stored in the  JMPD, and have been used for analysis and evaluation.  Furthermore, concerning the networking of materials data,  although it is not introduced here, development of a prototype  system for a distributed data network for materials called the  "data freeway" is in progress. Eventually, it will link the  Tokai Research Establishment of JAERI, the Tsukuba Branch of the  National Research Institute for Metals, and the Oarai  Engineering Center of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel  Development Corporation.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Carbon tax may become binding The European Commission still appears to be backing a mandatory EC-wide 'carbon tax' to reduce energy pollution, but leaning towards making it conditional on main industrial partners pledging similar action at the June 'earth summit' in Rio, David Buchan reports from Brussels. The EC executive yesterday debated the controversial tax - strongly opposed by industry but championed by environmentalists - but postponed a decision because too many of its 17 members were absent. Most of those present were said to favour a binding tax on fossil fuels, which like all EC fiscal measures must get unanimous approval of the 12 governments, on condition that countries such as the US and Japan match it. The EC accounts for 13 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, the US 23 per cent and Japan 5 per cent. Brussels is also weighing proposals to encourage energy saving and efficiency and to promote renewable sources of energy.</p>

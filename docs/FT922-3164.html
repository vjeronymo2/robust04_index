			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Flower power draws delegates There seems to be more under way in Rio than environmental discussions. Demand for the single roses being sold by Mr Chen Wen Yii of China is running at 1,200 a day. Mr Chen's service, at a few thousand cruizeros (about Pounds 1), enables summit romantics to send a rose to someone inside the conference centre. A label is attached on which the admirer's name and number is written, presumably with the hope of arranging a date. Delegates are obviously finding the need for some light relief from such matters as discussion on atmosphere and International Development Assistance. The late nights in the frantic race to resolve the planet's problems are taking their toll. Wednesday's proceedings broke up at 5am, and the previous night went on to 4am. Some delegates are no longer bothering to return to their hotels. Red eyes and unshaven chins are the order of the day. Help is at hand for delegates who cannot take the pace, in the form of an environmentally sound Amazonian drug sold on the mezzanine floor of the conference centre. Guarana, sold in powder or capsule form, is made from a 'sustainably cultivated' Amazonian berry, and is guaranteed to revitalise flagging delegates over the next 72 hours of meetings. Described by one delegate as 'like injecting pure caffeine', one pill is the equivalent of eight cups of strong coffee. Many Brazilians swear by it and Rio residents samba their way through the week-long Carnival with its aid. Guarana's lack of side effects has apparently also made it a hit in London nightclubs. Its green credentials make it most suitable for surviving the final days of the Earth Summit. A world record for the hotel business may have been set by the Copacabana Palace, a magnificent belle epoque pile on the Rio seafront. Last night it provided shelter for no fewer than 16 heads of state or government, and it announced the fact by flying their flags along the first-floor balcony. Its guests included the leaders of China, Jordan, Czechoslovakia, Chile and Belarus, as well as Britain's John Major, who slipped in at 1am. The hotel's grand entrance is constantly awash with limousines and police cars with flashing lights, though the atmosphere inside is surprisingly relaxed.</p>

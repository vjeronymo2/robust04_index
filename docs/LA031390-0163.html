			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ROSE EAGER TO JOIN BASEBALL HALL OF FAME  </P> <P> Pete Rose, former manager of the Cincinnati Reds, said today he is in no hurry  to apply for reinstatement but is eager to get into baseball's Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> "I'm not worried about getting back in baseball in a non-playing role," Rose  said.  </P> <P> "I'm anticipating the Hall of Fame. You don't need to be reinstated to go to  the Hall of Fame."  </P> <P> Rose, who last played in 1986, will be eligible for election by the baseball  writers after the 1991 season.  </P> <P> Rose was banned from baseball for life Aug. 24 because of illegal gambling  activity.  </P> <P> Attending a charity luncheon of Crossroads Rehabilitation Center here, Rose  commented on the contract dispute that threatens the start of the season: "I  don't think baseball needs any changes right now because the owners and players  are making top dollar and the fans are happy."  </P> <P> Rose said the loss of the spring training games should not have too much of an  effect on the season.  </P></p>

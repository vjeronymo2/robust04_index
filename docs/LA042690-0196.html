			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STERN DEFENDS HIS DECISION TO FINE THE LAKERS $25,000  </P> <P> NBA Commissioner David Stern used a baseball analogy Wednesday to defend his  $25,000 fine of the Lakers for failing to use two regulars in their final  regular-season game Sunday at Portland.  </P> <P> "We have to call balls and strikes," Stern said. "The Lakers' action was  clearly wide of the plate."  </P> <P> Stern said fans buying tickets deserve the best product and that the Lakers did  not supply that.  </P> <P> With Magic Johnson and James Worthy on the bench, Portland defeated the Lakers,  130-88. The game did not affect the final standings or playoff situation of  either team.  </P> <P> Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent endorsed Stern's action. "We believe strongly  that teams must make significant effort. . . . I think David did the right  thing," he said.  </P></p>

Mr. Wichit said the policy to allow Vietnamese firms and  Thai-Vietnamese joint-venture firms to be listed on the Stock  Exchange of Thailand [SET] is part of assistance from Thailand  for Vietnam to develop its own stock exchange, set to be  established next year.    The Vietnamese companies seeking listing on the Thai bourse  must meet SET and Securities and Exchange Commission  requirements, while the investment size of each company must be  substantial.    He said the policy to open the Thai stock exchange for  listing of foreign firms is similar to that in Singapore and  Malaysia.    "It is not only our intention to help Vietnam develop its  own  stock market, but it is also our plan to make our bourse a  leader in the region," Mr. Wichit said.    The first request for Thailand to help Vietnam develop its  stock market was made by the Vietnamese Secretary-General of the  Communist Party during his official visit to Thailand last year,  the central bank governor said.    After that, Vietnamese authorities had sent officials to  Thailand to hold talks with Thai officials and study the  development of the Thai exchange.    Mr. Wichit said it is likely that joint-venture firms  between  Thai and Vietnamese investors would be approved for listing  first as their investment sizes would be relatively larger than  those fully owned by Vietnamese. As well, their operation  systems, particularly their accounting, are in line with SET  requirements.    At the same time, Mr. Wichit said the Bank of Thailand has  permitted Krung Thai Bank and the Export-Import Bank to extend  loans through the central bank of Vietnam to support the  development of the Vietnamese stock market.    The loans will be channeled through the Bangkok  International  Banking Facilities scheme. The final round of terms and  conditions for the loans is scheduled for March 22.    Meanwhile, Thai ministers in an official delegation visiting  Vietnam say talks with their Vietnamese counterparts on trade,  finance and agriculture have produced good prospects for future  bilateral cooperation as both sides managed to achieve some  promising results.    Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsup told more than 50  prominent Thai businessmen that he had discussed with Vietnam's  Agriculture Minister possible cooperation and coordination to  prevent their becoming competitors in the world rice market,  which could affect their rice prices and export revenues.    Mr. Chaiyot said the Vietnamese minister had agreed to visit  Bangkok next month for further talks with the Thai private  sector on possible Thai-Vietnamese cooperation in rice  production and marketing.    Deputy Finance Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri, meanwhile,  said he expected decisions to be made on two joint development  projects when he leads a delegation to a meeting of finance  ministers from six Mekong River Basin countries -- Burma, China,  Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand -- in Hanoi from March 1922.    The projects are the construction of two transnational  roads,  one from Prachin Buri to Ho Chi Minh City and the other from  Mukdahan to Danang via Savannakhet in Laos and Hue In Vietnam.    Mr. Trairong said the two are among 26 projects involving  road construction and development of air and water  transportation links to be sponsored by the Asian Development  Bank.    A joint development project can materialize if at least  three  countries agree to work together, he said.    On long-running fishery disputes, Foreign Minister Prasong  Sunsiri said Thailand and Vietnam have agreed to set up a joint  committee to restructure joint fishery systems and manage  benefits from marine catches.    The ministers and the businessmen are accompanying Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai on a four-day official visit to Hanoi  from March 16-19.</p>

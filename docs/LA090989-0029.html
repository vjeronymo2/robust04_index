			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FIREMAN LOSES BID TO REGAIN JOB  </P> <P> A San Diego fire captain, who was dismissed because of charges that his home  was a methamphetamine laboratory and that he drove a city vehicle under the  influence of alcohol and drugs, lost his attempt Friday to win his job back.  </P> <P> However, in a second decision Friday involving firefighters and illegal drugs,  the San Diego Civil Service Commission reversed a suspension handed another  firefighter in connection with his 1986 arrest on drug charges.  </P> <P> Firefighter Joseph Rivas, 32, of San Diego, whose appeal was successful, had  maintained that he had been unfairly lumped in with others caught up in a  four-month police probe last year of drug use in the Fire Department. That  probe originally was sparked by a tip police received about the captain who  lost his appeal, Ronald R. Cervantes, 33, of San Diego.  </P> <P> Cervantes' termination was "reasonable, fully justified and warranted," the  commission said Friday.  </P> <P> Drugs found by police officers in an undercover raid June 12, 1988 at  Cervantes' home belonged to him, the commission found. Police told reporters  they found "some quantity" of drugs at the house and indications of a meth lab.  </P> <P> The commission also found that Cervantes, an 11-year department veteran who  last served in a community education post, drove his city-supplied car June 5,  1988 after drinking alcohol and while under the influence of methamphetamine.  </P> <P> Cervantes denied all accusations against him at a department fact-finding  hearing last Sept. 27. However, he was discharged Nov. 7.  </P> <P> The commission's hearings on Cervantes' appeal lasted four days this July.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conduct Called Inexcusable  </P> <P> Though Cervantes had an excellent service record, his conduct and "continued  denial" of the charges was "inexcusable, intolerable and had the potential to  jeopardize the safety" of the public and other firefighters, the commission  said.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I don't expect Mr. Cervantes will be pleased with the decision,"  said Joel Klevens, Cervantes' attorney. "I wouldn't be if I were in his shoes."  </P> <P> Cervantes could not be reached Friday for comment.  </P> <P> The commission said there was not enough evidence to support an additional  charge that Cervantes sold a dollar bill laced with methamphetamine to an  undercover police informer.  </P> <P> Cervantes was one of four firefighters indicted on federal drug charges last  October, capping an investigation by the Police Department in which  firefighters allegedly furnished illegal drugs to undercover police officers.  </P> <P> Those federal criminal charges against Cervantes were deferred March 3 for a  year, the commission said. If he has no criminal violations during that time,  the charges will be dismissed, it said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attorney Criticizes Commission  </P> <P> The commission's decision in the Rivas case followed what his lawyer, Thomas  Waddell, called "the lamest attempt to prosecute a guy I've ever seen."  </P> <P> Fire Department officials contended at a hearing June 29 that Rivas was  arrested in February, 1986 while snorting cocaine in a restroom at the Sports  Arena. He was off duty and at a rock concert.  </P> <P> Waddell pointed out at the hearing that the arrest was old, that the case had  never been prosecuted and that senior officers in the Fire Department suspended  Rivas last November only after they later learned he allegedly asked the police  officer to let him go because he was a firefighter.  </P> <P> After Rivas was suspended for 10 shifts without pay -- firefighters work  24-hour shifts -- he appealed to the commission.  </P> <P> The commission agreed with findings by hearing officer Stanley E. Willis II  that disciplinary action against Rivas would have been warranted only in 1986,  not now. To try to suspend him now was "not reasonable nor appropriate," Willis  said.  </P> <P> In addition to tossing out his suspension, the commission agreed with Willis'  conclusion that Rivas deserves back pay. However, it ordered Rivas to submit to  random drug tests through December, 1990.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Case Still Pending  </P> <P> The Cervantes and Rivas cases were two of four recently appealed to the  commission involving firefighters protesting department action. Still pending  is the discipline case involving George V. Jessup, a fire captain.  </P> <P> In July, the commission reinstated seven-year firefighter Vincent Stevenson,  who had appealed his termination, finding that the Fire Department's system for  dealing with employees who abuse drugs was "inequitable."  </P> <P> Stevenson admitted smoking cocaine while off duty last year, but his attorney,  Klevens, argued that other recent cases of firefighters abusing drugs for long  periods did not result in dismissals.  </P></p>

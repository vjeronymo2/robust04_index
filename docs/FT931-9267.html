			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Investors subscribe HKDollars 240bn for issue DENWAY Investment, which indirectly controls a 46 per cent interest in Peugeot's car manufacturing business in Guangzhou, yesterday set a record for oversubscription on the Hong Kong stock market when investors put up HKDollars 240bn (Pounds 20bn) for HKDollars 402m of stock. The strength of investor interest in Hong Kong for Chinese new issues has been the dominant theme of the local stock market for the past year. The most popular new issue of 1992 was China Travel Service - 411 times oversubscribed with investors putting up HKDollars 150bn. Denway's offer, however, exceeded that by a large margin. It was oversubscribed 657 times and the amount of money stumped up was equal to about one third of Hong Kong gross domestic product and nearly five times the amount of Hong Kong dollars in circulation. Last week the fund-raising associated with the issue caused a severe strain on the colony's money markets and rekindled official interest in reviewing the method by which new issues are sold to the public. Both the Exchange Fund, the colony's de facto monetary authority, and the Securities and Futures Commission have begun an investigation into alternative means of floating shares in new companies. Some merchant bankers believe that Hong Kong should move to a tender system for new issues. The Exchange Fund is also expected to examine issues of risk associated with possible corporate or stockbroker failure during the period of subscription, given the large sums of money involved. Denway offered 330m shares, equal to 25 per cent of the company, at HKDollars 1.22 each; grey market trading last week suggested that Denway would open at a price of about HKDollars 2.85 when official stock market trading begins on February 22. Mr Zhang Bohau, the company's chairman, said: 'We are extremely pleased with the enthusiastic response to the issues and we are very confident that investors will be rewarded for their support . . . we are poised for dramatic growth.' The company has 11 divisions. One is the leading shareholder in Guangzhou Peugeot, which last year made 20,550 cars and trucks, up from 12,628 in 1991.</p>

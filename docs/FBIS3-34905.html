In fact it preempted the negotiations by casting doubt  on their results, describing them as futile.    Syria yesterday expressed a kind of pessimism about the  possibility of achieving any progress. A Syrian official has  told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Israel continues to confuse the  issues as a result of its position rejecting peace and the  separation policy it is pursuing, which has resulted in the Oslo  and Cairo agreements with the PLO. Through this policy it is  seeking to infiltrate Arab ranks. The official pointed out that  Israel's request to raise the level of representation in the  negotiations on the Syrian track centers on its reliance on the  concessions offered to it by the Palestinian side, since this  request came immediately after the Cairo agreement. He said:  No matter how many agreements of that kind are concluded, they  cannot lead to a solution in the Middle East, especially as the  U.S. Administration and the world are committed to the  foundations of the peace process and a comprehensive and just  peace is an international demand just as it is an Arab and  regional demand.    The Syrian official described the new Washington round of  negotiations as sensitive and delicate. He said they are bound  to reveal the new Israeli orientation, even though nothing has  yet been issued by Israel to indicate that it is offering  something new through its delegation to Washington.    The official said that Syria continues to receive from  Washington assurances about the U.S. commitment to the  foundations of the peace process. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ANGELS GO OVERSEAS TO FIND NEW PITCHER -- FLOYD BANNISTER;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: THE CLUB SIGNS THE 35-YEAR-OLD LEFT-HANDER, WHO PITCHED IN JAPAN LAST  SEASON. HE GETS A ONE-YEAR CONTRACT WITH TWO OPTION YEARS.  </P> <P> Left-hander Floyd Bannister, a 13-year major league veteran who pitched in  Japan last season, agreed today to a $250,000 contract with the Angels.  </P> <P> Bannister, 35, was 3-2 with a 4.04 ERA for the Yakult Swallows of Japan's  Central League.  </P> <P> He pitched only 49 innings, walking 22 and striking out 31, and left the  Swallows midway through the season because his contract expired and he refused  to accept a month-to-month offer.  </P> <P> In addition to his base with the Angels, Bannister would get a $450,000 bonus  if he makes the Angels' opening day roster. Additional performance bonuses  could boost his 1991 income to $1.15 million. The Angels have options for 1992  at $1.3 million and 1993 at $1.6 million.  </P> <P> "There was a little bit of interest (from other teams), but Floyd had  ear-marked the California Angels as the place he wanted to be," said  Bannister's agent, Chris Arnold. "His in-laws are from the Anaheim area."  </P> <P> Bannister appeared in only 14 games for the Kansas City Royals in 1989 before  he injured his left shoulder. He was 4-1 with a 4.66 ERA in 14 games and made  $850,000. In 1988, his first year with the Royals, he was 12-13 with a 4.33  ERA.  </P> <P> After an outstanding career at Arizona State, Bannister was taken by Houston as  the first player selected in the June 1976 amateur draft.  </P> <P> He began his major league career with the Astros in 1977 and played for  Seattle, the Chicago White Sox and Kansas City. He has a career record of  133-142 and a 4.03 ERA.  </P> <P> Bannister had his best year in 1983 with the White Sox, when he was 16-10 with  a 3.35 ERA and 193 strikeouts. In 1982, he pitched for Seattle and led the  American League with 209 strikeouts.  </P></p>

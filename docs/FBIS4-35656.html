			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Algerian Army Occupies Police </F> Station Headed by Armed Group Leader"]    [Excerpt] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Reliable sources told  AL-HAYAH in Algiers yesterday that Army units had occupied a  police station in the capital after discovering that its head is  the amir [leader] of an armed group.    The sources pointed out that the Army discovered the armed  cell in a police station covering the Bab El Oued district in  the capital. The sources added that the head of the station in  Bab El Oued is the amir of an armed group that has carried out  several terrorist operations in the area. The Army, some of  whose units occupied the police station, has begun an  investigation into the clues of the armed groups' infiltration  of security units. Information not confirmed by security sources  indicates that the armed groups are indeed infiltrating security  services and "recruiting" some "security men."    Meanwhile, Republican Guard units supported by tanks  continue  to besiege the Ben Zerga-Bordj El Bahri area, 15 km northeast of  the capital. Eyewitnesses told AL-HAYAH that security forces,  which included elements from the gendarmerie and the Republican  Guard, have destroyed a center used by an "armed group" believed  to be linked with the assassination of former Prime Minister  Kasdi Merbah.    At another level, the "al-Nasr Battalion" belonging to the  "Islamic Salvation Army" has denied the contents of the  statement issued by the "Armed Islamic Group" about the  unification of the Islamic Salvation Front and the Islamic State  Movement under its banner.

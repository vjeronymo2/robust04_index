			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Uri Lubrani, coordinator of Lebanese affairs in the  Israeli Government and head of the Israeli delegation to the  negotiations with Lebanon, has stated that Syrian President  Hafiz al-Asad is using Hizballah as a card in the negotiations  with Israel. In giving Hizballah freedom of action in southern  Lebanon, al-Asad wants to have a card to play in the  negotiations. Lubrani said President al-Asad wants to make us  pay to end this threat.    Lubrani warned that Israel will continue to strike on all  occasions and with all means against Hizballah and other  terrorist organizations. He indicated that any suspension of  the talks with Syria and Lebanon would ultimately serve  Hizballah.</p>

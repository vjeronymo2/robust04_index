			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley doubles income MORGAN Stanley, one of New York's leading investment banks, yesterday underscored Wall Street's current profits boom when it reported more than doubled fourth-quarter net income. The securities house said net income totalled Dollars 132.3m, or primary earnings per share of Dollars 1.61, on revenues of Dollars 716.6m, compared with net income of Dollars 58.3m, or 71 cents a share, in the same period of last year on revenues of Dollars 488.2m. Wall Street firms have benefited over the past year from surging stock and bond markets, falling interest rates, strong demand for securities from investors and extremely heavy corporate issuance of new equity and fixed-income instruments. Morgan's fourth-quarter leap stemmed from two main areas. One was securities transactions on its own account, where its trading revenues rose from Dollars 176.7m to Dollars 246.3m. The group also realised Dollars 14.3m in revenues, compared with nil a year ago, from 'merchant banking' - direct investment in highly leveraged companies. The second big area was investment banking, where revenues rose from Dollars 146.3m to Dollars 252.3m, helped by strong equity and debt underwriting volume. Morgan Stanley invented the most fashionable new security on Wall Street last year - preferred equity redemption cumulative stock or percs. For the full year, Morgan Stanley reported net income of Dollars 475.1m, or earnings per share of Dollars 5.93, against Dollars 270.4m, or Dollars 3.37 in 1990. Revenues rose to Dollars 2.86bn from Dollars 2.16bn. The company said its strong global market position helped 1991 sales and trading activities, resulting in record fixed income, equity, foreign exchange and commodities revenues. On the investment banking side, equity and underwriting volumes had more than offset continued weakness in the takeover and real estate advisory markets.</p>

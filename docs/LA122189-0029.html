			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG TRIP ENDS WITH LONG GAME;  </P> <P> LAKERS: JOHNSON, WORTHY HELP TIRED LOS ANGELES OVERCOME HOT-SHOOTING  TIMBERWOLVES IN OVERTIME, 106-97.  </P> <P> His cheeks puffed out like Dizzy Gillespie's and his chest heaving, James  Worthy slouched near midcourt after the Lakers had tamed the Minnesota  Timberwolves in overtime Wednesday night, 106-97.  </P> <P> Along came Magic Johnson, who stood next to his Laker teammate and gave him a  brief smile and an even briefer hug. They were too tuckered out to exchange  high-fives, back slaps or any other more taxing celebration.  </P> <P> So ended an eight-game, 12-day trip, one that tested the Lakers' cardiovascular  endurance and mental alertness everywhere from the snowbound East to balmy  Florida to the frigid Midwest. The Lakers won five of eight games and headed  back to Los Angeles on a late-night charter still leading the Pacific Division  with a 19-6 record.  </P> <P> Maybe it was fitting that it ended with an exhalation of relief, rather than  exaltation, because this was anything but a pleasure trip for the Lakers. About  the best you can say is that they absorbed their opponents' best shots and, for  the most part, endured.  </P> <P> The Lakers, somewhat ambitiously, had set a goal of 6-2 on the trip. They fell  a victory short by blowing a 14-point fourth-quarter lead at Orlando, but they  seemed satisfied overall.  </P> <P> "A 5-3 trip is successful, as far as I'm concerned," Coach Pat Riley said.  </P> <P> "This makes my whole Christmas," Johnson said. "It was the best way to end the  trip. We never quit; that's the whole thing."  </P> <P> Enduring was the central theme again Wednesday night against the expansion  Timberwolves. The Lakers, clearly dragging and flu-ridden, suffered through a  first half in which the expansion Timberwolves shot 74.3% from the field and  took a 12-point lead behind former Laker Tony Campbell, who had 18 of his 26  points by halftime. The Lakers faced a 15-point third-quarter deficit.  </P> <P> But, they mustered the resolve to finish off the Timberwolves and finish the  trip with a winning record.  </P> <P> "The way I saw it," Worthy said, "we had taken their best shot. We just felt if  we kept plugging we'd be in there."  </P> <P> Overtime could not have been what the Lakers had in mind, but it took a  monumental second-half comeback even to get to that position.  </P> <P> After spending the fourth quarter whittling away at Minnesota's lead, the  Lakers caught the Timberwolves (5-19) with 7.2 seconds to play when, after Sam  Mitchell missed a free throw, Johnson went the length of the court for a  score-tying layup.  </P> <P> In overtime the Lakers summoned enough effort to outscore Minnesota by nine  points.  </P> <P> "It was a good way to end a long, long trip," Riley said. "I think our guys  showed the effects of the trip, but you have to give them credit. The way they  came back was indicative of their character and resolve. And, you want to thank  Earvin Johnson (for making) the shot he had to with no timeouts left."  </P> <P> Johnson, who had 26 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists; and Worthy, who had  24 points, were the steadying influences during a mostly lethargic effort. So,  it was not surprising that Johnson took control when the Lakers needed it most.  </P> <P> The Lakers had a chance to tie it nine seconds before Johnson's layup. A.C.  Green, who had 16 points and 15 rebounds while once again starting at center in  place of injured Mychal Thompson, missed one of two free throws that would have  tied it, 90-90.  </P> <P> Instead, the Lakers fouled Mitchell one second after Green's second free throw.  But Mitchell, a rookie forward who had 24 points, missed the second of two free  throws for a 91-89 lead.  </P> <P> Orlando Woolridge grabbed the rebound, and Johnson immediately moved toward the  ball. Near midcourt, Johnson paused to check the clock and avoid Campbell.  </P> <P> Johnson twisted between Mitchell and Campbell and banked in the layup to tie  it. Minnesota then tried to score quickly, but Green knocked away Sidney Lowe's  pass. With 3.7 seconds left, three Lakers converged on Campbell, who bobbled  the inbounds pass and dropped it out of bounds.  </P> <P> A full-length Laker inbounds pass with 1.4 seconds intended for Woolridge went  astray, but Johnson ran it down and flung it over his left shoulder toward the  basket. It hit the rim and fell out.  </P> <P> Such a miraculous finish somehow would not have been appropriate for the Lakers  on this trip. They had to work overtime to earn the victory.  </P> <P> The Lakers were in control the entire five minutes, a departure from their only  previous overtime experience, when they went scoreless against the Detroit  Pistons.  </P> <P> When it was finally over, the Lakers were happy but a little tired.  </P> <P> "No, a lot tired," Johnson said.  </P> <P> That could only partially account for the continuation of their outside  shooting problems. The Lakers made only 39.8% of their shots, but found success  in the second half using a bigger lineup featuring Woolridge and Vlade Divac  against the smaller Timberwolves.  </P> <P> Woolridge, in his best game since coming off the injured list last week, scored  20 points and had six rebounds. Divac added 16 points and 11 rebounds in 29  minutes.  </P> <P> "I feel a lot more comfortable out there," Woolridge said. "There are still  times when I feel tentative. But I'm glad Pat had the confidence in me to leave  me in there."  </P> <P> Riley said he had no choice but to go with a big lineup, since Laker guards  were not hitting. Byron Scott made only two of 10 shots and failed to reach  double figures for the third consecutive game. Michael Cooper missed all five  shots he attempted.  </P> <P> "We just got to get in the habit of moving the ball again," Riley said. "We've  only had one or two practices in the last two weeks. So, right now, our offense  is sluggish, lethargic and boring."  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Byron Scott has made only two of his last 17 shots. Coach Pat Riley said the  Lakers need to improve the ball movement in the half-court offense to enable  Scott to take open jump shots. Said Scott: "I'm kind of hesitating too much.  I'll just call it a little slump. You got to keep going and play both ends of  the court (offense and defense)." Scott's defense limited former Laker Tony  Campbell to six points in the second half. . . . Campbell on the Lakers: "I  knew Magic wouldn't let them lose to an expansion team. I think the Lakers are  still the Lakers. They may not be as glamorous without Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar),  but they are still a great team."  </P></p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Tarnished Lamont starts to lose support: Talk among Tories about a successor is spreading IN POLITICS, image counts for as much as substance. So the political damage inflicted on Mr Norman Lamont by the disclosure that the Treasury helped to pay one of his personal legal bills has little to do with the merits of the argument. As the weekend reports about the chancellor's financial affairs dealt another public relations blow to the government, the view among senior Conservatives was that Mr Lamont's image had been badly tarnished. The hardening consensus was that Mr John Major should move him from the Treasury in a new-year cabinet reshuffle. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, were being cited as front-runners for his job. No one was suggesting that Mr Lamont had broken the rules by accepting the Pounds 4,000 payment towards a Pounds 23,000 bill incurred after he discovered 18 months ago that the tenant in his Notting Hill house was a self-styled sex therapist. The contribution had been approved by Treasury officials who had judged that it matched the expenses he had incurred directly as a result of his public office. The taxpayers' contribution covered the initial handling of press inquiries, not the subsequent legal bill to evict the tenant. According to senior Whitehall insiders Mr Lamont had not asked for the money. Instead it had been offered after his officials judged that protecting the reputation of the chancellor was a legitimate public expense. The payment had been approved both by Sir Peter Middleton, then permanent secretary, and by Sir Terence Burns, his successor. An explanation of the expenditure had been sent to the National Audit Office. Whatever the proprieties, ministerial colleagues acknowledged yesterday that Mr Lamont had made a serious political misjudgment. They queried also whether he should have accepted the generosity of the anonymous Conservative benefactors who paid the remainder of the legal costs. The timing could not have been worse. A few days earlier the disclosures about Mr Lamont's credit-card record had indicated that the chancellor had been repeatedly behind in meeting his repayments. Taken together the two events conveyed an image of a chancellor living beyond his means, a bon viveur charged with stewardship of the nation's finances but careless about his own. As one minister put it last night: 'Accepting taxpayers' money does not say much for his judgment.' In more tranquil times Mr Lamont might have been able to brush off the controversy. But two years of deepening economic gloom and the disintegration on September 16 of the government's economic strategy with sterling's withdrawal from the ERM have seriously undermined his reputation. Neither the Conservative party nor the electorate are in a forgiving mood. Mr Lamont's position had been underpinned by his support on the right of the party. A Euro-sceptic, he has made clear that he is in no hurry to take sterling back into the ERM. But this weekend his admirers were beginning to question whether, with Mr Lamont at the Treasury, the government could hope to re-ignite the consumer and industrial confidence central to its hopes of economic recovery. There are signs of strain between Mr Major and Mr Lamont. The prime minister's friends have made clear that the economic recovery package in this month's Autumn Statement was a source of friction between the two men. The chancellor is said to have sought to trim Mr Major's ambitions. Mr Lamont has told his allies that he has an assurance from the prime minister that his position is secure, but the relationship between the two - the most important in the government - is businesslike rather than friendly. Nor is Mr Lamont's reputation high within the Treasury. He is judged to lack the intellectual clout - and capacity for hard work - of some of his predecessors. Some senior Conservatives were saying last night that Mr Major might yet seek to avoid until the summer a reshuffle that would anger Tory Euro-sceptics. The government is already faced with the prospect of a series of backbench revolts against the Maastricht bill. To move Mr Clarke or Mr MacGregor - both prominent pro-Europeans - to the Treasury could increase the number of potential rebels. Mr Howard, the most junior candidate, alone among the front-runners shares Mr Lamont's instincts on Europe and the ERM. Mr Clarke, widely acknowledged to be the most powerful minister in Mr Major's cabinet, has by far the strongest claim to the chancellorship. Mr Lamont could be moved to the Home Office or, in a wider reshuffle, to defence. Mr Major is a cautious politician but he may have to take the risk. After the traumas of the past few months he and his government need above all to demonstrate that they have re-established a grip. Putting Mr Clarke in 11 Downing Street could do it.</p>

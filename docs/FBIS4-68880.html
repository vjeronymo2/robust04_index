			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs at the University </F> of Latvia, 14 April 1994: "Foreign Policy and Domestic Policy  Aspects of Latvia's Security"]    [Text] I would like to start this address today with the  thought that the foreign policy and domestic policy aspects of  Latvia's security are a regional component of European security  and stability. The importance of this theme is characterized not  only by the increasing instability in the world and the  countless possible causes of conflict, but also in the strongly  emotional and politicized discussion in Latvia about the signing  of the agreement between the Russian Federation and Latvia,  about which there are many different views and arguments.    Whatever I say today, always bear in mind that Latvia's  security may be and partly is a constituent and essential  element of Europe's security and stability. That is the first  position which is at the foundation of my deliberations. The  second is a specific feature of Latvia, that is, that our  foreign and domestic security are unusually closely connected.    My main emphasis will be on the political aspect of  international security, not on its mechanism or its military  component. In other words, the subject of this address is  defining the cornerstone of Latvia's security and the discovery  of the causes of insecurity, as well as determining our  responses to the reaction to developments in the international  situation.    That is why I, first of all, will talk about the practice of  international politics at the end of the 20th century; secondly,  I will examine Latvia's place in the New World Order;  thirdly, I will characterize the basic dimensions of Latvia's  foreign policy; fourthly, I will offer insights into the  domestic aspects and coherence of Latvia's security. In  conclusion we will evaluate the possible responses, actions and  the consequences for Latvia of those or other actions.    The Practice of International Politics    For most of the Twentieth century, talk of a collective  security system and a few real efforts to realize it were  ignored, and precedence was given to doctrines of military  security and corresponding applications of international power  politics. Thus, in international practice the concepts of  "security" and "national security" were used as synonyms for  military security. To a certain extent that is understandable:  Not only did confrontations occur involving the world's great  powers and individual groups of states, but also an active  struggle for the division and redivision of the world, expansion  of spheres of influence, etc. The criteria for great power  security and national security were chiefly oriented not toward  domestic security, but actually toward averting potential  threats to the sphere of influence and territory and satisfying  hegemonistic national interests far beyond the state's borders.  The best example for that is the realization of the USSR's  interests in the Baltic states, the 1939 Ribbentrop-Molotov  pact, the aggressive annexation of the Baltic states into the  USSR in 1940.    It must be said that at the end of the Twentieth century the  principles of European security have both changed essentially  and have acquired new dimensions. Today, Europe turns its  attention to the institutional dimensions to avoid crises and to  reduce instability. That means that the goal of the  international community is to achieve stable collective security  with the intermediation of institutions so that their decisions  can become meaningful.    Along with that the classical concept of guaranteed security  has become old fashioned, and in its place as a guarantee comes  participation in a collective security system. With that  emphasis that Latvia's security is guaranteed in its own way by  the fact of participation in the ECSC, ZASP [expansion not  provided], the "Partnership for Peace" program or the Western  European Union, for along with that we are becoming part of this  process. The alternative to this sort of participation can only  be isolation and remaining in a grey zone.    A plan to create a mutually inter-connected network of  institutions in Europe was already planned in 1990, to provide  the opportunity to use various crisis management systems, let's  say political, economic or even cultural, and, to a lesser  extent, military methods. This resolution came at the right time  and the Eastern European countries gave the necessary support so  that the transition process in those countries would not stop.    Realizing that the New World Order after the Cold  War is characterized by disorder and countless possible causes  of conflict, but that doctrines of security have taken on a new  content, we may not return to the failures of the international  system of the past, especially to those which followed the end  of the First World War, when self-isolation and nationalistic  principles of security took priority.    The ending of the Cold War's strictly fixed positions and  along with that the time of easily modeled situation, and the  time of rigid doctrine have also gone. The situation in the  world, in Europe, and also around Latvia is developing very  dynamically.    In the current circumstances obviously the most pragmatic  approach to this question is to formulate clearly the basic  orientation of Latvia's security policy and foreign policy,  which, depending on the situation, permit us to choose solutions  most appropriate to Latvia's interests.    Latvia in the New World Order    The Prime Minister, the Fifth Saeima of the Republic of  Latvia, and the Cabinet of Ministers have come to the point of a  significant decision, which is related to the Republic of  Latvia's international and domestic interests.    The cornerstone of the contemporary dilemma is the draft  agreement between the Republic of Latvia and the Russian  Federation. To conclude the treaty, which is essential to  Latvia, we would swear that we support the most significant  post-war achievements in the international arena: international  cooperation and integration. The importance of this event puts  forth the demand to coordinate national political decisions with  the still changing situation in international security. In this  context I would like to remind you that the teamwork principle  operates at both national and international. Such a team has  already successfully developed within the context of Baltic  cooperation, though Latvia still has not developed a national  consensus and remains politically fragmented regarding  acceptance of this critical decision.    The contemporary world may think that Latvia is too small to  influence the events which develop the planet's political life.  The world's great powers are paying increased attention to the  conclusion of the Latvian-Russian agreement. Thus for the first  time in the history of our country the opportunity is presented  to Latvia to make an investment in the security and stability of  Europe and the world. What, then, could this investment be?    First of all, a successful conclusion to our economic  reforms  has become significant also to the European security aggregate,  for economic and security policy increasingly overlap. To ensure  long-term stability, the development of the economic character  will dominate over traditional security institutions. So, for  example, while the European countries still give priority to  NATO as a security organization, in the furture this priority  could be given to the European Union/Western European Union  institution, which in the longer term may be viewed as having  greater potential. Latvia's cooperation agreement with the  European Union and the status of members in the European Union  must be understood as testimony to Europe's faith in Latvia,  which calls for adequate steps in response.    Secondly, our foreign policy must be appropriate to the  changing international situation. Of course in the realm of  foreign policy, to prepare for the future one must have a  long-term vision, which would give an insight into the level of  capabilities, which is necessary to react appropriately to  respective situations in the future. Only our foreign policy  values system can guarantee that we do not find ourselves in the  gray zone of European security.    In regard to this we must agree on the resources which must  be devoted to supporting our doctrine in this area. To the RL  [Republic of Latvia] that means full integration of diplomatic,  economic, and military capability, which will in the aggregate  sketch out our strategy in the area of security.    Thirdly, although we can view the intuitive logic of our  values and our position as self-evident, we would not need to  isolate ourselves from other views. The draft agreement on  withdrawal of the army and the compromise on the Skrunda early  warning system question is an example which attests to our value  system being Europeanist.    Signing the agreement about the withdrawal of Russian armed  forces from Latvia is the only real guarantee that the Russian  armed forces will be withdrawn from Latvian territory by 31  August 1994. In fixing the end date for the withdrawal of the  Russian armed forces the likelihood of international controls  over this process are greatly increased. Signing the agreement  eliminates the possibility that the Skrunda early warning system  radar will be left to exploitation, secondly, and permits this  to begin immediately: The installation's most dangerous aspect,  the disassembling of the parts. The Skrunda installation is  found in Latvia's territory without a treaty which fixes the  date when its operations will cease, which would mean not  controlling this installation's functioning in Latvia for an  undetermined period of time. The execution of the treaty will be  controlled by a three-way commission which would include also  ECSC representatives. ECSC control over execution of this  agreement is not the only guarantee. It will also be ensured by  Latvian participation in the the "Partnership for Peace"  program. The agreement will enhance Latvia's opportunities to  cooperate with the Western collective security systems, proving  that Latvia is a politically mature country, which is able to  carry the politics of compromise in the interests of both Latvia  and also the international community.    By signing the agreement the Russian side undertakes a  supplementary payment for the Skrunda early warning system radar  being located in Latvia to compensate also the damage done to  the surrounding environment, if that is established.    During his recent visit in Western Europe Latvia's President  received international support to establish a special fund to  eliminate the ecological costs of Skrunda and the dismantlement  of the radar. The government issued an order to establish a  special fund to finance the relocation of retired military  personnel.    The agreement on Russian military retirees and their family  members does not determine the status of these persons in the  Republic of Latvia. That will be determined by Republic of  Latvia legislation.    I acknowledge that these agreements include several  difficult  compromises for Latvia, but in my view there is no more  important task than fixing the end point for withdrawal of  Russia's armed forces, and with that achieving the withdrawal of  this army from Latvia as quickly as possible.    Now, thanks to the initialed agreements, the so-called  Yeltsin error and the activity of some part of the people (who  easily manipulate, using historical analogies and ignorance of  inter-connections), we acquire a surprisingly large opportunity  to free ourselves not only from the army, but also from  discharged military personnel, for we will never again have a  real opportunity to actively draw in Western money to encourage  implementation. If we lose this historic opportunity, then we  could finally also lose our country, for I would not want to see  a future of Latvian provincial decay in Russia's shadow. And if,  by not signing the agreement, there is still an army in Latvia  after 31 August, then they will all be the godsons of Grinblats,  Kirsteins and Straume, for their care also remains here, which,  permit me, depends on patriotism and an erroneous evaluation of  the situation. How easily I could support the corps of critics  of the agreement and I would do it if I did not see the  inter-connectedness of the whole process. I would like to ask  you and myself: Why is the opposition's view of the agreement  the same both in Latvia and in Russia? Why is the signing of the  agreement being opposed by a united front of seemingly  diametrically opposed powers? I clearly see the situations in  the case of either the agreement being signed or in the event  that it is not signed. It is important not to permit  manipulation of oneself or or others. Against that I place an  understanding of our historical perspective and unpostponeable  action.    With appropriate action we will confirm also that basic idea  of the New World Order, that is that this order can  be created on the road of negotiation, that large and small  countries can can become equal partners on the road on  negotiation.    The Basic Dimensions of Latvia's Foreign Policy    We must explain what critical global factors can influence  our country in the mid-nineties of this century, as well as  entering the Twenty-first century. The chief goal of our  country's foreign policy is to guarantee our capacity to answer  the future development of events, which could threaten our  national interest. These threats, of a local or international  character, also include developments in the demographic  situation, social unrest, conflict over the status of  minorities, and a one-sided decree's basic view of peacekeeping  or strengthening security operations in other countries,  political fragmentation, as well as economic decline.    We must clearly ascertain that real foreign policy cannot be  based on many models at the same time, which is why security  policy, at least at the level of conceptual thesis, should stand  above squabbling by political parties. But unfortunately  discussions of foreign policy and security policy issues are  being exploited as tools for increasing capital in domestic  politics.    What Are the Dimensions of Latvia's Foreign Policy?    1) We aspire to a new regionalism: In the broadest meaning  this policy is crowned with Baltic cooperation within the  context of European integration and has sketched in as a new  element in European architecture, five plus three, which must be  understood as beginning cooperation between the Scandanavian  states and all three Baltic states within the context of a  broadened European Union. The second element: A union of Baltic  Sea states as a regional organization established in the  Northeastern European Baltic region.    2) We want to place a growing emphasis on a mutually  connected network of institutions in Europe. Still, we must  think not only about what we want to receive from these  institutions, but also what we will give them.    The European Union    In the recent past Latvia's inclination toward the European  Community meant primarily that we distance ourselves from the  former USSR, not approaching Europe. As Latvia's relations with  the European Union developed, our security policy in Europe's  dimension has acquired the greatest importance. Member state  status in the European Union pays security dividends, which in a  critical situation may turn out to be of decisive importance.  Each step in the economic realm brings us closer to the European  Union--a free trade agreement, which takes effect on 1 January  1995 already, and after that its logical successor would be  associate member state status, at the same time is an investment  also in strengthening Latvia's security.    That is not a cost of "feelings of security." Economically,  too, there is no alternative to such a direction for Latvia. Of  course, right now Latvia could, without great effort, orient  itself mainly toward the broad CIS market, although, in  predicting Latvia's future development, I am convinced that that  would ensure the backwardness of Latvia's industrial technology  and we will encounter additional and unnecessary risks because  of this disorderly and unpredictable market. That does not mean  that we must decline everything which this promising market may  offer, but still in my view it would be better to enter this  economic space together with the European Union and not by  competing with it.    The European Union is our road and hope for the future. The  discussions to conclude the free trade agreement between the  Baltic states and the European Union is an important part of  this section of the road. As I have already stated, if the  discussions conclude successfully, a free trade regime between  the European Union and Latvia will go into effect on 1 January  of next year, and will not apply to agricultural production. In  addition, a four year transition period is anticipated during  which both sides will agree on adapting the domestic market  asymmetric protection principle to trade. In the future the  European Union hopes to activate a political dialogue with the  Baltic states and, as soon as the essential prerequisites are  established, to begin discussions and to conclude agreements on  offering associate member status. In fact the political dialogue  has already begun and in the next few days its results will  become apparent. But the result of incorrect actions by us may  be that the political dialogue goes quiet.    By offering associate member status to the Baltic states the  European Union is clearly defining the boundary of its political  interests and that will certainly permit a more effective  neutralization of Russia realizing her "near abroad" concept in  Latvia.    The Western European Union    This is an organization, which is at once the European  Union's military union and the NATO pillar in Europe.    Latvia's active participation in the Western European Union  is a possibility, acquiring associate member state status in  this organization. In the future the Western European Union  anticipates having the decisive role in the European Union's  joint defense policy, which is why it is possible that the  highest possible participation status for Latvia will give us  the opportunigy to have a hand in developing this policy from  the very beginning. Besides active participation in the Western  European Union will be one other road--Europe, through which  Latvia will be able to align itself successfully with NATO.    NATO, the "Partnership for Peace," the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council    Latvia's policy with regard to NATO is oriented toward full  member state status, the most serious security guarantee that  Latvia could possibly receive. We cannot be only "security  consumers." Changes in the international situation have  influenced the NATO philosophy also. NATO established the  "Partnership for Peace" program for cooperation in the military  and security areas, with the help of which non-NATO countries  could gradually develop individually, each country's wishes and  possibilities appropriate to the dialogue with the NATO alliance.    "Partnership for Peace" today is another one of the threads  which must be woven into Latvia's security blanket. The  government must find an appropriate path which will, in this  difficult economic time, balance the division of resources in  Latvia's resolving many of the country's problems. We must  determine how much the country of Latvia is ready to pay for  today's and tomorrow's security. We must understand that wecan  discuss it only so long as this country stands.    The European Conference on Security and Cooperation    The ECSC is the basic element of the European security  architecture.    Our professional diplomats are actively working within the  confines the the ECSC, to include this organization in resolving  Latvian-Russian relations. When the agreements are concluded,  ECSC representatives will also be able to participate in the  joint commissions to verify implementation of the  Agreement on the Skrunda early warning system radar temporary  functioning and dismantlement, as well as the  Agreement on social compensation for discharged military  personnel. After the Skrunda agreement is signed ECSC  representatives also will participate in inspecting this  installation.    In speaking about the European Stability Pact or its  so-called Baladur plan, we see that it has transformed from an  idea to a constituent part of the European Union's joint foreign  policy. Latvia has undertaken to join this pact in its essential  problem resolution. This process, as is well known, will be  inaugurated in the second half of May in Paris, at nineth pact  inauguration conference. It is anticipated that twelve European  Union countries and nine countries to which this initiative  directly relates (the Baltic states, as well as Eastern and  Central European states) and will participate.    In Latvia's view, without border consolidation and  resolution  of minority problems, round table discussions must be given  broader scope, also touching on the most important security and  stability in economic and social aspects. Since discussions will  take place and resolutions will be adopted in accordance with  the basic principles of the UN, ESCS and EU, that is, not  altering borders with force and viewing them as inviolate, but  that can be discussed, then, so that further discussion about  these and other problems, essential discussions about exit  points, about the occupation of the Republic of Latvia, and  legal and political aspects of the ensuing annexation.    In our view cooperation in the security realm must be  realized through bilateral agreements.    Latvia's security blanket is made stronger by mutual  relations threads which, supported by mutual interests, tie us  to different states.    The road to Europe works as a catalyst for Baltic  cooperation. The Baltic states in their leaning toward Europe  ever more clearly comprehend and more successfully realize this  cooperation. Mutual consultations on security matters occur  regularly, both at official levels (at the Prime Ministerial,  Defense and Foreign Affairs Ministerial levels), and at the  informal (regular foreign policy and defense planning  conferences. Currently mutual coordination of Baltic states  participation in the world security process is quite essential,  for example, in the aforementioned project, the "Partnership for  Peace," the Stability pact, as well as participation in defining  our status in the Western European Union.    The successful cooperation of the Baltic states is an  example  to the world community and international organizations have  commended the Baltic states' jointly established peacekeeping  force batallion, which will be preparing to participate in the  peacekeeping activities of the UN and other organizations.    We are united with Scandanavia in our mutual interests in  the  area of regional security and an understanding of the  independence of the Baltic states. The Scandanavian countries  are actively implementing the "Sovereignty Support Program,"  which helps to ensure domestic order and stability in the Baltic  states.    After the visit to Latvia by Polish President Lech Walesa a  new era has begun in relations between Latvia and Poland.  Latvia, Poland and other "Visegrad states" have mutual goals  both in relation to moving closer to European organizations and  NATO.    We value highly the positive roles of Germany and France in  the development of the European Union. Germany is Latvia's  closest neighbor among the European Union's great powers.  Germany has given and continues to give us essential assistance,  supporting and accelerating our moving closer to Europe.    Domestic Aspects of Latvia's Security    The first task in developing our country's foreign policy  and  security policy is that we, as a nation, among ourselves, must  agree on very significant matters. The most important is the  necessary national unity (consensus) and political desire to  maintain long-term faith in the chosen strategy in the area of  our foreign policy and security policy.    In addressing this strategy, our national interests must  first be clearly defined.    These are Latvia's national interests and goals:    1) maintaining the Republic of Latvia as a free and  independent state which respects democratic values, is  developing a free market economic system and guarantees  protection of human rights;    2) developing the Republic of Latvia economically, which  would ensure the opportunity for individual prosperity;    3) healthy and cooperative relations with neighboring  states.    Regardless of how the world order and architecture change,  our country's interests and goals remain unchanged.    Political and ideological threats to national security are  the most dangerous and critical of all threats.    Various anti-state oriented organizations and groupings  continue to operate in Latvia, which do not support the idea of  an independent state and whose goals are contrary to Latvia's  interests.    We all remember the goals and actions of these organizations  during the October 1993 Moscow putsch.    Former USSR and Russian Federation retired military  personnel  are viewed as one of the sources of the threats from within  Latvia. As is known, the Northwestern Army Group headquarters  now pays pensions to 22 thousand people. In addition, their  spouses and children also live in Latvia. Altogether they are  about 100 thousand people, or close to three percent of Latvia's  population. We should not look for the image of the enemy among  these people, for the military personnel problem must be  resolved in a civilized way.    Many USSR and Russian armed forces pensioners are active in  the Veterans Rights Protection Union. If these Russian armed  forces pensioners truly wish to demonstrate their loyalty to  Latvia, than these people must publicly acknowledge the fact of  Latvia's occupation in 1940.    What is most critical for a person to feel secure? It is  essential that he have health, shelter and a job, which ensures  necessary income. Threats to this social value creates not only  a certain feeling of insecurity, but also increases  opportunities to manipulate people's emotions, sense of  security, increases instability and strife. In addition, the  state of domestic security also is also determined by crime, the  economic and ecological situation, and social welfare. Let's  just remember what Swedish Prime Minister Karl Bildt reminded  Latvia of during his visit to Latvia: It is not possible to  reach 100 percent security from the zero level in one instant.</p>

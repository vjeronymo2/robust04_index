			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Fears for reform as Russian rouble falls A further plunge in the value of the Russian rouble yesterday raised fears that the country's economic reforms could be derailed and that the growing confidence of foreign investors would be undermined. The rouble fell 6 per cent on the Moscow interbank currency exchange, closing at Rbs2,631 to the dollar. The latest fall means that the rouble has lost 16.5 per cent against the dollar this month. The central bank, which has spent Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.58bn) supporting the currency, has said it will stop intervening to preserve the estimated Dollars 5bn hard currency reserves. The depreciation, which is expected to fuel an inflation rate of around 8 per cent this month after a low in August of 4 per cent, may force the government into panic measures. It also risks delaying aid from international financial institutions, which are likely to be wary of giving money to a government which may no longer be seen to be in control of its finances. A senior western financial official in Moscow said: 'We may get a crisis earlier than we expected because of what has happened on the rouble front . . . it's starting to feel like loss of control.' Senior officials in Washington, where Russian president Boris Yeltsin discussed economic issues with US president Bill Clinton yesterday, echoed the promise made on Monday by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, that Russia could expect up to Dollars 10bn in immediate aid, mainly from the International Monetary Fund, if it adopted a tough reform programme. Muscovites yesterday queued at exchange points to change their roubles into dollars at prices which at some points dropped to 2,750 to the dollar. Some of those waiting said they no longer trusted the government to protect the value of the rouble. The fall in the currency was the largest since the 7.3 per cent drop which came when Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister, left the government of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin in January. The crisis may force the central bank to push up interest rates, despite its wish to reduce rates to encourage growth. Rouble fall threatens to undo everything, Page 3</p>

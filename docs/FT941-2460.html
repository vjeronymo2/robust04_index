			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / People: John Tucker's international alliance German corporate history was made on Friday when John R. Tucker became the first ever American to take the helm of a big German company, writes Michael Lindemann. Tucker will become chief executive of Munchen Motoren und Turbinenunion (MTU), a subsidiary of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), on July 1. He joins a handful of foreigners in senior German management, as companies - previously managed exclusively by Germans - fight to strike new international alliances. Tucker, 46, is expected to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Hubert Dunkler, and become a member of the Dasa board in the next few weeks. Industry analysts have suggested the appointment is meant to strengthen Dasa ties with Pratt and Whitney, the leading US engines manufacturer, and rival the successful co-operation between General Electric and Snecma of France. The new MTU boss began his career at Westinghouse Electric in 1968. Most recently he was chief executive at AEG Transportation Systems, the Pittsburgh-based subsidiary of the German multinational which is a market leader in propulsion and people-mover systems. He is credited with pushing sales up to a record Dollars 210m in 1992 and revolutionising working practices among the 1,100 workers.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee hit by a Dollars 188-a-tonne 'correction' Coffee prices staged a sharp correction yesterday when the London market responded to a late downturn in New York on Wednesday. The September futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange slipped by Dollars 188 to Dollars 3,805 a tonne in moderate trading. 'A lot of the business has been liquidations,' said one trader, 'people are getting out of the market and staying out to watch developments.' In the final minutes of trading on Wednesday night, arabica coffee futures at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York suddenly went into reverse, turning a 20-cent rise into a 4-cent fall on the day at Dollars 2.41 a pound. If the London market had fallen by an equivalent amount, nearby positions would have lost over Dollars 500 a tonne. London traders said the New York market was setting the tone for trading. It declined again yesterday, the September position reaching Dollars 2.39 a pound by midday. The sell-off was heavily influenced by technical chart activity and by worried speculators who thought the market might have seen its peak. Rumours that Brazil was about to re-open registrations prior to starting exports again added to the uncertain mood in the market. Brazil halted exports earlier this week in order to assess the frost damage to next year's crop. In the meantime, several coffee companies announced increases in their consumer prices in response to the recent rapid run-up in the futures markets. In the US, a division of Nestle raised ground coffee prices by 13 per cent and in Germany roasters hiked some prices by 28 per cent. But Mr Alexandre Beltrao, executive director of the International Coffee Organisation, said the price rises should not affect consumption as coffee remained a cheap drink.</p>

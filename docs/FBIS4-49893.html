			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 6 (XINHUA) -- The China National  Technical Import and Export Corporation (CNTIC) signed a  contract here today with the U.S. Foster wheeler energy company  to import a boiler island worth 190 million U.S. dollars.    The island is being imported for the Ezhou Power Station, 30  km east of Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province.    The power station, composed of two sets of turbogenerators  with a capacity of 300,000 kilowatts each, is the first thermal  power plant built with part of the third batch of loans from the  Japanese Government.    The station is made up of a boiler island, turbine island  and  a electrical equipment island.    Last March, CNTIC signed contracts with Japan's Itochu  Corporation and ABB Ltd. to import a turbine island and an  electrical equipment island worth 130 million U.S. dollars.    Last year, the Foster Wheeler Energy Company exported a  boiler island to Zouxian Power Station in east China's Shandong  Province.    The construction of the Ezhou Power Station will help ease  electricity shortages in Hubei Province, CNTIC sources said.</p>

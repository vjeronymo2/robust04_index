			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / People: Priddle to monitor the West's energy Robert Priddle, head of corporate and consumer affairs at the Department of Trade and Industry, was yesterday elected executive director of the International Energy Agency, the West's energy monitoring body. Priddle has been elected for a four-year term to the Paris-based organisation as successor to Helga Steeg, who had held the post for 10 years. Priddle's election comes as the 23-member organisation is in the middle of re-defining the agency's role in an economic and political climate which has changed considerably since it was set up after the 1973 oil crisis. 'The energy market is much more diverse and the political situation much less confrontational,' Priddle says. The IEA was set up to monitor security of energy supplies and share fuel at times of crisis. But Priddle says it must now work much more closely with the international markets for oil. The IEA must also concentrate on other aspects of energy security such as environmental measures. 'Unless energy producers and users are properly sensitive to environmental damage, the security of energy supply may be called into question,' he says. The agency will also need to develop its relationship with non-OECD countries in future as the dominance of the OECD in the oil market has diminished, he believes.</p>

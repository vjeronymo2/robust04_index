"Russia's view that it had `strategic interests' in relation  to its `near abroad' and it would not give up what has been  fought for for so much, is different from the contents of the  declaration signed at the summit of Russia and the USA," Malk  said, adding that this should still be a cause of anxiety for  other countries.    "The world expects Russia to present an explanation as to  its  attitude towards other states," he stressed. At the summit of  the USA and Russia both sides talked about the fact that no  divisional lines should be drawn in Europe, Malk said, stressing  that calling some states "near abroad" means in itself drawing  divisional lines.</p>

China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country's  stock-market watchdog, has confirmed that the country will go  ahead to issue 5.5 billion yuan ($632 million) worth of shares  as planned. However, the issuing of part of the shares may be  postponed until next year, if necessary.    Last month, the Shenzhen Securities Exchange suspended the  listing of new shares to help revive the bearish market.    The long-awaited step was warmly welcomed by both investors  and experts. They blame the continuing slip in the market on  the listing of too many new shares in too short a time, which  leads to a shortage of capital.    And they hoped the move would reverse the months-long  bearish  trend on the markets.    However, they have been disappointed that Shenzhen's move  has  failed to bring the anticipated results.    The brief revival disappeared quickly as the market remained  dull last week and most investors continued to wait and see.    Some experts say the suspension of new stocks cannot solve  the stock market's real problems.    High interest rates, increased risks in stocks investment  and  the disappointing performance of public companies are the major  reasons for the market's dull performance, said an economist at  Beijing University.    Enterprises must now pay more for bank loans and that, in  turn, is reducing their profits.    More importantly, the high interest rates have also  encouraged potential investors to protect their cash in banks  rather than risk it on stocks .    In addition, China's expanding stock market and the  increasing numbers of investors have made buying shares more  risky.    The days when the demand for stocks outpaced supply and  people could become rich overnight have long gone.    Now more and more public companies are choosing to grant  bonus shares or rights issues as dividends to shareholders. So  shareholders get no cash dividend and have to buy the new issues.    "It is hard to earn money in the stock market today--that's  why I withdrew my money from the market," said Beijing investor  Li Qin.</p>

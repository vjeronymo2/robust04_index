			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME WARNER INC.'S 32-PAGE AD INSERT BUGS A MEDIA CRITIC  </P> <P> Executives of Time Warner Inc. described it as one of the largest  magazine-advertising campaigns ever -- a 32-page insert that will reach about  80 million readers of Time, Life, People, Fortune and Entertainment Weekly this  week.  </P> <P> But one prominent media critic called it a prime example of intra-company  back-scratching that is "anti-competitive" and smacks of "self-dealing" by the  giant media concern.  </P> <P> The advertising insert in question was placed in the five Time Warner  publications this week by Time Warner's movie subsidiary, Warner Bros., to  commemorate the 50th birthday of Bugs Bunny. In addition to "advertorial" copy  about the wisecracking cartoon rabbit, the insert carries ads promoting various  Warner movies, company divisions and products licensed by Warner Bros.  </P> <P> A Time Warner spokesman said this week that the company's movie division "paid  fair market value" to the company's magazine division to run the ad supplement.  He would not specify a price, but sources inside and outside the company  estimated that such a promotion would go for about $10 million.  </P> <P> However, Ben H. Bagdikian, the former dean of the journalism school at UC  Berkeley, said the supplement highlights a larger issue involving concentration  of ownership in the media. "The media that reach the largest audiences are  becoming dominated by a handful of corporations who can exploit their size and  power with the kind of self-dealing that these Time Warner ads represent," he  said.  </P> <P> Ownership of Warner Bros. and the magazines gives Time Warner a built-in cost  advantage, Bagdikian said, that permits the company to squeeze out small  competitors. "Presumably, even if Warner pays the going ad rate, Time Inc. will  make a certain profit in which Warner will participate," he said. "It's all  going to end up in the same bank anyway."  </P> <P> Sandy Reisenbach, Warner Bros.' executive vice president of marketing, said  Warner began talking with Time about running the ads long before Time Inc. and  Warner Communications announced that they were merging early last year. The  supplement was inspired by a similar promotion that Walt Disney Co. ran in Time  Inc. publications a year ago to promote the 60th year of Mickey Mouse,  Reisenbach said.  </P> <P> Everett Dennis, executive director of the Gannett Center for Media Studies,  said the Time Warner ad supplement would have inspired congressional antitrust  hearings 20 years ago. But he said media ownership is considerably more diverse  now than two decades ago and the ads appear to raise no issues involving  anti-competitive practices.  </P> <P> "This is exactly the kind of competitive advantage that Time and Warner hoped  to achieve by merging," he said. "They are simply maximizing their  opportunities. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with it."  </P> <P> Dennis added that cross promotion within media firms is common. The Wall Street  Journal runs ads for subsidiaries owned by its parent firm, Dow Jones &amp;  Co., and the Washington Post runs ads for Newsweek, which are both owned by  Washington Post Co.  </P></p>

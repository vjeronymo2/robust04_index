			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / House prices 'are still weak' HOUSE PRICES remain weak and are showing little sign of recovery apart from the small pick-up which usually occurs at this time of year, according to Halifax, Britain's biggest building society. The society, which yesterday published its latest monthly house-price index, said prices last month rose 0.4 per cent. After taking into account seasonal fluctuations, prices actually fell 0.5 per cent, it said. It was the seventh successive month that seasonally adjusted prices had fallen. On this basis prices had risen only once during the past 12 months, in October, said the society. Since April last year the average UK house price of Pounds 62,709 had fallen 6.2 per cent. Prices of new houses had fallen 6 per cent over the same period to an average price of Pounds 73,629. Halifax said there had been an improvement in demand since the general election, but it was no more than it expected at this time of year. The society added that it expected a further improvement in confidence. As a result, it forecast that prices would stabilise in the second half of the year before starting to rise next year. Nationwide, the UK's second largest building society, has also reported a small rise in house prices in April. Earlier this week it said prices had risen 0.6 per cent in April. Mr John Hutchinson, a Nationwide director, said: 'It is too early to speculate that this is a sign of a general sustainable improvement. 'People may be less cautious now about making the long-term commitment to house-buying than they were a few months ago, but there will be need to be a demonstrable improvement in the economy and in peoples' job security and confidence before the housing market gets going again.'</p>

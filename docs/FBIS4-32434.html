			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sz.Sz."-signed interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the </F> Alliance of Free Democrats; place and date not given: "The  Coalition Agreement Is Not a Mathematical Operation"]    [Text] As a result of the planned coalition agreement, the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] will have a serious influence  on the whole work of the government, rather than only on the  operation of certain ministries, Ivan Peto claims. Peto  believes that, if the agreement is signed, the conventions of  the two parties will, in all probability, approve it.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] On the basis of various newspaper reports,  it was expected that the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] would  have eight and the SZDSZ four ministries in the new government.  In view of the agreement reached on 20 June, do you think that  the negotiating delegation managed to obtain adequate guarantees  for the SZDSZ when the ministries were allocated?    [Peto] This agreement is not yet final, so the time has not  yet come for drawing a balance. Many people believe that the  coalition bargaining consists only of allocating ministries.  However, in addition to this, we also have to agree on issues in  connection with the government's order of business and on issues  of guarantees. We also have to reach an agreement on issues of  content because the policies of the coalition government will  depend on these. Those who believe that the coalition agreement  is purely a mathematical operation are wrong. I find it  unfortunate if the starting point for someone is whether we get  three or four ministries. It has to be remembered, for example,  that the various ministries have different levels of influence  on society's life. The agreement whose framework is being  outlined will, in my view, ensure a decent position for the  SZDSZ, the smaller coalition partner within the government. As  a result of the planned coalition agreement, the SZDSZ will have  a serious influence on the whole work of government, rather than  only on the operation of certain ministries.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The party's convention on 26 June will have  to approve the coalition agreement. Do you expect serious  internal debates within the SZDSZ on accepting the agreement?    [Peto] As far as I know, we have also managed to assert a  large proportion of our views in the special committees. On the  basis of this, I can state that we did not only meet but  actually exceeded the expectations of the convention that had  empowered us to enter into the coalition talks. I am certain  that we will have debates at the convention and at the 25 June  meeting of the National Council, but if we sign the agreement,  the deputies will most probably approve it. At the moment,  there is a limited chance for debating this issue in the party  because the contents of the final agreement cannot yet be known.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Together with MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn, you  emphasized that the agreement on dividing up the ministries is  not yet final. Do you think that serious changes are possible  compared with what was published after the talks on 20 June?    [Peto] I do not see the coalition talks as closed because we  still have to agree on issues of content. Serious debates can  be expected in connection with this at today's session of the  main delegations because many questions are waiting to be  clarified. As for the ministries, some changes are still  possible but this will not necessarily affect the proportions.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Is there a chance for agreeing on the  supervision of the National Security Office?    [Peto] The views of the two parties have become closer on  this point, too, and the outlines of a compromise solution are  emerging.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] When and at what forum will you decide who  should fill the SZDSZ's government posts?    [Peto] Naturally, we have for a long time had ideas about  whom we would like to nominate for the various government posts.  The executive body will make the final decision once the full  agreement is known.</p>

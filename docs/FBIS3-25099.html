This was  disclosed to our correspondent today by (Nana Quy), regional  coordinator of the Norwegian Refugee Council. She said the  refugees returned from Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa,  and Swaziland. The returnees received agricultural equipment and  seeds, and were helped to resettle in their home areas. She  added that in 1994 returnees will continue to be registered at  civilian institutions [words indistinct] and educational  programs. A total of $3.5 million could be allocated for the  execution of those programs.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / People: Wellings proves there is a profitable after-life Fred Wellings, 52, who has seen more building industry booms and busts than most of his stockbroking colleagues, has proved that there can be a profitable after-life for ageing stockbroking analysts. He quit being a full-time broker on his 50th birthday, and has carved out a new career as consultant, author and non-executive director. Berkeley Group, the successful UK housebuilder, has just appointed Wellings to its board. He has been working for the firm as a consultant for a couple of years. Wellings has also recently published his first textbook, Construction Equities: Evaluation and Trading, and is correcting the proofs of a company history of Marley. His next project is a bibliography of banking history. Wellings, who also acts as a consultant for accountants Robson Rhodes and stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Laing, started his city career with Phillips &amp; Drew in 1962 and spent time with J &amp; A Scrimgeour before ending up at Laing &amp; Cruikshank. 'When I started every analyst was required to cover three or four sectors. Now there are three or four analysts per firm covering each sector,' says Wellings, who has no regrets about his mid-life career switch. He's not the first building analyst to move into the industry. Bob Erith, 55, who covered the building industry at Savory Milln for many years, sits on the board of Crest Nicholson.</p>

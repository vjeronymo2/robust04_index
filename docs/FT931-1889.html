			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / French Elections: Paris-Bonn axis faces pressure - A conservative government will adopt a hard line in Europe CO-OPERATION between Paris and Bonn represents the traditional driving force behind the development of the European Community. But the French conservatives' crushing victory, underlining the unpopular effects of the Socialist government's policy of linking the franc to the D-Mark, may pose severe tests for Franco-German cohesion. The likelihood that the new French government may toughen France's line on the Gatt trade talks is injecting additional uncertainty into economic policy questions. There is also worry in Spain - which faces general elections in the autumn - that the Socialists' rout may undermine the pro-European policies of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Socialist prime minister. Professor Michael Sturmer, director of the German foreign policy think-tank, Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, said that France and Germany had no option but to maintain strong ties: 'The French want to run European policies, but they cannot do it on their own. And the Germans need someone to lean on.' But the German Bundesbank could come under 'enormous pressure' to head off the risk that the new French government might seek to sever the franc/D-Mark parity. Prof Sturmer said that he saw the need for 'plain speaking' by Bonn to the prospective right-wing government, to emphasise the importance of a Gatt trade deal. There could be a 'trade-off' here affecting the Bundesbank's willingness to cut interest rates to help the French economy, he suggested. In Brussels, European Community officials said that the conservatives' landslide might make France's European policies much less predictable. Most senior European Commission officials believe the French opposition's pledge to stick to the franc fort policy, but some Community officials worry that strains caused by cohabitation between a weakened President Francois Mitterrand and an assertive conservative government may reinforce the present political drift in the EC. 'We may be in for a period of prolonged infighting,' said one senior official in Brussels yesterday. There is anxiety in Brussels over the French conservatives having pledged to re-open the EC-US farm trade deal, widely viewed as the pre-requisite for a Gatt conclusion. One view in Brussels is that Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist RPR leader, may provoke a Gatt crisis to strengthen his domestic position. This would be at the expense of upsetting his EC partners, particularly Germany. Speculation about the new French government's monetary policy difficulties has coincided with fresh evidence of Bundesbank scepticism about the targets agreed at Maastricht for economic and monetary union. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, yesterday emphasised Germany's own problems in meeting the Emu fiscal objectives. According to Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerland in Frankfurt: 'The failure of the Socialists to win a single seat in the first round does raise the question of whether there will be a reassessment of the franc fort policy.' Mr Matthys van der Want, chief economist at Pierson, Heldring, Pierson, the Amsterdam merchant bank, said that he did not expect a 'weakening' of Bonn-Paris links, especially since the Bundesbank is now in the midst of a process of gradual interest rate cuts. However, he added that France would run into problems unless the Bundesbank cut its benchmark interest rates by at least a further two percentage points by the fourth quarter. In view of the strong links between the French and Spanish Socialist parties, the result sent a nervous ripple through the Madrid government. 'The French result will affect the Spanish government in that it may force it to change its strict fiscal and monetary policies,' said Mr Joaquin Tamames, a leading Madrid business consultant. Like many analysts, Mr Tamames believes the government is already softening its economic policy position in the face of polls showing the Socialists rapidly losing ground to their conservative opponents. On the other hand, Professor Pedro Schwartz, one of Spain's leading liberal economists, said he believed the French vote would not move Mr Gonzalez. 'I don't think he can win any votes by walking away from his policies.' He added that Mr Gonzalez would be most helped by a crisis in Russia or in the EC . 'That would set Spaniards looking for a safe pair of hands rather than for change,' he said.

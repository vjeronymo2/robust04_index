			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Dr. 'Isa al-'Isa] </F>   [Text] Baghdad--AL-JUMHURIYAH has officially confirmed its  report that four European countries have indeed released our  assets frozen in their banks. AL-JUMHURIYAH's report was  identical with that of the Central Bank of Iraq. A responsible  source said: "Yes, some countries have released Iraqi assets  after receiving the approval of their monetary authorities.  These countries are Switzerland, Spain, Greece, and Austria."    In response to a question from AL-JUMHURIYAH, the source  said  that Iraqi assets had been frozen in the banks of several  Western, developing, and even some Arab countries. He added  that the assets were deposited as current accounts to cover  import expenditures and that there were other deposits in U.S.,  British, and German banks.    Regarding new measures for controlling the circulation of  the  U.S. dollar and other hard currencies in the market or on the  street, the source said: On 7 November 1993, the Council of  Ministers decided to establish limited companies to work as  brokers for buying and selling foreign currencies in order to  stop the confusion that has prevailed since the authorities  permitted the possession and circulation of foreign currencies  in Iraq. The instructions allow the company to use up to 10  percent of its capital for this purpose. During the first  stage, these companies will confine themselves to foreign  banknotes, rather than dealing with other forms of payment; the  dealings will be based on immediate, rather than delayed  payment; and the company's commitment to sound dealings and to  extending its services to its clients will make the process  successful and have positive effects on trade and other economic  activities.    Asked whether there are new instructions on transporting  national and hard currencies in and out of Iraq, the source said  that the current measures take into account the current  circumstances facing Iraq as a result of the unjust blockade  imposed on it and that the lack of foreign currency has affected  efforts to meet the needs of the local commodity and service  markets.    On the instructions of the Political Command, the Central  Bank of Iraq has tried to ease the pressure on foreign currency  by taking measures to cover basic consumer needs and to increase  the demand for the Iraqi dinar on foreign markets, thus  affecting its exchange rate against foreign currencies in  parallel markets. The following measures were taken:    1. To allow arrivals to Iraq to bring with them the sum of  1,000 Iraqi dinars per person.    2. To allow Iraqis to bring in Iraqi currency from abroad on  condition it is declared on foreign transfer form No. 8 and an  account is opened with this currency at a licensed bank.  Withdrawals from these accounts are not permitted for a  two-year period from the date of deposit. These accounts will  receive the 15 percent interest rate enjoyed by similar deposits.    3. To allow Arab citizens to bring in their capital in Iraqi  dinars for investment purposes in industrial and agricultural  projects designated by the Ministries of Industry, Agriculture,  and Irrigation. Iraqi dinars brought in for this purpose will  be considered as operating capital and expenses for the projects  contracted and without any obligation to transfer the profits.    4. In implementation of President Saddam Husayn's directives  on 13 July 1992, it was decided to allow citizens to make  withdrawals and deposits in their foreign currency bank accounts  without restrictions and without their being asked to declare  the source of these foreign currency funds.    5. In line with Paragragh No. 4 above, it has also been  decided to suspend the provisions on outside transfers that  required banks be contacted for selling purposes and for all  provisions dealing with the possession of foreign currency.    6. Iraqis who have accounts outside Iraq are permitted to  bring these funds into Iraq and open accounts in licensed Iraqi  banks or to use these accounts to import basic foostuffs.    When AL-JUMHURIYAH asked about the measures to combat  inflation, the Central Bank source said that the Iraqi economy  during the period preceding the 30-state aggression against Iraq  had come close to a balanced economy. But, the aggression and  the unjust economic blockade have been a major reason for the  spiralling inflation the Iraqi money market is experiencing.</p>

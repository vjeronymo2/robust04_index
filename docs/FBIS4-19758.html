			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has stated that the Turkish  Cypriot side is in favor of the continuation of the negotiations  and added: Nevertheless, the Turkish Cypriot side is constantly  accused of proposing new ideas. Denktas indicated that the  issue would have been solved a long time ago if the essentials  submitted by the Turkish side in the letters of 20 and 28  January had not been changed.    Denktas met with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's  assistant special representative in Cyprus, once more today.  Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime minister; Ahmet  Atay Rasit, foreign affairs minister and defense minister;  Ministerial Under Secretary Ozer Koray; and presidential  advisers Necati Munir Ertekun and Ergun Olgun participated in  the meetings. During the meeting Gustave Feissel was  accompanied by John Paul Cavanaugh.    In statements he issued prior to and after the meetings,  Denktas said that the difficulties encountered in the  negotiations stem from the changes that were made in the  confidence-building measures and that the Turkish side, who  wants these changes to be rectified, is being accused of  constantly proposing new ideas. Explaining that the issues that  need to be changed -- Maras [Varosha] and the Lefkosa [Nicosia]  International Airport -- are vital issues for the Turkish side,  Denktas said that it is unacceptable that a first-degree  military area like Maras should be demilitarized. Denktas said:  We want satisfaction regarding equality and coexistence.  Denktas said that the compromises to the Turkish side should not  be in word but in action.    Answering reporters' questions after the meeting, Feissel  said that they had discussed the recent week's developments with  Denktas and that they would meet once again on Wednesday.  Feissel said that, together with special representative Joe  Clark, he would hold contacts in Athens and Ankara and that they  would return to Cyprus next week.    In answer to a question, Feissel reiterated the view that an  agreement may be reached by the end of April, but that positive  answers both from Kliridhis and Denktas were needed to achieve  this.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): BA - Pick of Lex / A selection of comments from this week's FT BA's second-quarter figures were so good that, for a moment, the market could almost forget the continuing headache that is USAir. BA's stern cost control was again in evidence and the strong growth in business traffic brought a healthy increase in overall passenger yields. Year on year growth is bound to slow now, if only because the business traffic recovery started in the third quarter of BA's last financial year. But BA still has plenty of momentum behind it. It is the size of the final bill for BA's international expansion that is the worry. Losses from France and Germany were unchanged in the first half as the flag carriers attacked BA's Trojan horses. But it is USAir which is the immediate concern. The Dollars 500m of cost reductions being asked of the unions would barely offset its current losses and, as the negotiations grind on, its low-cost rivals are leaving it further behind. The real fear is not that BA will have to write off the Pounds 260m value of its stake, which it could handle comfortably. It is that USAir will slowly die, threatening the Pounds 70m of benefit BA expects this year, or that BA will feel compelled to pour in more money to keep it alive. The loss of Pounds 8m in preference dividends will be the only pain BA will suffer from USAir in the current year, which should see group profits jump by over 40 per cent to around Pounds 430m. With the shares trading on about 11.5 times prospective earnings, it is hard to argue that they are expensive. But until there is better news from USAir, they are likely to remain grounded.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Russian Congress postpones vote on Gaidar THE Russian Congress of People's Deputies yesterday postponed a vote on whether to reject Mr Yegor Gaidar as prime minister, as the government back-pedalled on a threat to resign if he was turned down. The postponement, officially attributed to the importance of discussing constitutional amendments, was also designed to give political leaders time to find a deal in order to avoid an embarrassing vote against Mr Gaidar, who is at present acting prime minister. Mr Gaidar yesterday disavowed the resignation threat the government's press service issued on Sunday, suggesting negotiation has replaced brinkmanship. The negotiations are focusing on a deal which would lead to some ministers being dropped and a way being found for Mr Gaidar to retain control of economic policy without necessarily staying on as prime minister. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister responsible for privatisation, said that key ministers were determined to resign unless Mr Gaidar continued in the post of acting prime minister or was confirmed as prime minister by the Congress. He said Mr Gaidar's resignation would mean the end of large scale privatisation and even his opponents realised that there was no real alternative to Mr Gaidar. President Boris Yeltsin is keen to keep Mr Gaidar on as the architect of the economic reforms, but is thought reluctant to take on the job of prime minister to let Mr Gaidar get on with reform unhindered. Another option is for a neutral figure to take on the job of prime minister. Although Mr Gaidar's closest reform associates have pledged to sink or swim together some, such as Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, and Mr Peter Aven, the foreign economic relations minister, may yet resign. The main Civic Union opposition alliance leaders have demanded that 'incompetent' ministers should depart and Mr Gaidar should be given a different cabinet post. Mr Chubais said changes in the government should be made 'only on the basis of professional complaints about a minister's work, not because Civic Union wants this or that post.' One of the constitutional amendments adopted by parliament yesterday inserts into Russia's old Soviet-era constitution for the first time the concept of private property. Repeating the wording used in recent Soviet-era legislation, the constitution now promises to protect various forms of property, including private, collective and state property and that belonging to public organisations. Another amendment gives backing to controversial privatisation laws, saying state property should be handled in accordance with these laws as well as those passed by cities and Russia's constituent republics. At the weekend, however, the parliament stopped short of endorsing the unrestricted sale and purchase of land, allowing only the free trade of small garden plots. Bigger pieces of land remain subject to a resale moratorium of five to 10 years.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Redundancy costs push How into Pounds 96,000 loss REDUNDANCY payments and other severance costs brought about by severe trading conditions pushed How Group, the Midlands-based building services contractor, into its first interim pre-tax loss since joining the main market in December 1987. Exceptional costs involved in shedding 200 more workers from its 2,500 staff in the six months to June 30 amounted to Pounds 591,000 (Pounds 226,000), resulting in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 96,000 against a Pounds 507,000 profit last time. Mr Peter How, chairman, said trading conditions in the first half were the worst since the group was formed in 1947. But if construction activity were to pick up following withdrawal from the ERM and the subsequent reduction in interest rates, the group would be among the first to benefit, he said. Mr How said a sharp fall in turnover to Pounds 75.2m from a record Pounds 123m reflected the length and depth of the recession and a determination not to embark upon uneconomic projects. The fall in turnover was largely due to a 50 per cent decline to about Pounds 50m in the engineering services division. Pre-tax losses in the division amounted to Pounds 1.5m against a gain of some Pounds 1m from the maintenance and distribution divisions. Losses per share were 0.35p (earnings 0.51p). The interim dividend is reduced to 0.75p (1p).</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Conservative foot-soldiers threaten to desert - Philip Stephens finds pensioners in Christchurch ready to give the government a by-election drubbing THEY ARE grey or greying. Typically they can rely on a manageable but less than extravagant income from running the local shop or from an occupational pension and the interest on Pounds 10,000 or Pounds 15,000 in the local building society. They are homeowners, thrifty and conservative by instinct. They are also enraged by the performance and policies of Mr John Major's government. In 10 days the retired and near-retired of one of England's Tory heartlands plan to take their revenge in the Christchurch by-election. The prime minister will no doubt brush off defeat as a familiar case of mid-term blues. Governments cannot expect to win by-elections in such febrile times. But Mr Major should beware. The loss of Christchurch would carry with it a much more worrying message for his administration. The government has fallen from favour with one of the electorate's most powerful interest groups. Mr Major's policies - on taxation, welfare spending, deregulation and privatisation - are out of tune with the interests and aspirations of the greying classes. It will take more than a gentle economic upturn to persuade the once-loyal battalions of southern England pensioners to return to the Tory fold. And without them the Conservatives cannot win elections. If the present mood in the sleepy east Dorset constituency provides anything like an accurate snapshot of the eventual outcome, the Conservatives will be trounced on July 29. A once impregnable Tory majority of 23,000 is collapsing. The recession, the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel, the threatened squeeze on health and social security spending, rising crime, rail privatisation and the promised deregulation of Sunday trading have all taken their toll. Things could change. But despite the formidable campaigning talents of Mr Rob Hayward, the Conservative candidate, it is impossible to find anyone in the constituency forecasting they will. When the stalwarts of the local British Legion, Tories all, declare a new-found allegiance to the Liberal Democrats it is hard not to believe that the government's game is up. Christchurch - as journalists covering the by-election are reminded constantly and with some irritation by its younger voters - is not populated entirely by pensioners. Only a third of the 71,000 electorate is above the retirement age. Inland from the bungalows strung like a necklace along the coast, the constituency boasts a burgeoning population of young families. But the elderly and the middle-aged have provided the backbone of Conservative support in an area which has voted for the same party at every election since 1910. Now they are defecting in droves to Mrs Diana Maddock, the sensible, careful and middle-aged Liberal Democrat. Grey power has come of age. The national statistics tell part of the story. Since 1971 the number of voters of pensionable age has risen 16 per cent to 10.6m. They now represent more than one-fifth of the electorate. That proportion will rise inexorably over the next 30 years, reaching about a quarter by 2021. Precise figures for the share-out of their votes are elusive but opinion polling data suggest that nearly half voted Conservative in the 1992 general election. About a third - heavily concentrated among those reliant on the state pension and other welfare benefits - supported Labour. The remainder backed the Liberal Democrats. But the bald statistics underestimate the reliance of the Conservatives on the older population - both in terms of its party organisation and its performance at elections. If Christchurch overstates their influence, the pensioner vote holds disproportionate and increasing sway in the Tory heartland of southern England. The modestly affluent elderly provide the foot-soldiers of local Tory associations. They are the envelope-stuffers, the jam-makers and the fete-organisers of the party. The outcry over the extension of VAT, over talk of new National Health Service charges, over the prospective squeeze on funding for nursing home care and for invalidity benefit has underlined their disillusionment with Mr Major's agenda. A switch from direct to indirect taxation holds little attraction for those on fixed or semi-fixed incomes. Pledges that the poorest pensioners will be protected from higher heating charges cut little ice with those just above income support levels. The threat of cuts in invalidity and other benefits which are not means-tested confirms the impression that the government is determined to penalise the thrifty. Nor are grey voters enthused by deregulation of Sunday trading, privatisation of British Rail and the promised sale of the Post Office. Instead Mr Major's enthusiasm for Thatcherite supply-side economics spells the end of the village post office, the closure of the local grocery and cuts in rural train services. Baroness Thatcher would have understood that. Her successor, it seems, is about to learn it the hard way.</p>

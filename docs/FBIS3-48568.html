Ilagan] </F>   [Text] Members of the government panel negotiating peace  talks with ultra-rightist groups appealed yesterday to the  leaders of the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa  [Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance] (RAM) to return to the  bargaining table for the resumption of the peace negotiations.    Professor Alfredo Tadiar, head of the government peace  panel,  said the resumption of talks with representatives of the RAM led  by Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina cannot be suspended indefinitely  because the country's stability is at stake.    "We call on RAM leaders to go back to the negotiating table.  We hope that the substantive part of the talks would start  soon," he said.    Tadiar explained that talks with RAM leaders were suspended  last 2 December because of differences on procedures.    He said the technical working committee with representatives  of both panels was about to discuss recommendations on 10  talking points submitted by the RAM, such as electoral reforms  and good government.    Former army lieutenant colonel Gregorio Honasan, also a RAM  leader, reportedly complained about the government's failure to  provide the right wing leaders with security, citing the  numerous armed escorts of Nur Misuari, leader of Moro National  Liberation Front (MNLF), during his stay in Mindanao in talks  with government representatives.    Tadiar, however, ruled out any discrimination against the  RAM, adding that it even failed to avail itself of the 30  permits to carry firearms issued to it by the government for  personal security. RAM leaders, he added, only got 12 permits to  carry firearms.    The government panel also said that they remain optimistic  that sincerity on both sides will still prevail despite the  initial problems now affecting the talks.</p>

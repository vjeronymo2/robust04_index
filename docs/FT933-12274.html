			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: Office gossip, how the power brokers work and play - Santa Raymond, a practising architect and interior designer, looks at the offices that three movers and shakers have created / Gary Withers GARY WITHERS' office is an eyrie in the apex of the Imagination building in London's Store Street, over the front door. It has views across to Tottenham Court Road and towards the University of London's Senate House, and a balcony at the back overlooks the airy atrium. The pitched roof is glazed, with light controlled by venetian blinds. Withers's professional life is very varied. One day he might talk to graphic or interior designers and architects, the next he may see writers or film makers about projects ranging from promoting Ford cars to building a castle at EuroDisney. This complexity is reflected in his working space. From the double-height living area a spiral staircase leads up to a working gallery. Here files are piled high, overflowing on to the floor: 'A secretary's nightmare, but all in current use.' Conceptual work, internal meetings, and dictation take place up here. Downstairs is used for more formal meetings, some client presentations, and entertaining. At night the lights - low-voltage spots and up-lighters - can be turned right down to give 'a quite different atmosphere with really moody lighting.' A fire burns within the marble fireplace and there is a Bechstein baby grand. There is a complicated sound system, but no computer: 'I can't stand computers,' says Withers, 'though of course the rest of the building is full of them.' Windows here, as elsewhere in the building, can be opened and heating is surprisingly by night storage heaters: 'Cheaper to install. Cheaper to run.' The furnishings are eclectic, a mixture of ancient and modern, chosen by Withers himself with extraordinary speed. The cool functionalism of chairs by Charles Eames and tables by Eileen Gray is contrasted with ornate antiques, carved and gilded mirror and side tables, marble bases and decorative flambeaux from France. With black and white photographs on the walls (some in-house and some by Mapplethorpe), black sofas (copies of some at Blenheim) and black tables, the only colour is from some original sketches for a 1930s clothes catalogue in gouache and charcoal. There is a nice rhythm between a round timber mirror over the fireplace (carved by Norman Simpson), the circular window (externally the fulcrum of the facade), walnuts in a great glass jar, and some oversize spheres of lavender (by Robert Day). Colour in the rest of the building comes from photographs of projects all over the place. Otherwise, colour is restrained: white walls, beech and chrome elements, dark grey carpets, grey workstations, black files. Architects, Herron Associates, designed the conversion of this building, originally a Victorian school, in close collaboration with Withers. It illustrates perfectly the effect of a good partnership between a dedicated client and talented designer. These are exciting and practical interiors which serve well the needs of the organisation while showing clearly the ethos of this design and communications company: flamboyant, theatrical and yet timeless; simple and direct, underlined with quality.</p>

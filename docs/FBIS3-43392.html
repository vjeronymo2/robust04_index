The newspaper quoted Israeli military sources as saying an  ANC delegation visited Israel 2 weeks ago to gather information  on the army's special program for recruits who fail their  studies.    The delegation reportedly met the head of the education  department in the Israeli army and visited several centers where  army students are trained. The paper says the delegation said  it was facing difficulty in enrolling young blacks with no  education and they hoped to adopt methods being used in Israel.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Argyll joins store price war Argyll Group yesterday became the third of the UK's big three retailers to admit that the trading climate was becoming more difficult in UK food retailing and that it was altering its strategy. The group, which includes the Safeway, Lo-Cost and Presto chains, reported an increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 205.1m to Pounds 217.3m. It warned, however, that trading would be difficult in the second half with increased price competition from Sainsbury and Tesco. Sir Alistair Grant, chairman, said Argyll had adopted a three-point plan. Safeway has launched an 'everyday low pricing' campaign, cutting the prices of about 200 own-label and branded goods. The group has also cut its planned capital spending from Pounds 650m to Pounds 550m and is reviewing its policy on depreciation of land and buildings, which is likely to result in a Pounds 40m profits hit this year. Mr David Webster, deputy chairman, said Safeway had not lost sales to the growing band of discounters such as Aldi, Netto and Kwik Save, but had been affected by a chain reaction. The spread of discounters offering very low prices had forced superstore operators Asda and Gateway to cut their prices to compete, which in turn had forced Sainsbury and Tesco to respond. This, he said, had destabilised the market, but he believed it would eventually regain its equilibrium. In the meantime, the bigger chains were best-placed to withstand the increasing competition. 'Chains with advantages of scale and efficiency, with big own brands, and who are prepared to tough it out, are in a much stronger position than new entrants.' Group sales were up 11 per cent to Pounds 3.15bn (Pounds 2.84bn). Sales at the Safeway chain increased 13 per cent to Pounds 2.55bn with new stores contributing 12.7 points of the increase. With inflation at about 2 per cent for the year, like-for-like sales were down about 1.7 per cent. Operating profits at Safeway increased 21 per cent to Pounds 187.5m (Pounds 155.3m). News from the Presto and Lo-Cost chains was less positive. Turnover increased 3 per cent to Pounds 601m, but operating profit fell 15 per cent to Pounds 23.7m. This was due mainly to a fall in profits at Lo-Cost, which Mr Webster admitted had been hit by competition from chains such as Aldi and Netto. Group earnings were up 6 per cent to 14.1p (13.3p), and the interim dividend is raised to 3.75p (3.55p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai, March 8 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai swap  market is brisk and the foreign exchange rate remains stable,  thanks to the unified floating rate system.    The total trade volume in February amounted to 280 million  yuan, a hefty 35.66 percent rise from the same period last year.    Despite the shift to an interbank forex market from the swap  one, the market posted an average daily trade volume of 16.58  million U.S. dollars within its 17 business days in February  this year, compared with 12.22 million U.S. dollars last year.    The renminbi exchange rate against the U.S. dollar opened on  February 1 at 8.696 yuan and dropped to 8.690 yuan at the close  on February 28.    In the first two months this year, the total trade volume at  the Shanghai market jumped to 750 million U.S. dollars from 440  million U.S. dollars in the same period last year, a surge of 70  percent.    The city is now speeding up the pace of establishing a  unified, standard Chinese interbank forex market to replace the  foreign exchange swap market.</p>

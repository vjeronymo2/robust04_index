			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Books: A little chip of Vermont - FT children's Book of the Month LYDDIE by Katherine Paterson Puffin Paperback Pounds 3.50, 182 pages THIRTEEN-year-old Lyddie Worthen had been queen in all but name of the poor cabin, the straggly fields and the sugar bush up in the hills of Vermont; but when she descends to the plain to begin work as a poorly-paid kitchen help at Cutler's Tavern after her father disappears Out West and her mother, in the grip of a religious obsession, takes herself and the babies off to evangelical Uncle Judah's house, despair seems to stare Lyddie in the face. Why has her mother allowed the family to be split asunder in this way? And what can she, a poor, untutored girl, do to bring it back together again? The answer seems relatively simple: pay off the farm's debts. After working in the tavern's gargantuan kitchens she drifts down to Lowell, Massachusetts, in pursuit of better paid work in the mills; and the account that Maryland novelist Katherine Paterson gives us of factory life in the 1840s in this novel could not be more different from the version provided by Charles Dickens in his American Notes of 1842 - a book that was received with great hostility by his hosts for, among other things, its harsh condemnation of slavery and its advocacy of international copyright. Lyddie earns a good living in the mill, working like a demon to pay off the debts of the farm so that, one day, she might return home. Envious of her friend Betsy's bookishness, she acquires a fine edition of Oliver Twist and teaches herself to read by copying out individual pages and pasting them to her loom. But she also remains a perpetual outsider, a crow among peacocks, in her tight homespun and the pinching, overlarge boots, speaking, as she does, her queer mountain speech. Unfortunately, the very yearning to earn enough money to liberate herself turns her into a different kind of person - tough, miserly, impatient with those weaker and slower than herself. Her mind becomes as calloused as her hands. And then the devastating news arrives: her mother is dead; her brother has found a surrogate family; and the farm has been sold. There is nothing and no one to return to. The farm now exists only in Lyddie's excitable imagination. Katherine Paterson has won many awards for her success in writing about children and teenagers pitting themselves against terrible odds - the struggles of Jess in Bridge To Tarabithia (1977), for example; or the efforts of an older sister in the Newbery Medal winner Jacob Have I Loved (1980) to establish an independent life for herself when she has always lived in the shadow of a younger favourite. But Lyddie is much more than a piece of convincing portraiture. It is both a meticulously researched historical novel that illuminates the conditions of life in an American industrial town of the 1840s, and an exploration of themes that have been written about too seldom in fiction for young people: whether or not work itself is a kind of enslavement; the plea bargaining that must go on between the need to improve one's working conditions and the very human wish not to be taken for a troublemaker; and sexual harassment in the workplace. These are mature themes - but they impinge upon the lives of children too, and Katherine Paterson has worked them into this novel with such skill that they have become an integral part of this excellently-told and well-paced story. American novelists have often demonstrated a rare ability to write about difficult, spunky children - among the best are Vera and Bill Cleaver, SE Hinton, Paula Fox, and even, perhaps, J D Salinger. Katherine Paterson has created something as good as anything that the others might have conceived in the person of the sturdy, plain Lyddie, a little chip of Vermont.</p>

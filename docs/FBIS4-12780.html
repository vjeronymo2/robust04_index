			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, 12 Apr (INA) -- King Husayn of Jordan this  afternoon received Hamid Yusuf Hammadi, [Iraqi] minister of  culture and information and the personal envoy of President  Saddam Husayn. Hammadi conveyed to King Husayn a personal  message from President Saddam Husayn that deals with the  fraternal bilateral relations and the importance of coordinating  stands with Arab and friendly countries to support Iraq's  position to have the unjust embargo lifted.    King Husayn stressed to President Saddam Husayn's personal  envoy Jordan's solidarity with Iraq, especially since Iraq has  proven its compliance with Security Council resolutions, which  means that the Security Council should now implement Paragraph  22 of Security Council Resolution 687 and immediately lift the  Iraq embargo.    The meeting was attended by Royal Court Chief al-Sharif Zayd  Bin-Shakir and the Iraqi ambassador to Jordan.</p>

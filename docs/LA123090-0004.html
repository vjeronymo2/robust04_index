			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: FICTION  </P> <P> LITHUANIA by Joe Ashby Porter (The John Hopkins University Press: $26; 144  pp.). Joe Ashby Porter has an unquestionable ability to turn a phrase and to  create a setting, both of which he does in fine style in this collection of 11  short stories.  </P> <P> His earlier collection, "The Kentucky Stories," was a Pulitzer Prize nominee.  The stories in "Lithuania" (the meaning of the title seems to be lifted from  one of the "Jeopardy" game show's categories) range, geographically, all over  the landscape -- from Tunis to Nashville, from Baltimore to Quebec -- and the  smells, sounds and backgrounds are right on target. However, Porter dangles,  dances around and skips over both plot and character development in a most  maddening way. In the story "Retrieval," the protagonist and a friend go  fishing in a lake on the Tennessee-Kentucky border. The friend rambles on,  touching on the computer business, country music singers and geography, and  concludes: "Country changes, but no invasion'll ever vanquish it. Country  assimilates, know what I mean, Rob?" At which point Rob confesses to the  reader: "I wasn't sure I did so I asked what kind of fish we were likely to  get." The reader, I fear, is in the same boat with the baffled Rob all too  often. Don G. Campbell  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On the afternoon of 27 June, after the provincial  team to report advanced deeds in administrative honesty and  diligence arrived in Jinan, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the  provincial party committee; Li Wenquan, deputy secretary of the  provincial party committee; and Tan Fude, standing committee  member of the provincial party committee and secretary of the  provincial discipline inspection commission, cordially met and  talked with all members of the team.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out in his speech: On the occasion of  commemorating the 73d anniversary of the founding of the CPC, it  is very necessary for the province to organize a team to report  advanced deeds in administrative honesty and diligence  throughout the province. Jiang Chunyun stressed: To  successfully promote administrative honesty and diligence, we  should, on the one hand, launch the anticorruption campaign in a  resolute, in-depth, and sustained manner and severely  investigate and punish a tiny minority of morally degenerate  elements, and should, on the other hand, vigorously summarize  and popularize the advanced deeds of a large number of  individuals and collectives who have been maintaining  administrative honesty and diligence, selflessly dedicating  themselves to the state, and willing to be public servants of  the people in a bid to promote healthy trends and foster a new  atmosphere of socialism.    Jiang Chunyun expressed hope that this team would make good  reports after going to 17 cities and prefectures in order to  affect and educate the vast numbers of party members and cadres.  Jiang Chunyun also expressed hope that press, radio, and  television units would vigorously publicize and report the deeds  of this team to form a social effect so that these advanced  deeds would yield positive results in various professions and  trades.</p>

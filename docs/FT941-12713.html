			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Usinor losses double to FFr5.8bn Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steel group, more than doubled its losses last year to FFr5.8bn (Dollars 970m) according to provisional results announced yesterday by the company. The losses illustrate the weak financial state of some of the companies slated for privatisation by the French government. The announcement coincided with confirmation that Air France suffered a loss of about FFr7.5bn in 1993 and follows an order from the European Commission that the French government freeze capital payments to Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer group. All three companies are on the list of 21 groups selected for privatisation. The downturn at Usinor Sacilor, from FFr2.4bn in 1992, was blamed on a several factors, from the depressed state of demand and prices in the steel industry to the costs of restructuring measures. Mr Francis Mer, chairman, said steel consumption in France had fallen by 13 per cent last year and that the impact of recession on demand and prices had been exacerbated by overcapacity, excess production, and the failure of the EC to restructure its steel industry. The reduction in steel prices prompted sales to fall by about 13 per cent to FFr75.4bn. Mr Mer described 1993 as 'a black year' for the industry. He said Usinor Sacilor had suffered more than many of its competitors because of the relatively sharp decline in demand from French industry and the effects of currency depreciation in several countries, in particular Italy and Spain. Usinor Sacilor said it had taken extraordinary costs of FFr2.2bn relating to the failure last May of Saarstahl, the German steel producer, which was controlled through a holding company by the French group. These costs, however, were offset by gains relating to a change in accounting practices for renovation of its furnaces. Despite the sharp rise in losses, Mr Mer pointed to several encouraging signs. He said that economic recovery in Europe, albeit gradual, and increased demand in the US and Asia, would combine with the group's cost-cutting measures to improve results this year. The group forecast losses would be reduced to about FFr2bn. Debts are also shrinking, to FFr24.4bn from FFr29.5bn in 1992, partly as a result of reduced investments. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, said investments at Air France would also be reduced as part of the its restructuring plans.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER BART SIMPSON T-SHIRTS  </P> <P> This letter is in response to Randy Lewis's article about Bart Simpson and the  T-shirt controversy. ("Let's Give the Kids a Break on the Bart Simpson  T-Shirts, OK?" May 13.)  </P> <P> A break! . . . I realize it's just one thing. By itself it appears to be  perfectly harmless. But added to the TV shows offered today, the drug  availability, the push towards having bigger and better things, the decline in  church attendance, the breakdown of our families (due in part to working moms  -- for whatever reason), the increased divorce rate, single-parent homes and  the shared custody of children, the gradual increase in acceptability of  homosexuality, the increase in violent crime, the increase in child abuse . . .  the list goes on.  </P> <P> My point is, I can't accept one more "little thing" because it is affecting the  moral fiber of the country. It is destroying our lives. Think about the little  things. They eventually grow into big things if you let them.  </P> <P> TERRY J. MCGRAIL  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

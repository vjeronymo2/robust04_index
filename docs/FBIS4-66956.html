			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of communique issued by the Colombian Embassy in </F> Washington on 21 April]    [Text] In response to a deposition made today to the  Subcommittee for Terrorism, Narcotics, and International  Operations of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Colombian  Ambassador to the Washington Gabriel Silva Lujan expressed his  deep concern that these hearings have undermined the war against  drugs. Gabriel Taboada, a drug trafficker sentenced to 12 years  in prison in the United States, testified that drug cartels in  Colombia have "infiltrated all levels of the government, from  the Presidency on down." Taboada said that only one of the  candidates participating in the current electoral campaign is  not corrupt.    Ambassador Silva said: "This convict's accusations are  inadmissible and an insult to the families of thousands of brave  Colombians who have lost their lives in this war against drugs.  The mere use of this so-called witness, a man who has been in a  U.S. prison for the past five years, is a clear shift from the  Congress' process of surveillance and one that will hinder our  capacity to understand the truth of the war against drugs.    "Apparently, the only first-hand knowledge this drug  trafficker has dates back to the mid-eighties, and yet he is  allowed to contest the integrity of a country that is recognized  the world over as a leader in the struggle against drugs.  Today, as on any other day, thousands of Colombian Government  officials, judges, journalists, candidates, policemen, and  soldiers are risking their lives. But this witness was  encouraged to make false statements that question the integrity  of our people and our political system," Ambassador Silva said.    "Colombia, the oldest democracy in Latin America, will  neither remain indifferent nor allow these absurd accusations to  go unanswered. Senator Kerry knew very well that these hearings  were being held during our presidential campaign. During  previous elections three presidential candidates were  assassinated. One of them, Luis Carlos Galan, was assassinated  by hired assassins of Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel, precisely  because Galan had the courage to publicly confront  narcoterrorism. Authorizing a groundless deposition such as  this during a critical election is not only irresponsible  interference in the Colombian electoral process; it will also  serve to erode the strong cooperation between the United States  and Colombia essential to dismantling the drug cartels."    "There is undoubtedly corruption in Colombia, just as there  is in the United States. We are struggling against the most  powerful and merciless criminal organization in history. The  achievements of President Cesar Gaviria's government in the  struggle against corruption have no parallel. The forces of  order and the judicial system have been completely reorganized  in an attempt to fight corruption. The investigations of  officials charged with corruption have been firm and yielded  good results."    "One asks how Senator Kerry would react if the Colombian  Congress were to conduct hearings on the big scandal this week  in Massachusetts, where the mayor of Middlesex County has been  charged with doing favors for and giving special treatment to  important Mafia personalities in the area? Can you imagine the  indignation of the people of Massachusetts if this scandal led  to charges that the state government, from the governor on down,  is corrupt? [no closing quotation mark as published]    The ambassador added: "Senator Kerry can rest assured after  these hearings because his so-called witness repeated some of  the groundless accusations the senator made against Colombia in  his recent article in THE WASHINGTON POST. This is a small  personal victory compared to the huge damage that this mistaken  use of surveillance will do to the real war being waged in my  country."    "A week ago Senator Kerry told Colombian reporters: `I  believe the Colombian people have fought with extraordinary  courage. There is no doubt in my mind about President Gaviria's  and his government's courage and efforts. Many people are  fighting without respite.' If we are to believe the senator,  how could he allow Colombia's image to be so wronged through  this distorted process? [no closing quotation mark as published]</p>

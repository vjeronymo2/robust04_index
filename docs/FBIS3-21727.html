The report was disclosed this weekend in Vienna, Austria.    The government official said that this very day he is  sending  a note requesting "to be told what is the basis of that report,  when it was made, and who was interviewed." Fishman explained  that the government had no knowledge that this study had been  made. "No UN official consulted the police authorities in the  country. The report is irresponsible and unimportant," the  minister signaled.    The report, disclosed by the UN Inter-American Board on Drug  Control which is headquartered in Vienna, on a study conducted  in the middle of last year, highlights the "evident" lack of  coordination among the police institutions as being among the  problems Costa Rica suffers in this field.    Rafael Angel Guillen, director of the Judicial Investigation  Agency, also denied the lack of coordination among police  institutions. Meanwhile Guillen highlighted the permanent  struggle being waged to prevent his country from becoming a  bridge for drug trafficking activities from South America to the  United States.    The UN report indicates that marijuana cultivation in  isolated areas of Costa Rica has increased despite police  efforts while it assures that Costa Rica is becoming  increasingly a bridge for drug trafficking to the United States  and Europe. "In the past two years (marijuana abuse) has  doubled, while cocaine abuse has tripled," adds the report  disclosed in Vienna. It also criticizes the "excessive" and  incorrect use of lesser hypnotics and tranquilizers that  constitute a real problem.</p>

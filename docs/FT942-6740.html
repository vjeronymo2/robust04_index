			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: CPL rises 30% to Pounds 1.44m CPL, the fragrance and flavour manufacturing company that is coming to the market, yesterday published its pathfinder prospectus and reported a 30 per cent increase in profits for the year to end March. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.44m on turnover of Pounds 17.3m (Pounds 14.7m). The company, which claims its products are used as ingredients in products found in most homes, is aiming to raise up to Pounds 5m net of expenses through a placing with institutions. It is expecting a market capitalisation of up to Pounds 20m. The family of Mr Terry Pickthall, chairman and founder, owns 57 per cent of the company, and is expected to retain around 40 per cent after the listing. The pathfinder shows that the directors expect to invest at least Pounds 2m of the proceeds in a project to develop a manufacturing plant to produce aroma chemicals. The acquisition is conditional on the listing. The balance of the proceeds will be used for working capital. The company owns two manufacturing sites in the UK, together with one in Hong Kong and one in India. Customers include many multinational and well-known national companies in more than 80 countries. Overseas sales account for 57 per cent of turnover. Impact day is expected towards the end of June. Credit Lyonnais is sponsor to the issue.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD SERIES;  </P> <P> OAKLAND ATHLETICS VS. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS;  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> FANS IN SECTION 53, THE MEMORIES VIVID, RETURN TO CANDLESTICK  </P> <P> The attitude of the fans in section 53 of Candlestick Park's upper deck Friday  night seemed best expressed by Stuart Graham of Foster City.  </P> <P> "This was almost like making a pilgrimage," Graham said. "There was the feeling  of having to come back."  </P> <P> Section 53 is in right-center field at Candlestick. The game is nothing more  than a blip on a radar screen.  </P> <P> On the night of Oct. 17, the night that Game 3 of the World Series was  postponed by the earthquake that rocked the Bay Area, fans in Section 53  thought their section might disappear entirely.  </P> <P> Concrete fell from the overhang. Cracks opened in the stairs and along the  expansion joints. Railings that run down the middle of the stairs loosened.  </P> <P> No other Candlestick area was more severely damaged.  </P> <P> "Everything did what it was designed to do, but they didn't tell us that  beforehand," Joe Eichbaum of Concord said Friday night as he returned to his  seat in Row 8 of Section 53. "I was scared to death. I expected to end up in my  seat on the playing field."  </P> <P> Was Eichbaum apprehensive about returning to Candlestick for the long-delayed  Game 3?  </P> <P> "In the first five days after the quake I wouldn't have come back," he said.  "Then I settled down and realized that if you fall off a horse, you've got to  get back on. If I didn't come back tonight, I never would have come back."  </P> <P> The memories remain vivid, however.  </P> <P> "There were chunks of concrete falling up here," he said. "It was a miracle no  one was hit. I thought for sure there'd be a stampede like you see at those  European soccer games. The way the crowd stayed calm was the biggest miracle of  all."  </P> <P> Tim Causey of San Francisco was back in Row 15 with his mother, Phyllis.  </P> <P> Both said they never thought twice about returning.  </P> <P> "I work for the city, so I have to say I feel safe about it," Causey said,  alluding to the structural inspections of Candlestick.  </P> <P> "But it was pretty scary watching the roof shift and that area along the joint  get farther and farther apart," he said. "The light towers looked as if they  were in a hurricane.  </P> <P> "A lot of people did start to run, but then a couple slipped on the stairs and  I think everyone realized we were too high to go at that pace.  </P> <P> "I worked 12 hours overtime, pushing electric trolleys off the streets that  night, and felt fortunate doing it since I couldn't have slept. I mean, I told  everybody at work that I was lucky to be alive. Another five seconds of rolling  and I don't think that overhang would have stayed up."  </P> <P> Ray Keller of Belmont displayed snapshots he had taken of the damage that night  and compared them to the repairs.  </P> <P> "I kept watching those panels (along the expansion joint in the overhang)  separate and wondering what they knew about earthquake construction in 1960,"  he said.  </P> <P> "Here, look at this. I took this picture of a guy singing 'We Will Rock You'  when the shaking finally stopped."  </P> <P> Said Graham: "It's pretty spooky being back. I was sitting here with a hot dog  and Coke when pieces of concrete started falling in them, so I ran into the  tunnel. Lost the Coke but saved the hot dog."  </P> <P> Ken Israel, a high school track coach from Stockton, returned with his son,  Greg. The spirit of the World Series brought them back, Israel said.  </P> <P> "Face it, there are no guarantees," he said. "If the epicenter is here the next  time, this sucker is coming down. It's something you can't worry about.  </P> <P> "I mean, it's great to be part of the excitement."  </P> <P> As if there had not been any on the night of Oct. 17?  </P> <P> "Greg and I had been to Disneyland about a month earlier and gone on that new  ride (Splash Mountain)," Israel said. "We walked out of here after the  earthquake and I said to Greg, 'Talk about rides, some amusement park should  buy the one we were just on.' "  </P> <P> They were buckling in in Section 53 again Friday night. Survivors. Happy to be  back. Happy the Series was resuming.  </P> <P> "Absolutely," Joe Eichbaum said. "Life goes on. The World Series is an integral  part of society. This is what makes America great."  </P> <P> Yes, the side effects of long-term cortisone usage are sad indeed. Listen to  Don Robinson, tonight's scheduled starting pitcher for the San Francisco  Giants:  </P> <P> "I've probably had between 150 and 200 cortisone shots throughout my career.  All over. My toe, my ankle, my groin, my hamstring, a majority of them in my  shoulder, my elbow, my back, my neck, my lower stomach. You name it, I've had  it there.  </P> <P> "I'm not really worried (about the effects). In this game, if you don't go out  there, you don't get paid. If you don't perform, you're not going to get a  contract. (The team) doesn't care if you're healthy or not -- they just want  you to go out there and win."  </P> <P> And this type of thinking doesn't bother Robinson?  </P> <P> "No," he said. "I've already been told that I'm going to have arthritis in my  knees and my shoulders. Maybe when I'm old, I'll be watching all this (confined  to) a chair.  </P> <P> "But if I make enough money, I'm not going to have to worry about it."  </P> <P> Sports medicine has yet to devise a drug that satisfactorily treats a sprained  perspective.  </P> <P> Friday's pregame activities included a Candlestick Park sing-a-long to the  lyrics of "San Francisco," a moment of silence at 5:04 p.m. -- the exact time  the Oct. 17 earthquake hit the Bay Area -- and a first-pitch ceremony that  featured local policemen, firemen and others who participated in the post-quake  recovery effort.  </P> <P> "Poignant" was how Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent described the pregame  agenda. "A real contrast to the game. What follows is what we all know --  baseball. That's the great thing about baseball. It's predictable."  </P> <P> And, according to Vincent, baseball is "probably as resilient an institution as  there is in America. Baseball, of all American things, should carry on. It's  always carried on -- and this is a good example of it. Baseball has to make a  determined effort to finish what it set out to do."  </P> <P> Vincent also said he was gladdened by a newspaper poll that showed a majority  of Californians in favor of the resumption of the World Series in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> "For the town itself, for economic reasons alone, it was important that the  World Series go on," Vincent said. "San Francisco depends heavily on tourism,  and it's important to show the whole country that San Francisco is not on its  knees.  </P> <P> "The city tonight will make a very important statement. And that is, 'It's all  right.' "  </P> <P> Times staff writer Mike Penner contributed to this story.  </P></p>

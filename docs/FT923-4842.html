			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Arts: An Ancient Triptych - Edinburgh International Festival TO anyone averse to good acting, intelligent theatre and classical culture, I commend Andrei Serban's An Ancient Trilogy. This hammy and phoney mumbo-jumbo, out at the Corn Exchange, is proving one of this Edinburgh Festival's bigger hits. The performers are the National Theatre of Bucharest from Romania. Serban, a director internationally celebrated for his opera and theatre work, returned to his native Romania as General Manager of this troupe in 1990. He has assembled three plots from ancient Greek drama - Medea, The Trojan Women and Electra, each of which he first tackled for Western troupes in the 1970s. (These may be a triptych but they certainly are no trilogy.) The texts, said to be 'performed in ancient Greek', are a mish-mash. Medea, for example, includes extensive Latin (via Seneca's play); and the Greek texts are so mauled that it is not until Electra that you hear any of the iambic pentameters that are, as with Shakespeare, the basic metres of the original dramas. The tight formal structure of Greek theatre has been jettisoned. That would be fine if Serban's version was of serious stature. But he has reduced each plot to its most obvious ingredients, has removed all the psychological insights and dramatic tension that make the original plays remarkable, and has ladled cheap multiculturalism over the whole affair (little bits of Aztec and Indian manners, lots of Kabuki intonation). Worse, he has encouraged his Romanian cast to deliver crude, exaggerated, unspontaneous and fake-intense performances. Here is how to act in this kind of show. In leading roles you either stare wide-eyed non-stop (this means you are in extremis) or hold your jaw up parallel to the floor (this means you are bloody but unbowed). You snarl, you wail, you blink real tears, you have a whale of a time. You produce your voice in strained, chesty tones, sometimes quiet but usually loud. You avoid naturalism, or sincerity, or restraint, like the plague. If a single actor behaved like this, everyone would recognise it as ham, worse than the worst of Joan Crawford. When a whole company carries on this way, though, it becomes a 'style' and people fall for it. These Romanians have the added cachet of coming from a former iron curtain country, and therefore of being martyrs and heroes. They were, of course, rapturously cheered. Most popular of the three is The Women of Troy - which, with its horrors-of-victory theme, is always a good show for the best kind of Amnesty International sentiments. It is an easy play in which to create big sensations, and Serban does so full-throttle. The first half takes place on three sides of the audience, and sometimes in the middle. High up above us, Cassandra (bare midriff) foretells disaster; Astyanax is caught and led to destruction; his mother Andromache hurls herself to her death. The bitch Helen is stripped, raped, tortured and killed. But the play's real tension and serious poignancy of utterance are ignored. The audience can sit during the second half to watch Polyxena be sacrificed, and Hecuba and the other women be led off to slavery: much ritual moan-groan-drone chanting. A great drama is reduced to Wimmin of Troy. In Electra, Serban resorts to more spurious sensationalism (for example, a 9-foot snake). He makes rubbish connections between the plays. Clytemnestra, for example, ends in the same position as Medea did. The fact that this means nothing is of no consequence here. It is merely meant to seem 'mythic'. It makes a big effect. It wins a big hand. This is Theatre of Quick Sensation. Leave your brains and hearts outside. Continues at the Corn Exchange, Edinburgh, until September 5</p>

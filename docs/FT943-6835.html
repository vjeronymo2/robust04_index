			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Finnish purchase lifts Life Sciences Life Sciences International, the laboratory equipment company, yesterday announced a 28 per cent increase in first half profits after enjoying contributions from new acquisitions and improved European distribution. Input from Labsystems, the Finnish pipette maker acquired for Pounds 33.5m last year, helped lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 13.2m for the six months to June 30, on turnover ahead 31 per cent at Pounds 86.8m (Pounds 66.2m). Of the increased profit, almost half was due to the new subsidiary. 'Labsystems has been very important to us,' said Sir Christopher Bland, chairman. 'It has strengthened our presence in Europe and given us access to new markets in China and Japan.' The subsidiary's buoyant performance underpinned trading profits of Pounds 14m (Pounds 10.2m), and helped offset subdued conditions in key markets such as North America, France and the UK. Nevertheless, the group said it managed to overcome weak demand by building market share 'through the exertions' of its direct sales force. The shares closed up 8p at 153p, some 43 per cent ahead of the year's low of 107p. Sir Christopher, formerly chairman of London Weekend Television, claimed partial responsibility for the market's renewed enthusiasm. 'When the shares dipped, I doubled my holding to some 2m shares. It restored confidence and cheered people up a bit.' He also said the group hoped to reduce gearing from 71 per cent - equivalent to borrowing of Pounds 28m - to less than 60 per cent by the year end. Borrowings increased following the purchase of Labsystems and the Pounds 15.9m acquisition of Hybaid, the molecular biology company, in June. The large proportion of high margin products, meanwhile, helped cash generation reach 82 per cent of trading profit. Earnings per share rose from 4.3p to 5p, on a fully diluted basis. An interim dividend of 1.6p (1.4p) is declared, with a scrip alternative for the fifth successive year. COMMENT Having given up the helm at LWT, Sir Christopher has been able to devote more time to Life Sciences. It shows. The group has bounced back from disappointing full year figures thanks to better housekeeping and profits from Labsystems, which has proved a very shrewd acquisition. However, some hurdles remain before it achieves the kind of growth to push the shares back to January's 171p high. It must pursue greater market share in the UK and win sizeable orders from the US government's research funding budget. If it achieves those two goals, full year profits could exceed Pounds 28m. On a forward multiple approaching 14, the shares are worth considering as a long-term investment.</p>

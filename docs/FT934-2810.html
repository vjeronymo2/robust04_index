			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Economic factors lift metals London Metal Exchange markets put in their most impressive ensemble performance for months as price rises ranged this week from tin's 3.1 per cent to nickel's 9.3 per cent. Outstanding in the early action was nickel, which was boosted by a report, later denied, of a strike at Norilsk, the Russian smelting company that produces the equivalent of nearly 40 per cent of western requirements. But as the run continued it was aluminium that took over the leading role, breaking down successive technical barriers. Performing creditably throughout was lead, which, almost alone among the LME contracts, was principally supported by fundamental factors - continuing supply tightness in concentrates and buoyant demand from car battery makers as the northern winter deepened. For the rest dealers attributed the more bullish sentiment to general economic factors, particularly improving US indicators, and the widely-held belief that the markets had already seen the low points of their recent downtrends. The cautious optimism thus engendered was the more readily translated into positive action, the dealers explained, thanks to the current cheapness of credit. 'For example,' said London trade house GNI, in one of its daily market reports, 'to fund a nickel position with a stop (stop-loss selling order) below Dollars 4,000 (a tonne - the recent LME low) will accrue just Dollars 35 a tonne in funding costs for a year, low for a market where historically prices have shot up to Dollars 20,000 in the not so distant past.' Similar considerations were thought to have influenced the buyers who drove the silver price back above Dollars 5 a troy ounce this week. Gold was towed higher in silver's wake, in spite of its status as an inflation hedge. Platinum, although now firmly established as an industrial metal, could not match silver's strength, presumably because it is heavily dependent on demand from Japan, where the recession is still deepening. Dealers said silver was continuing to attract keen interest from US investment funds as hopes of a further weaking of inflationary pressure were encouraged by a renewed slide in oil prices. A tentative rally in oil prices was halted in mid-week after the market was warned not to look to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries for a 'miracle solution' to the oversupply that was weighing down the market. Mr Abdullah al-Attiyah of Qatar, the cartel's president, also suggested that it was time for non-Opec exporters to shoulder some of the burden of supporting oil prices. Mr al - Attiyah's remarks, made after informal talks in Damascus with other Opec ministers, including Mr Hisham Nazer of Saudi Arabia, the biggest exporter, appeared to have extinguished any lingering hopes that Opec producers might yet rally round to bolster prices this winter by cutting the cartel's 24.52m-barrels-a-day production ceiling. The ceiling, set in September, was left unchanged after last month's ministerial meeting, precipitating the latest decline in prices to five-year lows. At the London Commodity Exchange cocoa prices were held steady until yesterday, in spite of slack demand, by concern about the situation in the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer, following the death of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny.  ----------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------- Aluminium         +2,150  to  2,399,450 Aluminium alloy     -120  to  48,680 Copper              -900  to  589,950 Lead              +1,050  to  299,000 Nickel              -192  to  120,240 Zinc              +3,925  to  874,500 Tin                  -90  to  10,035  -----------------------------------------</p>

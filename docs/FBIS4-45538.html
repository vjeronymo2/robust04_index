			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 22 Jun (EFE) -- The top 14 executives of  Banco de los Andes, including its chairman, Rear Admiral  Guillermo Duenas (retired), and its attorney [procurador],  Chilean Gonzalo Huidobro, were arrested for alleged ties to the  "laundering" of properties from drug trafficking. The two were  jailed a few hours ago, the local news media have reported.    Duenas, owner and chairman of the bank board of directors,  is  allegedly linked to the "laundering" of properties of more than  20 members of the Reyes family, Pichincha Police Superintendent  Boanerges Villagomez confirmed today.    According to the police, the so-called group "Three Magi"  [Los Tres Reyes Magos], headed by wealthy businessman Victor  Hugo Reyes, who is under arrest, was the only organization with  the characteristics of a "cartel" in Ecuador and was dismantled  two years ago. The Reyes family has been facing drug  trafficking charges since then.    At least a dozen people, including certain retired officers  and executives of a local airline, have been charged with these  offenses.    According to Ecuadoran law, any offense related to  trafficking or "laundering" of money obtained through the  illicit drug trade brings with it imprisonment for the accused  until found innocent.    The charges against Duenas are based on a report by a  special  congressional commission, the police, and the Bank  Superintendency, which also ordered the imprisonment of Huidobro.    Duenas was arrested a few hours ago in the main building of  his bank in Quito during a discreet operation that involved  uniformed and plainclothes policemen. In a statement from the  Provisional Detention Center, Duenas said that his arrest "is  illegal and unjustifiable" and that he will give fuller details  in the coming hours.    Bank Superintendent Ricardo Munoz has asked the bank's  170,000 customers to remain calm, because "neither the bank's  solvency nor immediate liquidity is adversely affected by the  arrests." Banco de los Andes has $72.5 million in deposits and a  portfolio estimated at more than $85 million. "The  investigations," he said, "are directed at events that occurred  from 1989 to 1990, and so the bank's current status is not at  risk." He added "there should not be a run on the country's  banks, because the Ecuadoran financial system is solid and  handled with great professionalism and seriousness."    According to Munoz, Rear Admiral Duenas had charged  investigations were not conducted by order of Congress but,  rather, based on exigencies of the U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration and the U.S. Embassy. News reports have stated  Duenas also owns at least 52 companies in different sectors,  magazines, television production companies, advertising  agencies, and shares in several Ecuadoran newspapers.</p>

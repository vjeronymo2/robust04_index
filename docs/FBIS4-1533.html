			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Zhongde (0491 1813 1795): "Study Deng Xiaoping's </F> Theory on Socialist Literature and Art With Chinese  Characteristics, Use it To Guide Our Brand-New Practice of  Promoting the Cause of Chinese Socialist Literature and Art"]    [Text] Theory is the product of an era. An extraordinary  era creates extraordinary theory. If we say that Marxism is the  proletarian scientific theory of the era of free capitalism,  Leninism is the proletarian revolutionary theory of the era of  monopoly capitalism, and Mao Zedong Thought is the  crystallization of collective wisdom of the CPC during the era  of China's new democratic revolution and socialist revolution,  then Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is present-day Chinese Marxism with which our  party leads the people of all nationalities in our country in  bringing order out of chaos and entering the new period of  socialist modernization. Therefore, as part and parcel of the  whole theory, Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist literature and  art surely has the distinctive spirit of our times.    Comrade Jiang Zemin said: "Combining the basic tenets of  Marxism with the realities in China and the characteristics of  our times, by inheriting and developing Mao Zedong Thought,  concentrating the wisdom of the whole party and people  throughout the nation with the great courage to chart a path to  socialist construction and open a new realm of Marxism, Comrade  Deng Xiaoping creatively put forth the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics." Just as Comrade Jiang  Zemin said, after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, while dialectically inheriting and developing  Mao Zedong's thinking on literature and art, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping opened new ground on various aspects of endeavor in the  light of the many new developments and problems facing writers  and artists in the new period and achieved major  accomplishments, thus forming his own theory on literature and  art with Chinese characteristics. A careful and systematic  study of the achievements will enable us to clearly see that  Deng Xiaoping's theory on literature and art with Chinese  characteristics has a clear-cut characteristic of our times and  a vigorous creative spirit.    1. The theory has provided a new method of leading  literature and art. After the proletariat has seized  political power, as a ruling party, how should the Communist  Party exercise leadership over the ideological realm as a whole,  including literature and art? This is a problem facing not only  our socialist country. In this regard, we have both positive  and negative examples. Naturally, it was necessary to impose  strict control over the ideological realm when China's newly  born people's regime was not yet consolidated, and even to  exercise necessary control under certain historical conditions.  However, when class struggle ceased to be the principal  contradiction of the Chinese society and socialist modernization  has increasingly become its central task, what method should the  party adopt in leading literature and art work?    After correctly analyzing numerous theoretical and practical  issues, such as the nature of socialism in China, the current  stage of socialism in China, and its main contradiction and  fundamental task, and basing himself on the laws governing  literature and art, Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forth the correct  idea that the party should adopt in leading literature and art  work and gave a practical Marxist reply. He said: "Leadership  does not mean handing out administrative orders and demanding  literature and art serve immediate, short-range political goals.  It means understanding the special characteristics of  literature and art and the laws of their development and  creating conditions for them to flourish. That is, it means  creating conditions that help writers and artists improve their  skills." Proceeding from acquiring a correct understanding of  the speciality of literature and art creation, he stressed that  party leadership over literature and art did not mean wanton  imposition of administrative interference. He said: "In the  production of literature and art, which involves complex mental  labor, it is essential that writers and artists follow their own  creative spirit. What subjects they should choose for their  creative work and how they should deal with those subjects are  questions that writers and artists themselves must examine and  gradually solve through practice. There should be no arbitrary  meddling in this process." Therefore, he pointed out  particularly sharply: "The bureaucratic style of work must be  dropped. There must be no more issuing of administrative orders  regarding the creation and criticism of literature and art. To  think such a practice upholds party leadership can only produce  results opposite those intended."    Here we must clearly point out: These methods advocated by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping do not mean weakening party leadership  over literature and art work. On the contrary, they mean  further strengthening party leadership by improving the way the  party leads literature and art work. Particularly in view of  the errors made in ideological education and the unchecked  spread of bourgeois liberalization during the first decade of  reform and opening up to the outside world, he emphatically  pointed out: "Vigorous efforts should be made to strengthen  party leadership over the ideological front." "Principal  leaders of the party committees at all levels must attach  importance to the developments, problems, and work of the whole  ideological front, including theoretical and literature and art  circles." He firmly believed: "So long as our party really  strengthens Marxist leadership, firmly overcomes weakness and  laxity as well as liberalism, and conscientiously conducts  active ideological struggle, the abovementioned problems on the  ideological front can be solved, and it will not be difficult to  solve them."    In this new situation and in accordance with the numerous  correct methods put forth by Comrade Deng Xiaoping for the party  to lead literature and art work, to better and more effectively  uphold party leadership over literature and art in political  principle and orientation and necessary organization, party  leading organs must earnestly change the way they operate, pay  keen attention to orientation, total quantity, structure, and  efficiency, and further realize the party's macroregulation and  control, as well as correct guidance of literature and art work.    2. The theory has expounded the new connotations of  the literature and art standards. Practice is the sole  criterion for testing the truth, and also the sole criterion for  judging the literature and art works as one of social  ideologies. As far as literature and art works are concerned,  the practice with which to judge them is generally manifested in  a prominent way in two aspects: The society's political  practice and literature and art practice. As such, Comrade Mao  Zedong summarized the criterion for judging whether literature  and art works are right or wrong and whether they are good or  bad into "the political criterion and the artistic criterion."  Meanwhile, the Marxist viewpoint on practice maintains that, as  social practice undergoes a constant change, the political and  artistic criteria with which to judge the right and wrong -- as  well as the superiority and inferiority -- of literature and art  works are also bound to change accordingly.    In terms of the political criterion, when socialist  modernization has become the main tide of China's present-day  social life, Comrade Deng Xiaoping expounded scientifically:  "Socialist modernization is our biggest political issue at  present, because it represents the people's biggest and most  fundamental interests." Therefore, the practice of socialist  modernization has naturally become the biggest and most  fundamental political practice of the people of all  nationalities of present-day China and has correspondingly  become the biggest and most fundamental political criterion for  judging the right and wrong of present-day China's literature  and art works. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "The basic  standard for judging all our work is whether it helps or hinders  our effort to modernize."    In terms of artistic criterion, according to the objective  laws of literature and art creation, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  unified the profound artistic contents and the perfect artistic  form. This highest realm, which literature and art creation  seeks, is the artistic criterion for weighing the superiority  and inferiority of the literature and art works in the new  period. First of all, in terms of artistic contents, Comrade  Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Our socialist writers and artists  should create vivid, inspiring flesh- and-blood characters.  Through them, they should truthfully depict our rich social  life and the inner qualities of our people as shown in their  social relations, and give expression to the trend of historical  development and to the demands of our progressive era. They  should endeavor to educate the people in socialist ideology and  imbue them with the drive and spirit necessary to build national  strength and prosperity." Second, in terms of art forms,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping went on to point out: "All writers and  artists should earnestly study, assimilate, and expand on all  that is best in the literary and artistic techniques of every  land and every age and perfect art forms with the distinctive  features of our nation and our own time." The practice of  literature and art development in the new period has proven: So  long as we judge the superiority and inferiority of literature  and art works using the artistic criterion which perfectly  combines contents and forms as expounded by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping, we can help raise the level of China's literature and  art creation in accordance with objective laws.    3. The theory has entrusted a new task to  literature and art creation. In the final analysis, with  what works should our writers and artists serve the drive to  build socialism with Chinese characteristics? This is a major  topic of discussion which has a bearing on the question of what  mission writers and artists should undertake. On this issue,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Our writers and artists  should try harder to portray and help foster the new socialist  man and achieve greater success in doing so. We must portray  the new features of the pioneers in the modernization drive,  their revolutionary ideals and scientific approach, their lofty  sentiments and creative ability, and their broad and realistic  vision. Through images of this new man, we must stimulate the  enthusiasm of the masses for socialism and inspire their  creative activities, which are of historic significance in the  pursuit of the four modernizations." Here, proceeding from the  overall situation of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, in fact, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly  entrusted to writers and artists the great mission of developing  the theme of the spirit of our times.    Every era and society have their own main tide of historical  development and the spirit which occupies a leading position in  the entire development of ideology and culture. As the dynamic  aesthetic reflection of social life, every state must have its  own main theme [zhu xuan lu 0031 2467 1774] in the literature  and art creation of every era. In discussing the mission of  this era in building socialist spiritual civilization, including  literature and art, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "It is  fundamental to enable the broad masses of people to have  communist ideals, moral integrity, education, and a sense of  discipline. Internationalism and patriotism both belong to the  category of spiritual civilization." Correctly applying the  stand, viewpoint, and method of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Comrade  Jiang Zemin more concretely expounded on this issue. He pointed  out: "Patriotism, socialism, and collectivism must become the  main theme of our society."    The real social life is rich and colorful. The spiritual and  cultural demands of the masses of people are multifaceted and  multileveled. In the light of this reality, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping advocated: "The road before literature and art should  become broader and broader. Guided by the correct principles  for creative work, writers and artists should deal with an even  wider range of themes, increasingly vary their means of  expression, and dare to blaze new trails. We must guard against  or overcome the tendency to be formalistic and abstract, which  produces monotonous, stiff, mechanical, and stereotyped works."  Therefore, in our literature and art creation, including  mainstream works, theme, form, style, and means of expression  must also be diversified, rich, and colorful. To put it another  way, the diversification of theme, form, style, and means of  expression should be encouraged. Only when this dialectical  unity is achieved in both theory and practice can fine works and  performances truly worthy of our great people and era be  produced. What needs pointing out here is that while developing  the main theme, all spiritual products which educate and  enlighten the people and give them entertainment and aesthetic  treats should be welcomed and encouraged.    In a word, developing the main theme, encouraging  diversification, and upholding the unity of the two are the  demands of the era and also the demands of the development laws  of literature and art. The more resounding and clear-cut this  theme of our literature and art, the more able it will become to  effectively embody the "two serves" orientation and the "double  hundred" policy and resist the interference of various  distractions. Through literature and art works "which have  healthy and encouraging contents, particularly eulogizing reform  and opening up and modernization as well and artistic magic,"  writers and artists should fulfill the great mission entrusted  to them by history to develop the theme of the spirit of our  times and promote the flowering of socialist literature and art  creation.    4. The theory has expounded the new standards for  literature and art efficiency. Literature and art, from  the formation to distillation of artistic conception and from  the process of creation to aesthetic enjoyment, show that  ideology is the most fundamental and clear-cut speciality of  literature and art. Of course, after entering circulation, some  literature and art works have the specific characteristics of  both ideology and commercial formation. In the last 10 years,  the socialist cultural market has emerged forcefully and  developed rapidly. Hence, how to correctly understand the  commercial attributes and speciality of most literature and art  products and how to correctly handle the relationship between  the social benefit and economic results of literature and art  products has become a new important question promoting the  flowering of China's literature and art.    In 1983, sternly criticizing the unhealthy phenomenon of  "putting money above everything else," which emerged in the  literature and art circles, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "The  unhealthy trend of `putting money before everything else'" has  also spread in the literature and art circles. From grass-roots  to central performing groups, there are performers giving  performances everywhere without authorization. Quite a few  people made money by publishing works and giving performances  with lowbrow contents and vulgar forms. It is a pity that some  performers and literature and art fighters of the People's  Liberation Army were also involved in such activity." Quite  indignantly, he pointed out: "The tendency of commercializing  spiritual products is also manifested in the other aspects of  spiritual production. Some people who unworthily occupy a place  in literature and art, publishing, and historical relic circles  have simply become merchants, intent on nothing but profit."  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's firm opposition to the erroneous trend  of commercializing spiritual products is in line with the  Marxist basic principle of differentiating spiritual products  from material commodities.    In 1985, in regard to the emergence of bourgeois  liberalization and the tendency of money worship on the  ideological and cultural front, Comrade Deng Xiaoping once again  clearly stated: "Ideological, cultural, educational, and health  departments must take social benefit as the sole standard for  all activities. The enterprises under their jurisdiction must  also take social benefit as the supreme standard." This  standard not only deals with what is of basic importance in the  production of literature and art products, but also has great  significance in guiding the construction of China's socialist  cultural market. In other words, as part and parcel of the  socialist market economy, China's cultural market naturally must  abide by the general laws of the market rule in its development.  However, because the creation of cultural products is a complex  mental exercise, we should not let the market completely decide  their rise or decline or their success or failure; because the  relationship between the long-term development of the cultural  cause and short-term consumption of literature and art products  should be correctly handled, we should not let the utilitarian  [gong li 0501 0448] behavior of the market completely decide  their proportional readjustments; and because the cultural  products entering the cultural markets have the attributes as  both commodity and ideology, we should all the more not let the  commercial gains and loses of the market completely decide which  to choose. These special features of our socialist cultural  market require us to regulate and control the market more  directly and powerfully by using policy, legal, economic, and  administrative means and, in the complicated practice, ensure in  terms of mechanism that "social benefit is put in the first  place and the relationship between the social benefit and  economic results of spiritual products is correctly handled."    5. Theory has charted a new way of building literature  and art. In the great practice of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, continuously probing the new way of  promoting China's socialist literature and art cause is one of  the important tasks facing the drive to strengthening the  building of material and spiritual civilization and also one of  the important contents of Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist  literature and art with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's major achievements in this regard are as follows:    1. Literature and art structural reform is clearly defined.  In 1979, when dealing with the need for qualified people in  large quantities in prospering China's literature and art,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Through improved  ideological and administrative work we should create the  necessary conditions for persons of outstanding talent to emerge  and mature." Later on, from the angle of reform being the  fundamental way out of China's various socialist undertakings,  he emphatically stressed: "I stand for reform. Without reform,  there would be no way out. Decades of experiments have proved  that the old ways were unsuccessful." He went on to say:  "Reform is all-embracing. It includes economic structural  reform, political structural reform, and resulting reforms in  the other aspects of endeavor." With these expositions, in  fact, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly defined: China must carry  out reforms including literature and art structural reform.  Moreover, literature and art structural reform is the effective  way of promoting the development of China's literature and art  cause. In this aspect, on the basis of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the  CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core has provided  correct leadership in light of the development of China's  literature and art cause. The report to the 14th CPC National  Congress clearly stated: "We should actively carry out cultural  structural reform, improve our cultural and economic policies,  and promote the flowering of our socialist culture." In the  "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several Questions  Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic  Structure" which was promulgated not long ago, the party once  again put forth the task of "deepening cultural structural  reform, improving our cultural and economic policies, and  strengthening the management of the cultural market according to  law."    In the new situation of building the socialist market  economic structure, we must acknowledge that to drop old habits  and reform the literature and art structure is inevitable.  However, the change must not be arbitrary, spontaneous, and  unregulated. It must conform to development laws. Therefore,  we must note the internal relationship between literature and  art structural reform and economic structural reform and their  generality in some aspects and fully understand the former's own  laws and speciality. Only when we have a good grasp of this  point can we ensure the sound and smooth progress of literature  and art structural reform. Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forth a  scientific standard for judging the nature and the success or  failure of reform, thus providing a theoretical basis for us to  test the success or failure of literature and art structural  reform. To be specific, we must see if the reform helps bring  the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of writers and  artists into full play, if it helps turn out works and talents,  promotes the flowering of socialist culture, and meet people's  increasing demands for cultural life, and if it helps promote  economic growth and overall social progress.    2. The training of writers and artists is clearly defined.  According to the Marxist viewpoint, man is the most active of  the productive forces. Developing culture, literature, and art  production and prospering China's socialist literature and art  is no exception. This requires training and fostering large  numbers of outstanding socialist writers and artists.  Meanwhile, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always favored "respecting  knowledge and talents." He maintained: "Only when outstanding,  talented writers and artists have come to the fore group by  group can the scientific and cultural levels of the Chinese  nation be raised as a whole." When specifically discussing  literature and art work, he urgently pointed out: "Special  stress must be laid on the training of talented writers and  artists. For a country as big as ours, with a population of  over 900 million, we really have too few who are outstanding.  This is quite out of keeping with the demands of our times."    On the question of improving the political quality of  talented writers and artists, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We  are now building socialism with Chinese characteristics. As the  times and task are different, there is indeed a lot of new  knowledge for us to learn. Therefore, we should strive to  master the basic Marxist theories in the light of new  realities." He also urged "writers and artists to  conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought so as  to enhance their own ability to understand and analyze life and  see through appearances to the essence." He reminded writers  and artists to attach importance to changing their world  outlook. With skill and patience, he said: "In our socialist  society, everyone must remold themselves. Not only must those  whose basic stand has not changed remold themselves, all people  must study, continuously remold themselves, study new problems,  accept new things, conscientiously resist the corrosive  influence of bourgeois ideology, and better shoulder the  glorious and arduous mission of building a modern and powerful  socialist country."    On the question of enhancing the artistic quality of  talented  writers and artists, advocating that writers and artists should  learn from the people in the practice of life, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping pointed out: "The creative life of all progressive  writers and artists is rooted in their intimate ties with the  people. Creativity withers when these ties are forgotten,  neglected, or severed." On the other hand, also advocating that  writers and artists should learn from successful artistic  experience in the practice of art, he pointed out: "We should  draw on and learn all that is progressive and advanced in the  literature, art, and performing arts of old China, and of other  countries as well." From the strategic position that there is  no lack of successors to carry on China's socialist literature  and art cause and with his particular concern about the training  of young writers and artists, he especially pointed out: "Our  young writers and artists are vigorous in perspective and in  them lies the future of our literature and art. We should help  them eagerly and also make strict demands on them, so that they  will not become divorced from life but will make steady progress  both ideologically and in their art."    Placing particular stress on the unity of the contingent of  writers and artists, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We sincerely  hope that our writers and artists will unite more closely and  expand their ranks. Whether professional or amateur, all  socialist and patriotic writers and artists and all those who  support the reunification of the motherland should try harder to  help and learn from each other and to concentrate their energies  on literary and artistic creation, study, and criticism." In a  word, Comrade Deng Xiaoping eagerly hoped that "more and more  comrades in the ranks of writers and artists will become real  engineers of the human soul."    "For a tree to grow tall, one must make its roots firm. For  a river to flow endlessly, one must dredge its fountainhead."  Past events since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee have proven: The completely new practice of  prospering China's literature and art is inseparable from Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, in particular, the literature and art  theoretical guidance contained in it. Therefore, the  fundamental task of our cultural work is to earnestly study and  correctly apply the theory's stand, viewpoint, and method in  unifying our thinking, studying our work, and guiding our  practice.</p>

"Do not abandon us, do not let us die  alone, do not let our struggle end in a vacuum," the EZLN said  in a message released today, Saturday, and sent to the executive  coordinating commission of the Guerrero State Council of Indian  and Peasants Organization.    The communique came in reply to a letter by Guerrero Indian  organizations, which includes representatives from the Amusgo,  Mixtecos, Nahuatls, and Tlapenecos ethnic groups, and was  delivered to the EZLN by its intermediary [Monsignor] Samuel  Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas.    The EZLN called on the Guerrero Indian organizations to  "take  our blood as nourishment, fill your hearts and the hearts of all  good men of this Indian and non-Indian land," but does not  specify the type of support they request. "Brothers, let our  path be the same for all: liberty, democracy, justice," the  Zapatistas added.    Guerrero, located approximately 300 km south of Mexico City,  is one of the states most analysts believe will show evidence of  the EZLN movement. Recently, local police initiated an operation  to search for guerrilla hideouts in this state's mountainous  region.    The last Mexican guerrilla rebellion occurred in Guerrero in  1970 with the Party of the Poor, founded by Lucio Cabanas, a  rebellion subsequently controlled by the Armed Forces.</p>

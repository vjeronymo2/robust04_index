			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 19 Mar (DPA) -- Today, Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria temporarily overcame the ministerial  crisis that arose last night when Labor Minister Luis Fernando  Ramirez, who was proclaimed vice presidential candidate by the  Conservative Party, resigned.    According to the text of a presidential decree issued today  and given to DPA, Gaviria entrusted the ministry to Deputy  Minister Gerardo Hernandez. A labor minister is expected to be  appointed next week. He will regulate decrees for the social  security reform approved by Congress late last year.    The reform was sponsored by Ramirez, who registered today as  presidential candidate Andres Pastrana's ticket partner, and he  immediately announced an ambitious and quick tour of Colombia.  Ramirez was appointed labor minister in July 1992 on behalf of  the New Democratic Force (FND), a conservative group founded by  Pastrana, who announced a campaign and promised a government  with supraparty leanings.</p>

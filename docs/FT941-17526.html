			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Delay on Everton bids explained Professor Tom Cannon, former director of Manchester Business School and a principal figure in one of the two bids to run Everton Football Club, yesterday said that the Cadbury report on corporate governance was one of the main factors delaying a decision on the bids. A choice between the bids was deferred by the club's board at the weekend to another meeting on Friday. Both bids are understood to be worth between Pounds 10m and Pounds 25m, spread over three to five years. Neither would buy majority control, which is likely to remain in the hands of the family of Sir John Moores, the founder of football pools and Littlewoods, who died in September. Prof Cannon said 'Cadbury considerations' had made the board hesitate as it was about to award victory to a consortium headed by Mr Bill Kenwright, the theatrical impresario who is already an Everton director. This followed an eleventh-hour telephone call from Mr Peter Johnson, chairman of the Birkenhead-based Park Food Group and Tranmere Rovers Football Club, offering to bid more. Prof Cannon, a member of the Kenwright consortium, said the two bids were 'virtually' the same in terms of overall commitment. An initial Pounds 7m is needed to clear debts of Pounds 3m and to buy new players, but steady annual investment would be essential to rebuild the club's prospects. The final decision will rest with Everton's shareholders. More than half of the 2,500 shares are owned or controlled by the Moores family. Observer, Page 11</p>

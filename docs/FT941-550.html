			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: High-tech judges - Legal briefs The Lord Chancellor's Department is to provide 300 UK judges with laptop computers over the next three years, in a drive to increase the use of information technology in the courts. The department has placed a Pounds 340,000 order with Siemens Nixdorf for PC notebooks, services, support and training for the judges. They will be issued with PCD-4NC colour notebooks, with portable cut-sheet printers. The computers will be linked so judges can communicate with each other and with court administrators. They will also be able to set up conference facilities and take notes on their computers in court.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Damascus, 17 Jan (SANA) -- The newspaper TISHRIN has  asserted that the summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and  Bill Clinton has revived hopes for peace and shown the road to  stability in the Middle East and the possibility of establishing  genuine, firm, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the region.    In its editorial today, the paper says that establishing a  firm, durable peace in the Middle East does not depend on Syria  alone. Israel must also show a response, after the United States  has pledged to make tireless efforts to settle the Arab-Israeli  conflict in line with the resolutions of international  legitimacy.    The paper asks Israel to make the "difficult decisions" that  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has often spoken about. It  also urges Israel to end aggression and occupation because they  contradict all principles and values of civilized humanity and  because peace and occupation can never coexist.    AL-BA'TH says that the Geneva summit has proven beyond doubt  that President al-Asad cares for Arab rights and truly seeks a  just and comprehensive peace in this region.    In its editorial today, the paper adds that this truly  embodies the constants of an approach and way of thinking that  has never considered relinquishing any rights.    The paper questions Israel's intransigent position at a time  when the Geneva summit has emphasized the achievement of a just  and comprehensive peace, which is now a pressing international  demand for our region.    AL-BA'TH concludes: Now that the Geneva summit is over, eyes  will turn toward what the U.S. Administration will do to fulfill  its commitments, namely, working to achieve genuine peace in the  region based on international resolutions and the land-for-peace  principle.    In its commentary today, AL-THAWRAH says that the Geneva  summit has resuscitated the peace process on the foundations on  which it was originally launched, supported by an  across-the-board Arab and international acknowledgment of  Syria's central, decisive role in the region and in the peace  process.    The paper thinks that the positive, honorable results of the  Geneva summit have revived hopes for achieving a just and  comprehensive peace in line with the resolutions of  international legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle.    AL-THAWRAH asserts that Israel's response to a just and  comprehensive peace and its requirements will herald a new era  in the region.    The paper concludes: It is the moment of truth. Peace and  occupation can not coexist. This is an important result of the  Geneva summit that will turn into concrete reality if Israel  responds to the voice of peace that has again rung out loud from  Geneva.</p>

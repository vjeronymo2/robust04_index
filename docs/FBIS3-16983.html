Armenian authorities which  have control over Nagorno-Karabakh said that the plane crashed  to into mountains due to thick fog. Thirty two people with 9  children among them died. Iran's Embassy in Moscow reports that  the crew of the plane included families of Iran's diplomats.    The press service of the Azerbaijan Defense Ministry told  TURAN that on March 17 at 23.00 p.m. Iran's transport plane  entered Azerbaijan's air space from Georgia and then had to  depart from it in the direction of Armenia after a few minutes.  The pilot lost the course. Though Azeri control services tried  to resume connection with the pilot they couldn't. Soon the  plane was over Karabakh to the west of international air space.    Azeri radar installations followed the flight of Iran's  plane  until 23.30 at which point they lost sight of it. At that time  the plane was near Khankendi (Stepanakert). Military experts  say that the plane immediately disappeared from the radars'  screen which proves that the plane was shot down. However, in  order to draw a final conclusion we have to investigate the  wreckage of the plane. But will Armenian authorities allow the  experts including from the international community to visit the  site of the wreck?    Sources in the President's staff and the Azerbaijan Defense  Ministry opposed Armenian authorities' version. They say that  the weather was fine and the plane flew at average height. They  report that Iran's plane turned to find the right course when  was shot down by Armenian forces which mistook it for an Azeri  plane.    The Ministry for National Security of Azerbaijan confirm  this  version. Yesterday the Azeri Ministry reported that it has a  tape- recording between Khankendi (Stepanakert) and Yerevan  proving that the Azeri plane was shot down at night on March 18.  The leader of the press service of the Ministry of National  Security said that Azerbaijan is ready to present the  tape-recording to any party concerned.</p>

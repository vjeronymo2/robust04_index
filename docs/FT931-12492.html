			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Technology: Technology file SOFTWARE PRODUCT: Hewlett-Packard's two-dimensional ME-10 computer-aided design package for 18 seats.  Three-dimensional Solid Modeller is soon to be introduced. SOFTWARE SUPPLIER: The ME-10 software was developed, installed and integrated with other systems by Cad specialist Cadtek, a third-party value added reseller for Hewlett-Packard.  Cadtek also trained Carleton staff. HARDWARE: Apollo 9000 Model 700 under Unix for Cad, running 18 seats of the software, linked to a Unisys 6000/65 under Unix for commercial and manufacturing systems. OTHER SYSTEMS: Integrated with the Cad software is the Progress database which feeds the manufacturing control system and the Unison integrated financial distribution and manufacturing package from Sam System Services, running on a separate Unisys Unix computer.  The bill of materials is transferred directly from the Cad systems to the commercial system for materials planning.  All four sites use the Cad software, feeding into a central group file, which then feeds Unison. SYSTEMS COST: The Cadtek contract amounted to Pounds 250,000, part of an estimated Pounds 550,000 spent to date on all the systems.  In the Cad field, software is still cheaper than hardware because Cad needs powerful and expensive workstations.</p>

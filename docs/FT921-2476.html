			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Broker warns of 'oil price shock' THE WORLD is storing up an oil price shock for the mid-1990's which could see the price of a barrel shoot up by between 40 and 65 per cent, London stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson Securities said, reports Reuter. 'The longer world oil prices remain under Dollars 20 a barrel, the greater the risk of another oil price shock in the middle of this decade,' Kleinwort said in a report presented at a London seminar for oil industry and financial institution officials. 'We are bound for another oil price shock and could see prices between Dollars 25 and Dollars 30 a barrel,' Kleinwort analyst Mr Mehdi Varzi told delagates at the seminar. Oil prices on the London futures market have barely strayed from the Dollars 18 level for the past month. Today's prices are in real terms the lowest in 18 years and are providing a strong disincentive for upstream investment in exploration, Mr Varzi said. 'Current oil prices are sending the wrong message to the international oil market over the medium and long term,' he added.</p>

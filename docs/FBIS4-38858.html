			<p>BFN     [Text] The increase in Russia's military expenditures from  37 to 55 trillion rubles reflects the Defense Ministry's factual  expenses taking into account its debts accumulated over the last  five months, deputy chairman of the parliamentary committee for  defense, Aleksandr Piskunov said today.    As has already been reported, the Federation Council (the  upper house of the Russian parliament) voted in favor of  increasing the defense expenditures to 55 trillion rubles  Thursday.    "Either we openly admit that the expenditure will be that  high, or we will end the year with a debt of 18 trillion  rubles," Piskunov said in an interview with Interfax.    Piskunov believes that the Defense Ministry should develop a  program for the optimization of its expenses, structure and  personnel in the near future.</p>

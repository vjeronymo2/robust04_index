			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Litton ahead despite sales fall A big cut in interest charges helped Litton Industries, the US defence group, report a 24 per cent increase in net earnings to Dollars 32.1m from continuing operations for its first quarter to October. In the comparable quarter Litton made Dollars 25.9m after tax excluding the contribution from its non-defence businesses, which were spun off to shareholders earlier this year. Earnings per share from continuing operations rose from 55 cents to 68 cents. Litton has a substantial defence electronics business and builds warships. But like other defence contractors, it has been suffering the effects of the global downturn in defence spending. Sales declined by 6 per cent to Dollars 788m, and although the company achieved an improvement in operating margins in its advanced electronics business, total operating profits declined from Dollars 69.6m to Dollars 68.4m. Net interest paid fell from Dollars 9.6m to Dollars 1.3m, resulting from the early extinguishment of high-cost debt in July. Mr John Leonis, chief executive, said Litton's financial position remained strong, and that the company planned to invest in acquisitions related to its aerospace and defence businesses as the fiscal year progressed.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Patten set to urge start on Hong Kong electoral reform Mr Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, is tomorrow expected to recommend to the British government that the colony should go ahead with the first stage of its controversial electoral reform legislation. His advice will follow Chinese accusations that Britain was responsible for what it called the 'failure' of the latest round of talks on the future of Hong Kong. A terse dispatch carried by the official Xinhua news agency said the breakdown had occurred in spite of China's 'best and thorough efforts' to reach agreement. It was Beijing's first official comment on the 17th round of talks, which ended on Saturday in Beijing. Mr Patten and his executive council will meet tomorrow to consider pushing ahead with democracy legislation despite the apparent breakdown. China, which takes over the running of Hong Kong in 1997, has denounced Mr Patten's plans to broaden the franchise for local and Legislative Council (LegCo) elections due in 1994 and 1995. Britain had hoped to reach a first-stage agreement on less contentious issues, such as local government elections due next year. The governor, who described the latest session as 'another sad and disappointing round', said the door remained open for further talks. He said he still hoped it was possible to reach agreement. 'We are not walking away from any negotiating table; what we are doing is walking firmly in the direction of our responsibilities and that we'll continue to do,' Mr Patten said. But negotiations, which began in April, are at an impasse, with both sides claiming they can go no further. Although Britain offered an 18th round, western officials in Beijing say it is ominous that, for the first time, the talks ended without an undertaking to meet again. Mr Patten is likely to face tough questioning when he addresses the Legislative Council on Thursday. Mr Yeung Sum, a leading pro-democracy activist, called on both sides to be more open. 'They should come out and explain to the people of Hong Kong why there isn't another round of talks. Does that mean that the talks have come to a stop or not?' he asked. British officials said Beijing had hardened its position in the past two rounds, after appearing willing to compromise. One Hong Kong official said: 'There is a feeling of irritation bordering on anger about what they did between the 15th and 16th rounds.' This is a reference to Beijing's withdrawal of a compromise which would have allowed the Hong Kong government to legislate some parts of Mr Patten's proposal while leaving others for future talks. During the summer, Britain retreated from Mr Patten's original proposals for Hong Kong's democratic development, but to date the Chinese government has made no commensurate move.

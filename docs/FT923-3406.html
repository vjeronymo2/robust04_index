			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / International Company News: John Labatt to spin off its dairy division JOHN LABATT, the Canadian beer and entertainment group, is spinning off its dairy division into a separate, listed company. Labatt, controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, is also paying a special dividend totalling CDollars 275m (USDollars 225m) or CDollars 3 a share. The dairy business has revenues of about CDollars 2bn a year from operations in the US and Canada. Labatt has withdrawn from numerous food-processing ventures over the past few years, and the creation of a separate dairy company is a further effort to concentrate on its brewing and entertainment interests. Separately, Labatt reported a 13 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings from continuing operations to CDollars 52m, or 55 cents a share, from CDollars 46m or 47 cents. Revenues rose by 12 per cent to CDollars 1.12bn.</p>

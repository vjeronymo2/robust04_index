			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Housing market The strong recovery in the UK economy has barely touched the housing market. The prospect of a turn in the interest rate cycle must raise doubts among householders about whether it ever will. Although a small rise in short-term rates would not much affect the cost of mortgage borrowing, it would damage consumer confidence. Next week's house price figures from the Halifax and Nationwide building societies are unlikely to be encouraging. This is curious. On various affordability indices, houses are 'cheaper' than for many years. Demographics suggest there should also be plenty of eager first-time buyers. But several factors are deadening the market. Real income growth has been dented by tax rises. The rise in long bond yields has already pushed up the costs of fixed-rate mortgages to new borrowers by about 2 1/2 percentage points. More houseowners may have been sprung from the negative equity trap but they still have no equity from which to gear up and climb the housing ladder. Mortgage repossessions have fallen sharply from their peak but are still running at a historically high level. But maybe the real culprit is the government. In 1975 it was generous enough to pay 40 per cent of all mortgage interest payments. Last year that figure had dropped to 10 per cent. That other fuel of house market prices - negative real interest rates - has also been eliminated. Such economic virtue is, of course, commendable. But it has a price.</p>

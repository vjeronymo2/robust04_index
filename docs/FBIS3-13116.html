			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Makovsky] </F>   [Excerpts] Public opinion must be prepared for the possible  dismantling of some settlements, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  told reporters yesterday. But he insisted that the fate of the  settlements is an internal Israeli affair, completely divorced  from the current negotiations with the PLO.    Peres also told foreign correspondents Israel does not have  the money to meet settler demands for compensation in return for  evacuation. [passage omitted]    Peres told reporters that the government does not have the  political power to evacuate Jews from settlements.    He insisted that the government would seek to convince the  public that this needs to be done, but it cannot come as result  of PLO demands.    When asked about the wisdom of having settlements remain,  Peres said removing them would cause a deep schism in the  country. "We wanted to push through an agreement with minimum  opposition. That is one of the reasons why we insisted the  settlements remain where they are. We thought that any  different approach would split the nation beyond recognition,"  he said.    When pressed by reporters on the idea of compensating  settlers who wish to leave, Peres scoffed at the notion.    "They are talking about very large amounts of money," he  said. We aren't forcing them to leave, so why should we pay  compensation? In Sinai, since the government forced them to  leave, there was reason to compensate them. If we start with  compensation, it will be an endless story. I don't think we  have to do it."</p>

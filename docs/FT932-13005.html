			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Where the main thrust of the DTI's new competitive policy will be focused ...: Deregulation THE DTI's deregulation unit operates under the watchful eye of the prime minister. Mr John Major says he hates red tape and, in memorable scenes during last year's Tory party conference, urged Mr Heseltine to don his jungle garb and get rid of it. Day-to-day responsibility has been handed down to Mr Neil Hamilton, consumer affairs minister, but Mr Major demands a progress report every eight weeks. In July he will convene the second Downing Street meeting this year to see if the 'burden on business' is being gradually lifted. But the war on unwanted paper work - carried forward by a deregulation minister in each department - draws only cynical sneers from critics who dismiss it as a cheap bid for headlines. Business, particularly small business, thinks differently, though it remains to be convinced that the government will not simply print two new regulations for every one it scraps. As Mr Heseltine put it: 'Ministers quite like regulations. They are the frame on which political success is often measured.' The latest hunt has yielded 3,500 regulations which are deemed to impinge directly on UK business, all of which have now been entered in the DTI's 'Domesday Book' for early examination. Last month, the department appointed heads to seven 'task forces' of business people, who will spearhead an attack on unnecessary regulations across a broad spectrum of industry, ranging from engineering and construction to transport, pharmaceuticals and financial services. Lord Sainsbury presides over the seven teams, who have six months to do their work and report back. 'It's a blitz, rather than a marathon,' says one DTI official who is involved. The job is not simply one of dismantling obstacles in the way of business - which will not necessarily be easy, given the likely need in some cases for primary legislation. Some regulations will be retained but simplified. The government has since February also insisted that no new regulations can be imposed on UK companies unless the cost to them is spelled out before being put to parliament. Red tape emanating from the European community is also under scrutiny, with 500 small businesses being surveyed to find what they think about the regulations they are expected to obey. Mr Hamilton says he has gone to great lengths to ensure the survey itself will not be a burden.</p>

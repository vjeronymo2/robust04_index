The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) representative  at  the United States, Nasir Al-Qudwah, indicated that talks  scheduled for Washington this week could collapse if the UN  Security Council [UNSC] did not adopt a resolution condemning  the killings and if Israel did not take steps to protect  Palestinians from Jewish settlers in the occupied territories.    The United States, which is in constant contact with Israel,  has agreed to go further than just condemning the assault but  rejected any reference to Jerusalem as an occupied territory or  offering international protection for Palestinians, a PLO  representative said. [passage omitted]    "We believe that it is very unfortunate that the Council  failed to fulfill its responsibility," said al-Qudwah, a nephew  of PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat. "We reached a deadlock."    Asked if the Mideast talks scheduled for this week were  threatened by the failure to agree on resolution, al-Qudwah  responded: "We appreciate the efforts of President Bill Clinton  to save the peace process.    "But to resume the talks and (for) success to be achieved,  certain measures should be taken by the Security Council as the  representative of the international community and by the Israeli  government."    The PLO required a "serious change in policy" from Israel,  which should start disarming settlers, he said.    Also Saturday, UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali sent  a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin proposing that  the United Nations send observers to the occupied territories, a  spokesman for the secretary general said.</p>

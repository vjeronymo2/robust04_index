			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> HIGH COURT REJECTS ABORTION PLEA  </P> <P> The Supreme Court has refused to order the continued federal funding of a  family planning agency that provides abortion services in Third World  countries.  </P> <P> The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected an emergency plea from the  Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which said it faced a cutoff today of  assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development.  </P> <P> The court's action was taken Monday, with only Justice John Paul Stevens voting  to grant the emergency request.  </P> <P> Planned Parenthood had asked Justice Thurgood Marshall to block the funding  cutoff until a formal appeal could be filed. Marshall referred the request to  the full court.  </P> <P> The high court's action does not preclude the possibility the justices will  agree to review the dispute when Planned Parenthood's formal appeal reaches it.  </P></p>

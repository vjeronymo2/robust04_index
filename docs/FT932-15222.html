			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Bank of France faces battle to keep its powers THE Bank of France plays a bigger role in its national economy than any other European central bank. Its 17,000 employees implement monetary policy, regulate commercial banks, compile corporate data, run the payments clearing system, even provide management advice to industry and conduct some private banking. But French politicians will soon decide whether some of the bank's roles should be hived off to a separate authority. Mr Edmond Alphandery, finance minister, has said he will produce a draft statute on the bank's future by the end of this week, which he expects parliament to pass before the summer break. The Maastricht treaty dictates that national central banks must be made independent in the transition to economic and monetary union (Emu), with their board members having 'irrevocable' tenure for at least five years and being forbidden to 'solicit or accept' instructions from outside bodies. The treaty is, however, silent on what other roles independent central banks should have, beyond conducting monetary policy. It is in this grey area that bureaucratic battle has begun between the Bank of France, which naturally wants to move into its new era of independence or autonomy with all its powers intact, and other institutions, notably the influential Tresor department of the finance ministry, which sees merit, not to say self-interest, in slimming down the 'Old Lady' on the Rue de la Vrilliere. The odds are the central bank will keep its present powers. This was indeed the provision in the draft statute produced earlier this year by the UDF party in the ruling conservative coalition, from which Mr Alphandery hails. However, the finance minister has chosen, as the director of his private office, a Tresor official, Mr Christian Noyer, who has openly suggested that the central bank suffers from a potential conflict of interest between its job of controlling liquidity and its role of lender-of-last-resort. Mr Jacques de Larosiere, Bank of France governor, said he saw no reason to remove banks from his supervision. Mr de Larosiere said the split in Germany between a Bundesbank in charge of monetary policy and a Berlin office responsible for supervising banks was more apparent than real, since the latter institution was dependent on the former. The French Association of Banks does not have a formal view on who should best regulate its members. Most banks seem to favour the devil they know intimately (the Bank of France), rather than one they know less well (the Tresor), or not at all (in the case of some new body). One solution, suggested by an adviser to Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, would be to leave day-to-day bank supervision with the Bank of France, with its network of 212 branches and data base on banks and their clients. The same network enables the central bank, its officials claim, to intervene at the first sniff of trouble. They cite the fact that the Bank of France - and the Banking Commission which Mr de Larosiere chairs - stepped in to inspect the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) France in October 1990, and to forbid BCCI taking deposits from French residents in January 1991, months before that banking scandal blew up publicly. By contrast, the Bank of France should perhaps play less of a role in the Banking Regulation Committee, of which Mr de Larosiere is vice-chairman, because of the potential for divided interests. The committee sets rules which the Banking Commission enforces, among which are the level of non-interest bearing reserves which commercial banks must place with the Bank of France. 'But the level of these reserves affects the central bank's profits,' notes the Balladur adviser.</p>

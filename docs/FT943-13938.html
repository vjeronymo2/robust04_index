			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Outdoors: Where have all the shops gone? - . . . gone to flower shows every one. When will they ever learn? Every year, I vow to go to look, not to shop, and I end up lop-sided with bags of plants. Last weekend, the crowds poured into the Hampton Court Flower Show; marvellous rubbish was changing hands in the craft village; wooden trellis was being booked up by the 100 metres; after two hours, most of us thought of joining the stand called Glazed Additions because it matched the look on our faces. Remember that the British like shopping somewhere other than the high street. At horse shows, they want to buy suede and leather; at dog shows, I have seen them buying carpet; at flower shows, they will buy anything in frames or blue and white number-plates to give a French look to the front of the house. Hampton Court strives hard to show flowers under canvas and, this year, the sweet peas, half-hardy perennials and the border plants from Bressingham were up to Chelsea standards. But if anyone thinks that it is the new Chelsea of the future, they are horticulturally impoverished. There were some brave exceptions but the sponsored theme tent for international gardens led to the inevitable attempt to do too much in a too small, publicity-centred space: how could anyone believe that they were being shown the essential art of Italy and its great former garden at La Mortola in a confined space under canvas, even allowing for the awkward fact that its Italian committee of university inheritors are widely agreed to have ruined the style of La Mortola and its English origins anyway? The Royal Horticultural Society has taken the Hampton show under its care after previous confusions in the partnership with Network SouthEast. The nursery exhibits seldom have the scale or combined impact of Chelsea's main tent and the outdoor gardens are on the lower end of Chelsea's very low scale. The supreme distinction of Hampton Court is the scope for shopping. I fear that it may dent Chelsea - but only because it occupies different ground. Once you allow the public to shop on it, they will career downmarket like Gadarene swine. As Gadarene as the best of them, I think I have avoided pigs in a poke. The fact is that after five years of bagging and buying at Hampton Court, my garden wears a new look. It is at this show that I really appreciate the strength of the new Alstro-emerias, which have been steadily produced by Peter Smith, of Chanctonbury Nurseries, Ashington, West Sussex. This weekend sees their lesser relations, the old Peruvian lilies and Ligtu forms, just ending their handsome season of flower. Peter Smith's new varieties will continue for months and some of the best are unarguably hardy. There is no disputing the strength and hardiness of its Little Princess forms, which flower at a height of about a foot, last for weeks and have the exquisite markings which you find on their cousins in florists' shops. Many gardeners rightly hate novelties and mini-plants but I do urge you to try these splendid innovations where you have a sunny bed and a light, open soil. They are extremely easy, although they disappear below ground in late autumn: I doubt if half-hearted gardeners could kill them. Dodging the conservatories and wrought iron, I always head for the conservation tent, where the plants are more unusual and the crowds are less frantic. Here, too, I have struck gold. The best exhibits are backed by the National Conservation of Plants and Gardens Collections, which aims to conserve a wide range of varieties in major families of use to the gardener. This year's exhibit of the new Day Lilies made me wonder whether anyone will conserve most of them in 50 years. Much of the breeding seems to be stuck with the search for ever-hotter colours and smaller stems: the orange-yellow Stella D'Oro has turned out to be a shocker, as many of us verified when walking past the rather dreary plantings in the gardens of Hampton Court Palace itself. However, the pale yellow Giant Moon has real class and I am glad of its cool colour and vigour in the front to middle row of a border. I made positive notes on Michelle Coe, a tall, pale peach, and Chicago Picottee Pride, both of which are in softer colours than many of the newest breaks. The moral of all this study is that we should never risk buying a new Day Lily blind: the strength of colouring can be most misleading. The effort to find the best is worthwhile because these plants really do block out weeds and last for years without attention. I rank them second only to my essential answer to gardening without effort in shade or any difficult soil: the matchless Geranium endressii. Hampton Court has also alerted me to a new trick: the special merit of the new Wageningen variety, the flowers of which are a particularly clear and strong pink. If you have a choice, opt for it first. At Hampton, I feel more in the mood for Ceanothus than at Chelsea, when their season is not far advanced. Specialists allow us to compare a wide range, some of them new from west America or the Antipodes. They are also prepared to discuss the difficult question of hardiness, the fact which rules out most of the best. I return to the strong blue of Concha and also Edinburgh, neither of which is entirely trustworthy in a serious winter. They grow so fast that they are worth a gamble anywhere but I continue to be most thankful for one of the commonest forms. The sky-blue Gloire de Versailles will grow anywhere on well-drained soil. It is at its absolute best in big Hampshire gardens from this weekend onwards, where it stands among old roses as a free shrub in its own right. It picks up the show this weekend when the roses are fading and, after four winters with me, it has shown no serious loss. Each spring, pruning should be light. Impatient gardeners would love it as a filling between slower plants in a new garden wherever there is warmth and shelter. Lastly, the return of an old favourite. Our grandfathers grew lots of the tall, lemon-yellow daisies of Anthemis Wargrave throughout their herbaceous borders, but the mad keen gardeners of the 1970s managed to lose most of the stock. Three years ago, I thought I had found it but it turned out to be the shorter, and more vivid, Anthemis EC Buxton, which has supplanted it in common nurseries. Did no one remember the height and paleness of the true daisies which were upheld in iron plant-hoops in my early years? At Hampton Court, the real Wargrave surfaced - alive and well at Pounds 3 a plant from Rushfields, of Ross Road, Ledbury, Herefordshire. Rushfields is expert at staging displays of the softer colours among border plants and last week it confirmed that Wargrave was still in good supply. I left Hampton Court reunited with this long-lost friend.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- Japan's chief economic  planner Friday [14 January] hinted at a "little" delay in  releasing the government's additional economic stimulus package  originally expected January 20.    "I can't deny the possibility of a little delay," Manae  Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA]  told reporters after the regular morning cabinet meeting.    Her agency is working on the package as instructed by Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for compilation by "mid-January,"  Kubota said.    But she indicated the chances of delay while citing the need  for further discussion among coalition parties and some  uncertainties still remaining over political reform, Hosokawa's  previously stated "top priority" for his administration.    Kubota said there were no questions or comments over the  stimulus measures at the cabinet meeting.    Meanwhile, the Economic Planning Agency chief quoted Bank of  Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno as saying that the recent rally in  Japanese stock prices stems from "bargain-hunting" against  strongly rising overseas stocks.    Mieno was speaking at a meeting of economic ministers held  before the cabinet meeting.    On the dollar-yen exchange rates, Mieno stressed the dollar  has recovered "half" of its losses against the yen since January  last year with the weakening of the yen since December to the  range of 110 to 112 yen to the dollar, Kubota said.    She also quoted Mieno as saying that interest rates have  fallen to record levels, but bank lending has remained sluggish.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Stevan Cordas] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, Feb 1 (TANJUG) -- The offer made by  Slovenia to the Federal Republic of Yugoslav [FRY] to normalize  relations means knocking on an open door, since the FRY had  earlier already recognized Slovenia unilaterally, a move which  was practically rejected since it was not reciprocated. The  statement made by Slovenian Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle that  "the normalization of relations between Belgrade and Ljubljana  was of interest for Slovenia," was interpreted by observers of  Yugoslav-Slovenian relations in Belgrade as an official offer of  Ljubljana to the FRY.    There have not yet been official reactions in the FRY to  Ljubljana's offer, but the offer just as every other offer to  normalize relations made by a former Yugoslav republic, would be  carefully examined in Belgrade. The FRY is working for  re-establishing disrupted links in the former Yugoslavia, ending  the war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina and for a just solution to  the crisis in former Yugoslavia. That is why it is exclusively  the fault of Ljubljana that Belgrade's earlier offer for mutual  recognition had been consigned to oblivion.    One wonders why the Slovenian foreign minister has shown his  cards and made his offer to normalize relations between  Ljubljana and Belgarde at this particular time. It is well  known that out of all the former Yugoslav republics Slovenia has  up to now been the most out-spoken in its attacks on Belgraee in  all international fora, from the U.N. to the CSCE. Demanding  even that the mentioning of Yugoslavia be banned, Ljubljana has  naively expected to improve its reputation in the world, to  approach the european Union and other international factors.    The Slovenians have shown by their offer to normalize  relations with Belgrade that they did not wish to be late in the  process of normalization of relations with the FRY. The  interest to normalize relations with the FRY has undoubtedly  been spurred by the beginning of the normalization of relations  between Belgrade and Zagreb, since Slovenia is having some  serious problems with Croatia. The possible normalization of  relations with the FRY would counterbalance to a great extent  the trouble Slovenians are having with Croats, it is assessed in  Belgrade.    The ball is now in Slovenia's court.</p>

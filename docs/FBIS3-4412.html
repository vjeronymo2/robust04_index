			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shenyang, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Highway  transportation in northeast China's Liaoning Province has  undergone rapid development thanks to the flourishing collective  and private transport sectors as well as increased state input.    Joint efforts of state organs, collectives and individuals  and appropriate competition among them have greatly invigorated  the province's road transportation and provided a firm  foundation for its economic development.    The volume of Liaoning's road transportation last year  reached 700 million tons and the number of passengers served  topped 340 million.    Communications and transport services in the province, as in  the whole country, used to be totally under state control and  were long haunted by such problems as insufficient carrying  capacity and slack organization.    Along with the country's reform of the transportation  system,  collective and individual sectors have begun to play an  increasingly important role in both road construction and  transport services.    A decade ago, the number of trucks and buses for civil use  owned by individuals in Liaoning was 4,279, with only 12  designated to carry passengers.    That figure had grown to 51,600 by the end of last year,  accounting for one-tenth of the province's total and nearly four  times that owned by provincial transportation departments.    In the year 1993, one-fourth of the province's total volume  of goods delivered through road transportation were handled by  individual sectors, which also served half of its 160 million  passengers.    The provincial government has also increased input in  transportation. Last year alone, state investment in highway  construction reached 1.1 billion yuan.</p>

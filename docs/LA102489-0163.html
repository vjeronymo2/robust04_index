			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BHUTTO EXPECTING SECOND CHILD  </P> <P> Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is expecting a second child, probably  early next year, sources close to her family said today.  </P> <P> If still in office -- the opposition announced plans Monday night for a vote of  no-confidence -- she apparently will be the first serving modern head of  government to give birth.  </P> <P> Bhutto, 36, gave birth to a son, Bilawal, on Sept. 21, 1988, eight weeks before  the partial election victory that brought her to power.  </P> <P> She was the first woman to become prime minister of a Muslim country and one of  the youngest heads of government of a major nation. Right-wing Muslim clerics  objected to her nomination, saying it was "un-Islamic" for a woman to govern.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, private organizations, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. One species ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Melicope ovalis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) is located only in Haleakala National Park. One population of another species ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. balloui <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) is also found in this park. Laws relating to national parks prohibit damage or removal of any plants growing in the parks. There are no Federal activities that are known to occur within the present known habitat of these three plant species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered plant species. With respect to the three  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Melicope  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> species listed as endangered by this rule, all prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export such species to/from the United States; transport such species in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale such species in interstate or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to possession such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any such species on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. Section 10 of the Act and 50 CFR 17.62 provide for the issuance of permits under certain circumstances to carry out activities involving endangered plants that are otherwise prohibited by section 9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the policy of the Service (59 FR 34272) to identify to the maximum extent practicable at the time a species is listed those activities that would or would not be likely to constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. Such information is intended to clarify the potential impacts of a species' listing on proposed and ongoing activities within the species' range. Two of the species occur on National Park Service lands. Collection, damage or destruction of these species on Federal lands is prohibited without a Federal endangered species permit. Such activities on non-Federal lands would constitute a violation of section 9 if conducted in knowing violation of Hawaii State law or regulations or in violation of a State criminal trespass law (see Hawaii State Law section below). The Service is not aware of any trade in these species or of any activities currently being conducted by the public that will be affected by this listing and result in a violation of section 9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requests for copies of the regulations concerning listed plants and general inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (503/231&hyph;2063; FAX 503/231&hyph;6243).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Questions regarding whether specific activities will constitute a violation of section 9 should be directed to the Field Supervisor of the Service's Pacific Islands Office (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

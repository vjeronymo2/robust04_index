			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Observer: Back into the cold Investment bankers at leading Eurobond houses await the return of Kari Nars with some trepidation. Finland's head of treasury management has been on a three-year secondment to the EBRD, but is due back at his desk next month. Nicknamed 'Basis-Point Billy', his talent for driving a hard bargain is not easily forgotten. However, Finland was blessed with a triple-A foreign currency credit rating in those days, so syndicate managers had little choice but to suffer his tough market tactics, his curt telephone manner and his endless name-dropping. During his absence, the country has lost one of its three As, and investor appetite for its paper is correspondingly less keen. At the same time, his easy-going deputy, Veikko Kantola, is reckoned to have made a good fist of a difficult job and to have won over syndicate managers by distributing business fairly. Surely Basis Point Billy isn't going to have to reinvent himself as Percentage Point Paul?</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENDING GERRYMANDERING BY POLITICIANS: PROS AND CONS OF PROPOSITIONS 118-119  </P> <P> Anyone who cares about environmental quality should vote No on Tuesday on the  two reapportionment propositions, Propositions 118 and 119.  </P> <P> They are frauds. Cleverly designed, with different criteria for Northern and  Southern California, to produce as many districts as possible that will be held  by friends of the backers (oil companies, chemical and development companies,  partisan political groups), these initiatives are not an honest effort at  even-handedness. They will not keep politics out of reapportionment. But they  will reduce the number of congressional and legislative districts that elect  environmentalist representatives. If passed, they spell more trouble for Planet  Earth, especially in California!  </P> <P> KEN HORNER  </P> <P> Chair, Angeles Chapter  </P> <P> Sierra Club  </P></p>

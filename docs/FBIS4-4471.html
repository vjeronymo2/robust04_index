			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe and Japan's International Trade and Industry  Minister Hiroshi Kumagai agreed Friday to oppose unilateral U.S.  trade retaliation such as that mandated under the revived Super  301 Trade Law, Japanese officials said.    The law requires the U.S. Administration to annually  identify  countries maintaining trade barriers against its exports and to  impose punitive tariffs if bilateral negotiations fail to remove  such barriers.    Juppe, calling on Kumagai at the ministry, expressed hope  that retaliatory rules such as the Super 301 will be abolished  in global trade after member nations of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) sign a final accord this month on the  seven-year-old Uruguay Round of talks held under its auspices.  GATT has called a ministerial conference in Marrakech, Morocco,  from April 12 to 15 to sign the accord.    Juppe also told Kumagai that the Marrakech conference should  focus on trade and the environment, the officials said.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Observer: Aunty George? Who's to be next chairman of the BBC governors? Even though Marmaduke Hussey's term runs until November 1996, there are persistent rumours he will go sooner rather than later. With his vice-chairman, Lord Barnett, standing down at the end of next month, the next chairman could well be among the clutch of new governors to be enshrined shortly. True, judging by how often Bosnian peace envoy Lord Owen's name is bandied about, the government can hardly have overlooked him. But there's a much more obvious candidate - businessman Sir George Russell. Better known as chairman of the Independent Television Commission than head of building products group Marley, he'll probably have time on his hands next year. His term as chairman of the ITC runs out in 18 months or so, and he seems intent on bowing out of Marley. If the government wanted Aunty led by a business type, as opposed to a political has-been, then Russell seems an ideal fit to take on the BBC poisoned chalice. His commercial acumen is not in doubt, and he made a fair stab at sorting out the ministerially created mess over the ITV franchise awards. He is also a former chairman of Independent Television News and deputy chairman of Channel 4. Nor should the fact that he works for the opposition be a problem. Lord Hill of Luton was chairman of the Independent Television Authority before he took over the BBC chair. If Sir George were to be offered the job, it would be good news for Bob Phillis,the current BBC deputy director general. A few years ago Russell helped Phillis become chief executive of ITN.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Devonport workers lobby case to refir Trident submarines Workers from Devonport dockyard lobby Downing Street yesterday in support of the yard's case to refit Trident nuclear submarines. Next week will see a lobby on behalf of the Rosyth dockyard in Scotland to step up the pressure for the Trident re-fitting contract to go there rather than to Devonport. After a meeting with Mr John Major on the issue yesterday afternoon, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, pledged to keep up the Rosyth campaign. An announcement is not expected before next Thursday at the earliest.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Sinn Fein to put blame on London Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, will seek this weekend to blame the British government for lack of progress on the Northern Ireland peace initiative. Officials said yesterday that a 'full debate' was anticipated on the peace process at the party conference, to be held in Dublin, and a definitive Sinn Fein response to the Downing Street declaration could not be ruled out - although it was 'unlikely in current circumstances'. The party's national executive has put forward an emergency motion welcoming the Irish government's approach to the Downing Street declaration and 'its positive and commonsense attitude to the need to provide clarification'. It calls on the British government 'to join the ranks of the persuaders' and reiterates Sinn Fein's demand for British clarification of the peace process. A Sinn Fein official said this would require face-to-face talks and for the British government to say whether it was considering an eventual withdrawal from Northern Ireland. Mr Danny Morrison, a senior IRA prisoner in the Maze prison in Northern Ireland, said that, if the British became 'persuaders' of unionists in the province 'to accept reconciliation with the rest of the Irish people,' this would result in a rethinking of the Republican movement's strategy. Other important issues to be debated at the conference are policy papers on the European Union and the economic effects of a united Ireland.</p>

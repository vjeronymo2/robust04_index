			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 3 SAPA -- African National Congress  Western Cape leader Dr Allan Boesak on Tuesday congratulated his  National Party [NP] counterpart, Mr Hernus Kriel, for the NP's  clear win in the region. Speaking at a press conference, Dr  Boesak said the ANC was determined to give its full co-operation  in the NP- led government of provincial unity. "I do not  believe this is the time for recrimination, threats or grudges,  but for building and working together for all our people.  Whatever work we do will not be for ANC members, but for the  people of the Western Cape."    While the ANC's Western Cape region was disappointed with  the  provincial outcome it rejoiced in the party's national victory.    "I think the ANC has fought a valiant battle...Against  tremendous odds," Dr Boesak said. Conceding a "clear NP win" in  the Western Cape, he said he would again like to congratulate Mr  Kriel for his party's victory. The ANC's defeat could be  attributed to the brief period in which it had to reverse  antagonistic public perceptions; an electorate which voted for  NP leader Mr F. W. de Klerk rather than Mr Kriel; and a  well-honed NP media image.    Dr Boesak said the ANC's commitment to its programme of  reconstruction and development was unchanged and it would work  as hard as it could in the provincial government for the crucial  programme to be implemented. This was not just because no other  parties had a similar plan "but so the NP can see there is no  subsitute for what the ANC is bringing to the people of South  Africa".    He did not believe there would be any tensions between the  ANC and NP if the NP went along with the reconstruction  programme. "But if the NP tries to block it there will be  tensions." Healing the scars left by the NP's racially-tainted  election campaign would be an important long-term focus for the  ANC and the government of provincial unity.    Dr Boesak said he had not detected any signs of an ANC  backlash against the Western Cape result, which by mid-Tuesday  had shown the NP leading the ANC with a 25 per cent margin.  "Especially the people of the Western Cape should not for one  single moment worry about what the ANC is going to do in the  government."</p>

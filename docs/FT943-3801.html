			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (9): Manila Hotel awaits a partner  -The privatisation programme is almost complete The Philippine government will soon be winding down its privatisation programme. Since its start in 1987, sales of 118.5bn pesos (Dollars 4.5bn), have been generated, including nearly 35bn pesos from foreign investors. The biggest of these was the recent sale of 60 per cent of Petron Corporation, the nation's leading oil company. Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Aramco) acquired 40 per cent for 14.7bn pesos in a public bidding, while 20 per cent raised 6.8bn pesos via a public offer of stocks. Eighty-two other government corporations and 314 varying assets have been disposed of, according to latest records. In 1986, the government slated for privatisation 130 corporations, out of 301 in its roster, along with 419 assets (mostly 'non-performing') transferred by government financial institutions - Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and Philippine National Bank (PNB) - to the national government. According to current plans, sales of assets worth 78bn pesos over 1994-96 will complete the privatisation programme. Of this, 45bn pesos is targeted to be earned this year, including the Petron sell-off. Two other big items expected to go on the auction block this year are the state's 51 per cent holdings in National Steel Corporation, at an asking price of 7.5bn pesos, and a bloc of shares in Manila Electric Company (Meralco), the power utility, estimated to be worth 14bn pesos. The government is relying on proceeds from its privatisation programme to help fill its fiscal gap, while new measures are being pursued 'to generate more permanent sources of tax collections.' This year, implementation of the law expanding the value-added tax system was delayed by a suit filed with the Supreme Court by its opponents. Intended to raise additional collections of 8bn pesos this year, the VAT law was originally scheduled to be implemented on July 1. The Supreme Court issued a favourable ruling in late August, which paved the way for its implementation by October 1. For 1995, government sales of smaller holdings in PNB, Meralco and Philippine Airlines (PAL) are targeted to yield 12bn pesos. PAL, the flag-carrier, was offered in a bidding in January 1992 at which a local consortium of major business groups won a 67 per cent interest for some 9.6bn pesos. Another big-ticket item, National Power Corporation (Napocor), which currently owns the bulk of electricity-generating capacity in the country, is being planned also for privatisation, although various details still need to be sorted out. Principally, schemes are being studied to break up the giant corporation into smaller units that will divide its generation and transmission operations. The smaller units should also be within reach of the prospective bidders. Last year, Napocor reported total revenues of 41.79bn pesos, making it the second-largest Philippine corporation in terms of sales, and total assets of 245bn pesos. A jewel in the privatisation programme, the Manila Hotel, is also being offered for sale by the state-employees pension fund which owns it, the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). A public bidding next month will offer 20-30 per cent of the 510-room hotel for a minimum price of 280m pesos. Thereafter, another 20 per cent will be offered to GSIS members and hotel employees, and 5-15 per cent will be made available in a stock public offering. The winner in the bidding will become Manila Hotel's 'strategic partner', and be expected to provide marketing and management expertise and financial support for the institution, which has been experiencing declining revenues. Company officials blamed this on the proliferation of new hotels in Manila, and to its lack of a viable international marketing network. This was the same strategy followed by Philippine National Oil Company, the state energy group, when it launched the privatisation of Petron. After getting a strategic partner through a public bidding, the company went on to make a public offering of shares. Petron's new partner, Saudi Aramco, has promised to assist in the oil company's expansion plans, and to develop it as an exporter of refined petroleum products in the region. Saudi Aramco is the world's largest producer and exporter of crude oil. Petron, as a government corporation, has often been slowed down by cumbersome government procedures on purchases, hirings, and even the opening of new retail outlets. As a majority private company, it may now be able to pursue initiatives without having to go through public biddings or long government audits. However, Petron's privatisation is also in preparation for the eventual deregulation of the local oil industry. Domestic prices of petroleum products are still fixed by the government, although it has set up a fund on which the oil companies may draw when prevailing price ceilings result in losses for them. The government has committed itself to the privatisation programme as part of its key structural reforms. According to officials, the programme not only results in additional revenues for the state, it also enhances the role of the private sector as the engine of economic growth.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Rob Walton takes over at Wal-Mart WAL-MART, the discount chain, yesterday named Mr S. Robson 'Rob' Walton as chairman of America's largest and most influential retailing group in succession to Mr Sam Walton, his father and the founder of the business, who died on Sunday. The 47-year-old new chairman is the eldest of Mr Sam Walton's four children and has been a member of the Wal-Mart board since 1978. The Walton family holds 38 per cent of Wal-Mart'stock. Mr Sam Walton, who died in Little Rock, Arkansas, aged 74, after a long struggle with cancer, had stepped down as chief executive of Wal-Mart in 1988, handing over day-to-day responsibility for running the business to a management team headed by Mr David Glass. Wal-Mart emphasised yesterday that Mr Rob Walton's assumption of the chairmanship would mean no changes in group policy or direction. The company would 'continue to look for operational guidance from its current management team'. Wal-Mart shares moved higher in active trading, and at close of trade on the New York Stock Exchange were up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 52 7/8 . In spite of the company's assurances, there remains some doubts on Wall Street as to whether Wal-Mart can be quite the success it was under Mr Sam Walton, who exerted a charismatic charm over the business right up to his death. There is also concern over Wal-Mart's ability to maintain its extraordinary pace of growth as it pushes into food retailing, and experiments with own-label products, at the same time as it expands geographically and faces sharper competition from other large discount chains such as K-Mart.</p>

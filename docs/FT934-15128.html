			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Polish investors buy cement plant POLAND is to sell one of the country's most modern cement works, in Ozarow, to a group of domestic investors led by the Polish Development Bank (PBR), Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the outgoing privatisation minister, said yesterday. The decision comes in a letter of intent signed yesterday with the state-owned PBR as well as management and unions at the plant. It follows the sale in July of stakes in two Polish plants, which account for a quarter of Poland's cement output, to Cimenteries CBR of Belgium for DM90.4m (Dollars 56.5m). CBR has since sold a 43 per cent share of its equity to Heidelberger Zement, Germany's largest producer of building materials. The Ozarow plant has a 15 per cent share of the market and expects to report a 100bn zlotys (Dollars 5m) net profit on sales of 850bn zlotys, which represents a 30 per cent increase on 1992 sales. It was completed in 1977, along with Gorazdze, one of the two plants sold to CBR.</p>

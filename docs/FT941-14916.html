			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Business and the banks There is always a risk in economic and financial policy that ministers and central bankers will respond to the last crisis but one while ignoring the signs of crises to come. The debate about the relationship between the banks and small business in Britain is a case in point. Bankers can never expect to be popular. But the widespread disillusionment now felt by small business over high bank charges and high-handed behaviour is primarily a reflection of the unusual structure of the last economic cycle. Individual banks and bankers are no doubt at fault - there can be no respectable excuse for charging for the bank manager's time when the client has paid for the banker's lunch. But as the Governor of the Bank of England rightly indicated yesterday, banks are less to blame for the troubles of small business than those responsible for wayward macroeconomic management. In the recession of the early 1980s big business suffered disproportionately because a brutal monetary squeeze was administered chiefly through an overvalued exchange rate. The non-tradeable sector of the economy, in which the majority of small businesses operate, escaped relatively lightly. In the latest recession the squeeze was imparted mainly through a sharp increase in interest rates, which caused nominal house prices to fall for the first time since the second world war. Since most small businesses in Britain are overborrowed and their borrowings are often secured on their owners' homes, this unprecedented double disinflationary shock was devastating. Against such a background it is galling for small business to see banks widening their margins as they seek to restore profitability and bolster capital, especially in the light of the banks' high-profile lending blunders in commercial property and elsewhere. Yet it is important to remember that small business lending is not notably profitable for the banks. As the governor has pointed out, the high street banks have had to provide Pounds 3bn against a small business loan book of Pounds 45bn over the past two-and-a-half years. It is the personal customer, not small business, who has been cross-subsidising the banks' less profitable operations in recent years; and it is the personal customer who has recently been most heavily mugged, as a result of mis-selling by the banks' overenthusiastic army of pensions salesmen. It follows from all this that the first priority in addressing the concerns of small business should be to improve the conduct of monetary policy. The second should be to acknowledge that the macroeconomic record in Britain does not inspire confidence and that the small business balance sheet needs better fire-proofing. That points to a number of long-touted remedies: more equity, more fixed-term, fixed-rate lending in place of overdrafts that can be withdrawn on demand and more emphasis on cash flow instead of collateral in lending. Much of this is happening already. The sudden end to the postwar pattern of net disinvestment in equities by the personal sector can only be helpful: a less institutional capital market is one in which so-called business angels will thrive. At the top end of the scale a buoyant equity market has facilitated a flow of fresh capital into small quoted companies. Lower down, fixed rate lending is growing fast in the new disinflationary climate. Banks have surplus capital and are anxious to lend again. The margins, admittedly, look fat. But as bank profits recover, competition tends to reassert itself. The Office of Fair Trading should be on the look out for any market failure here.</p>

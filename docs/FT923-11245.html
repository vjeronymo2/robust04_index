			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Motoring: For armchair motorists . . . THREE new motoring books make a nice change from those of the 'Complete history of the side-valve Ford V8' variety (does anyone ever read these bar the author?). In The Green Car Guide (Merlin Press, Pounds 7.99), co-authors Paul Nieuwenhuis, Peter Cope and Janet Armstrong analyse minutely the environmental impact of the motor car. This is not in the least boring because a mass of facts is presented clearly by a level-headed, apparently non-partisan trio. Stuart Bladon's Observers Cars (Frederick Warne, Pounds 4.99) is not an A to Z guide to everything car on the market but a summary of 181 vehicles cars he feels are worth writing about. Two dozen of them have 'the invaluable and often-appreciated asset' of a top speed of more than over 150 mph (245 kph) and three are rated at 200 mph (322 kph) plus. Just what you need nowadays. Yet, an important newcomer like the Volvo 850 GLT is not mentioned. Never mind; it is an entertaining if subjective little book. If you like buying cheap petrol or sometimes find yourself down to the last few litres late at night, Easy Driver (Seven Points Publications, PO Box 119, Chichester PO18 9LY, Pounds 3.99) should be in your car's glovebox. It lists all supermarkets serving petrol, 24-hour filling stations, fast-fit and car hire outlets and hospitals with major accident and emergency departments. Also included are the best round-the-clock roadside and recovery companies and much else to interest a thrifty, independent motorist.</p>

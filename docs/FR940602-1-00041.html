Any tails, fittings, or other means of making the preventers fast on deck shall provide strength equal to that of the preventer itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Wire rope clips or knots shall not be used to form eyes in, nor to join sections of, preventer guys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Stoppers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) When used, chain topping lift stoppers shall be in good condition, equipped with fibre tails, and of a length to allow not fewer than three half-hitches in the chain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When used, chain stoppers shall be shackled or otherwise secured in such a manner that their links are not bent by being passed around fittings. The point of attachment shall be of sufficient strength and so located that the stoppers are in line with the normal topping lift lead at the time the stopper is applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When used, patent stoppers of the clamp type shall be suited to the size of the rope used. Clamps shall be in good condition and free of paint and dirt which would prevent their being drawn tight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Falls. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) The end of the winch fall shall be secured to the drum by clamps, U-bolts, shackles, or some other equally strong method. Fibre rope fastenings shall not be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Winch falls shall not be used with fewer than three turns on the winch drum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Eyes in the ends of wire rope cargo falls shall not be formed by knots and, in single part falls, shall not be formed by wire rope clips.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) When the design of the winch permits, the fall shall be so wound on the drum so that the cargo hook rises when the winch control lever is pulled back and lowers when the lever is pushed forward.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Heel blocks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) When an employee works in the bight formed by the heel block, a preventer of at least three quarter inch (1.9 cm) diameter wire rope shall be securely rigged, or equally effective means shall be taken, to hold the block and fall in the event that the heel block attachments fail. Where physical limitations prohibit the fitting of a wire rope preventer of the required size, two turns of one-half inch (1.3 cm) diameter wire rope shall be sufficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the heel block is not so rigged as to prevent its falling when not under strain, it shall be secured to prevent alternate raising and dropping of the block. Except that: This requirement shall not apply when the heel block is so located as to be at least 10 feet (3.0 m) above the deck when at its lowest point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coaming rollers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Portable coaming rollers shall be secured by wire preventers in addition to the regular coaming clamps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cargo hooks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Cargo hooks shall be as close to the junction of the falls as the assembly permits, but in no case farther than 2 feet (.61 m) from it. Except, that this provision shall not apply when the construction of the vessel and the operation in progress are such that fall angles in excess of 120 degrees do not normally occur. Overhaul chains shall not be shortened by bolting or knotting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1918.53  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Cargo winches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Moving parts of winches or other deck machinery shall be guarded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Winches shall not be used if control levers operate with excessive friction or excessive play.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Double gear winches or other winches equipped with a clutch shall not be used unless a positive means of locking the gear shift is provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) There shall be no load other than the fall and cargo hook assembly on the winch when changing gears on a two gear winch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Any defect or malfunction of winches that affects safety shall be reported immediately to the officer in charge of the vessel, and the winch shall not be used until the defect or malfunction is corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Temporary seats and shelters for winch drivers which create a hazard to the winch operator or other employees shall not be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Except for short handles on wheel type controls, winch drivers shall not be permitted to use winch control extension levers unless they are provided by either the ship or the employer. Such levers shall be of adequate strength and securely fastened with metal connections at the fulcrum and at the permanent control lever.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Extension control levers which tend to fall of their own weight shall be counterbalanced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Winch brakes shall be monitored for performance. If winch brakes are unable to hold the load, the winch shall not be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Winches shall not be used when one or more control points, either hoisting or lowering, is not operating properly. Employees shall not be permitted to tamper with or adjust control systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) When winches are left unattended, control levers shall be placed in the neutral position and the power shall be shut off or control levers shall be locked at the winch or the operating controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1918.54  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Rigging gear.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

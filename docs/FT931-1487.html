			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Halifax up 8% despite sharp rise in bad debts HALIFAX Building Society disclosed an 8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 628m to Pounds 680m, despite a 63 per cent increase to Pounds 374m in provisions against bad and doubtful debts. Mr Jon Foulds, chairman, said the society had performed well in 'the worst year in the housing market since the war'. The priority in the year to January 31 had been to maintain financial strength and security, and help members. Mr Jim Birrell, chief executive, said competition from National Savings for retail funds and the need to maintain investors' returns meant that any further cut in base rates was unlikely to lead to mortgage rate reductions. Mr Birrell said it was possible that the society might have to raise mortgage rates later in the year to support a rise in savings rates if there was a strong upturn in the housing market and a scarcity of retail funds. Gross mortgage lending fell 8 per cent to Pounds 8.3bn (Pounds 9.1bn) while net advances - mortgage advances minus repayments of mortgage loans - fell to Pounds 3.3bn (Pounds 3.9bn). This represented 18 per cent of net lending in the UK housing market. Total assets rose 7 per cent to Pounds 62.8bn (Pounds 58.7bn). The asset growth was funded by a Pounds 2.9bn increase in retail funds to Pounds 50.4bn and a Pounds 1bn increase in wholesale funds to Pounds 8.3bn. Wholesale funds were 15.2 per cent of total funding. Net interest income was up 18 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn because of asset growth and widening of margins, while other operating income firmed 5 per cent to Pounds 348m (Pounds 332m). The society said this reflected a 9 per cent fall in housing transactions. The ratio of costs to income fell to 40 per cent (43.6 per cent) although the number of staff expressed in full-time equivalents was 20,600. Cost/income ratio has fallen steadily from 51.6 per cent in 1989. Some 87 per cent of the rise in provisions for possible bad debts related to residential mortgages. There were 22,486 mortgages in arrears at January 31 compared to 18,061 a year before, and total arrears were Pounds 268.7m (Pounds 257.4m).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["S. Korean Workers' Struggle Cannot Be Checked" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- The South Korean workers  will surely have their just demand met by more staunchly  struggling to frustrate the crafty tricks of the Kim Yong-sam  group and win democratic freedom and vital rights, stresses a  NODONG SINMUN commentary today.    The analyst says:    Recently, trade unions of big businesses in South Korea  including the Hyundai Heavy Industries and the Daewoo  Shipbuilding on Koje Island declared that they would start a  full-dressed struggle in June demanding wage hike, the  reinstatement of expelled workers and the participation of trade  unions in management. It is fully justifiable because it  reflects their strong will and resolution to win vital rights  and democracy without fail.    South Korean workers are now subjected to medieval toil for  13-16 hours a day to be paid low wages far below the minimum  living cost.    The analyst further says:    When he came to power, the traitor Kim Yong-sam committed  himself to build "a society where people who sweat are well  off." But he has driven them to the bottom of destitution by  freezing their wages with the doctrine of "sharing sufferings."    The Kim Yong-sam group is urging the workers to obey the  demand of the businesses, blaring that this year will be made  "the first year without labour-capital dispute" and  "labour-capital cooperation" is necessary to win the competition.    The massive struggle declared by the South Korean workers  again, however, clearly indicates that any threat and crafty  trick can never break their will to win their vital rights and  democracy through struggle.</p>

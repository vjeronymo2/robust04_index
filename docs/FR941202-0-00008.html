			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The syringe label should not be limited to the clinical procedure. On the other hand, it is unnecessary to require that the label, or the leaflet or brochure that accompanies the radioactive drug, contain all of the statements specified in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The regulatory text in this section states: ``In addition, the label for the syringe or syringe radiation shield must also contain the clinical procedure to be performed or the patient's or the human research subject's name.'' Thus, the clinical procedure is an additional item but not the only item on the label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the statements that must be included in the leaflet or brochure, the Commission believes these statements are necessary because they serve as warnings to individuals who are not authorized to use the byproduct material. However, the statement that ``other regulatory approvals may be required'' has been deleted because this concern is already covered by 10 CFR 35.7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . It is unclear as to the legal origin of the statement that ``NRC's labeling requirements are independent of requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This comment quotes the last sentence of &sect;32.72(a)(4) of the proposed rule, stating that: ``NRC's labeling requirements are independent of requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).'' This comment appears to question the NRC's statutory authority for the quoted statement. As previously stated in response to comment 1 on &sect;32.72(a)(4), the NRC's statutory authority to impose requirements with respect to the labeling of radioactive drugs containing byproduct material derives from its authority under the Atomic Energy Act (primarily sections 81 and 161b) to regulate byproduct material. The quoted sentence makes it clear that NRC's labeling requirements are separate from the labeling requirements of FDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 32.72(b) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were several comments concerning this paragraph. These comments and the NRC's responses are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The phrase ``within 30 days of the date'' used in the proposed &sect;32.72(b)(3) is confusing and should be replaced with ``no later than 30 days after the date.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Commission agrees with the comment. The final rule text has been modified accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In the preamble of the proposed rule discussing proposed &sect;32.72(b)(3), the use of the phrase ``individual's character'' in determining whether the individual should be approved as an authorized nuclear pharmacist appears inappropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The NRC disagrees with this comment. Under sections 182 and 183 of the Atomic Energy Act, the Commission has broad authority over the scope of license applications and the terms of licenses. Section 182(a) includes the authority to require, by rule or regulation, such information as the Commission determines necessary to decide, among other things, the technical  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and other <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  qualifications of the applicant as the Commission may deem appropriate, as well as the applicant's character. Therefore, in determining whether to grant a license or license amendment, or approve an individual to perform licensed activities, the NRC can consider the past performance and character (which may include activities involving improper or illegal practices) of the license applicant, the licensee, or the individual who is to perform licensed activities. An individual occupying the position of a physician authorized user or authorized nuclear pharmacist has the potential to affect the public health and safety. Accordingly, it would be appropriate for the NRC to consider information relating to that individual's ``character.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If an authorized nuclear pharmacist decides not to seek recertification as a Board Certified Nuclear Pharmacist, would the individual lose the authorized nuclear pharmacist status?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . No. If an individual gained authorized nuclear pharmacist status based on board certification and decided not to seek recertification, this individual may continue to work as an authorized nuclear pharmacist provided this individual continues to be identified as an authorized nuclear pharmacist on a Commission or Agreement State license or on a permit issued by a Commission or Agreement State licensee of broad scope.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Would the scope of ``grandfathering'' extend beyond the initial transition period?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Commission believes it is not necessary to limit the ``grandfathering'' provision to a definite period after the effective date of this final rule. Therefore, there is no time limit for the ``grandfathering'' provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 32.72(c) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were several comments concerning instrumentation. These comments and the NRC's responses are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

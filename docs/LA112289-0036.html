			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> BISHOPS FACING A DILEMMA ON PRO-CHOICE POLITICIANS  </P> <P> A sampling of the nation's leading Roman Catholic bishops indicates that most  are distancing themselves from San Diego Bishop Leo T. Maher, who last week  banned a Democratic assemblywoman from Communion for her openly pro-choice  stance, saying they prefer to appeal to an official's conscience first. Several  of the bishops said, however, they still may ultimately penalize Catholic  politicians who blatantly oppose the church's teaching on abortion.  </P> <P> Although the action against San Diego Assemblywoman Lucy Killea appears to be  an isolated response, the bishops still are faced with a two-pronged dilemma:  How to consistently implement a strongly worded resolution they adopted two  weeks ago calling for Catholic politicians to publicly adopt an anti-abortion  stance while, at the same time, avoiding backlash from American voters who  resent political "meddling" by church authorities.  </P> <P> In the long run, Maher's action may hurt, rather than help, the bishops' cause,  and stiffen the resolve of pro-choice Catholic lawmakers to steer their own  course independently of church counsel, according to some church leaders and  politicians.  </P> <P> In a two-page letter sent to Killea last Wednesday, Maher accused the four-term  legislator, who has a solidly pro-choice voting record, of being "an advocate  of this most heinous crime" and banned her from receiving Communion -- the most  sacred element of the Catholic Mass -- unless she recants. She said she would  follow Maher's order, but would not change her position on abortion.  </P> <P> Killea faces Assemblywoman Carol Bentley (R-El Cajon) in a special election  Dec. 5 for a vacant Senate seat in San Diego County.  </P> <P> Other pro-choice Catholic politicians responded quickly to support Killea,  saying they were concerned about the potential political fallout of Maher's  action against her.  </P> <P> "I am appalled that the Catholic Church has entered into politics in this  manner," declared State Sen. Diane E. Watson (D-Los Angeles). "What this action  says to Catholics everywhere is that the church can dictate public policy by  issuing orders to Catholic lawmakers."  </P> <P> New York Gov. Mario Cuomo issued a statement saying Maher's denial of Communion  to Killea raised "troubling questions." Cuomo asked whether the church would  now impose sanctions on Catholic officials who differ with its teaching on such  issues as the death penalty or distribution of contraceptives.  </P> <P> California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp said he did not think the flap would  affect his campaign for governor in 1990. The Catholic Van de Kamp's strong  pro-choice position "is well known," spokesman Duane Peterson said Tuesday. "He  has discussed his views with (Los Angeles Archbishop) Roger Mahony. They  disagree on the issue and it ends there."  </P> <P> Peterson added that while Van de Kamp personally opposes abortion, "he believes  it is not the place of government to make the choice for women."  </P> <P> Julie Sly, a spokeswoman for the California Catholic Conference in Sacramento,  said the state's bishops decided at a meeting last month in San Diego that the  best strategy for swaying Catholic lawmakers to the church's abortion view was  for each bishop to meet individually with legislators in their own dioceses  rather than to impose sanctions.  </P> <P> "Some might have interpreted Bishop Maher's actions as being too strong," she  conceded Tuesday.  </P> <P> The bishops themselves are not unmindful that the resolution they unanimously  adopted at their national conference in Baltimore on Nov. 7 -- which urged all  public officials, especially Catholics, to work to end legal abortions -- could  backfire.  </P> <P> Although that resolution declared that "no Catholic can responsibly take a  'pro-choice' stand when the 'choice' in question" involves abortion, it did not  mention sanctions. And when Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis, outgoing  conference president, was asked directly at a press conference in Baltimore  whether he thought sanctions would be effective, he bluntly replied:  </P> <P> "No, I don't think it would help us one bit to change America's thinking" about  abortion. "It might even have an adverse effect," he added.  </P> <P> Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, the newly elected chairman of the bishops'  Committee for Pro-Life Activities, also downplayed the matter of sanctions, and  Chicago's Cardinal Joseph Bernardin appeared reluctant to be drawn into  discussion of the issue by the reporters.  </P> <P> "It seems to me that it's not so much a question of expelling a dissident  person as it is motivating that person to change his or her mind and heart,"  Bernardin said when pressed. He added, however, that the possibility of  sanctions "needs further study."  </P> <P> The Killea situation is so sensitive that few bishops would comment directly.  </P> <P> Mahony, who spoke eloquently in favor of the abortion resolution in Baltimore,  said through his public affairs director that his position was best expressed  in his June policy statement directed at Catholic officeholders. That  statement, which does not mention sanctions, says legislators have "a positive  moral obligation" to work for the repeal of laws permitting abortion.  </P> <P> Subsequently, both Mahony and Bishop Norman F. McFarland of the Diocese of  Orange have said they would impose sanctions against a Catholic politician  supporting abortion rights -- but only if the lawmaker exhibited what Mahony  called a "very flagrant" outspoken stand.  </P> <P> McFarland added, however, that unless a Catholic public official "who actively  promotes abortion" directly challenged him, he would not deny Communion to that  individual.  </P> <P> Father Ken Doyle, a media spokesman for the U.S. Catholic Conference, summed up  the bishops' delicate position by saying, "A determination like this properly  belongs to a bishop in his own diocese. There is no specific conference policy  on the matter of sanctions for those Catholics who disagree publicly with the  church's pro-life position."  </P> <P> In the Archdiocese of Denver, for instance, where Mayor Federico Pena is a  visible, openly pro-choice Catholic, neither Archbishop J. Francis Stafford nor  Pena's parish priest, Father Marshall Gourley, plan any punitive actions,  spokesmen said Tuesday.  </P> <P> And John Walsh, communications director for Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston --  in whose church jurisdiction Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, a pro-choice  Catholic, resides -- said, "There is a good degree of latitude under canon  (church) law in terms of discipline a bishop may take. Each bishop looks at his  own circumstances and makes up his own mind."  </P> <P> Law reportedly plans no sanctions against Kennedy, nor O'Connor against Cuomo.  Representatives of both politicians said neither had received word from  Catholic officials threatening action or pressing them to modify their abortion  stands.  </P> <P> Yet O'Connor's auxiliary bishop, Austin Vaughan, said he hopes the nation's 300  bishops take "some kind of collective action on this." Maher's disciplining of  Killea, he said, "points to the significance of the issue."  </P> <P> Vaughan added in a telephone interview that he has publicly warned Catholic  politicians "who push pro-choice views . . . they are running a serious risk of  going to hell."  </P> <P> Such differing views illustrate how difficult it will be for the Catholic  bishops to come up with a consistent policy of dealing with the pro-choice  politicians.  </P> <P> If what is meted out in San Diego goes unpunished in Denver, how are the  nation's 300 bishops to speak with one voice on the issue they described in  their statement as "an overriding concern" and the "fundamental human-rights  issue" of the day?  </P> <P> Maher intended his bold -- and, as yet, one-of-a-kind -- punishment to serve as  an example to the faithful and a deterrent to "erring" Catholics politicians.  But in doing so, he may have forced other bishops to be more cautious in the  way they handle the abortion resolution.  </P> <P> At the same time, Maher's action is likely to stir residual anti-Catholic  sentiment among American voters, who, opinion polls show, deeply resent the  intrusion of sectarian religious beliefs into politics.  </P> <P> Even Father Robert J. McManus, the vicar for education in the Diocese of  Providence, R.I., who thinks the church should consider excommunicating  pro-choice Catholic politicians, advised the church hierarchy to move slowly.  </P> <P> "It would be extremely unfortunate," he wrote in America, the influential  Catholic weekly published by the Jesuits, "to jeopardize the generally  responsible political leadership of a Catholic public official or to reawaken  inadvertently a latent, yet historically evident, prejudice that Catholics are  not politically independent enough of their bishops' political agenda to govern  in a pluralist society."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The nation's Roman Catholic bishops have long opposed abortion as the  unjustified taking of human life except in rare cases where the pregnant  woman's life is jeopardized. But their latest policy statement, adopted this  month, is the first since last summer's U.S. Supreme Court decision that allows  individual states more latitude in restricting abortions. In their stepped-up  campaign against pro-choice advocates, the bishops' resolution goes further  than their earlier statements by calling for public officials, especially  Catholics, to work to end legal abortions.  </P></p>

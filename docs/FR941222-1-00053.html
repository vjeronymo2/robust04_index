			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The risk associated with the wastewaters in tanks is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to be below levels of concern. However, the risks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with managing these wastewaters in surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impoundments are calculated to be high. One constituent found in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the waste is considered capable of posing a substantial present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or potential risk to human health or the environment ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , risks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are 1E&hyph;4 or higher for carcinogens, or 1 or higher HQs for non-carcinogens). The constituent poses a risk 1E&hyph;4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As was the case with wastewater treatment sludge from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of azo dyes, excluding FD&amp;C colorants, the wastewaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were found to contain high concentrations of aniline, a high-volume dye reactant that poses an unacceptable risk at such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels. In fact, aniline was present in each of the seven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater samples from azo dye production. However, two of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seven aniline data points, which were both from one facility,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were dropped prior to the risk assessment because the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported that aniline found in the wastewater is associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-dye operations. This facility consumes larger volumes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aniline in their non-dye operations than in the manufacture of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> azo dyes. It is likely that aniline from dye operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributed to the presence of the constituent in the waste;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, the Agency could not determine the extent of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the aniline concentrations represented by the five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining data points, the Agency has determined that the risks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> posed by aniline in this wastestream are 2E&hyph;6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The presence of three coeluting isomers, 2-, 3-, and 4- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aminotoluene, was confirmed in four out of six wastewater samples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected from azo dye manufacturing operations, and the combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration of the three compounds was quantified (refer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier discussion under Section II.D.2, Coeluting Compounds, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a discussion on the coelution of 2-, 3-, and 4-aminotoluene).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the toxicity of 2-aminotoluene, is 1E&hyph;4 for the surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impoundment management scenario.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

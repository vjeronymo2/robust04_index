			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Brussels defends motorcycle plans PLANS to limit the power of motorcycles and prevent tampering with moped engines are meant to make EC roads safer, the European Commission said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. Critics say the EC's executive is meddling in matters the prerogative of manufacturers, but Commission officials said they had backing from governments and manufacturers. The proposal to ban motorcycles over 100 brake horsepower would affect only a small number of machines, they added. It would bring the EC in line with Japan, which has had a 100 brake hp limit for 15 years and makes more powerful models only for export, a Commission official said. The proposal has been in trouble getting through the European parliament because some MEPs have taken the part of motorcycle users, arguing that factors other than horsepower cause road accidents. The parliament was to vote on the legislation late yesterday. The other proposal, still being drafted, would set technical specifications for mopeds, aimed to prevent users tampering with engines to make them more powerful. The two proposals are among 24 draft laws to set up a single set of technical specifications for two- and three-wheeled vehicles marketed in the EC.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Slovakia faces shift to extremes: Prospects of a right-left alliance Mr Vladimir Meciar, twice Slovakia's prime minister, had a commanding lead after elections over the weekend, paving the way for an alliance among his populist movement, socialists and extreme nationalists to form the country's next government. In a national turnout of 75 per cent, Mr Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) won 35 per cent of the vote and a potential 58 seats in the 150-member parliament. That is more than three times as much as the party's nearest rival, the former communists of the Democratic Left (SDL). If Mr Meciar becomes prime minister it will shift Slovak politics away from the centre ground occupied by the outgoing government and towards extremes of both left and right. Mr Meciar, who was ousted as prime minister in March, looks set to form the next government in a coalition which could include the socialist Union of Slovak Workers (ZRS), which won 7 per cent of the vote and the extreme nationalists of the Slovak National party (SNS), which won 5.4 per cent. The size of the HZDS victory took many observers by surprise. In the weeks before voting on Friday and Saturday opinion polls had given the party no more than 27-30 per cent of the vote. If the HZDS forms a coalition with the ZRS and SNS it will have up to 81 seats in parliament, giving it a majority of six. As remarkable as the success of the HZDS was the collapse in support for the SDL, which slumped to 10 per cent from 15 per cent at the last election in June 1992, before Slovakia split from the Czech Republic. This has effectively killed hopes of the return to office of the outgoing government, of which the SDL was the dominant partner. The outgoing prime minister, Mr Jozef Moravcik, whose Democratic Union (DU) party, a breakaway unit of the HZDS, garnered 8.5 per cent of the vote, conceded that there was little likelihood of his government remaining in office. 'It will be difficult for the current government to stay together,' he said. While Mr Meciar's appointment as prime minister is not yet guaranteed, observers in Bratislava said yesterday that there were no other likely candidates among senior HZDS officials. Mr Meciar's outsize personality dominates the party. If he is appointed, it leaves the way clear for him to carry out his campaign promises to undo voucher privatisation, curb the growing influence of Slovakia's ethnic-Hungarian minority and seek to oust President Michal Kovac, the man who helped force him out of office as prime minister six months ago over allegations of corruption. Mr Moravcik's government had made hesitant progress towards restarting voucher privatisation in Slovakia, and began a process of rapprochement with Hungary over the issue of Slovakia's 560,000-strong ethnic Hungarian minority. The Hungarians are seeking greater autonomy over educational and cultural affairs. The HZDS is deeply suspicious of voucher privatisation because it allows control of state assets to pass to what Mr Meciar terms 'anonymous persons'. His potential coalition partners are of a like mind, the ZRS fearing huge job losses as companies restructure under new ownership, and the SNS wanting complete state control over the economy, as in the communist era. Mr Meciar might have difficulty in reversing the voucher programme, though he is expected to try. Nearly 1m Slovaks have bought vouchers which they can exchange for shares in a range of state companies the outgoing government has earmarked for inclusion in the programme. 'He can certainly interrupt it, but he may not be able to stop it,' one observer said. 'It will be difficult to buy back all those vouchers.' Both HZDS and SNS are fiercely opposed to greater autonomy for ethnic Hungarians, who make up more than 10 per cent of Slovakia's population, regarding such a move as tantamount to secession. Relations with Hungary have been cool since independence, and progress on drafting a comprehensive agreement between the two countries, begun under Mr Moravcik and tentatively scheduled to be ready next February, could now be in jeopardy. Mr Meciar's greatest problem might yet lie in his relations with Mr Kovac. Mr Kovac orchestrated the campaign that ousted Mr Meciar in March, alleging widespread corruption in privatisation. In the last hours of his administration Mr Meciar approved more than 40 deals to sell state assets to their managers. The bitterness in relations between the two men, once allies in the HZDS, will make co-operation extremely difficult. It is still possible that the ZRS, with 13 seats, will decline to go into coalition with the HZDS. It seems unlikely that the party's leader, Mr Jan Luptak, would join a coalition with Mr Meciar because of his opposition to privatisation, but he may yet agree to support such a government informally. In that case Mr Moravcik could also count on the support of the ethnic-Hungarian parties, which will have 18 seats. A coalition of the DU, the FDL and the Christian Democrats with the support of the ZRS and the Hungarians would give Mr Moravcik 82 seats but a more unwieldy coalition than Mr Meciar could put together. Whatever the make-up of the next government this election has failed to bring Slovakia much-needed stability. There is some concern that the confusion and instability that characterised Mr Meciar's two previous governments may return if he forms the next administration.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wm Sinclair at Pounds 1.3m in unseasonal half Both turnover and pre-tax profits eased in the first half at William Sinclair Holdings, the supplier of products to the garden, leisure and pet markets. The Lincoln-based group reported profits of Pounds 1.35m on turnover of Pounds 16.5m for the six months to end-December, compared with Pounds 1.39m on Pounds 16.6m previously. Net interest receivable fell from Pounds 192,000 to Pounds 92,000, mainly reflecting lower interest rates. The horticultural division was again affected by the continuing trend of customers to defer taking delivery of stock. The pet, aquatic and household division was also starting to find that an increasing amount of sales took place in the second half. However, horticultural deliveries were now beginning to pick up in readiness for the gardening season. Mr Tom Sinclair, chairman, said yesterday that the results were encouraging, and had left the group in a good position to benefit in the second half. 'The better the weather is, the better we will perform in the next six months.' In January the group acquired Zeneca's compost business for Pounds 2.76m. Turnover for the business for the 1993 year is estimated at Pounds 3.7m with profits before tax and interest of Pounds 436,000. Mr Sinclair said the acquisition had doubled the group's peat resources and increased its share of the professional grower market. Earnings per share dipped 4.4p to 4.2p. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.7p.</p>

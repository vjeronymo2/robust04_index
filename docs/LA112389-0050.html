			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO ACTION ON HOMELESS PROGRAM  </P> <P> A controversial request to set up a program for the homeless in Redondo Beach's  Dominguez Park was held over Tuesday by the City Council until Dec. 5.  </P> <P> Faced with an agenda so long that, according to Councilwoman Kay Horrell, "it  would choke a good-sized camel," the council delayed discussion of the issue  until its next meeting, even though dozens of homeless activists and  neighborhood residents had come to debate the plan.  </P> <P> At issue is a request by Hope Chapel of Redondo Beach to distribute free food  and clothing from a church-owned trailer that the church would place in  Dominguez Park once a week for a 45-day test period. The goal, said Ron Mason  of the chapel's Haven of Hope Ministry, is to gauge how many homeless people  there are in the area and, based on that information, set up expanded programs  for them if necessary.  </P> <P> But city officials say there are few, if any, street people in Redondo Beach,  and neighbors of Dominguez Park say they fear the program will draw transients  from other parts of Los Angeles. Also of concern, they say, is the fear that  the homeless will frighten or threaten the 150 youngsters who participate in  Little League at the park.  </P></p>

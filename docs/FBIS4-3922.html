			<p>BFN     [Text] Yichang, Hubei Province, April 24 (XINHUA) -- China  started construction on the Three Gorges Dam as ground was  broken on a temporary set of ship locks here this morning in  Yichang, central China's Hubei Province.    So far, earth work on three big projects for the Three  Gorges  Dam has begun on one side of the dam, including permanent ship  locks, a power station and the temporary ship lock and lift  system.    Earth and rock work for these three projects adds up to  39.24  million cubic meters, accounting for one-third of the dam's  total.    The first phase of the permanent ship locks work, which  started on April 17, is 3,800 meters long and nearly 100 meters  in depth. The two-way five-staged locking and lifting system  will have an annual handling capacity of 50 million tons and is  to be the biggest of its sort in the world.    The one-way one-staged temporary ship locks with a handling  capacity of 3,000 tons aims to ensure normal water traffic  during the dam's construction.</p>

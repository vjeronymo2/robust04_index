			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Freeze on European fighter contracts agreed A THREE-MONTH freeze in new contracts in the development of the controversial European Fighter Aircraft was agreed yesterday by defence ministers from Germany, Britain, Italy and Spain. The time will be used to undertake studies to find drastic cost reductions in the Pounds 20bn project and to redefine the aircraft's military role. The ministers, meeting in Madrid, stopped short of suggesting that the EFA would not be built. But Spain and Germany - which triggered a crisis in the consortium earlier this summer by declaring it would not join the production phase of the aircraft - left little doubt that the original project is on the verge of being abandoned. 'The EFA is dead,' Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, said yesterday. His Spanish counterpart, Mr Julian Garcia Vargas, said: 'Our current economic situation will not permit us to go into production of the EFA as it stands.' Only Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, tried to sound an enthusiastic note by insisting that Germany had agreed to continue the development phase of the EFA. But Mr Ruhe, who has never threatened otherwise, noted that for the first time 'London has shown a readiness to discuss a reduction of the military and strategic requirements of the aircraft'. In a clear reference to Mr Ruhe's calls for a cheaper and lighter EFA, Mr Rifkind said: 'We very much hope that the decisions eventually taken will be informed rather than those based on simple assertions without any supporting hard evidence . . . It is unlikely that any project which does not take advantage of the huge expense already undertaken on development will end up being less expensive than the EFA.' He said a 30 per cent cut in unit costs being sought by Spain was a broad target and 'we are happy they should look at that'. The decision to freeze new development contracts was purely symbolic, he said. There were, as far as he knew, no new ones pending. Mr Garca Vargas said the ministers had agreed that no new contracts would be awarded between now and the end of October. During this time the air forces of the four countries would study alternative military requirements. Mr Garca Vargas said the ministers would meet again in November to decide whether to proceed with the EFA, to build a lighter, cheaper version or to begin work - possibly with other partners and investors including Saudi Arabia - on a new aircraft. He warned that the 'pause' would inevitably mean a delay in the production of whatever aircraft it was decided to build. Spain would insist on a twin-engined aircraft, but he said the studies would look at changes in all aspects of the EFA, including the airframe, which Britain has been keen to protect.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie picks up after initial 96-point setback - Market report Fears that last Friday's near 2.5 per cent slide on Wall Street could have triggered an October 1987-style slump in the London stock market were quickly shrugged aside yesterday. A pre-emptive mark-down of share prices by marketmakers headed off any big selling. Nevertheless, London could not ignore the influence of Wall Street's big fall and the FT-SE 100 Index ended a tense trading session a net 56.3, or 1.6 per cent, off at 3,419.1, well above the day's lowest levels. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index proved equally resilient, recovering strongly to settle 69.3, or 1.7 per cent, down at 4,077.1. The market's resilience came from a noted absence of selling pressure from the big UK institutions and a better than expected opening by Wall Street yesterday afternoon. Although a fresh downturn in US bonds caused a certain amount of consternation in the market towards the close of business. UK gilts remained under pressure, always a sign that there could be more problems ahead for the market in the short term. The Federal Reserve's move to lift its Fed Funds rate by  1/4 percentage point late on Friday wrought havoc on Wall Street, which posted its biggest one-day drop for two years and produced hefty falls throughout the Far Eastern and European markets. After their initial move to chop prices, the traditional response of London marketmakers to bad news, dealers encountered very little selling from the big institutions who, if anything, moved to buy what they considered 'cheap' stock in many areas of the market. After a setback of about 100 points in early unofficial trading, the FT-SE 100 officially opened almost 70 points off, the rally coming in the wake of a mixture of 'cheap' buying and bear closing. Mid-morning brought a period of extreme uncertainty and nervous trading as dealers began to worry about the potential for another bout of weakness on Wall Street when that market opened. The FT-SE 100 was trading around 87 points off but Wall Street came in steady to a shade firmer and London subsequently gained ground in tandem with the US market, which was around 25 points better shortly after the official London close. Second-line stocks, if anything, out-rallied the leaders, the Mid Cap picking up from an early 120-point drop. Equity market strategists were generally impressed by the market's resilience. Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull said the market had taken events 'in its stride', while Mr Rob Buckland at NatWest Securities described the fall as an 'opportunity to buy cheap stock'. Mr Richard Kersley at BZW said sector stories will now become more interesting, and took the view that financial stocks, especially the banks, may begin to emulate their US counterparts and start to underperform the market. There were raised eyebrows at the level of turnover in equities, which reached 894.1m shares, surprisingly low given the swings and big falls in the market and reports of exceptionally heavy basket trading by one of the big European securities houses. Non-Footsie stocks comprised 516.6m, or 58 per cent of the total. Possibly the day's most impressive individual performance came from Slimma, the clothing group, whose market debut could hardly have come on a more difficult day. Nevertheless, the shares rode out the storm and ended at a substantial 17.5 per cent premium.</p>

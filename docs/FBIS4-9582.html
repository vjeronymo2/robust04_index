			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Slovak President Michal Kovac by </F> correspondent Ildiko Nagy in Bratislava; date not given; from  the "Extra" program--recorded; Kovac speaks in Slovak with  superimposed translation into Hungarian]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Nagy] From the viewpoint of  the development of good-neighborly relations, which tasks do you  consider the most timely in Slovak-Hungarian relations?    [Kovac] I believe that what both sides consider the most  important is that we should put an end to mutual accusations and  mistrust between the Slovak Republic and the Hungarian Republic  as soon as possible. This is the basic condition for our being  able to develop cultural and economic relations at the level of  the various organizations, institutions, and citizens as well.  So, the elimination of mistrust is at the top of the list, and  every step promoting this is given priority. I believe that the  signing of the basic treaty that lays down good-neighborly  relations is included in this. The principle of the  inviolability of the borders has to be laid down just as that of  the political solution of issues affecting the national  minorities. If we manage to achieve this, then afterward what  we must strive for is to remove gradually from people's  consciousness the suspicion and mistrust inherited from the past.    Once the basic conditions have been created for shaping a  new  type of relations, enormous possibilities will open up before  us--first and foremost in cross-border cooperation, which is by  no means at the level made desirable by the economic, cultural,  and technical endowments and requirements of the region's  inhabitants.    [Nagy] During their visit to Bratislava last week, Gabor  Kuncze [head of the parliamentary group of opposition Alliance  of Free Democrats] and, before that, Gyula Horn [chairman of the  opposition Hungarian Socialist Party], also, spoke  optimistically about the future development of Slovak-Hungarian  relations. Jozef Moravcik, the Slovak head of government, also  sees a chance for improvement. Do you share this opinion?    [Kovac] Yes, I support this opinion. And I trust that, in  the election campaigns, the so-called Slovak and Hungarian cards  will become superfluous--in other words, that it will not be  possible to play these against each other. On the contrary, it  will become apparent that the most rational way to resolve  issues is to approach them in a sober, objective manner, without  suspicion, be it a question of Gabcikovo, water distribution,  the legal status of national minorities, or anything else--in  other words, that everything can be resolved if it is not  unnecessarily overpoliticized.    Incidentally, I consider this to be a sickness that has  raised its head not just in our country but elsewhere, too. It  is obviously connected with the fact that real democracy in our  region is still only in the developmental phase, the political  situation has not yet settled down, and an unnecessarily large  number of issues are brought onto the political level as if they  were trying to forge capital for themselves from this.    But I also see signs of the opposite of this: the effort to  try to remove obstacles from the path of our relations. I  consider looking to the future the important thing, and to make  people aware that European integration is an attractive  objective for which it is worth working with joint forces so as  to achieve it more quickly.    [Nagy] Mr. President, if I am not mistaken, you managed to  find the common note a long time ago with Hungarian President  Arpad Goncz. You mentioned that, in the course of your earlier  meetings, too, you had managed to get attuned.    [Kovac] Yes, that is so. This has shown that the presidents  of republics, who are infrequently dragged into daily  politicizing, look at events from above. Their hands are not  tied, and they can express an opinion without prejudice, without  ulterior motives, about certain issues. This is what we need:  that this approach should pass down from the president's level  to the executive power level. I do not doubt that this will  happen because, also in Hungary and here, too, we have already  taken steps in a direction serving the aim of depoliticizing.  Once people's everyday interests come to the forefront, that  will bring with it the necessity of sober solutions.    [Nagy] In your view, what role can the minorities play in  the  shaping of bilateral relations? I am thinking, in our case, of  the Slovaks living in Hungary and of the Hungarians living in  Slovakia.    [Kovac] In general terms, it can be said--and this relates  to  both the Hungarian and the Slovak situation--that it is in the  interest of every country to create for its minorities  conditions in which they can feel at home, so that they will  strive, in their own interest, to integrate and become fully  valuable members of the given society, while being able to  retain their particular characteristics, their language, their  culture, their traditions, while being given the possibility to  study in their mother tongue. However, it is a general interest  that the use of the mother tongue should not impede the minority  in becoming integrated in society and the individual in getting  on. We must change this outlook, which still lives on, that a  minority means nothing but trouble for a country. We must  reinforce the view that it can also mean richness. So far, we  have done little to achieve this, but perhaps not only in  relation to Hungary and Slovakia. Elsewhere, too, what people  see is the disadvantages of the minorities issue rather than the  richness the minorities represent for a country from the  viewpoint of culture, of the multicolored mix of languages.    We have not sufficiently weighed the possibility of making  use of this opportunity provided by the minorities for the  purpose of getting closer to our neighbors, in our case toward  the south, making our relations closer with Hungary.

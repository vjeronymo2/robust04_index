			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / BREL renamed ABB Transportation BREL, the train manufacturing arm of British Rail privatised in 1989, was yesterday renamed ABB Transportation following the acquisition of a controlling stake in the business earlier this year by Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group. The company said the new name was intended to reflect a change of image. However, the loss of Brel's independent identity is likely to reinforce fears that Britain's biggest trainmaker is destined to become little more than a local assembly plant for ABB's products.</p>

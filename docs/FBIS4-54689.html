			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sarajevo, May 3 (AFP) -- [passage omitted]  UNPROFOR spokesman French Major Eric Chaperon said a Serb T-34  battle tank was intercepted overnight by French troops near the  Lukavica barracks -- right in the heart of the NATO exclusion  zone on heavy weapons around Sarajevo ordered in February. Both  here and in the eastern town of Gorazde, heavy weapons were  building up again in the exclusion zones "drop by drop," the  spokesman said. Informed military sources also reported  increased Bosnian Government army activity in the Mount Igman  region overlooking Sarajevo, with units being relayed by fresh  troops. The Serb tank was heading that way. [passage omitted]</p>

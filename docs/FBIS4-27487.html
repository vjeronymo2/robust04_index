			<p>on   U.S. Ties   <F P=102> BK2705134994 Dhaka Radio Bangladesh Network in Bengali 1230  GMT 27 May 94 </F>  <F P=103> BK2705134994 </F> <F P=104>  Dhaka Radio Bangladesh Network </F> <F P=105>  Bengali </F> BFN     [Text] The visiting foreign minister of Vietnam, Nguyen  Manh Cam, has said that though his visit to Bangladesh was a  brief one it has laid a new foundation in mutual relations.  Addressing a news conference in Dhaka today, he said that long  historical ties exists between Vietnam and Bangladesh. For a  long time this relationship has been limited to friendship. We  extended our support to each other's independence movement in  different international forums. He said his current visit has  yielded positive results. Two agreements have been signed to  expand bilateral cooperation in economic, scientific, and  technical spheres. He said these agreements gave a legal  framework for future bilateral ties. Apart from meeting  government leaders, Mr. Nguyen said he also held meetings with  the trading community and the leaders of the Federation of  Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry.    In reply to a question, the Vietnamese foreign minister said  his country is keen to develop trade ties with Bangladesh. He  said the two the countries can explore the prospects of trade  with others together.    In reply to another question, Mr. Nguyen said that there has  been an improvement in ties between Vietnam and the United  States. In this regard, Hanoi and Washington have recently  signed an agreement to set up liaison offices.    [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0956 GMT on 27 May 94 in a  Dhaka-datelined report adds the following: "Vietnamese Foreign  Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said here Friday that Vietnam favors  the resumption of full diplomatic relations with the United  States as soon as possible, but that a decision is up to the  Americans.    "`We are ready, but the ball is in the American court and I  regret that I cannot say when full diplomatic ties will be  restored between our two countries,' Cam said as he wound up a  three-day visit to Bangladesh.    "Cam's comments at a press conference followed the  announcement that Vietnam and the United States had taken  another step toward diplomatic normalization by announcing that  they would open liaison offices in each other's capitals. Cam  said the only thing holding up normal diplomatic ties was US  domestic politics, an apparent reference to pressure by American  groups which claim Vietnam has not fully accounted for US  servicemen still listed as missing in action from the Vietnam  War.    "I am sure it will come sooner or later. Ties have improved  since the (President Bill) Clinton administration lifted the  economic embargo on Vietnam" in February, he said. Bangladesh  opened a diplomatic mission in Hanoi last November.    "While here, Cam met President Abdur Rahman Biswas, Prime  Minister Khaleda Zia, Foreign Minister Mustafizur Rahman and  business leaders. The two countries pledged in two agreements  signed Thursday to work toward improving ties. Cam said the  pacts gave a legal framework for cooperation and his visit here  would promote mutual understanding and trust.    "As for Vietnam's historic rival, China, Cam said Vietnam  wanted a `bilateral dialogue' with Beijing to resolve  territorial disputes on land and sea, saying `both sides should  restrain themselves from force or the threat to use force.'    "Asked to comment on the US decision to renew China's  most-favored-nation trading status, Cam said only that Vietnam  -- one of only nine countries which does not enjoy MFN -- wanted  it as soon as possible for itself. As for the human rights  situation in Vietnam, Cam said the Vietnamese had regained their  rights only after a hard struggle for independence.    "`We will promote them further to make a government for the  people, of the people and controlled by the people,' he added,  but `first comes the right to live in freedom and  independence.'"]</p>

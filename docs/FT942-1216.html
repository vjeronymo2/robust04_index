			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Mexico banker's ransom agreed The lawyer of Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, the kidnapped Mexican financier, said on television that his ransom would be paid, paving the way for the release of one of the country's wealthiest men, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. Mr Harp, the joint head of Banamex-Accival, the country's largest bank, was seized in March. His kidnapping has been given enormous publicity, with his abductors sending the press a series of emotional letters from the financier to his family and partners in which he pleaded for his life. The lawyer made the statement on Mexico's main television news programme, accompanied by Mr Harp's son, and a representative of the Catholic church, as demanded by the kidnappers. The kidnappers said in their latest communique that the ransom demand had been dropped to less than Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.7m). Mr Harp's lawyer agreed to pay an unspecified amount, and not to involve the police. The kidnappers have promised to release Mr Harp three days after receiving the ransom.</p>

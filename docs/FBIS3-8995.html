			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pristina, 18 Mar (TANJUG) -- Ibrahim Rugova,  president of the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo [Demokratski  Savez Kosova, DSK], today welcomed the signing of the agreement  on the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    At a news conference Rugova described the agreement as the  first step toward containing the situation and a peaceful  resolution of the conflict, at the same time warning that  developments will be more difficult on the ground [than in the  negotiations] due to war wounds.    According to him the question is whether similar things will  happen in other parts of the former Yugoslavia, since, as he  said, it [former Yugoslavia] should first be reorganized  according to ethnic and political criteria. Rugova said  different and new ways of [implementing] the agreement could not  be ruled out. He voiced his party's position whereby first of  all each one [each nation] should be a master in its own home,  and then economic and other associations will be possible.    The DSK president expressed satisfaction with the outcome of  the discussion on Kosovo in the Belgian Parliament, in  particular with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes's speech,  in which, according to Rugova, he had said that Kosovo Albanians  were now no longer satisfied with the Yugoslav Constitution of  1974 [that gave them the status of an autonomous province within  Serbia]. The DSK leader interpreted this as a sign of support  for the [ethnic] Albanian demand for an independent and neutral  Kosovo.    Rugova welcomed recent demonstrations of Albanians in  European cities and confirmed that the organizers were the DSK  and other Albanian associations.</p>

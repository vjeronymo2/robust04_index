			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Business clients still critical of banks THERE are still 'substantial weaknesses' in the relationship between banks and their small-business customers, says a survey published yesterday by the Forum of Private Business, the lobby group. Poor communication between banks and small businesses may make it difficult for enterprises to raise funds for expansion when the economy recovers, according to the survey of more than 6,000 businesses. Forty per cent of business owners said the banks did not understand small companies. Scottish banks won a more favourable rating from their customers than their English counterparts. Barclays won the highest marks among the English banks, while Lloyds scored lowest. The survey by Nottingham University said banks were starting to differentiate their services more. It found no backing for claims that banks had not passed on the benefit of cuts in base rates to small companies. In spite of banks' efforts to improve relations with small companies by drawing up charters or codes of practice, there was no change in the issues highest on businesses' concerns - account charges, interest rates and the need to provide collateral.

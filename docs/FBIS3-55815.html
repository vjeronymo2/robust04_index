Approved by the bloc's heads of state and government,  it is now its official policy. But the program is not only of  interest and importance to NATO. It speaks of the basis on  which the NATO countries' new relations with those known in the  West as the "newly independent states" -- the countries of East  Europe and the former Soviet republics -- will be built. The  "partnership" idea has already been discussed for six months,  but had thus far lacked any "content" -- but the specific  proposed actions and avenues for cooperation are turning a  slogan into a program of action and, in this instance,  cooperation. The picture has now been clarified to a certain  extent.    From the time it was announced as a slogan for future  partnership between the NATO countries and their former enemies  in East Europe and the USSR, the central question worrying the  world public has been the possibility of quantitative growth and  the expansion of the NATO alliance and its expansion as a  military-political bloc. There have been stormy debates in the  European and trans-Atlantic capitals on the pluses and minuses  of such prospects. This problem has also been actively  discussed in Russia.    We can assume that it was no secret that Washington did not  immediately reveal the nature of its proposals. It cannot be  ruled out that the U.S. leadership was launching a trial  balloon, wanting to see the reaction both from its allies and  from its future "partners" to its plans, to hear the political  thunder and lightning about the program (which did indeed occur)  beforehand and take account of them in President Clinton's  official report, and only then to firmly state that membership  of the NATO bloc is not the starting point for the plans to  build partnership but the ultimate goal.    As U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin noted, participation in  "Partnership for Peace" will not be a clear run [propusk] into  NATO. It would be more correct to see it as a certain trial  period, during which current NATO allies will have to be  convinced of the new partners' reliability, and the latter will  have to demonstrate the sincerity and practicality of their  aspirations by their actions (the governments of Poland, the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania have  already stated their aspirations officially, and other East  European states are also prepared to do so).    NATO members intend to organize concrete cooperation with  each of the applicant states individually. Although the overall  framework has already been generally defined. This will take  the form of mutual consultations on military problems, the  training of military cadres, the embracing of NATO approaches  and standards in planning and organizing combat training  measures for troops and staffs, and the holding of joint  command-staff and field training exercises.    "Partnership for Peace" assumes that states seriously aiming  to join the West will be given the status of so-called associate  members. This has not been completely defined, but is seen as  something higher than the status of member of the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council. At the same time, it differs substantially  from the position of a full NATO member -- the bloc takes no  responsibility for the collective defense of partners'  territories, while nonetheless gaining the right for the NATO  Joint Armed Forces to assimilate the associate members'  infrastructures. Each state's contribution to the overall  peacekeeping effort in situations such as the Yugoslav conflict  will be taken into consideration. In other words, it is not a  question of what NATO can do for the new partners, but of what  the latter can do for the bloc.    It is clear from President Clinton's Brussels speech that,  apart from purely military joint contacts, the partners will  also have opportunities to organize cooperation in spheres such  as peacekeeping activity, search and rescue operations,  humanitarian aid operations, and environmental protection  efforts. None of these areas is anything new; the first steps  have already been taken in all of them -- some successful,  others not very. The alliance's headquarters obviously believes  that these operations will be more effective and timely under  NATO rather than UN auspices.    Despite the NATO (and, particularly, U.S.) leadership's  reluctance to accept new members into the bloc in the immediate  future, the states east of the former "iron curtain," the  situation within them, and their political policy are at the  center of attention of Brussels and Washington. As NATO  Secretary General Manfred Woerner admitted, "it is obvious that  the United States cannot prosper amid chaos and conflict, and  the United States needs the alliance as a most important tool  for exercising American influence and leadership in Europe."  Needless to say, an expansion of NATO would also mean an  expansion of America's potential in this sphere. The principles  on which these ambitions would be realized is another matter.    Washington currently admits that it is impossible to allow a  few of even the best-prepared states into the bloc -- it would  very much smack of the formation of a some kind of new  anti-Russian coalition (particularly given the regrettably tense  relations between Russia and a number of its former allies). It  would also hardly be sensible to let all comers join NATO at one  fell swoop -- the sharp growth in numbers without any careful  qualitative preparation for such a step would essentially  destroy the bloc and make it an unimportant organ similar to the  CSCE. The gradual, drawn-out process proposed by Clinton at the  NATO Brussels session makes it possible to avoid sharp  confrontation -- above all with Moscow -- although it leaves  many questions open.    One of the most obvious questions, whose dangers we have to  face even now, is whether the NATO membership will become a kind  of instrument of blackmail. There is a very great temptation  (and not everyone is currently capable of resisting it) to use  the power of "big brother" -- the role which NATO plays -- to  attempt to pressure the Russian leadership. This may be simpler  than organizing or, rather, reestablishing a normal working  dialogue, but it is hardly any more effective. All the more so  at a time when Russia is building a good and constructive  relationship with most NATO countries on a bilateral basis and  gradually at bloc level.    Following the official announcement of the "Partnership for  Peace" program and its adoption by the NATO leadership, we can  expect efforts to implement it not at a level common to all, but  in certain areas. During President Clinton's current tour of  the states of East Europe this will undoubtedly be discussed in  Prague, Kiev, Minsk, and Moscow.    Bill Clinton arrives in the Russian capital 12 January. U.S.  sources report that no new "historic initiatives" should be  expected -- the top-level talks will focus on perhaps more  prosaic but nonetheless extremely important problems. These are  U.S. support for the reform processes in Russia, and the  steering of that support toward easing the social tension  engendered in our country above all by the painfully difficult  transformations in the economy. The Russian and American  leaders will also examine how successfully the accords on U.S.  assistance reached back in Vancouver are being implemented --  whether they are working, where the obstructions are if there  are problems, how to accelerate the transition from fine  declarations to routine but productive action.    In Minsk, Kiev, and Prague the emphasis during talks will be  different. And this is logical. The same Americans, in the  words of General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint  Chiefs of Staff and until recently commander in chief of the  NATO Allied Armed Forces, clearly see a difference of approach  to partnership with Russia and, for example, the Czech Republic,  countries with differing potential, different possibilities, and  dissimilar starting points. Furthermore, in the last two-three  years some areas of cooperation have already been mapped out,  and weak points along this path have also emerged. They need to  be eliminated on a reciprocal basis. The main point is that  Russia is ready for equal partnership for the sake of  strengthening security in Europe and throughout the world. And  it hopes to be shown the same attitude by our potential allies.</p>

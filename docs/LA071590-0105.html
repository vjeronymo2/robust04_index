			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. WOMAN GETS SKULL FRACTURE IN RUNNING OF BULLS  </P> <P> A 21-year-old American woman suffered a fractured skull in the running of the  bulls Saturday, the final day of the weeklong San Fermin festival, a hospital  spokesman said.  </P> <P> Stephanie Kern was in serious condition after she was knocked down by a bull  during the run at the festival made famous by author Ernest Hemingway, the  spokesman said.  </P> <P> Kern, who will be a college senior in Conway, S.C., and her mother arrived in  Pamplona on Wednesday. Kern is the first woman known to have been injured in  the running of the bulls, officials said.  </P> <P> Hannah Kern, of Clinchport, Va., said her daughter had been racing ahead of six  bulls in a pack of people when the group suddenly surged forward. When she  looked ahead to check her footing, a bull butted her with his head and caught  her torso inside his horns.  </P> <P> The force of the impact sent her sprawling headfirst onto the cobblestone  street, Kern said.  </P> <P> Five other people were treated at area hospitals after being less seriously  injured during the 2 1/2-minute run with the bulls along the half-mile route  from the corrals to the city bullring.  </P></p>

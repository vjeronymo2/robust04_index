			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Arts: Someone Who'll Watch Over Me Why Frank McGuinness's new play should take its name from a verse-line of the Gershwins' song (used here to cover most of the scene-breaks) instead of its real title, 'Someone to watch . . .', is the least puzzling thing about it. Doubtless that simply avoided some hassle about copyright. Everything else about the piece - a chamber trio for three Western hostages in a Beirut cell - is more tantalising. ('Huis clos with jokes,' said my companion.) The more tantalising, because it is manned by a dream cast that couldn't imaginably be bettered. Hugh Quarshie, Stephen Rea and Alec McCowen inhabit their characters completely. If there are any lapses in the script, they conceal them with shining conviction. Obviously the play was prompted by the plight of John McCarthy and his cellmates. No less obviously, McGuinness has no intention of re-telling their story. Instead, he gives us a different kind of story: 'There were an American, an Irishman and an Englishman . . . ' The Arabs don't get a look-in, either as wicked captors or as ideologues. Nobody discusses geopolitics; none of the prisoners is beaten or tortured. One does die - but the guards are said to be embarrassed and sorry about that. This is hardly a hostage-play at all, but a Shavian conversation-piece for national stereotypes, highly self-conscious ones. Quarshie's calm, stoic American doctor works relentlessly at keeping himself in shape. (It is piquant that nothing is made of his being black: did McGuinness really write the role with a black actor in mind?) Rea lavishes all his wry, vulnerable charm on the Irish newsman. As the elderly, prissy English professor, McCowen is of course immaculate, and of course he gets to recite bits of 'The Wanderer' in the original Old English. McGuinness seems deliberately to have given no overt structure to the piece. There aren't even any surprises to speak of - just the endless conversation, articulate, searching and frequently witty. Unlike most Shavian ones, it does have moments of intense feeling; but they are held within careful restraints, as if to insist that individual pain and despair are not what this play is chiefly about. Robin Lefevre has directed the proceedings with perfect tact. Hampstead Theatre, NW3, to 1 August; (071) 722 9224</p>

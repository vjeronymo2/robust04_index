			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Japanese spinners want cheap imports squeezed Japan's textiles industry is to ask the government for protection under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) to stem a surge of cheap imports from China and other Asian countries. The Japan Spinners' Association said it was hoping to file an application requesting the Japanese government to restrict imports of low-priced cotton yarn. The Japan Chemical Fibres Association is also considering an application. The moves follow an announcement by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry that it has established rules for imposing emergency restrictions on textile imports under the MFA. The rules, which would apply for three years, call for year-long investigations and bilateral negotiations before the imposition of restrictions. They are designed to give the domestic industry time to allow it to carry out structural reforms, Miti said. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, trade minister, yesterday stressed the international acceptance of the new rules: both the US and the European Union had introduced restrictions on textiles imports under the MFA. Japan's textile industry has come under growing pressure from cheap imports, notably in the past two years with the yen's appreciation. Textile imports rose 13 per cent to Y1,511.5bn (Dollars 15.34bn) in the first nine months of this year compared with the same period in 1993, according to the Japanese government. The industry, which was profitable until 1986, suffered a Dollars 10bn loss last year, expected to rise to Dollars 14bn this year, according to the Japan Chemical Fibres Association. In the first half of 1994, imports of cotton yarn and cotton fabrics reached a peak according to the Japan Spinners' Association. The number of companies in the cotton spinning industry fell by about 10 per cent last year from 162 to 145, the association noted. The trade ministry has, however, been cautious in its approach to restricting textile imports. Japanese retailers have benefited from being able to import directly from low-cost textile manufacturers in China and elsewhere. Consumers have also enjoyed lower prices offered by retailers as a result of cheaper imports. The ministry is aware of the technical difficulty in proving that imports have damaged domestic industry. There are also the political considerations regarding a decision which could alienate consumers as well as the developing countries which may be hurt by restrictions, one industry official noted. The government would also be reluctant to risk being exposed to criticism that it is going against the tide of free trade which it has so fervently advocated in its trade negotiations with the US.</p>

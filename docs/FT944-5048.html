			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / City levy 'may fund transport infrastructure' Transport projects in London and other large cities could be financed by a business levy similar to the non-domestic rate, under proposals put forward by the Corporation of London yesterday. Businesses would be able to vote on whether to support the levy in their area - though they would have to abide by the majority decision - and would be involved in monitoring how it was being spent. A study by Mr Tony Travers and Mr Stephen Glaister of the London School of Economics, on behalf of the corporation, includes plans for an infrastructure fund for London to complement the government's private-finance initiative. The Treasury yesterday reacted negatively to the proposal, saying it would increase the burden on business at a time when rates were due to fall and that it did not represent 'true private finance'. The City first began looking at methods of raising additional finance for transport when CrossRail, a plan for a cross-London rail line, was mooted. Another 1p in the pound on business rates in Greater London could raise Pounds 75m a year towards the capital cost of transport schemes or to the repayment of interest on loans. The scheme's managers could expect to raise 10 times their annual revenue from the levy in the form of commercial loans. Mr Travers said: 'London's infrastructure is badly in need of reinvestment but government funding has remained below the levels officially accepted as necessary to reinstate and maintain the railway network.' The infrastructure fund would be easy to understand because the rating system already exists and it would be relatively easy and cheap to collect the levy, Mr Glaister said. The idea is for a trust or similar organisation to be established, combining private and public-sector membership. It would devise a package of transport schemes seeking backing and propose this to local businesses. The government would have to commit itself to maintaining existing public-spending levels for transport if businesses were to be expected to contribute, Mr Travers said. Legislation would be needed to permit the introduction of a levy. Some US cities have designated improvement districts, which raise funds from local business. In France, a city may impose a levy on businesses to finance transport infrastructure. An Infrastructure Fund for London. Corporation of London. 071-332 3451.</p>

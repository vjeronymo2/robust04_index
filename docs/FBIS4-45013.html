			<p>CSO     [Text] Sanaa--Mosque preachers in the Yemeni capital called  yesterday for "maintaining jihad for God's sake" and in order to  rid the country of what they described as the "enemies of God  and his Prophet." That was a clear reference to the military  confrontation, currently in its third successive week, between  forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Chamber of  Deputies Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, and other  forces loyal to 'Ali Salim al-Bid and leaders of the Yemeni  Socialist Party whom Sanaa regards as insurrectionists against  legitimate authority.    Mosque preachers, in their Friday sermons, did not consider  it inconceivable that "the current war would continue for a few  more days or even for months" since, in their opinion, it takes  patience and wisdom to overpower and defeat enemy strongholds.  They noted that the mujahidin, as they called them, waged a  fierce battle at Mihwar al-Hind, some 60 km from Aden where,  they pointed out, most concrete fortifications exceed two meters  in thickness. And yet, they said the lightly armed mujahidin  charged them and secured them with a minimum of losses compared  to enemy casualties. That claim is consistent with communiques  issued by Sanaa, which continues to claim control of the base  despite Aden's assertions to the contrary.    The preachers asserted that groups of Yemeni civilians have  volunteered in what they called the "jihad for God's sake" and  joined the ranks of regular forces that are engaged in fierce  fighting in order to achieve their mission. They added that the  volunteers have joined various divisions in solidarity with  their warring brethren and in order that "they all may celebrate  clear victory," as the preachers put it.    In a related development, an informed source in Sanaa  shrugged off the impact of the "volunteer mujahidin" who include  groups of Arab Afghans as well as militias of the Yemeni Reform  Grouping. He opined that they could have no stronger impact on  the battle than either the "deluded" Socialist Party militias or  those whom 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his supporters dispatched to  the mountains of al-Dali', Radfan, etc., in order to regain lost  territories by engaging regular troops in guerrilla warfare.    Asked whether the war, or military confrontation, between  well-trained and fully equipped armed forces regulars threatens  to become guerrilla warfare or war among groups of volunteers  spread beyond the military fronts, the Sanaa source said that  "it is unlikely that things will reach this level of complexity  and foreboding that some people dread. The reason, he  emphasized, is that both warring parties in Sanaa and Aden know  full well that it would undermine their interests to allow their  conflict to escalate to that extent, since both of them are keen  on remaining in power one way or another." Should the war  continue or expand, both parties to the confrontation could  forfeit their positions by losing the initiative, especially in  the event of a prolonged military confrontation, which the  source deemed to be "unlikely."    Both Sanaa and Aden acknowledged in their military  communiques that a number of "intrepid citizens" from various  parts of Yemen are involved in the military confrontations and  are engaged with the regular forces "in achieving military  victories and vanquishing the enemy."    Some observers regard this with a degree of uneasiness and  trepidation. They believe that the development, and the openness  with which it is discussed in military communiques and mosque  sermons, does not forebode a quick conclusion and may indeed  escalate the military confrontation into a civil war where each  of the parties may be forced to deploy its civilian supporters  into militias or tribal forces, thereby driving the battle  beyond the fronts into various parts of Yemen. That, should it  happen, would take a long time and tremendous effort to quell.    Those observers also view the semantic use of "jihad" to  describe current skirmishes in certain sections of Sanaa between  the forces of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the forces of  his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid, as something that undermines  President Salih's position and his justifications for his war  with al-Bid's forces. President Salih, having won the support of  a comfortable majority of northern members of the Yemeni Chamber  of Deputies, claims that "al-Bid and his supporters are  insurgents against the constitutional authority" and must  therefore be "pursued, apprehended, and made to stand trial."  The debate on jihad, while it seems to rebut President Salih's  claims, is consistent with al-Bid's statements on the  confrontation between the southern forces and the forces of  President Salih and his fundamentalist supporters who, in his  view, "want to regress the country to the way things were  centuries ago."    Some observers believe that by recently relinquishing the  word "terrorists" in favor of the term "Sanaa-supported  fundamentalists," especially since the military confrontation  began, al-Bid and his supporters are seeking to gain the support  of Arab and Western countries that are apprehensive about the  potential of the religious movement in Yemen rising to power.    Observers therefore expect President Salih and his  supporters  to be alert to some of the caveats for which the West is closely  watching, and he may deal with those caveats in an unexpected  manner. President Salih has assured the West, and particularly  the United States, that once he resolves the conflict with  al-Bid and his supporters, his immediate focus will be on  "making up for the mistakes of the past and on building a new  Yemen on a foundation of unity, democracy, political plurality,  respect for human rights, comprehensive development, social  progress, and the administrative and fiscal decentralization of  local governance."    Those assurances notwithstanding, the Western countries are  not satisfied with mere "promises" and are relying primarily on  their sources for reports, information, and supported figures to  determine the extent to which those promises have been  translated into pragmatic measures and actual realities.    Observers fear that President Salih may not be able to  maintain his control of the religious movement in the Yemeni  Reform Grouping with which he is currently allied in his drive  to eliminate the leaders of the Socialist Party. This may prove  even more difficult should they actually succeed in achieving  their mutual objective and emerge victorious from this  confrontation. This is something that President Salih must  consider with great care in his quest for the West's trust and  for better treatment by it. Not only that, he must also  consolidate his rapprochement with countries of the Gulf and  with other nations that view the "problem of fundamentalism"  with great trepidation.</p>

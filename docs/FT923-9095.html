			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Arts: The landscape of imagination - Art OLIVIER MOURGUE is one of France's most innovative designers. He is also a maverick. In the 1960s he travelled Europe in various 'ateliers mobiles' establishing a reputation as a furniture designer and producing, most memorably, futuristic sets for Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. There followed design projects for motor-car as well as furniture manufacturers and experiments with textiles and 'animated' canvases. More recently, while living in Brittany, he began to furnish the landscape of his imagination. This is the stuff of the current exhibition, his first in Britain, at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts in Norwich. Out of the long-familiar materials of watercolour or balsa wood, canvas and paint he has confected a series of Imaginary Gardens and Little Theatres - and a world of the gentlest fantasy. Only gradually does this world come to be recreated in our mind's eye. Certainly the visitor leaves the almost impenetrable prose of Mourgue's introduction ill-prepared for the watercolours that look more like textile or wallpaper designs than preparatory drawings, and the models and constructions that fuse folklore and craft traditions, design and the theatre. Such is the nature of exhibitions that the Little Theatres stand empty, their props neatly arranged and hermetically sealed behind glass a few feet away. The man-sized painted and slatted wood 'play' furniture looks similarly bereft, uncomfortably confined and untouched in this indoor space. Mourgue's own photographs, reproduced in the catalogue, record these pieces as they should be seen and used. The kite-backed chaise-longue, for example, catches the breeze at the point where the flat, wet Brittany beach seems to merge with the expanses of sea and sky. Photographed at low tide too is 'The Bird' which is suspended above us. It is a five metre long sledge bearing a figure crowned with a bird's-nest seated behind a kite-like head of a bird. The bird's wings are imaginary sails, its long tail feathers a tiller. The watercolour shows this fantastical vehicle and its equally strange occupant gliding across what may be waves or clouds. Sea and sky seem ever interchangeable. Mourgue has described elsewhere how his silent theatre came into being as a result of constantly re-arranging the objects scattered about his studio - pebbles, driftwood, feathers, dried sea-weed, children's drawings. They developed as 'a sort of mime' in his watercolours and then acquired a third dimension. Just as Mourgue's imagery comes out of the Brittany landscape, his theatres and props - large or small - look most at home within it. Regrettably, there is no film of his silent story-telling - in Brittany, New York or Helsinki - as there is of Alexander Calder operating the famous wire Circus that must have inspired him. Mourgue's theatres, like Calder's Circus, fit into a suitcase. His performances are, apparently, equally impromptu, improvised and compelling. That is where the similarity ends. While Ringmaster Calder's stage is makeshift and his troupe of miniature performers concoctions of wire, cork and fabric strips, Mourgue's minimalist wood and canvas theatres are impeccable in their artful simplicity, each prop and character beautifully crafted. There are smooth, pebble-shaped wooden figures with jaunty acorn heads, stone houses and rocks, and a retinue of cats, birds and jumping dogs that are either carefully drawn and cut out or made from strips of torn paper. Calder's wire performers thrilled their audiences by ingeniously replicating human movement. His wire strongman, clad in a scrap of leopardskin, raises his weight in a series of authentic jerks; the belly dancer's hips gyrate convincingly and the stretcher bearers, come to whisk away the victim of an inept knife-thrower, enter and exit with a comic trundling gait. Mourgue offers a kind of Theatre of the Absurd. Ladies take tea or play the 'cello floating out to sea with hungry chicks clamouring in the nests made on their heads. Boats give the illusion of carrying trees, even houses. This Absurdist humour - long a characteristic of his furniture design - brings to mind the work of Sam Smith and the English automatists, which also has its roots in folk traditions, although there is none of their irony or subversive wit. Mourgue's flights of fancy are innocent, domestic. Even his Imaginary Gardens have the qualities of samplers stitched with sacred symbols. His tall tales and enchantments are as inconsequential as dreams. Like dreams, they are compelling as long as they last and then they are instantly forgotten. * * * Norwich, for another week, is also host to a selection of paintings and oil sketches on loan from the Turner Bequest at the Tate.  'From Turner's Studio' focuses on work that would never have been exhibited during the master's lifetime. A wide-ranging sequence of small, fresh landscapes, some painted direct from nature, canvases laid in but never completed, and all manner of preparatory sketches, atmospheric studies and impressions reveal this most inquiring of artists at his most dazzlingly experimental. 'Olivier Mourgue: Imaginary Gardens and Little Theatres' is sponsored by Worms et Cie, Association Francaise d'Action Artistique, Visiting Arts, the French Ministry of Culture and Communication, and Sir Norman Foster and Partners. It continues at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, University of East Anglia, Norwich, until August 30. 'From Turner's Studio' closes its national tour, sponsored by Digital, at The Castle Museum, Norwich, on August 16.</p>

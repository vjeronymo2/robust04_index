The ministry  believes its deficit should be 55 trillion rubles. The  expenditure part comes to 178 trillion. We asked Finance  Minister Sergey Dubinin what this money is going to be spent on.  This is what he told us in a telephone interview.    [Begin Dubinin recording] The expenditure part of the budget  reflects those real outlays which have been planned by the  government, set by the laws and resolutions, so to speak, and  which we, the Finance Ministry, would not dare propose  rescinding. We are proposing simply rescinding a whole series  of laws, a whole series of resolutions, which we are simply  unable to underpin financially with revenue, but there are  things which inevitably have to be financed.    Quite a large amount in our budget is spent, of course, on  social and cultural measures. This comes to tens of trillions  of rubles, and all this is a continuation of our policy aimed at  supporting, on the one hand, the most needy areas, and also  extending selective support to production sectors with capital  investments, and in some areas, as in agriculture and the coal  industry, with subsidies, although subsidies, of course, are not  the best way of spending money.    Russia's budget, like that of any other state, is burdened  with the same historical state prerogatives, that is, the  country's defense, international activity, the social sphere,  and certain economic matters.    There is hardly any point in telling you about the whole  structure of the budget, especially as this is a draft, and  there will clearly be certain alterations to it after the  government has examined it, it has its own drafts, and it will  be submitted to the State Duma. We tried at least to prevent  the situation of industries and the social sphere from getting  any worse, although it is quite difficult to do that when output  is being cut generally, and the country is in a state of crisis.  It is quite difficult to ensure a rise in the finance of one  area or another, it is scarcely possible.    Otherwise the whole structure of the budget has to be  radically altered, say, totally stop financing one area and  switch to another. Since no-one has taken such decisions, the  structure of the 1994 budget will to a large extent look like  the structure of the 1993 one. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "They Came To Die as Martyrs in </F> Kurdistan]    [Text] The downing of two U.S. helicopters yesterday over  Iraq's Kurdistan by two U.S. fighter planes was the first of its  kind in Kurdistan. It was a tragic accident that the Kurdish  people deeply and bitterly regret. The two helicopters were  carrying UN officials and military personnel from the  international protection force that was set up by the United  Nations for the Kurdish people.    The U.S. President was deeply distressed when he announced  the tragedy to the American people and all other nations. The  Kurdish people's distress is deeper because it has lost a group  of friends who came from every corner of the earth to give it  relief, help it live in peace, and also help in rebuilding  liberated Kurdistan. The Kurdish people do not want their  friends to die on Kurdistan's soil or in allied and friendly  planes that fly over Kurdistan.    How splendid it was when the U.S. President said that these  men were performing their duty of providing protection for the  Kurdish people and died while performing this duty.    The incident has military and strategic significance too.  Regardless of the confusion or technical error that showed the  two helicopters on the two fighter planes' radar screens as  hostile targets -- and investigations will of course reveal the  cause of this technical error -- the incident has an extremely  important strategic significance; namely, that it is an  unambiguous signal to the ruling dictatorship in Baghdad  confirming that the international protection force is always  vigilant and actively present and that any hostile move against  the Kurdish people, territories, and air space will be  immediately crushed. The international protection force  operating in Kurdistan has firm and clear orders to abort any  hostile adventure that the regime of death and crime might think  of mounting against the Kurdish people.    We have the right to regard these courageous men, the  victims  of humanitarian duty, as martyrs of the peaceful Kurdish people  who are faithful to their friends. How nice it would be if the  Kurdistan region's government and parliament were to issue a  resolution to this effect. How nice it would be if the Kurdish  parties were to lower their flags in mourning. How nice it  would be if we were to erect a monument for them and for all our  friends and allies who had been killed and martyred, a monument  that would immortalize them and would be an expression of  gratitude and a memorial to friendship between man and his  brother.</p>

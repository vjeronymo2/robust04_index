			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARLIER LETTER 'MADE ME LAUGH'  </P> <P> The statement, "Politics for the sake of politics should take a back seat to  the welfare of the people of Monterey Park" by (activist and former Councilman)  Irv Gilman, in a recent letter to the L.A. Times (Oct. 5), made me laugh.  </P> <P> Irv Gilman is one of our city's "good old boys" and a political godfather who  seems to control the way council member Betty Couch and Mayor Pat Reichenberger  vote to spend our money.  </P> <P> I have known Irv Gilman as a "smoke-filled back room" political deal maker for  over four years.  </P> <P> He has always put politics before the welfare of the people of Monterey Park.  </P> <P> Yet he castigates council members Hatch and Houseman for their "no" vote on a  water rate increase and increased building in our city as no more than  irresponsible "inflammatory rhetoric" for the sake of "scoring a few political  points."  </P> <P> While he's probably right, I would like to remind the reader that it was his  political machine that installed these two politicians in office almost four  years ago.  </P> <P> I also think that Mayor Pat Reichenberger, who voted for this water rate  increase, should be investigated to see if a conflict of interest exists.  </P> <P> Why?  </P> <P> She is married to San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District Board of  Directors Member Joseph Reichenberger. It is his board that will benefit from  the increased taxes.  </P> <P> He works as a vice president for Engineering Science, a Pasadena firm that  advises business and government entities on the planning and design of water  supply and water treatment facilities.  </P> <P> Do they do business with Monterey Park? I don't know, but I do know that in  Southern California, political power is traditionally tied to land with a  supply of water, and money.  </P> <P> Gilman (who was once a council member himself, but couldn't get reelected) rode  the issue of slow growth -- as if he were whipping a dying horse to get him  into battle before it died on him -- in order to get his people into power.  </P> <P> Now that he has political control again, he has abandoned the slow-growth issue  in favor of using tax money to help the developers.  </P> <P> Politics for the sake of money or politics should take a back seat to the  interests of the people of Monterey Park, but it won't, as long as political  godfathers like Gilman and his puppets control how our taxes are spent.  </P> <P> FRANK J. ARCURI  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

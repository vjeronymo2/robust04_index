Addressing the India  special session of the World Economic Forum at Davos in  Switzerland last night, Mr. Narasimha Rao said there is a  national consensus in the country with regard to the reforms and  what is needed now is development of the power, transport,  communication, and road network for the next phase of  liberalization. He assured them of safe and good returns and  reiterated his government's commitment to remove all obstacles.  He told the business community that laws, wherever needed, will  be modified to protect the interests of all concerned and the  bureaucratic controls will not be allowed to come in the way. A  select gathering of about 300 noted chief executive officers of  corporations, academicians, journalists and intellectuals  participated in the India session.    The commerce minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, chaired the  session. The finance secretary, Mr. Montague Singh Aluwalia, and  the chairman of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, Mr. A.N.  Verma, attended. Our correspondent S. Sudharshanam reports from  Davos that, replying to questions at the India session, the  prime minister dispelled doubts of foreign investors about the  liberalization program of the Indian economy and assured them  that the process is irreversible. He told them liberalization is  a deliberate attempt and choice to globalize the Indian economy.  He said his government is politically stable to carry forward  these reforms.    Earlier, the commerce minister apprised the business  community of the health of the Indian economy and the results  achieved after the introduction of economic reforms two years  ago. Expressing similar sentiments in his address at the  closing symposium of the World Economic Forum, the prime  minister cautioned against internationalization of transborder  export of terrorism, clandestine encouragement of religious  fundamentalism, and local issues. He said these would result in  anarchy and total cessation of developmental effort of many  developing countries. Mr. Narasimha Rao also warned the world  community against linking the transfer of technology to  extraneous, unreasonable, unwarranted conditionalities, and said  these are threatening the basic fabric of many developing  countries. He said internationalization of local issue, low  cost proxy wars, and recourse to blackmail of various kinds are  on the rise, and thus anarchy and total cessation of  developmental efforts stare many developing countries in the  face. The prime minister made it clear that India will not  accept conditionalities in developing peaceful technology.    The prime minister called for a cooperative global effort to  fight poverty and widespread illiteracy. He expressed the hope  that a literate world can be ensured in the first quarter of the  coming century and called for determined efforts to achieve the  result. Expressing concern over religious fanaticism and hatred,  Mr. Rao said that challenge is to create and strengthen the  desire for a better life in society.</p>

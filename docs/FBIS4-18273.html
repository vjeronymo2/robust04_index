			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sebastiano Messina: "Ministerial Sweepstake </F> Begins"]    [Text] Rome -- Now that the League's obstacle to the first  Silvio Berlusconi government has been removed, Forza Italia's  leader is working in top secret on his list of ministers. He  does not yet have a list, of course, but the choice of names to  submit for President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's approval and  signature, in accordance with the Constitution, is rapidly  taking shape. One new factor emerging from yesterday  afternoon's Berlusconi-Bossi [Northern League leader] meeting  could affect Roberto Maroni, the League's lower house floor  leader, whom the League leader has proposed for prime minister.    Three possible posts await him, and he will of course gain  one of them. The first (and most likely) is deputy prime  minister, a post without any direct powers, but nevertheless  symbolic of the League's influence over the next cabinet. The  second is the very powerful position of interior minister -- a  post that the DC [Christian Democratic Party] has held  uninterruptedly since the beginning of its era. "I would gladly  fill it in order to clean up the secret services and to take  part directly in the federative reform," Maroni told his aides  yesterday, and Clemente Mastella [Christian Democratic Center]  has granted his approval to this possibility. The third post is  that of minister for the regions and institutional reforms -- a  position that seems bound to play a key role in the reform of  local government that the League so keenly desires.    If it does not go to the League, the Interior Ministry could  go to the National Alliance's general, Luigi Ramponi. True, the  police would not be overjoyed to see a former chief of the  Finance Guard, but Ramponi's past in the senior leadership of  Sismi would be enough to grant him the necessary authority.  Gianfranco Fini [National Alliance leader] decided not to keep  Berlusconi in suspense any longer when he told him that he does  not want to stand as a candidate for the prime ministership, but  nevertheless a party that commands 13.4 percent of the vote does  demand some visibility in government. The most likely solution  is that the ministers of the Right will be chosen from among  National Alliance members rather than among MSI [Italian Social  Movement] members. Thus, Pietro Armani, formerly of the IRI  [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction], could become foreign  trade minister, while Publio Fiori could become labor or  transport minister.    The allies of the Christian Democratic Center do not yet  know  whether they should negotiate with Berlusconi as an autonomous  parliamentary group (with their 34 deputies) or as a component  of a unified Forza Italia group. In any case, their candidates  are ready: Clemente Mastella, formerly in the running for the  prime ministership, is a potential defense minister, while  Pierferdinando Casini could secure the very delicate position of  minister of posts, and Francesco D'Onofrio is being mentioned as  the likely minister of institutional reforms, in view of his  recent experience. Ombretta Fumagalli Carulli is being  mentioned again as a likely justice minister, ever since both  Fini and Mastella discreetly vetoed Tiziana Parenti ("It is  better that a magistrate not fill that post").    The main stumbling block at the moment is the Foreign  Ministry. Whoever fills that post must represent Italy abroad in  the years ahead -- the center-right Italy that is already  prompting debate in Europe and America. Someone well-known and  reassuring is needed, a profile that does not exactly match that  of [Radical leader] Marco Pannella, who according to some people  is among the candidates for the post. Berlusconi seems more  inclined to choose an "outsider," an expert diplomat such as  former Ambassador to Moscow Sergio Romano, the commentator for  LA STAMPA. The alternatives are General Luigi Caligaris (who  could also become defense minister, by virtue of his  experience), and the Liberals' Alfredo Biondi (who, however,  seems likely to become speaker of the lower house).    The lion's share will of course go to Forza Italia members,  whom Berlusconi will make responsible for implementing the  program on which he focused his election campaign: a reduction  in income tax, a million new jobs, and the reorganization of the  health sector. No one is likely to deprive Antonio Martino of  the post of finance minister, while Carlo Scognamiglio, head of  the LUISS [International Free University of Social Studies] and  pioneer of privatization, seems the natural candidate for  industry minister. Giugliano Urbani, Berlusconi's much heeded  adviser, is expected to fill a leading ministerial position,  though no one yet knows which -- perhaps at the Interior  Ministry?    As always, the greatest uncertainty concerns the economic  ministries. For the Treasury and Budget Ministries, a number of  names are being mentioned, including such illustrious experts as  Lamberto Dini, President of the Bank of Italy; General State  Accountant Andrea Monorchio; head of the Bocconi institute Mario  Monti, and even economist Giulio Tremonti -- who, though a  candidate on the Pact's lists, is nevertheless well regarded for  his research on fiscal decentralization. The candidates for the  economic ministries will probably also include the Northern  League's top economic expert, Giancarlo Pagliarini, who was one  of the founders of Arthur Andersen.    Absolutely everything in government will change. But there  is one minister who will remain in the government, perhaps  returning to the Health Ministry: That is the Liberals'  Raffaele Costa, the only outgoing minister who could get back in.</p>

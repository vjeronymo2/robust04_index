			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, member of the  Presidential Council, has met with representatives of notables  and dignitaries of the al-Hadah Subdistrict in Yafi' District  [in southern Yemen], who came to Sanaa to stress their support  for constitutional legitimacy and readiness to confront all  secessionist attempts, as well as their belief in Yemeni unity  as the destiny of our people.    The dignitaries expressed their absolute rejection of  al-Bid's secessionist declaration, noting they had suffered for  27 years from the domination of the Socialist Party and that it  was time to be free from this despotism.    The brother member of the Presidential Council thanked them  for this attitude, stressing the importance of vigilance and  decisive opposition of all the secessionist who have threatened  unity, spilled blood, attacked property, refused to submit to  the people's will to let them choose their own rulers, and did  not acknowledge the peaceful transfer of power.    Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani also noted the great  victories scored by our valiant army on all axes of the  fighting. He called for a unified rank, mobilizing all popular  and official capabilities, to support the Armed Forces and ease  the effects of striking residential areas in Sanaa and other  governorates by the gang of apostasy and secession.</p>

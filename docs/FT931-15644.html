			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pledge on orders for railway stock THE government last night announced steps to ensure that orders for new railway rolling stock do not dry up because of the privatisation of British Rail. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told the all-party Commons transport committee that new arrangements would be introduced before privatisation to develop a market in leased rolling stock for BR and private operators. These should ensure that new orders are placed before current orders for the new Networker trains are completed in 1994. Critics of rail privatisation have warned that a hiatus in orders for new rolling stock because of the uncertainties over the future of BR could damage the UK rolling stock industry, which employs 30,000 people. Plans to allow BR to lease Pounds 150m of passenger coaches in 1994-95 and 1995-96 have been brought forward one year. This means that orders can be placed in 1993-94, and BR has been asked to draw up a shopping list. A discussion paper will set out options for creating a leasing market for railway rolling stock once privatisation begins. The key, according to ministers, will be to ensure that the risk on any leases lies with the private sector. If the public sector bears the risk, the investment must be counted against the public sector borrowing requirement under UK public accounting rules. Alternative routes for the high-speed rail link between London and the Channel tunnel were submitted to Mr MacGregor by British Rail yesterday. Mr MacGregor is expected to announce his preferred route in March and open a period of public consultation.</p>

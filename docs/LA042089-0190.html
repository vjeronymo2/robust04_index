			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE VET: NAIL TRIMS CUTS KITTY'S SCRATCHING  </P> <P> Q: What is the proper way to trim my cat's nails? I don't want to have her  de-clawed, yet she frequently scratches me or my furniture. I have heard that  keeping her nails clipped short will help reduce this problem, but I want to  make sure I am doing this the right way. I tried one time and caused her to  bleed.  </P> <P> Patricia Siegel, Seal Beach  </P> <P> A: To help keep your kitty from damaging you and the furniture, frequent nail  trims will reduce your cat's need to scratch. You should take her to your  veterinarian or groomer and have him show you the correct method. They should  also show you the proper way to hold a nail clipper. You need to extend each  nail by gently pushing on the pad. This way you should be able to see the quick  of the nail which has the blood vessel and nerve -- which you don't want to  cut. You can cut or trim off the tip of the nail below the quick without the  risk of hurting your cat. Hold your cat on your lap or on a secure surface to  keep her supported. If you should cut the nail too close and cause it to bleed,  you can apply commercially available agents such as Kwik-stop, to the tip of  the nail to stop the bleeding. Start off by just tipping the nails until you  feel comfortable about trimming them.  </P> <P> Q: I have a year-old, beautiful, longhaired cat who lately has been retching at  various intervals. She was able to eject a fur ball at one time. Is there some  method, treatment or medication that can be used to make the expulsion of fur  balls more bearable for her?  </P> <P> Mrs. Chloe B. Culver, Fullerton  </P> <P> A: Fur balls are common to all cats but seem to be more prevalent in longhaired  cats that groom themselves more frequently. As a cat licks herself, she will  swallow a portion of the hair that is stuck to her tongue. This hair starts to  collect in the stomach and is either vomited or passed on in the feces. In some  severe cases, the hair mass collects and can cause an intestinal obstruction  which may have to be surgically removed.  </P> <P> The best methods for controlling hair that is swallowed is to groom your cat  daily to remove most of the loose hair that she would normally lick off  herself. Give her any one of the laxative medications that come in tubes two to  three times a week to help her pass any accumulated hair. If your cat stops  eating and appears to be ill, have her seen by your veterinarian.  </P> <P> Got a question about your pet?

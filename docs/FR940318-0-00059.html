			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The commentator suggested that the final regulations provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, for purposes of determining whether certain stock is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferred stock for purposes of the regulations, preferred stock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is convertible into common stock should be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating stock if the conversion right represents, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance, a meaningful right to participate in corporate growth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This suggestion is adopted in the final regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the commentator suggested that a conversion right  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitting a holder to receive common stock should always be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated as affording such holder a meaningful right to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in corporate growth. The Service and Treasury have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rejected this suggestion, because a conversion right does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessarily afford the holder a meaningful right to participate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in corporate growth. Whether a conversion right affords a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaningful right to participate in corporate growth must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined on a case-by-case basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preamble to the proposed regulations requested comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the treatment of contingent liabilities under section 108(e)(8).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments, however, were received on this issue. Although the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations contain no provision for the treatment of contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities, contingent liabilities may not be used to increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the denominator inappropriately for purposes of meeting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proportionality tests. For example, the mere assertion by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant that it is owed a specific amount does not by itself  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warrant inclusion of the asserted liability in the denominator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for purposes of determining the group ratios. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Special Analyses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> It has been determined that this treasury decision is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12866. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of proposed rulemaking was submitted to the Chief Counsel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its impact on small business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Drafting Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The principal author of these final regulations is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Annette M. Ahlers, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Corporate),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other personnel from the IRS and the Treasury Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participated in their development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Bank staff plan 2 1/2-hour strike About 100 staff of Barclays Bank in Birmingham are planning a 2 1/2 -hour strike today. The staff, members of the finance union Bifu, who work at Barclays Centralised Securities Office in Summer Road, Birmingham, are protesting at the withdrawal of protection for their salaries following a reorganisation at Barclays. The union claims the reorganisation has left many staff working in lower paid grades. Mr Terry Bray, Bifu organiser in the west Midlands, said: 'Our members have co-operated with endless changes in Barclays and they should not be penalised in their pay packets. Yet some of our members stand to lose more than Pounds 5,000 over the next few years.'</p>

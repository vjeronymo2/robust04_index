			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Organic profits go against the grain - Surprising results from a farming experiment THE COST of switching land from conventional to organic wheat production is about Pounds 800 a hectare. This is one of the earliest conclusions that can be drawn from an experiment begun three years ago at Boarded Barns Farm near Ongar in Essex. Mr Lister Noble, the farm manager, believes his first organic crop of 5.8 tonnes a hectare, harvested last year, was one of the best in the UK - it compared with just under 8 tonnes a hectare obtained on the same farm using conventional methods. To his surprise, however, the gross margin on the conventional crop was higher than on the organic at Pounds 608 compared with Pounds 556. That figure was arrived at after spending Pounds 100 a hectare on pelleted chicken manure after the organic crop appeared to be suffering from stress. 'I was not expecting the higher gross margin on the conventional crop,' he says. 'Even with no fertiliser the organic gross margin would still have been only Pounds 656. That's not much of a premium considering there has been no income for two years.' This is a reference to the need to leave a field fallow for two years before it can be used for an organic crop. In the first year each hectare intended for organic production incurred a cost of Pounds 32 as it was put to grass. The second year saw an income of Pounds 48 from the grass. The third year's wheat output brought in an income of Pounds 555 a hectare, giving a gross margin for the period of Pounds 571. Using a conventional cropping policy, a similar hectare earned Pounds 128 in year one from rape, and Pounds 641 and Pounds 607 from wheat in years two and three, giving a gross margin of Pounds 1,376 a hectare for the three years. Mr Noble points out that most farmers would need a large subsidy to be able to bear such a cost. 'I would be wary if it was my own money about committing myself to it - and we have had good crops.' However, there is nothing a farmer can do about market forces and the premium for organic wheat has come down sharply in the last three years. In 1990 organic wheat was selling at Pounds 260 a tonne, while the price for conventional was Pounds 125. Early this year organic wheat was fetching only Pounds 187 a tonne, while conventional had risen to Pounds 147. The Boarded Barns experiment, which is being run by Rhone-Poulenc, Europe's biggest agro-chemicals manufacturer, is in only the early stages of its 10-year life, and Mr Noble is determined not to jump to premature conclusions. He also vigorously attacks any suggestion that the experiment, which has excited huge interest from outside bodies, will lead to conclusions which the company might be expected to want. 'It is totally unbiased,' he says. 'Every single project is being run or monitored by an outside body.' The company points out that it has not sought out people to join the experiment. Rather, organisations wanting to carry out experiments have sought permission to join in. New studies started in the last year include one by the Agriculture and Food Research Council into the relation between birds and the insect population on both sides of the farm and one by the University of Plymouth into dragonflies. This year Boarded Barns is the display farm for Essex for the Farm and Wildlife Advisory Group. Mr Noble is a member of Organic Farmers and Growers and the farm is registered with the UK Register of Organic Food Standards. The soil at Boarded Barns is similar to that across most of south-east England's grain growing country. The conventional side of the farm has followed a normal rotation policy of milling wheat, beans and oilseed rape. Herbicides, pesticides and fungicides are used when deemed necessary. However, a great deal of attention has been paid to conservation. There is a detailed tree and hedge programme and a one-metre strip around each field is kept clear of all chemicals. Not that the organic side of the farm will reject the use of all chemicals - UKROF has a list of allowable sprays, including sulphur to control mildew. The effect of these will also be studied. 'There is no such thing as chemical free farming,' says Mr Noble. 'Natural products can be quite toxic  -that is one of the things we are looking at.' He believes a lot of the success of his first organic wheat crop can be traced back to excellent weather. For example, he invested Pounds 6,000 in a 12-metre wide harrow comb, which was efficient at removing big weeds when the weather was dry. The little weeds then withered. However, if it had rained the little ones would have grown, and uprooted weeds could have taken root again, he points out. He also believes that Boarded Barns benefits from being surrounded by well-run conventional farms, although he fears the results of set-aside, which could lead to reservoirs of disease. Aside from the good weather, the organic crop was the first from land left fallow for two years. 'The soil has had a good rest. It's first wheat - you always get a good crop.' Samples of the wheat from both crops were sent to the Flour Milling and Bakery Association, which found there was effectively no difference between the two. The flour was then sent to a panel of the Campden Food and Drink Research Association, the authoritative food tasting body, which baked loaves for a blind testing. The results were surprising - the panel preferred the bread baked from the conventional wheat, describing the organic brown loaves as having a significantly more musty/mouldy flavour than the conventional. However, the two wheats were not of the same variety. Future crops will switch the same varieties from organic to conventional and vice versa. Such is the attention to detail in this experiment. 'We may not come to any conclusions for 10 years,' says Mr Noble. 'At the moment all the research projects will say is that we have established a good baseline.'</p>

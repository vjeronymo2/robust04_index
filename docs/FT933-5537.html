			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Divergences among emerging markets There were some wide fluctuations in performances among the world's emerging markets last week, with South Korea losing all of the previous week's rise and Indonesia once again doing well. Among the Latin American markets, Brazil and Venezuela stood out, with respective rises and falls, according to data supplied by the IFC, an affiliate of the World Bank. Indonesia is the third best performer in dollar terms among the markets reviewed, and has recently been registering record highs in the local index, helped by reasonably good interim reports and continuing foreign buying. An uncertain economic outlook for South Korea has been affecting investor sentiment there; while disappointment over the government's delay in detailing proposals to boost market activity also contributed to the market's depression last week. Daiwa's latest Asian equity strategy review comments that the country's export sector has been losing momentum, and the strike at Hyundai group companies, which was finally settled late last month after 10 weeks of disputes, has also had a negative effect on investment prospects. Brazil's strong run came amid hopes for further fiscal reforms and built on satisfaction over recent approval of the government's wages policy which, it is hoped, will contain inflation. The situation in Venezuela, however, remains negative, with investors unsettled by the current terrorist bombing campaign, now in its sixth week.</p>

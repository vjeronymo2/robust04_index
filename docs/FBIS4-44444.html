			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yan Si (0917 1835): "Querying the Theory of </F> `Public Ownership as a Method'"]    [Text] A short while ago, a certain journal published a  so-called "authoritative" article terming the public ownership  system a method with the goal of developing productivity. Thus,  any ownership system is fine provided it can develop  productivity: "there is only one matter of choice in the  ownership system" and we "should make it beneficial to  productivity." The discussant seemingly is entirely  unconventional, truly reaching "non-ideologization," unfettered  by any socialist or capitalist clans. It goes without saying,  provided the economy can develop, any system of ownership,  public or private, is fine!    I would like to raise for discussion some queries regarding  these enlightening remarks. But for a discussion to procede  normally, first there must be the premise that everyone respects  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics  and all intend to undertake socialism. If there is no common  agreement on this point, disapproval of the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics with no intention of  undertaking socialism, then there can be no discussion. Or else  the discussion could only procede in a different sense. Now that  Volume 3 of the Selected Writings of Deng Xiaoping  has been published, we can analyze this issue according to it.    Everyone knows that Comrade Deng Xiaoping highlly regards  developing productivity. He repeatedly has stressed "The  fundamental principle of Marxism is to develop productivity,"  "the premier task of socialism is to develop productivity," and  "to not develop productivity, to not improve the living  standards of the people cannot be said to correspond to the  needs of socialism" (Footnote 1)(Selected Writings of Deng  Xiaoping, Volume 3, page 116). He promotes reform and an  open door policy because the originally highly concentrated  planned economic system had fettered the development of  productivity, "reform is the necessary path for China to develop  productivity." He emphasizes wholeheartedly undertaking the  four modernizations centered around the economy, noting that we  must button up this fundamental link without slack. If we do not  master this point, "it is divorced from Marxism, it is only  empty Marxism." Comrade Deng Xiaoping is entirely correct in the  strategic ideology of concentrating energy in moving the economy  forward. It has the wholehearted support of the people  nationwide and is being implemented by all.    Nevertheless, productivity always develops within certain  social production relationships. No economic activity can be  divorced from society's basic system. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  aforementioned developing productivity refers to doing so within  socialist production relationships rather than being separate  from production relationships and talking abstractly about  developing productivity. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "We must  realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, national  defense, and science and technology. Yet the word `socialism'  precedes the four modernizations; they are called the `four  socialist modernizations.' When we talk now about enlivening  the domestic economy and having an open door policy, they  procede by firmly upholding the `principles of socialism,'"  (Footnote 2)(Ibid., page 138). Clearly, from Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's concepts of developing productivity, one cannot draw  the conclusion that productivity can be developed using any  ownership system. Although productivity may develop a certain  amount by taking a capitalist road, however, first, the speed of  productivity development could not be rapid because of the  constraints of fundamental conflicts of capitalism. Second,  taking this path definitely leads to polarization, it "can allow  several percent of the Chinese people to become wealthy but it  absolutely cannot resolve the problem of the welfare of  ninety-some percent of the Chinese people" (Footnote 3)(Ibid.,  page 64). Thus Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasizes that only  socialism can save China. Likewise, only socialism can develop  China, "it will not do for China to engage in capitalism." He  clearly noted: "if our policies bring on polarization, we have  lost. If they engender some new bourgeois class, then we really  have taken to evil ways" (Footnote 4)(Ibid., page 111).    So then, what is socialism? Comrade Deng Xiaoping's response  to this question is: "socialism has two extremely important  aspects, one is the primacy of the public ownership system, and  the other is non-polarization (Footnote 5)(Ibid., page 138)." In  another place, he also clearly noted: "a public ownership system  is the mainstay, a common wealth. This is a basic principle of  socialism we must firmly uphold. We must resolutely implement  and realize these socialist principles" (Footnote 6)(Ibid., page  111). Some worry that reform is taking a capitalist road and  China has become capitalist. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that it  cannot be said that this worry has no reasoning. We cannot  dispel their fears using empty talk while firmly upholding these  two facts in reply to those who hope we become capitalist.  Obviously, the public ownership system is not a method to  develop the economy. The public ownership system as the mainstay  of our economic development process from start to finish must be  firmly upheld as a basic socialist principle. Although in the  early stage of socialism non-socialist economic elements may  play a positive role in developing the national economy,  ultimately they are not mainstays but only complement the public  ownership system. The primary position of public ownership  cannot waver. If it does, the entire socialist endeavor will be  shaken. Saying "the public ownership system is a method,"  obviously is contrary to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's judgement  because methods can be used or not. The people can choose one  method or another, but fundamental principles are not allowed to  be cast aside or altered.    Why must we firmly uphold the primacy of public ownership?  This question can only be answered with Marxism regarding the  basic tenets of the mutual relationship between production  relationships and productivity. Marxism contends that in social  production, productivity is the material content of production.  Production relationships (their base is the form of ownership)  are the social form of production. The organic unity and  synthesis of productivity and production relationships  constitute a society's form of production. Within forms of  production, the relationship between production relationships  and productivity is not one of method and goal but rather a  dialectical relationship: productivity determines production  relationships and production relationships counteract  productivity. When production relationships are suited to the  nature of productivity, then they can promote the development of  productivity. Conversely, they can fetter the development of  productivity. In line with the development of capitalism,  productivity increasingly has a social nature. Private  capitalism vis-a-vis productivity constitutes an essential  insurmountable problem within the capitalist system itself. It  is precisely the nature of productivity and its development  needs which objectively provided the necessity for public  ownership to replace private ownership and socialism to replace  capitalism. Our firm support of public ownership as the mainstay  is not a subjective choice of this or that but rather it is  because public ownership is suited to the nature of productivity  and can promote its development. Here is the dialectical  relationship between production relationships and productivity:  the social nature of productivity determines the emergence of a  socialist public ownership system, and conversely the public  ownership system which is suited to the nature of productivity  promotes the development of productivity. This dialectical  relationship could not be explained within the scope of methods  and goals. Here the reason why we take great pains to discuss  some most rudimentary Marxist common knowledge is only because  those who say "public ownership is a method" do not even want  basic Marxist tenets.    Those who suggest "public ownership is a method, developing  productivity is the goal" also have forgotten a basic fact,  namely, that no society can have the goal of developing  productivity; developing production merely as a method to attain  a certain goal. The goals of production are not decided by the  subjective wishes of the people but precisely by the form of  ownership of the means of production. Whoever owns the means of  production, social production must serve his basic interests.  Whatever the form of ownership of the means of production, the  owners will have special interests of that nature.  Correspondingly, that will be the goal of social production. In  capitalist societies, the capitalist class' private ownership  system occupies an authoritative position and social production  follows the basic interests of the capitalist class which  determines that the goal of capitalist production is to seek the  greatest surplus value or profits. Under the socialist public  ownership system, the laboring peoples jointly hold the means of  production, becoming the masters of social production , which  determines that the goal of social production is to satisfy the  material and cultural needs of all laboring peoples and to  promote their overall self-development. Socialist countries  develop production to satisfy the needs of the people and this  point is determined by the socialist system of public ownership.  These inherent ties between things are common knowledge to  anyone with a smattering of Marxist understanding, yet  "authoritiative" economists do not even want this most basic  thing.    Considered in political terms, it is incorrect to make  developing productivity a goal. As stated above, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping fully highly regards developing productivity but has  never made it a fundamental aim or objective goal of socialist  society. He has never advocated production for production's  sake. He repeatedly has stressed "our ideals and beliefs are to  engage in communism." Communism takes the greatest abundance of  products as a material base. Our development of productivity is  to manifest the superiority of the socialist system, win a  victory over capitalism and ultimately realize communism.  Economic work is the central task of all of our work.  Developing the economy is to consolidate and develop the  socialist system which is centered around public ownership,  thereby serving the transition to communism. To abstractly and  generally discuss developing productivity while forgetting why  we want to do so will put one in evil ways. A saying by Richard  Nixon, such a monopolistic capitalist class representative, is  worth our deep consideration. In 1983 he concluded after  visiting several eastern European countries that for eastern  Europe, "the time is ripe for a peaceful transition" because the  "eastern European communist party people have fully lost faith,"  "the new generation of eastern Europeans are not ideologues but  men of action and utilitarianism may open a space for a peaceful  transition" (Footnote 7)(Richard Nixon, 1999: Victory  Without Battle, p 169). This passage proves the reality of  eastern Europe's transition. This is a strike against those who  discuss the economy all day without mentioning socialism or  communism. They are busy all day developing the economy but  forget that we are building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    Guess what is the intention of those promoting the  enlightening remarks that "public ownership is a method?"  Regretfully, "authoritative" economists dare not directly  explain. Perhaps this is a way of speaking: say half a phrase,  hint at another. Be complicated and confusing, only suggesting,  not stating explicitly. What the conclusion is is not clearly  stated to allow one to guess or conjecture. According to the  ideological logic of "authoritative" economists, public  ownership is one method of developing productivity which can be  chosen. Private ownership is another. Any method is fine as long  as it can develop productivity, thus, one ought not to propose  the matter of which ownership system is the mainstay. This is  called "rediscovery of public ownership as the mainstay."  Undoubtedly, "public ownership is a method" is a natural  extension of numerous various forms of ownership systems which  do not distinguish between primary and secondary "mixed up  economic" thinking in the previous period. Therefore in any  society there always is the form of ownership of the means of  production as a mainstay. It determines the entire nature of the  form of society and economy. There has never been a "mixed  economy" as a mainstay. If the mainstay is not public ownership,  then private ownership is. Which ownership system ultimately is  the mainstay for those discussing "methods"? Unfortunately, they  do not clearly say. However, their intentions are clear when  related to the temporary clamor of "the results of public  ownership are not as good as in enterprises under the three  forms of foreign ownership or the private economy," "public  ownership has entered a blind alley," "public ownership is not  like market economics," "the private economy is the vanguard of  market economics," etc. Although public ownership is only a  method chosen to develop productivity, and public ownership is  not as good as private ownership, then naturally we should get  rid of public ownership and privatize. Obviously, promoting  "public ownership is a method" is simply the theoretical basis  for privatization. However under current historical conditions,  privatization has to lead to capitalism. The reality of Russia  and eastern Europe have proven this. Whatever the "methodists"  want, why don't they say it right out?!    Clearly, "public ownership is a method" relates to whether  to  uphold public ownership as the mainstay and thus relates to  whether to take the socialist road or a capitalist road. How can  the people be unmoved or silent regarding such cardinal  questions of right and wrong? Analyzing the nature of the issue  a bit, disputing its right and wrong, undoubtedly is beneficial.</p>

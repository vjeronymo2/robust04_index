			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Marco Panara report: "Knight Plans Single Round System To </F> Beat League"]    [Text] [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi's  unexpected conversion from a two-round uninominal electoral  system to a single-round uninominal system has been welcomed  only by the Northern League, i.e. the party likely to suffer the  most if this formula is adopted, whereas the others, friends and  political adversaries alike, are, if anything, astonished.    Astonished but sticking to his guns is Giuliano Urbani, one  of Berlusconi's closest advisors as well as the architect of the  Forza Italia program on the institutions. "Berlusconi has  changed his mind," said Urbani, "he has opted for the  single-round system. I have not; I remain in favor of a  two-round system as indicated in the Forza Italia program."    Domenico Fisichella, the political expert elected in the  ranks of the National Alliance [AN], is puzzled and also sticks  to his original choice, namely a two-round uninominal system.  The Popular Party is certainly not sparing its criticism, nor  is the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], which is sticking  very firmly to the two-round system.    But far from revolving around which system to choose, the  talk is about the Forza Italia leader's conversion. The most  widespread opinion is that it is a tactical decision, a way for  him to free himself from the troublesome accord with the League.  The postelection polls show Forza Italia on the rise and the  League in decline, and if this trend turns out to be a strong,  long-term one, Forza Italia could sweep the League away with the  uninominal, single-round system. Some point out that this way  of looking at things is typical of a party with a relative  majority, the same way of thinking practised by the Christian  Democratic Party last summer.    Except the League is not making any noise. Umberto Bossi's  [Northern League leader] party has always been firmly in favor  of a straightforward single-round uninominal system (i.e.  without any proportional representation). The reason why Bossi  and his party are so in favor of this solution is explained by  Domenico Fisichella. "A single-round, uninominal electoral  system," AN's political expert said, "requires a specific kind  of party setup if it is to lead to a two-party situation,  otherwise fragmentation becomes more accentuated. For example,  if there were 10 parties in a single territorial area in Italy,  a single-round system would result in a very fragmented  parliament. If the League is deeply rooted in one area of the  country, nobody could unseat it with a single round of  elections."    Since this is how things stand, one is led to believe that  by  opting for the single round at this time Berlusconi considers  that the League's roots are being fast eroded and that the Right  in its entirety could maximize its parliamentary representation  to the detriment of the opposition parties.    Fisichella's reasoning, on the other hand, is that of a  scholar: "A single-round uninominal system is a drastic choice;  it gives good results only if the party system is such that it  can promote a rapid change to a two-party system. On the other  hand, a two-round electoral system tends toward bipolarity,  which is different from a two-party system, and nobody can swear  that the former may not be better for Italy than the latter.  The blend between the party system and the electoral system is  like a chemical compound: If both components are suited to each  other the desired result is obtained, otherwise there is an  explosion."    As for AN's electoral interests and the risk of being  absorbed by Forza Italia if a single-round system is adopted,  Professor Fisichella weighs his words: "It is not only a matter  of numbers," he said, "but also of organization. We must see  what sort of party structure Forza Italia adopts and what its  relationship with the citizens will be."</p>

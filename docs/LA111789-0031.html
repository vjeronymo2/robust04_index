			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AGOURA WINS IN MARATHON TO REACH VOLLEYBALL FINAL  </P> <P> After four games and 87 minutes, Thursday's Southern Section 3-A Division  semifinal volleyball match between Agoura High and Rim of the World was even.  </P> <P> So leave it to Agoura to take the fifth.  </P> <P> The third-ranked Chargers, survived to beat Rim of the World, 15-2, 12-15,  15-8, 3-15, 15-8, advancing into Saturday's 3-A championship match at Marina  High in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> In the final, Agoura will meet La Habra, a 15-4, 15-6, 15-8 winner of Anaheim  Canyon on Thursday.  </P> <P> The loss was the first of the year for the Fighting Scots (20-1), the Sunkist  League champion.  </P> <P> "They're a great team," Agoura Coach Alan Segal said. "We've been in a lot of  tough games. I've got to give it to these kids, they played their guts out all  year."  </P> <P> Outside hitter Christy Janssen led Agoura's charge, recording 19 kills and two  service aces. And the Charger senior came through when Agoura needed an extra  push in the fifth game.  </P> <P> With her team trailing, 8-7, Janssen served four consecutive points --  including an ace -- to give the Chargers an 11-8 advantage that kept growing  until the final point.  </P> <P> But Janssen's heroics Thursday only confirmed what Segal has known all along.  </P> <P> "If she's not the 3-A Player of the Year, there's a problem," he said. "There's  nobody better than her."  </P> <P> With Agoura (15-3) leading, 12-8, in the final game and junior Shannon  Carpenter serving on the match's last sideout, Janssen tipped the ball over the  net and it fell to the floor. Carpenter then launched another serve, but the  Fighting Scots could not return the ball in three hits.  </P> <P> On match point, Janssen landed a spike between Rim of the World defenders Julie  Noyes and Katie Ojendyk that sent the Chargers into their second championship  game in the 1980s.  </P> <P> Agoura, the Frontier League champion, advanced to the 3-A final in 1987 but was  defeated by San Gabriel.  </P> <P> Having taken game one, 15-2, the Chargers dropped a spine-tingling second game,  15-12, after jumping to a 4-0 lead and, later, an 11-7 margin.  </P> <P> However Rim of the World middle hitter Tahlia Wagner served four points in a  row to tie the score, 11-11, and Ojendyk added two more points to put the game  out of reach for Agoura.  </P> <P> "We really need to win that second game," Fighting Scots Coach Jill Lawler  said. "Being down 0-2 would have been disastrous (for Agoura)."  </P></p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / BBA rises 53% to Pounds 47.4m pre-tax BBA, the motor components group, reaped the full benefit of cost-saving measures with a 53 per cent increase in pre-tax earnings last year, adjusted to the new FRS 3 accounting convention. The motors performance offset a large downturn in BBA's US-oriented aviation parts and services operations, and virtual standstill in its industrial division, covering industrial textiles to heavy electricals. Mr John White, chief executive, insisted that BBA was well able to cope with an 'ominous' downturn in the German motor industry. BBA's group pre-tax profit of Pounds 47.4m in the year to December 31, up from Pounds 30.9m, was earned after exceptional items and on turnover of Pounds 1.32bn, up from 1991's Pounds 1.25bn. Profit before tax and exceptionals was 23 per cent higher, at Pounds 60.3m (Pounds 49m). The final dividend was held at 5.25p to make an unchanged total of 7.5p. BBA's shares closed at 171p, up 5p. The motor components division saw profits leap from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 31.9m, in spite of turnover up only slightly to Pounds 621.1m from Pounds 595.7m. Mr White said the improvement reflected technical process improvements and other cost-cutting started in 1991, particularly in Germany. After a record year for its German motor activities, BBA expects a 15 per cent decline in the German original equipment market. It expects this to be offset by business gained on several new cars, including Ford's Mondeo and Opel's Corsa. Half BBA's motor components turnover is in the aftermarket, for which no decline is expected. Profits in the industrial division were virtually unchanged at Pounds 35m (Pounds 34.9m) on sales of Pounds 486m (Pounds 458.6m). The higher aviation turnover, up from Pounds 197.8m to Pounds 215.5m, partly reflects the merger of BBA's Flight Services Operations with Butler Aviation International. Sector profit slumped to Pounds 10.7m from Pounds 14.1m, as BBA steered clear of business with carriers with potential credit worthiness problems. With 35 per cent of total sales derived from North American operations, BBA says it is well placed to benefit from what it sees as a strong US recovery now under way. However, Mr White warned of 'harsh' European economic conditions this year. Lex, Page 22</p>

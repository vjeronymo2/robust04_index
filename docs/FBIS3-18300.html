Speaking to journalists on the sidelines of a marathon  negotiating session underway here since Friday [25 February] to  enlarge the European Union to include Austria, Finland, Norway  and Sweden, Andreatta noted that a full report on the episode  has not yet been compiled and that, until then, a final  judgement could not be made. "What is certain, is that the  planes violated the UN resolution banning military flights over  Bosnia," he went on. If these planes were also involved in an  attack, then the NATO intervention would have "even further  justification," he added.    Andreatta said that the pilots of the American jets had  requested and received from their commanders authorization to  open fire.    The Italian foreign minister also pointed out that planes  like those downed today were at the disposition of Croats, Serbs  and Bosnian Serbs and that, as a result, the situation was still  "a bit confused."    Ever since UN decreed the no-fly zone over Bosnia, there  have  been hundreds of violations, he added, noting however, that it  was mostly helicopters that had invaded the banned airspace.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / International Company News: Maddox poised to make its first UK acquisition MR HUGO BIERMANN'S recently listed Maddox group is expected to confirm this week that it is on the verge of making its first UK acquisition and is planning several more. The South African-born entrepreneur, who made a small fortune in 1989 selling the mini-conglomerate Thomson T-Line to Ladbrokes for Pounds 186m, three years after buying it for Pounds 800,000, is at an advanced stage of talks to acquire a privately-owned cable systems company for around Pounds 15m. The move will refocus Maddox from a pure distributor of wire and cable by adding the servicing and maintainence of electrical wiring systems. Mr Biermann is both chairman and largest shareholder of Maddox in which he has raised his stake to 26 per cent. He hopes to buy more privately owned companies over the next six months. Mr Biermann has a reputation as a shrewd deal maker, but has been criticised in the past for lacking the managerial back up to run the companies bought. To try and answer that criticism Mr Biermann has recruited Mr Nigel Smith from Ladbroke as group managing director. He was installed as MD in Thomson T-line when Ladbroke acquired the mini-conglomerate in 1989. Maddox, which acquired its listing in March, has two main businesses, Cables and Flexibles, a UK distributor which Mr Biermann bought back from Ladbrokes last year, and Seacoast Electrical Corporation in the US. The group has decided to expand its UK business first. Mr Biermann believes the liberalisation of telecommunications will offer his company further opportunities in laying cables for new competitors to BT in the UK, while simultaneously expanding on the continent. Cables and Flexibles recently bought a UK company, Cablelink, whose Belgian subsidiary has won orders with several telephone companies in the Benelux installing cable systems.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> BALLET FOLKLORICO DE MEXICO AMAZES AT SHRINE AUDITORIUM  </P> <P> The classic symbols of Mexican identity are, of course, the serpent and the  eagle: creatures portrayed at the very start of the Ballet Folklorico de Mexico  performance Thursday in Shrine Auditorium. However, for Amalia Hernandez's  spectacular company (in Los Angeles through Sunday afternoon), the iguana and  the deer may be equally significant.  </P> <P> The iguana turns up in "Tarima de Tixtla" at a moment when the whole 6,000-seat  theater is vibrating from the energy of 12 couples furiously fanning themselves  with scarfs while pounding the stage with percussive, high-velocity footwork.  At just the point where it doesn't seem possible for the dancing to become more  galvanic, one man and then the others begin to twist and slither on the floor,  surrounding the women, eyes popping and tongues a-quiver.  </P> <P> It's an amazing metamorphosis, one that makes us suddenly reappraise the corps  dancers as individuals while reminding us of the deep links to the animal  kingdom that underpin so much Mexican folk art.  </P> <P> The Yaqui Deer Dance, of course, represents the noblest expression of this  kinship, suggesting not merely animal motion but a different way of  experiencing the world. Other Mexican and Mexican-American companies present  narrative versions ending with hunters killing the deer, but Ballet Folklorico  chooses to offer its "Danza del Venado" as a ritual of coexistence.  </P> <P> This decision is daring -- the usual death throes obviously create a more  dramatic conclusion than the group pose seen on Thursday -- but Hernandez has  never exactly been timid about making a personal statement with this company.  In her new "Feria de Carnival en Tlaxcala," she takes her biggest risk of all.  </P> <P> Subtitled "Folklore of America," this extended suite attempts to sample the  overlapping cultural influences in contemporary Mexico and so rejects any  pretense of ethnic purity. We hear a tango, a polka and even rock 'n' roll. We  see improbably elaborate and anachronistic costumes from some sci-fi Mayan  Melrose. We follow an archetypal Don Juan parable (complete with a puppet show  on the seven deadly sins) about a seducer carried off to hell. And we are  blitzed by wave after wave of decorative, exhausting group dances.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the mix never really ignites, but it proves highly revealing as  it sputters from one effect to another -- objectifying the passion for theater  that has always shaped Hernandez's approach to folklore. For all her  anthropological research, she is essentially a social muralist and in "Feria de  Carnival" she creates a broad panorama of entertainments for the modern  campesino. From a diminutive vaudeville-style automobile to an expansive  bull-ring procession, she embraces them all, and her finale confirms that even  funerals can be quite a show.  </P> <P> Obviously, the program has its share of traditional pleasures -- ranging from  the formal depictions of pre-Columbian ceremonies in "Tenochtitlan" and "The  Concheros," to the explosive Tlacotalpan and Jalisco fiestas with their  exciting live music (in contrast to the over-amplified tapes that accompany  some of the other suites). But even here, Hernandez's stylization of her folk  materials proves distinctive and characteristically bold.  </P> <P> Ballet Folklorico is, indisputably, her vision of Mexican culture (not just  Mexican dance). Other valuable approaches exist, but this is the one with  enough heat and savvy to make the uninitiated into aficionados -- to send  dazzled, middle-class Anglos scurrying off to bookstores and record shops and  travel agencies. Even to other folkloric companies, too.  </P> <P> Obviously, Latinos identify with the company for different and, doubtless, more  profound reasons, but to some of us, the appeal of Ballet Folklorico remains as  irrational and overwhelming as first love. It pulled us out of our predefined  ethnic identities into a magnificent civilization that spoke to us more deeply  than we could have guessed. It still does.  </P> <P> Political footnote: At the end of the performance, embattled Mayor Tom Bradley  presented Hernandez with a city commendation -- and was given a mask by tour  co-producer Julio Solorzano "to ward off evil spirits." He seemed very  appreciative.  </P></p>

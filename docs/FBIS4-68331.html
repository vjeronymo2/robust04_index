Borodkina, Kharkov Polytechnic Institute; UDC  535.511;32/34;536.24]    [Abstract] Samples with a porous, light-absorbing,  inorganic coating based on low-vacuum condensates of aluminum  were studied for the effects of a yearlong exposure to open  space on the Mir station. A before-and-after study of the  thermal radiation and spectral optical characteristics was  performed with the FM-59, TRM-I, SF-26, and IKS-29 instruments  with attachments for recording the mirror and diffuse components  of reflection in the visible and IR ranges. Structural studies  were done with optical and electron microscopy and low-angle  x-ray scattering. For coatings that were 3 m or more thick  and were applied to both sides of a substrate, electron  microscopy revealed that large, lengthwise pores about 1 m  wide were essentially intact after the yearlong exposure. The  pores in the samples with fine coatings applied to only one side  of a substrate, however, underwent structural changes in which  the submicropores coalesced. Those coatings produced conditions  favorable to processes controlled by surface diffusion. Exposure  to open space raised the levels of reflection for the one-sided,  thin coatings, and a substantial dimensional effect associated  with coating thickness was observed on the radiation and thermal  stability for the thin coatings. In general, diffusional changes  in the substructure of the aluminum condensates were the primary  source of degradation of the optical properties of the thin  coatings. No appreciable changes were observed in the morphology  of surface relief or optical characteristics in the thicker  coatings. Figures 3, references 10 (Russian).</p>

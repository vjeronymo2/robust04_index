			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVATIVES REAFFIRM SUPPORT OF 'HERO' NORTH;  </P> <P> CONTRIBUTIONS, FEES AS SPEAKER EXPECTED TO MEET $150,000 FINE  </P> <P> When Donald Anderson, community relations manager of the Manchester Union  Leader, a conservative newspaper in New Hampshire, heard about Oliver L.  North's sentence Wednesday, he remarked: "I'll bet he won't be able to open all  the mail from people who'd be willing to send him $150,000" to pay his fine.  </P> <P> But just in case, Carlos Perez, national chairman of the Miami-based Concerned  Citizens for Democracy, said: "We are organizing already to pay for his fine.  We won't rest until the moment he is fully vindicated."  </P> <P> North -- former Marine lieutenant colonel, former White House staff member,  sought-after public speaker and now a convicted felon -- may not have much  trouble paying his fine on his own. That is if, after he has exhausted his  appeals, the fine sticks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Commands $25,000  </P> <P> North reportedly commands about $25,000 for each of his appearances on the  lecture circuit. At that rate, it would take him only six speeches (not  counting the taxes he would have to pay) to earn the $150,000 fine imposed by  federal Judge Gerhard A. Gesell for three convictions for his Iran-Contra  activities.  </P> <P> "Your notoriety has caused many difficulties, but it has also made you a rich  man," said Gesell. "And where you go from here is up to you, as I see it. You  can continue to flame the myth by which you have supported yourself during  these recent difficult years, or you can turn around now and do something  useful."  </P> <P> While North was not ordered to serve time in prison, another feature of his  sentence -- 1,200 hours of community service in a Washington anti-drug program  -- may prove disruptive, although it will not be imposed until North has  exhausted his appeals. That is 30 weeks of 40-hour weeks, and it could  interfere with what acquaintances say is North's plan to write a book.  </P> <P> Some of North's associates speculate that his popularity is such that he could  win election to public office. To hold federal office, however, North first  would have to win the appeal of his three felony convictions or receive a  presidential pardon.  </P> <P> Whatever North chooses, he must face the possibility that his celebrity will  have a short shelf life.  </P> <P> "None of us have a place in the sun forever," said Gary L. Bauer, once an  official in the Ronald Reagan Administration and now president of the Family  Research Council. "One can envision a time when he will be less in demand."  </P> <P> For now, however, said Bauer, reflecting the views of many other conservatives,  "he remains a hero to many of us in the conservative movement."  </P> <P> He is a high-priced hero. Nackey Loeb, publisher of the Manchester Union  Leader, personally paid North $25,000 to attract him to a Memorial Day  celebration, according to Anderson.  </P> <P> Stephen King, a Republican businessman in Wisconsin who campaigned  unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate last year, said that he was quoted $50,000  as North's fee when he negotiated to have him appear at a fund-raiser this  month to help pay campaign debts.  </P> <P> "It was a hell of a deal for them," King said, "not a hell of a deal for us."  North's appearance was called off, said King, because of both North's fee and a  potential conflict between the fund-raiser and the court sentencing.  </P> <P> Officials of the Washington Speakers Bureau, which handles North's engagements,  would not comment on North's fees or appearances.  </P> <P> North's ventures onto the lecture circuit have endeared him to hard-core  conservatives who love to hear his stern advocacy of aid to Nicaragua's  Contras, his indignant criticism of the "imperial Congress" and his warnings  against trusting Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> At the same time, opponents typically carry signs and shout slogans criticizing  North's role in the Iran-Contra scheme to sell arms to Iran and divert profits  to the Contras. North's sentence came after his conviction May 4.  </P> <P> While his case was winding its way through the courts, North spoke at political  rallies for conservative candidates during last year's political campaign and  he is expected to continue to do so.  </P> <P> North was an asset to conservative political candidates, according to Edward  Ceol, president of the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation, a  conservative political action committee that acted as a clearinghouse for such  North appearances.  </P> <P> Ceol said that North will "have some time to do speeches" but added that his  community service "will handcuff him in some respects."  </P> <P> In sentencing North to work in a new program helping youngsters avoid drugs,  Gesell called North "a caring person" and told him that he wanted the community  "to get the benefit of your organizational and administrative skills, which are  very high."  </P> <P> Gesell said that the program will serve youngsters who live in public housing  "surrounded by the drug culture. The work will involve no fund raising, no  public speaking but a very complex administrative task of coordinating" a  program that combines public and private resources.  </P> <P> The work, said Gesell, will give North "an opportunity, I think, a sense of  fulfillment and a chance to start something good and wholesome for the future."  </P> <P> Many of North's supporters said that his nearly 20 years as a Marine  constituted public service enough and vowed to redouble their efforts to secure  a presidential pardon for him.  </P> <P> Emile Beaulieu, mayor of Manchester, N.H., wishes North had been sentenced to  community service in Manchester instead of Washington.  </P> <P> "If he could serve in my community," Beaulieu said, "I'd welcome him. Ethics  and values are so important today."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE SENTENCE  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell sentenced Oliver L. North to:  </P> <P> A three-year suspended prison term  </P> <P> Fines totalling $150,000  </P> <P> Two years of probation  </P> <P> 1,200 hours of community service administering a new program to help inner-city  youth avoid involvement in drugs.  </P> <P> A ban on North holding federal office  </P> <P> Maximum possible sentence was 10 years in prison and fines totaling $750,000  </P></p>

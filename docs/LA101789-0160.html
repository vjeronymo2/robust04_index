			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FISHING DISPUTE WITH CANADA WON BY U.S.  </P> <P> A joint dispute settlement panel has found that a Canadian rule requiring  certain fish to be brought to shore before export to the United States violates  the U.S.-Canada free trade pact, U.S. officials said.  </P> <P> Under the Canadian rule, all Pacific salmon and roe herring caught in Canadian  waters must be landed in British Columbia before being exported.  </P> <P> The United States charged that this is an effort to protect the Canadian  fish-processing industry from U.S. competition.  </P> <P> The panel rejected Canadian arguments that the landing requirement could be  justified on conservation grounds and agreed with the United States that it  impeded the free flow of unprocessed fish.  </P> <P> The panel was the first mechanism of its type to be set up under the historic  trade pact between the two countries that was signed in January.  </P> <P> "We are gratified that the panel has confirmed that Canada's landing  requirement is inconsistent with the FTA (free-trade agreement)," U.S. Trade  Representative Carla Anderson Hills said Monday. "We fully expect that Canada  will promptly comply with the panel's ruling."  </P> <P> Under the free trade pact, the Canada-U.S. Trade Commission has until Nov. 13  to reach a mutually satisfactory solution to the dispute. If no solution is  reached by then, the free trade agreement provides that the United States can  suspend equivalent benefits to Canada.  </P></p>

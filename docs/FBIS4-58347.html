			<p>BFN     [Text] The Islamic resistance announced that a group of its  men detonated an explosive charge under an Israeli occupation  forces patrol on al-'Ayshiyah Road in al-Rayhani at 1700 today,  wounding and killing patrol members. Immediately afterward,  ambulances and helicopters came to evacuate the wounded. A  second explosive went off when a number of enemy personnel were  assembled in the area.    Elsewhere, a 27-year old citizen, Sonia Musallam, was  wounded  in the right shoulder when Israeli occupation forces opened  machine-gun fire from their post in al-Majidiyah as she looked  after her cattle in Shab'a farms near Halta Town. Soldiers of  the Norwegian contingent of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon took  her to Marj 'Uyun Hospital inside the occupied strip.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (April 26) TURAN -- Yesterday the Chairman of  the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan, Rasul Guliyev, met with  Russian Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev.    During the meeting they discussed issues of mutual interest.    Rasul Guliyev mentioned that the primary pre-conditions for  the development of Russian-Azerbaijani relations must be a  cease-fire on the territory of Azerbaijan.    He said that the war has taken thousands of lives of both  parties. That is why Russia must use its influence to settle  the issue.    Andrey Kozyrev called the conflict "a common pain" and said  that they will use all possible means to settle the conflict.    The Russian Foreign Minister assessed the settlement plan as  a realistic document which is of mutual interest.    As far as the stationing of peacemaking forces of the CIS in  the zone of the conflict is concerned, Kozyrev said that "it  does not mean a constant presence of Russian troops in the  region."    Rasul Guliyev's visit will end on 29 April. He is due to  meet with the Chairman of Federal Session Meeting and the  Russian Duma, the Russian Foreign Minister and Armenia's  representatives.</p>

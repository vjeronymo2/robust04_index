			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M. J. Tzou and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Nice, France, May 2 (CNA) -- Taiwan plans to  contribute US$15 million this year to the "Asia Development  Fund" under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help finance  infrastructure construction plans in less developed Asian  countries, Vice Finance Minister Li Chung-ying said here Monday  [2 May].    Li, heading a 10-member delegation, arrived in Nice Sunday  to  attend the 27th ADB annual meeting scheduled to open Tuesday.    More than 70 percent of the 55 ADB members have agreed to a  proposal to double the bank's capitalization to US$48 billion,  Li said.    Against this background, Li said, Taiwan plans to increase  its annual contribution to the bank's US$32 billion six-phase  Asia Development Fund to US$15 million this year.    Taiwan, an ADB founding member, holds a 1.12 percent stake  in  the Manila-based bank. Li said all ADB members are required to  inform bank management whether they support the proposed bank  capital increment by mail before May 22.    Li said he will issue a formal statement Wednesday urging  the  ADB to change Taiwan's designation in the bank to "Taipei China"  instead of the current "Taipei, China."    Taipei believes that the "Taipei, China" designation  relegates Taiwan's government to a local government and not a  sovereign political entity.    Under Beijing's pressure, the ADB unilaterally changed  Taiwan's designation from the "Republic of China [ROC]" to  "Taipei, China" in 1986 when Beijing joined the bank.    Taipei refused to take part in any ADB activities in protest  of the unfair treatment in 1986 and 1987. It resumed  participation in ADB activities in 1988.    Taipei has since consistently voiced protests against the  name change during the annual ADB meeting.    Li said he asked ADB Governor Mitsuo Sato to seriously  consider the name issue during this year's meeting. "I told  Sato during a meeting Monday that Taiwan wants its designation  in the ADB to be changed to `Taipei China,'" he added.    In reply, Sato said he understood Taiwan's stance and would  pay "special attention" to the issue.    The three-day ADB annual meeting will close Thursday.</p>

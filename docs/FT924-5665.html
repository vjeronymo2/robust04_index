			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend hope for Barclays THE BEST performance in the Footsie list came from Barclays Bank, which raced up 4.3 per cent after two leading broking houses, County NatWest and Hoare Govett, came down firmly on the side of those who say the bank will maintain the dividend when it reports its 1992 figures next February. Forecasts that Barclays may cut its 1992 dividend have been unsettling the stock market for some time. Focusing on Barclays' recovery potential and the dividend, County analyst Mr John Aitken said Barclays was the only stock offering good value in the sector. He expects Barclays' profits to rise from Pounds 75m for the current year, to Pounds 525m for 1993 and to Pounds 1.35bn for 1994. 'We take the view that this is the bottom of the profits cycle and that there is significant recovery potential in 1993-4,' he said. Hoare Govett's banks team told clients that Barclays' Tier One capital ratio will remain around 5.5 per cent during 1993 and that the management will not be pressured into cutting the dividend. 'The shares are 30 per cent undervalued relative to the sector,' said analyst Mr Steve Thorn. US buys Hanson Conglomerate Hanson received a push from the US ahead of full-year results next Thursday. US investors continue to pick up the stock for its yield attractions and the shares lifted 5 1/4 to close near the top of their trading range at 229 1/2 p. Turnover was heavy at 8.5m shares. The rise in the shares was prompted by awareness that the upstate New York broking house First Albany had put Hanson on its 'pick of the week' list. There was also some speculation that Goldman Sachs had raised its dividend forecast. Goldman's Hanson specialist Mr Jack L. Kelly said that he maintained his estimate but did believe it would be up to a penny higher than last year's 11p. He did not feel the group's figures will be be unduly affected by new accounting rules and he is confident that any moves by President-elect Clinton to clamp down on overseas companies will not hit the conglomerate. Meanwhile County NatWest has been recommending Hanson in the UK and US arguing that 50 per cent of operating profits emanate from the highly operationally geared US subsidiaries such as Beazer USA, Peabody Coal, Cavenham Forest and SCM Chemicals. Vodafone strong Interim profits up over 23 per cent and a 20 per cent increase in the interim dividend from Vodafone, the UK's dominant cellular telephone group, were the trigger for an upsurge in the shares. The profits and dividend were well ahead of market estimates. The stock was the second best performer in the Footsie, rising 14, or 3.6 per cent to 401p, the first time the stock has traded over the 400p level since April 1991. Analysts quickly upgraded their earnings forecasts for the full year and for next year. Henderson Crosthwaite moved up from Pounds 310m to Pounds 320m for the twelve months and to Pounds 360m for next year, with analyst Mr Brian Newman saying that the results confirmed Vodafone as 'the most profitable cellular phone company in the world. County NatWest moved up to the same figures for the full year and next year. Mr Patrick Wellington, telecoms specialist at County described Vodafone as a 'defensive, growth and cyclical stock, that offers all things to all people.' Thorn active Sparkling figures from Thorn EMI calmed the recent nervousness in the group's shares and led to a welter of upgrades. Strong cash control and improved cost cutting offset any weakness in the rental business, while margins in the recently derided music division were also improved. Most analysts are now forecasting around Pounds 340m for the full-year, with Virgin records expected to contribute some Pounds 45m. The shares jumped 21 to 796p. Having been under fire from some in the market who believe that it paid too much for Virgin Records, the Thorn management will have been pleased to hear that its former chairman Mr Richard Branson bought an 'undisclosed' number of Thorn shares yesterday. The power generators came under pressure with Smith New Court, the stockbroker, said to have been responsible for much of the selling in the sector. National Power fell to 281 1/2 p before settling a net 3 off at 284p while PowerGen lost 5 at 282p, after 280p. Kleinwort Benson was said to have been the prime mover in South West Water, 4 easier at 503p and Thames, marginally higher at 493p. Lowndes Lambert was the pick of the insurance broking area of the market, the shares racing up 11 to to 300p after the much better than expected 7 per cent increase in the interim dividend. Wellcome rose a further 7 to 1043p. Some securities houses have been discussing the company with Japanese institutions. Shares in Associated British Ports fell 9 to 313p after Kleinwort Benson weighed in with a profits downgrade. The securities house now estimates that current year figures will be between a profit of Pounds 10m and a loss of Pounds 10m, against a previous forecast of a profit of Pounds 30m, to take account of property write downs. Bargain hunters favoured Tiphook and the shares moved 10 ahead to 265p, with volume reaching 1m. Among motor stocks, Laird Group eased 8 to 269p, hurt by a report that west European new car sales are expected to fall by 3.5 per cent next year. Laired is supplier to several European car manufacturers. Last week's downgradings in TI group continued to weaken the shares and they gave up another 5 to 277p. Rolls-Royce gave up 2 to 92p. Market watchers are hoping an analysts visit to the company's NEI site tomorrow will help the shares recover some of the lost ground. Siebe were in demand and the shares hardened 3 to 372p. International drinks group Guinness dropped 12 to 533p as Kleinwort Benson reiterated its sell stance. Food manufacturer Unilever suffered a volatile session as a reported speech by the Dutch division's chairman, Mr Floris Maljers, was taken to imply trading difficulties in Unilever's markets, dealers reported. However, reassurances from the company that Mr Maljers speech, said to be given at a private internal company briefing, referred to the general economic situation and not Unilever specifically rallied the shares. They closed 8 off at 1038p, having touched 1026p. Boots surged as UBS Phillips and Drew was reported to be recommending the stock. The company has been doing a round of presentations recently and has been stressing improved productivity gains. The shares gained 11 to 497p. Good music figures from Thorn impacted on WH Smith, which owns the Our Price music business, lifting the shares 15 to 475p. Dixons were strong as dealers ran short of stock, the shares adding 8 to 238p. Interim results from Argyll, while in line with market forecasts, upset some as worries emerged over the price the company was paying for new supermarket sites. The shares retreated 8 to 365p. Conglomerate Tomkins had a busy session in which turnover reached 12m as the shares gave up 3 to 212p. The UK's biggest textile group Coats Viyella was held back by some large agency crosses and the offloading of a block of 1.1m shares at 206p. The stock slipped 3 to 208p on good turnover of 5m shares. Dawson International announced profits of Pounds 15.5m in the first half, down from last year's Pounds 16.2m, and said it saw no end to the recession. The shares fell 3 to 224p and Mr Khaleeq Taimuri of Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken recommended buying on weakness. Other market statistics, Page 29 NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (56).

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Letter: Diversity benefits electricity supply, despite surplus Sir, Juliet Sychrava's report, 'Electricity surplus of 60 per cent is predicted' (April 24), draws attention to the likely excess of capacity in electricity generation. It also points out that virtually all of the new capacity is gas-fired. The excess capacity is indeed high by the standards of the former state-controlled industry, but electricity users should welcome the willingness of new privately owned companies to compete with the ex-CEGB generators. Britain should enjoy the benefit of diversity in power generation and that includes a role for coal, but the electricity industry cannot sustain itself by pricing its product on the output of fully depreciated coal-fired power stations. Gas-fired generation, using 'combined cycle' technology, is being chosen for sound commercial reasons. It is also cleaner and no doubt eventually it will get credit for that. One of our leading members bought and converted an ex-CEGB power station. With manning at only one-third of the previous level, it now achieves much higher fuel efficiency and double the previous power output - with a massive reduction in emissions. In most industries, that would be considered a good investment. David Porter, chief executive, Association of Independent Electricity Producers, Herodsfoot, Liskeard, Cornwall PL14 4QX</p>

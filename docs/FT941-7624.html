			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Selling weakens unit trust levels Private investors continued to pour money into unit trusts last month, against a background of low interest rates, by investing a net Pounds 534m - gross sales minus repurchases. However, heavy selling by institutions reduced total net investment for January to Pounds 490m. Both figures, issued yesterday by the Association of Unit Trust and Investment Funds, are lower than December's, although the drop in retail investment is only from Pounds 569m. Overall net investment was almost halved from Pounds 895m. Private investors made net investments of Pounds 500m or more in August, October and December last year. January's net retail investment represents a steep increase on January last year, when private investors accounted for Pounds 112m of net sales. The most popular retail funds last month were international growth and UK equity income funds. Repurchases in December from institutions, and to a lesser extent, private investors, were high in the Far East, according to the association, which attributed the reason to profit-taking after strong performance in the region. The average Far East (excluding Japan) fund rose 86 per cent in 1993, according to HSW statistical information. After falling out of favour in 1993, Japan became January's best-selling fund with total net sales of Pounds 268m, of which Pounds 195m was due to institutions and Pounds 73m from private investors. Total gross sales of unit trusts last month were Pounds 1.94bn, and the value of funds, at Pounds 99.9bn, was the highest recorded.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> NEW IMPROV'S CACTUS CAFE SERVES 'TEXICAN' FARE  </P> <P> I never thought I'd live to see a Mexican restaurant (well, not wholly Mexican;  they call it Texican) with brutal, '70s-style design, but here it is. Bare  brick walls, ceilings chock-a-block with exposed ducts and beams, the whole  splash of cold water in the face.  </P> <P> What is this, some kind of joke? Or maybe I should rephrase that: What, is this  some kind of joke?  </P> <P> Because technically it might be. The Cactus Cafe is the front end of a comedy  nightclub, the new Improvisation in Santa Monica. But these ungainly air ducts  hanging down from the ceiling aren't funny. They look like sleep tubes for  klutzy space aliens.  </P> <P> Fortunately, though, the Cactus Cafe is a pretty comfortable room, with its  surprisingly high ceiling and mirrors. It's a pleasant place to sit and eat,  and I suppose a pretty good spot to wait for the next show.  </P> <P> So what do you eat? What the original Cactus Cafe in Silver Lake served, I  presume: Mexican dishes and a couple of gringoesque items. The American things  are pretty good, in fact, particularly the hamburger: a thick, juicy one that  fills a huge bun and falls apart in your hands before you're halfway through.  The french fries are the usual blond starch rods.  </P> <P> The chicken-fried steak is very likely the best in our area. First, it's really  a tenderized steak rather than a breaded hamburger, that shameful travesty  palmed off by a number of Diner Revival places. Second, it's very crunchily  breaded, probably having been deep-fried. Even the best chicken-fried steak in  the world is not an intense sort of dining experience, but this one is really  enjoyable.  </P> <P> The barbecued beef ribs have a pleasant, rootless sort of sauce that tastes  like A.1. sauce and light molasses, maybe. When they're good, or rather where  they're good, they're very good. Some parts, however, may be dry and overdone,  even charcoalized.  </P> <P> And the chili, which Mexican purists insist is an American dish, is excellent.  There are both stewed beef and ground meat in it, and somebody's private recipe  of ground peppers and spices, prominently cumin and clove. The smaller of the  two sizes is more than adequate for an appetizer. I'm a little afraid to see  how big the large size is.  </P> <P> The Mexican things themselves are actually not quite of the same standard. The  appetizer sopes, a little cup of masa, (or tamale cornmeal) are pretty good:  tasty little beds of masa topped with beans and a choice of meats with shredded  lettuce and red cabbage on the side. (I'm glad we're assured this kitchen uses  no lard, because they're really somewhat oily.) But the taquitos, for instance,  are terribly dry despite all the salsa verde on them.  </P> <P> Among the entrees, which come with rice and plain boiled beans, you can order  the usual combo plates. Note: The Sonora enchilada is actually a sort of  aggrandized sope, a thick homemade tortilla stacked very high with onions, a  choice of meats and some pickled red cabbage.  </P> <P> The other Mexican dishes I've tried -- on the menu, incidentally, each is  singled out as a house specialty with a little cactus plant symbol -- were all  in some way or other disappointing. The chicken mole is not chicken stewed in  mole sauce but a chicken breast with sauce ladled over it. Though it's not a  very sweet mole sauce or one dark with chocolate, it is a pleasant one that  smells of anise and cloves. The enchiladas suisas are sort of aggrandized  versions of the taquitos, not crisp but with all the dryness.  </P> <P> I've never understood the rage for fajitas -- maybe some people really crave  tacos made with half-fried onions, tomatoes and bell peppers . . . if they're  allowed to put them together themselves. Cactus Cafe's version is much like  everybody else's, except that if you dig around in the bottom you may find a  nice bit of spice in the sauce.  </P> <P> A waitress told me that the flan is very good, but the only thing I've found  available for dessert is a fried tortilla with vanilla ice cream; a sort of  dessert tostada, I guess. I'd take the one with chocolate syrup over the one  with stewed apples.  </P> <P> She couldn't tell me why there weren't any more desserts available that night.  Personally, I'd have a look in those air conditioning ducts.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: chili, $2.95/$3.95; hamburger, $5.95; chicken-fried steak,  $7.75; dessert tostada, $3.75.  </P> <P>  Cactus Cafe at the Improv, 321 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica. (213)  394-8664. Open for dinner from 6 p.m. daily. Full bar. Valet parking.  MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $25 to $41.  </P> <P> </P></p>

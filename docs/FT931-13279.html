			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / The US puts its poor and huddled masses to work MR ROBERT REICH, labour secretary in President's Bill Clinton's new cabinet, used to set a test each year for his graduate students at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. The idea was simple. The students were asked to vote for one of two options for economic growth rates in the US and Japan over the next decade: either the US and Japan both grow at 1 per cent a year, or the US grows at 2 per cent a year and Japan grows at 3 per cent. The minority group of foreign graduates voted for the latter option. But most of the aspiring American public policy students, and thus the majority of the 250-strong class, preferred the former option - and thus a lower US growth rate - rather than have a faster-growing Japan. The reason, presumably, was that they recognised the link between economic supremacy and political power and thus the implicit threat that Japan poses to the world's largest democracy. There was an echo of this sentiment in the recent remarks of Mr Michael Boskin, the outgoing chairman of the council of economic advisers. Pouring cold water on unease about the supposed long-term decline of the US economy relative to other countries, he pointed out that the US has a growing share of the industrial output of the developed economies and the highest level of industrial productivity. Yet the Kennedy School students should not be totally satisfied with these comparisons. Yes, the US still has the largest gross domestic product in the world. Using current exchange rates, which understate US incomes, Japanese GDP is still only 60 per cent of US GDP. But no statistics can disguise the fact that Japan is catching up. Japanese GDP grew at 4.1 per cent a year between 1979 and 1990 compared to 2.3 per cent a year in the US, although France, the UK and west Germany all posted slower growth rates than America. Mr Boskin is also correct to highlight America's relatively high level of labour productivity, as the chart shows. Value-added output per worker in manufacturing was 14 per cent higher than in Japan in 1990 and 75 per cent higher than in Britain. But, once more, Japan is catching up. Business sector productivity, which also includes energy and private service industries, grew by an average 3 per cent a year in Japan in the 1980s. Germany managed a modest 1.6 per cent a year, but US business sector productivity grew by a mere 0.5 per cent a year. This recent dismal record of US productivity growth in the business sector, alongside a declining share of investment in GDP, helps explain why the US electorate was in a mood for change at the recent election. It also justifies the remark of Ms Laura Tyson, Mr Boskin's successor at the CEA, that America's recent economic performance posed a potentially devastating threat to US living standards. Yet the evidence is slightly harder to interpret than Ms Tyson suggests. Average real wages barely grew at all in the 1980s, while the real wages of the low paid fell sharply. But disposable income per head was able to grow at 1.5 per cent a year, over twice as fast as economy-wide productivity. The reason is that the number of US wage earners grew relatively rapidly as a proportion of the total population, by 0.5 per cent a year. The rise in female employment as a percentage of the female population in the 1980s was greater in the US than in Japan or the main European countries. And the percentage of US men with jobs also rose, by 1.6 percentage points, while the ratio of male employment to the population fell elsewhere. So the growth in US living standards, while slower than in Europe, was spread across a greater proportion of the population. The UK, by contrast, is currently managing to achieve rapid productivity growth, but only because employment is falling even faster than output. President Clinton plans to boost employment and productivity growth during his first administration. But unless he finds a way to increase investment and the skills of the labour force, he will find that these objectives are contradictory.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: NATIONAL ACCOUNTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures for GNP/GDP are in billions of European currency units (Ecu).

Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. GNP/GDP is broken down into private consumption expenditure, investment (the sum of gross fixed capital formation and the change in stocks), general government final consumption, and net exports (exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and services). The US includes investment by government in the government series rather than under investment.  Quarterly GNP/GDP totals are annualised. The growth rates are the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The figures in the fifth column of each set of growth rates refer only to exports, rather than to net exports. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government sources.</p>

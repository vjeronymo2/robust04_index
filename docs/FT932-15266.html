			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Boise Cascade reduces losses BOISE Cascade, the Idaho-based paper, office and building products company, yesterday reported a reduced Dollars 12.1m loss in the first three months of 1993. By comparison, in the first quarter of 1992, Boise suffered a loss of Dollars 43.3m before the cumulative effect of accounting-related changes. Sales were slightly higher at Dollars 984m, compared with Dollars 953.9m in the same period of last year. The company said that the profits figure reflected continued weakness in the paper business, which was partially offset by a strong performance in the office and building products divisions. In the paper division, Boise said losses were below those of the first quarter of 1992 but higher than the deficit recorded in the final quarter last year. Prices of the company's mix of pulp and paper grades continued to decline on average in the latest three-month period, and reached the lowest level seen in the current industry cycle. In the office products area, sales volume was flat year-on-year, but profitability improved due to reduced costs. Profits from the building products division also climbed sharply, due to an improvement in demand and a shrinking supply of harvestable timber in the Pacific north-west, which drove lumber and hardwood prices higher. On Wall Street, Boise shares were Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 25 1/2 at the close. International Paper, the large US forest products group, yesterday reported first-quarter net earnings of Dollars 64m, or 52 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 3.4bn, writes Karen Zagor. A year earlier, the company's earnings were muddied by a number of charges which reduced net income to Dollars 52m, or 44 cents. Stripping out the impact of an accounting change and the costs to retire high interest debt, International Paper earned Dollars 104m, or 87 cents in the first three months of 1992 on sales of Dollars 3.4bn.</p>

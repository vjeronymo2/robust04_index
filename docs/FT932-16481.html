			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Pakistan seeks to allay US fears over terrorist links MR NISAR ALI KHAN, cabinet member and chief political adviser to Pakistan's prime minster, is due to arrive in Washington today for discussions with US officials over recent allegations that Pakistan was supporting terrorism in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Senior Pakistani officials and politicians fear Washington might put Pakistan on a list of terrorist states alongside countries such as Libya and Iran, but western diplomats in Islamabad discount the possibility. 'They (Americans) are not likely to label Pakistan as a terrorist state . . . because it has not been involved in the same sort of anti-western campaigns as Iran or Libya,' a western diplomat said. The Bush administration considered terrorist allegations against Pakistan last December, but decided not to press the case. Now the Clinton administration is reviewing the allegations. The Pakistani visit is part of a recent effort by Islamabad to convince the outside world that the allegations are part of an Indian-backed campaign to discredit Pakistan. Pakistan has also come under pressure from Egypt over allegations that Arab terrorists carrying out attacks in northern Africa are being trained in Pakistan. Last week, Mr Nawaz Sharif, prime minister gave assurances to the Egyptian president, Mr Hosni Mubarak that Islamabad would clamp down on Arab suspects allegedly being trained by Islamic activists in Pakistan. While it appears unlikely Pakistan will be listed as a terrorist country by the US, Pakistan is taking the issue seriously, in part because 'it only adds to previous strains over the nuclear issue', according to one official. Washington suspended military and economic aid to Pakistan in October 1990 after allegations that Islamabad was developing nuclear weapons. Pakistani paramilitary forces arrested the leader of a march on the Indian-defended ceasefire line dividing Kashmir yesterday, Reuter reports from Seri, Pakistan. Officials ordered the arrest of the leader, Mr Mumtaz Hussain Rathore, and 102 followers after they threatened to storm a police barricade. About 2,000 marchers in Seri, a small town 23km from the line of control, had staged a sit-in on the second day of the march, saying they would break through police barriers unless Pakistan opened routes into the disputed region. The march was organised to show support for a three-year separatist rebellion in Indian-ruled Kashmir. Mr Rathore, leader of the Kashmir branch of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's party, was arrested after army officers failed to persuade him to call off the march. Earlier, he had appealed to the crowd to disperse.</p>

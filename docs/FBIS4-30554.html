			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said  the United States should not have made negative statements on  the proposed East Asia Economic Caucus [EAEC] until the East  Asian nations had given their views. He said the United States  should first listen to the views of the East Asian nations.    He said ASEAN will hold a meeting in East Asian countries  soon to discuss the matter officially. He added that when all  the East Asian countries have stated their views, then the other  countries can give their comments. He said this after receiving  the Russian Minister of Culture Yevgeniy Sidorov and the  Secretary General of Libyan People's Congress on Foreign Affairs  (Chad Mujabba) at his ministry in Kuala Lumpur.    He said for the first time, the East Asian countries should  discuss the matter first as the issue affects them. Datuk  Abdullah was asked about the government's efforts to make the  EAEC a reality after the U.S. has opposed the proposal.</p>

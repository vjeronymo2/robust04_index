			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Gilts issue in demand There was strong demand for the five year gilts which the Bank of England auctioned this week, much to the surprise of many gilt-edged market-makers. In its first auction for nearly three years the Bank of England sold Pounds 1.2bn of 10 per cent Conversion stock due 1996. The stock is already available in the market, but the Bank of England was keen to improve the liquidity of the five-year stock. The gilts market had not expected the auction to be such a success, given general concern about possible oversupply. Many economists forecast that the government will have a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement of some Pounds 12bn this year and predict that the Bank of England will have to issue about Pounds 1bn of new stock each month.</p>

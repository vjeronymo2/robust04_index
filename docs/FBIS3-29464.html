			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bangkok Feb 12 (CTK) -- Czech Deputy Premier and  Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik and Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec signed today, along with the Thai Foreign Minister  Prasong Sunsiri, a Czech-Thai trade agreement, agreements on  protection and support of investments, on prevention of double  taxation, and on cooperation of the two countries' Foreign  Ministries.    Kocarnik and Zieleniec are members of the Czech delegation  currently visiting Thailand and headed by Czech President Vaclav  Havel.    Zieleniec said that by signing the agreements, the two  parties wanted to indicate that their relations were "more  intensive and surpassed the phase of acquainting each other."    At the Czech visitors' meeting with Thai representatives  today, the discussion focused on a future cooperation between  the countries associated in the Central European Free Trade  Agreement (CEFTA), comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary,  Poland and Slovakia, and the Asian Free Trade Agreement (AFTA),  of which Thailand is member.    "The agreement on this sort of cooperation is very important  for us, since Asian countries are known for their  protectionism," Zieleniec said.    Kocarnik informed journalists that the Thai partners were  well acquainted with the economic situation in the Czech  Republic, which they found "unambiguously the best of all"  post-communist countries.    "The premier (Chuan Likphai) even said he was sorry about  the  shortage of (Czech-made) Skoda cars which Thailand had  imported," Kocarnik said. He added that Thai bankers intended  to establish a bank in Prague which would promote mutual trade.    Likphai gave today a ceremonial dinner to honour Havel. At  the dinner, Havel briefly outlined possibilities of the  Czech-Thai cooperation on third markets.    Havel today toured some of Bangkok's monuments, including  the  statue of Emerald Buddha, Thailand's most adored Buddha.    On Sunday [13 February] he is to visit the ancient city of  Ayutthaia, former Thai capital.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pawel Reszka, Piotr Adamowicz, and Barbara </F> Cieszewska: "A Few Hundred Enterprises Will Stop Work,  Krzaklewski Says; `Solidarity' Without Impetus"]    [Text] Most of the members of the National Commission of  the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity" ["S"]  believe that the union should withdraw from the Trilateral  Commission. According to them, work in the commission cannot be  a substitute for bilateral talks with the government. After the  lignite miners suspended their strike, the protest of "S" lost  its impetus; however, Marian Krzaklewski has announced tbe  escalation of strikes for today. Anthracite mines are still on  strike; the protest has been joined by the railroad workers,  even though the General Directorate of the Polish State  Railroads [PKP] claims that only 14 employees went on strike --  in Tarnowskie Gory.    Apart from this, in line with the data of "S," 20  enterprises  all over Poland are taking part in a continuous strike. The  unionists are hoping that the deadlock may be broken if the  protest is joined by more railroad workers and if the lignite  miners resume their strike.  <H5>  Presidium Against the Commission </H5>   "Most of the members of the Presidium of the National  Committee believe that the union should no longer participate in  the Trilateral Commission because it does not fulfill the  functions for which it has been set up," "S" spokesman Piotr Zak  told RZECZPOSPOLITA. Minister Miller is trying to make people  believe that the Trilateral Commission is a wonderful remedy for  all conflicts and that it is the committee that should handle  the union's demands. He forgets, however, that "S" is the only  union that signed an agreement with the government (on 29 May  1992), whereby it may begin collective bargaining with the  government, and resolution of the strike is possible through  negotiations between the union and the government. Therefore,  the Presidium believes that the work of the Trilateral  Commission cannot substitute for bilateral negotiations.  According to the "S" spokesman, the present commission,  "without a legal foundation and in view of the fact that the  issue of the representativeness of the unions has not been  settled," is a fictitious body.  <H5>  Krzaklewski: Culmination Today </H5>   "S" National Commission Chairman Marian Krzaklewski said  that  the government's statement that popiwek [tax on excessive wage  increases] will have been rescinded by the end of the year is  contrary to the agreement signed with lignite miners (following  which they suspended their strike).    "In such a situation the union is preparing a strike action  in the power industry; on Friday the Strike Committee in the  Belchatow mine will decide whether or not to resume the strike  in this enterprise," he said. He added that the "S" Protest  Action Headquarters will agree that the mine renew its strike.    "On Friday there will be a culmination of our three-day  strike. A few hundred enterprises will stop work, among others,  the historical Gdansk Shipyard," announced the "S" leader.    It is worth recalling that the "S" Strike Headquarters  first announced a nationwide continuous strike action and then  declared that it would be intensified on 4, 5, 6, and 7 May; all  the branches of the union were supposed to take part in an  active strike.    According to Krzaklewski, through the present strikes the  union has achieved its strategic goals; now there must be  "collective pressure, so that the demands are reinforced."  Asked about the scale of the strike, he stated that this was  just the scale that he had expected and that there were no  surprises: "I knew how many enterprises would stop work." Also  the union's spokesman positively evaluated the course of the  strike; he added, however, that he was not familiar with the  data that PKP had at its disposal. Miners go or not go on  strike.    Today a demonstration by the defense industry unionists is  to  be held in Warsaw, as well as a "S" demonstration in Biala  Podlaska. An eight-hour strike will be staged in the enterprises  of the Gdansk region, including the shipyards and ports of  Gdansk and Gdynia. The fuel base in the northern port will be  cut off, which will make the reloading and reception of oil  impossible.    Yesterday the strike by anthracite miners was joined by two  mines: "Zabrze-Bielszowice" and "Nowy Wirek." "S" claims that  23 coal mines and three zinc and lead mines are out on strike.  The State Anthracite Agency maintains that 20 anthracite mines  are out on strike.    "S" did not manage to organize a strike in the Gliwice Coal  Partnership yesterday. If the "S" plant committees of the mines  that are associated with it do not join the strike, the "S"  Inter-Mine Coordination Commission in the Gliwice partnership  threatened to request the region's leadership to suspend the  present authorities of the union in the individual mines.  <H5>  The Union Is Not the Army </H5>   Off the record, the unionists concede that the strike was  not  as successful as was expected -- even though Marian Krzaklewski  holds a different opinion. They point out that the protest lost  momentum when the lignite mines suspended their strike. Some  criticize the behavior of Strike Headquarters, whose decision  concerning the intensification of the strikes was so sudden that  there was not enough time to inform the Plant Committees about  it and to persuade them to strike.    "There is discipline in the union; however, it is not a  military-like discipline," we were told by a high-ranking "S"  activist. Quite common is the opinion that "S" strikes are  better organized by the various branches, which can add their  own demands and thus encourage employees to go on strike. The  unionists are now hoping that the protest will be joined by the  railroad workers and that the employees of the power industry  will resume their strike, which might result in extending the  strike action.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Mokrishchev: "Thefts at the Level of </F> `Accidents'"]    [Text] Donetsk Oblast -- ...The night shift at the  "Shakhterskaya-Glybokaya" pit was in full swing. The shipment  of coal was preceding normally. When suddenly the alarm on the  control panel went off -- one of the skip elevators had broken  down. They replaced the electronic part of the instrument, but  there was no change.... The duty engineer discovered the cause  and reported that a sensor containing a radioactive source of  cesium 137 had been stolen. Only with the help of this device  is it possible to spot in the shroud of coal dust the critical  moment which is followed by an inevitable accident.    Several hours had passed after the emergency situation near  Shakterskiy, when a still more alarming signal came from the  city of Dzerzhinsk. Here three vials disappeared at once during  the work shift. The robbers did not stand on ceremony, and  carried them off together with their lead containers, which  weigh 100 kg each.    The disappearance from industrial enterprises of radioactive  isotopes with an activity of three curie is no laughing matter.  Hence, the events were immediately reported to officials of the  Donetsk Oblast Association for the Protection of Public Health.  The official investigation uncovered many circumstances of the  theft of the lethal vials -- customers have been found abroad  and, for the sake of relatively paltry sums of hard currency,  people are exposing themselves to the risk of a slow death.    These thefts, which are taking on the character of a real  disaster for Donbass enterprises, are already becoming  customary. Twenty-one such "accidents" -- this is how the  emergency situations involving radioactive isotopes are  described in official documents -- have been recorded in the  oblast. But whereas until recent times 14 cases were caused by  unpremeditated actions and circumstances, seven in the last few  months have been the result of thefts.</p>

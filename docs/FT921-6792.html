			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Profit-taking and early fall in NY depress bourses SENIOR BOURSES ran into profit-taking yesterday and an early drop on Wall Street depressed later-closers, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT consolidated after its recent gains. The DAX index closed 1,722.30, down 6.80, while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, eased 0.29 to 701.69. Volume rose to DM7.3bn from DM6.9bn. Utilities were in the limelight yesterday. RWE opened at the day's high of DM398.10 on a buy recommendation from Deutsche Bank but a lack of follow-through buying left the stock down 10 pfg at DM394.20 at the close. Veba rose DM2.50 to DM374.20 following excellent results from its trading subsidiary, Raab Karcher. The stock was also lifted by a buy recommendation from James Capel. Elsewhere, the supermarket chain Coop rose DM97 to DM2,200 as the trial against its former management started. Commerzbank, which will list its shares in Milan on January 30, eased DM1.50 to DM261.50. PARIS ran into profit-taking after its recent rally. A weak opening on Wall Street also weighed on the market. The CAC-40 index came off a high of 1,991.70 to close down 22.99 at 1,953.53. Volume fell to FFr2.7bn from FFr3.6bn. Cerus, the French holding company of Mr Carlo de Benedetti, remained active, adding FFr1.60 to FFr136.10 with 681,400 shares traded. Dealers reported options-related arbitrage activity. Blue chips which were heavily bought last week fell back, with Michelin down FFr4.90 to FFr164.90 and Lafarge losing FFr5.10 to FFr351. But Chargeurs added FFr16 to FFr1,171 in good volume of 22,925. AMSTERDAM saw active trade in Unilever after it reported 1991 results in line with expectations. The stock closed down Fl 5.70 or nearly 3 per cent at Fl 188.40 on late selling by US investors and reports that US consumer confidence was at its lowest for 17 years. The CBS Tendency Index closed down 0.4 at 125.8 in turnover of Fl 770m. Philips, which reports tomorrow, rose Fl 0.10 to Fl 32.50, while Akzo, whose 1991 results are due today, gained Fl 2.20 to Fl 147.70. MILAN got further encouragement from Monday's inflation data, though some analysts said this was not the start of a pre-election rally. The Comit index rose 4.96 to 545.04 in turnover estimated at L115bn after L91.8bn. Fiat rose by L182 or 3.7 per cent to L5,050, mainly on short-covering. Pirelli was volatile as traders spotted an arbitrage opportunity between the ordinary shares and the rights. The rights jumped L33 to L83 while the ordinaries rose L75 to L1,200. Ansaldo Trasporti was temporarily suspended after a big buy order pushed the stock up by its daily limit of 10 per cent. There have been rumours that Ansaldo will announce a joint venture with Breda in the railway sector. Trading resumed at the official fixing, at which the stock rose L90 or 2.5 per cent to L3,630. MADRID opened strongly on news that the central bank had cut the intervention rate, but fell on a weaker Wall Street. The general index closed down 0.81 at 259.54. Iberdrola gained Pta5 to Pta748. STOCKHOLM closed weaker after results from SE Banken failed to lift sentiment. The Affarsvarlden General Index closed down 4.1 at 927.2 in turnover of SKr311m. SE Banken, which reported an expected 30 per cent decline in 1991 profits, rose SKr2 to SKr45. ZURICH followed Frankfurt lower. The SPI index closed down 2.6 at 1,136.9. Sulzer rose on reports that it would allow foreign investors to buy its registered shares as soon as a stake held by Omni Holding, the collapsed financial company, has been placed. Sulzer certificates rose SFr9 to SFr548. BRUSSELS closed down on Wall Street. The Bel-20 index declined 3.25 to 1,193.64 in turnover of BFr990m.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 25  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open    10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1167.96  1167.80  1165.00  1163.12  1162.65  1162.22  1160.85  1156.42  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              Day's High  1168.86    Day's Low  1154.20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Feb 24    Feb 21    Feb 20    Feb 19    Feb 18 1163.91   1154.51   1149.62   1140.09   1143.83  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

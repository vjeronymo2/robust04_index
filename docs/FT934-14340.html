			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Rival Russian parties target reform vote TWO powerful electoral blocs to compete in Russian parliamentary elections on December 12 were formed yesterday. Russia's Choice, promptly dubbed 'the ruling party' by its critics, was established in Moscow by supporters of President Boris Yeltsin. Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai set up a rival Party of Russian Unity and Accord in the town of Novgorod. Both parties will be competing for the pro-reform vote. Under the slogan 'Stability, Family, Property and Motherland', Mr Shakhrai is advocating market reforms devoid of radicalism, and the transformation of Russia into a genuine federal state devolving economic power to the regions. His main economic strategist, Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations, said reforms had to give more protection to Russian industry and the poorest members of society. Mr Victor Prihodin, a local official from the Ryazan province, summed up the mood of the delegates in Novgorod: 'The regional issue is the key issue now. We are fed up with being dictated to by leaders in Moscow.' Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister responsible for the economy who is the leader of Russia's Choice - an electoral bloc grouping several 'democratic' parties and movements - promised a radical platform of unpopular but vital economic reforms. 'Even on the eve of the elections we will take responsibility for tough decisions needed so that the Russian economy does not collapse,' Mr Gaidar told the Russia's Choice delegates. Its trump cards include unrivalled access to state-controlled media and an extensive provincial network run by Democratic Russia, the country's biggest collection of anti-Communist parties. Its symbol is Peter the Great, the great reformer whom President Yeltsin likes to compare himself with. Its motto is 'Freedom, Property, and Legality' - with an emphasis on the defence of private property rights. Claiming that financial support came exclusively from the private business sector, organisers denied suggestions that Russia's Choice would enjoy unrivalled access to government funds. But with the majority of the cabinet included in the movement and 11 ministers and presidential advisers leading its electoral list, it is difficult to see how this cannot be the case. 'This is a criminal restoration of the idea of a ruling party, like the Communist party,' complained Mr Konstantin Borovoi, an entrepreneur who is leading an independent list put up by his liberal Economic Freedom party. A fourth pro-reform bloc is being formed by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the prominent economist who has his eye on later presidential elections. More conservative forces, including neo-communists and nationalists, are also considering alliances in the run-up to the election. Half the seats in the state Duma, or lower chamber in a new-look parliament, will be elected on the basis of party lists and proportional representation. The other half will be fought for on a first-past-the-post basis in local constituencies where Russia's Choice and Mr Shakhrai's party are likely to put up joint candidates.</p>

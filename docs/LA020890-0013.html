			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CARLSBAD CONSIDERING MIGRANT HIRING HALL  </P> <P> Following the lead of Encinitas, the Carlsbad City Council voted unanimously  Tuesday to study the possibility of opening a hiring hall for migrant workers,  to help alleviate growing unrest between residents and migrants looking for  jobs.  </P> <P> Mayor Bud Lewis' proposal, which will be studied by the city staff, would  establish a temporary employment hall for migrants who have legal status in the  United States. The staff report, which is due in two months, also will delve  into the possibility of establishing a regional hiring center.  </P> <P> Lewis suggested county-owned land at El Camino Real and Palomar Airport Road as  a possible hiring hall site, which is only 4 miles from the Encinitas hiring  hall. Lewis also proposed that a busing program be instituted to make the hall  more accessible.  </P> <P> But Lewis said the proposal is not the entire solution.  </P> <P> "Many of the workers are illegal, and this will not solve that problem," Lewis  said. "The idea is to get those that are (legally) here to become part of the  community and be employed and find housing."  </P> <P> Lewis said the city has little latitude in dealing with undocumented workers,  adding that only federal officials have that authority.  </P> <P> "This plan does not even make a dent in the problem, but if other cities feel  that this is beneficial, maybe we could put some dents throughout the area,"  Lewis said.  </P> <P> "Maybe there's some cooperative efforts with other agencies that would make  sense," Assistant City Manager Frank Mannen said. Mannen said employment  services have traditionally been a state responsibility, but cooperation with  other cities and the county are also being considered.  </P> <P> The proposal comes on the heels of recent confrontations between migrant  laborers and residents in areas where the laborers gather and wait for offers  of work. Two men are accused of kidnaping a migrant worker outside a store on  Jan. 3, handcuffing him and gagging him with duct tape.  </P> <P> The Encinitas hiring hall opened in late November has had moderate success in  dealing with tensions between residents and migrants.  </P> <P> More than 500 workers have registered at the temporary hiring hall, with more  than half of them placed in jobs since Nov. 29, said Gloria Carranza, the  city's transients' issues coordinator.  </P> <P> But the city continues to have a problem with undocumented workers, Encinitas  Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines said.  </P> <P> "In terms of providing a place for people who are legally residents here to  find work, and for those who are seeking day labor to hire people, it is doing  quite well," Gaines said.  </P> <P> The hiring hall also supplies potential employers with a pool of workers with  legal U.S. residency.  </P> <P> "The thing that has not happened is that it has not eliminated the problem that  we have of the people who are here illegally seeking jobs on the streets,"  Gaines said.  </P> <P> Carranza said 60 people a day arrive at the hall, about half of whom are placed  in jobs. About a third of the jobs are permanent, Carranza said.  </P> <P> Carranza said Latino migrants are not the only ones served by the center, and  that non-Latinos have also received help at the hiring hall, temporarily  located in a motor home at El Camino Real and Olivenhain Road.  </P> <P> People have been placed in the agriculture industry, as well as in construction  and landscaping, Carranza said.  </P> <P> Carranza said about 200 companies use the hiring hall, but many employers still  choose to hire migrants on the streets.  </P> <P> "Some are paying below minimum wage and there are a lot of abuses out there --  and this segment of the population falls victim to that abuse," Carranza said.  </P></p>

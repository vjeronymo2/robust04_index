			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Heavy investment costs hit Siam Cement SIAM Cement, the Thai conglomerate and largest cement producer in the country, yesterday announced a fall in consolidated net profits to Bt2.62bn (Dollars 103.3m) in the first half of 1992 from Bt2.81bn a year earlier, although sales rose marginally to Bt26.02bn from Bt25.80bn. The company blamed the fall in profits on heavy investment spending on new projects, including several embryonic petrochemicals plants. Consolidated earnings per share fell to Bt22.08 from Bt23.64. By contrast the unconsolidated results - comprising the core business of cement and construction materials - showed a marked improvement. In the second quarter, net profits rose to Bt1.53bn from Bt1.04bn, giving first half profits of Bt2.54bn against Bt2.02bn and earnings per share of Bt21.21 against Bt16.85. Cement output in Thailand is expected to exceed demand from 1993, but Siam Cement's margins are improving as the company expands its own production facilities to supply the Thai cement market from abroad. Although the construction sector's growth is likely to slow in the next few months, long-term demand for cement should be supported by the start of several big infrastructure projects in Bangkok, including multi-billion dollar elevated road and rail systems. Thai cement producers have also benefited from relatively low energy prices and the falling cost of borrowing. Siam Cement shares rose Bt10 to Bt520 on the Thai stock market yesterday. Siam Cement yesterday announced a joint venture with Furukawa Battery of Japan to produce car and motorcycle batteries in Thailand for the domestic market and also for export to Japan, Europe and Australia. CHAROEN Pokphand Feedmill (CPF), the Bangkok listed agri-industrial and aquaculture company of the multinational CP group, yesterday announced a modest rise in second-quarter net profits to Bt293.08m (Dollars 11.56m) from Bt283.23m on barely changed revenue of Bt2.7bn, writes Victor Mallet. First-half net profits amounted to Bt596.6m, in line with expectations, compared with Bt486.4m in the same period last year. Half-year earnings per share rose to Bt4.97 from Bt4.05. CPF has long been viewed with caution by foreign stockbrokers because of the complex links between the CP group's public and private companies, but it has disclosed tentative plans to simplify its entire structure by making CPF the core agri-industrial company and buying out minority shareholders of Bangkok Agro-Industrial Products and Charoen Pokphand Northeastern, CPF's two listed subsidiaries. 'We just don't want to confuse our investors,' said Mr Prasertsak Ongwattanakul, who acts as a spokesman for the CP group. In the past three years CPF's sales of prawn feed and prawns have grown from nothing to reach two thirds of the company's consolidated turnover. The business is vulnerable to price fluctuations and pollution, but margins are high.</p>

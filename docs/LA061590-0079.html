			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> ALCOHOL SUSPECTED IN TRANSIENT'S DEATH  </P> <P> A 36-year-old transient, who was known for his wit and penchant for working  crossword puzzles, was found dead in Oxnard early Thursday beneath a bush where  he sometimes spent the night.  </P> <P> Philip Christian Montry, who was known as T.J., was discovered in the 640 block  of Meta Street about 4:10 a.m. by a homeless friend who tried to wake him, said  Craig Stevens of the Ventura County coroner's office.  </P> <P> The friend called for help and the Oxnard Police Department and paramedics  responded. However, Stevens said, Montry probably had been dead about 24 hours  when he was discovered.  </P> <P> It appeared that the cause of death was alcohol-related, Stevens said.  </P> <P> Montry, who had a history of alcohol abuse, was a regular visitor at the  Ventura County Rescue Mission in Oxnard, which provides beds and meals to the  homeless as well as running a drug and alcohol treatment program.  </P> <P> Montry, who told friends at the mission that he had once been in the U.S. Navy,  was "intelligent and witty but down on life," said Andy Anderson, assistant  chaplain at the mission.  </P></p>

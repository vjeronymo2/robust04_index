			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> HITACHI, MOTOROLA FIGHT ENDS; APPLE'S THE LOSER  </P> <P> A hard-hitting court battle over patent rights between rival semiconductor  makers Hitachi Ltd. and Motorola ended Thursday with a federal judge ruling  against both sides.  </P> <P> However, in a strange twist, the biggest loser in the case could be Apple  Computer, whose Macintosh product line depends heavily on one of the chips  affected by the legal proceedings.  </P> <P> In his decision, U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton ruled in Austin, Tex., that  both companies had infringed on the other's patent and ordered both to pay  damages as well stop selling chips based on the offending patents.  Representatives of the two companies could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Under Bunton's order, Hitachi will pay $1.9 million to Motorola for  infringement of Motorola patents in the Japanese firm's H8 chip, and Motorola  will pay $500,000 to Hitachi for infringing on Hitachi patents in the American  firm's 68030 microprocessor.  </P> <P> However, despite the imbalance of payments, the decision could be far more  damaging to Motorola, which, analysts said, takes in about $100 million in  annual sales from the 68030. It could also hurt Motorola's customers, including  Apple and Sun Microsystems, which depend on the microprocessor to control some  of their machines.  </P> <P> The 68030 chip is the microprocessor used in all but two Macintoshes built by  Apple. An Apple spokeswoman said the company is confident that Motorola and  Hitachi would resolve their differences before Apple's inventory of the  microprocessor is depleted.  </P> <P> Although she declined to reveal Apple's inventory of the microprocessor, she  noted that the company is noted for keeping its stockpile of supplies low so  that it can receive shipments just as they are needed.  </P> <P> A Sun spokeswoman said two of its products use the Motorola chip. She added  that the company has not yet evaluated the ruling to determine its potential  effect.  </P> <P> Michael Slater, editor of the Microprocessor Report in Palo Alto, predicted  that the judge's ruling would prompt both sides to quickly seek a  cross-licensing agreement covering both chips. Slater said such an agreement  would be indispensable, especially to Motorola.  </P> <P> "There is no way Motorola can allow this ruling to stand as it is. They have to  convince Hitachi to license them the technology for that chip," Slater said.  </P> <P> The ruling capped a yearlong suit and countersuit battle between the companies  that had at one time been technological, manufacturing and marketing allies.  </P> <P> The legal proceedings started in January, 1989, when Motorola, based in  Schaumburg, Ill., sued Tokyo-based Hitachi, claiming that the Japanese company  was using Motorola secrets in development of a series of micro controllers --  thumb-sized devices central to information-processing devices used in  computers. The micro controllers were designed and manufactured in Austin.  </P> <P> Hitachi filed a countersuit, claiming Motorola infringed on some of Hitachi's  patents. At issue was a 1986 cross-licensing agreement between the two  companies that allowed each to use some of the other's patents.  </P> <P> In his ruling, Bunton said neither company was licensed to use the other's  patents under the 1986 agreement.  </P></p>

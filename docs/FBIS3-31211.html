			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava Feb 13 (CTK) -- Slovak Deputy Chairman  [as received] Roman Kovac and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik  refused to resign their positions, despite the vote of no  confidence expressed in them by Movement For a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS) leadership on Saturday [12 February].    Both said at a press conference on Sunday [13 February] they  would wait for Premier Vladimir Meciar, who is also leader of  the ruling coalition partner HZDS, to ask the Slovak president  to demand their resignation.    Kovac and Moravcik headed the formation of the HZDS  break-away group Alternative of Political Realism on Thursday  [10 February].    The two also said Sunday they would remain in the HZDS  unless  asked to resign at the party's congress in March.    Kovac and Moravcik also denied Meciar's accusations of  cowardliness and disloyalty. Kovac justified the creation of  the Alternative as an effort to solve the blocking of laws in  parliament -- by the stalemate between government and opposition  powers -- through the formation of a government which would  include the opposition's participation, but lack personal  enemies as leaders.    One Alternative member, parliamentary Deputy Vladimir Bajan,  would not comment on how the nine current deputies in the group  would react to a vote of confidence in Premier Meciar, saying  they would have to "consider that issue very soon." He did say  that unconfirmed reports indicated that the parliamentary  deputies who joined the Alternative of Political Realism were  under much pressure.    Parliament is to meet again on February 16. Government may  link the expected vote on a privatization law amendment, which  was responsible for the current deadlock, to the issue of  confidence in parliamentary deputies also in cabinet.  Alternative deputies -- who are officially still part of the  HZDS -- could decide cabinet's fate.    Members of the group have said they consider the most  important outcome of their move to be obtaining the agreement of  all parties, including HZDS, for the calling of premature  elections.    Moravcik predicted these would take place this year. Kovac  said the period until any elections could be passed by a broad  coalition government or even by the current cabinet under the  condition it agree with the other parties on a date for  elections and on their advance until then.</p>

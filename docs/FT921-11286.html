			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais considers acquisition of BfG stake CREDIT LYONNAIS, the French state-owned bank, is studying the possible acquisition of a stake in BfG Bank, the troubled banking subsidiary of Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), the Germany insurance group. The move, suggested by AMB, could pave the way for a compromise in AMB's power struggle with Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the state-owned insurer. AGF has, over the past 18 months, built up a 25 per cent stake in AMB in the hope of striking a co-operation deal to improve its access to the German market. But the German group has, until now, been unwilling be courted. AMB has not allowed AGF to take up its full voting rights, instead pursuing an alternative alliance with Fondiaria of Italy and Royal Insurance of the UK. Currently, AGF has only 9 per cent of the votes at AMB. The German insurer hinted yesterday that relations with AGF were unfreezing. 'We have offered AGF a joint solution on BfG. AGF has announced an offer for BfG from Credit Lyonnais and we would assess such an offer thoroughly,' said Mr Peter Matthiessen, AMB spokesman. AMB was seeking the French insurer's mediation in selling a stake in the bank subsidiary to Credit Lyonnais, he said. A formal Credit Lyonnais offer, possibly for 30 per cent of BfG's equity, has yet to be tabled, and the French bank said yesterday it was just starting to study the proposal. BfG is 51 per cent owned by the German insurer, with the balance held by a German trade union holding company. They have had to make two large capital injections to cover provisions for unsound sovereign debts.</p>

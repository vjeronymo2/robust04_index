			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVES ON FREE SPEECH;  </P> <P> FLAG FLIES OVER SOME AMERICAN TRUTHS  </P> <P> No speech, however obscene or inflammatory, injures America as much as the  Supreme Court does -- all nine justices -- when speaking about First Amendment  protections of speech. It almost invariably miseducates the nation about the  nation's premises. It has done so again, concerning flag burning.  </P> <P> In 1984, a protester burned a flag in Dallas to express loathing for America.  Convicted under a Texas statute proscribing desecration of the flag in a way  that would give offense to onlookers, he appealed to the court.  </P> <P> Last June, the court overturned his conviction, arguing that flag burning is  "sufficiently imbued with elements of communication" to be constitutionally  protected "symbolic expression," which the court erroneously considers a  synonym for "speech."  </P> <P> Congress promptly passed the Flag Protection Act of 1989 criminalizing  desecration. Protesters promptly burned flags to protest (among other things)  the act. Now the Supreme Court has agreed with the lower courts that said  prosecutions would be unconstitutional.  </P> <P> The court was divided 5-4, but the decision is fundamentally uninteresting  because the majority and the dissenters do not differ about fundamentals. All  nine justices share the flaccid, false consensus about what the Founders  intended by First Amendment speech protection.  </P> <P> If you agree, as all nine justices do, that the First Amendment forbids  limiting particular forms of expression to protect particular ideas -- if, that  is, you agree that the Constitution forbids "establishment" of particular  political ideas -- the result the court reached is logically entailed. But did  the Founders mean to forbid such partiality toward particular ideas? They did  not. That they did not is, we may say, self-evident.  </P> <P> Sufficient proof (but not the only proof) is that the Constitution guarantees  the supremacy of -- "establishes," if you will, as American political orthodoxy  -- certain political ideas. The Constitution forbids the establishment of a  particular religion but requires the establishment of a particular form of  government. It does so by guaranteeing to each state "a republican form of  government." (Article IV, Section 4.)  </P> <P> Furthermore, the First Amendment explicitly distinguishes religious speech from  other kinds by proscribing "establishment" of (government partiality toward) a  particular religion. Why? Walter Berns of Georgetown University argues,  correctly, that the Founders believed that fundamental religious truth may be  unknowable, and certainly, so far as government is concerned, there is no such  thing as religious truth. But the Founders believed that fundamental political  truths are not merely knowable, they are (as Jefferson proclaimed in the  nation's primary document, the Declaration of Independence) "self-evident."  </P> <P> By forbidding "establishment" of religion, the Constitution mandates  illimitable pluralism and government impartiality. But the Constitution  mandates agnosticism only about religious, not political, ideas. The Founders  knew that a political constitution mandating agnosticism about political ideas  and outcomes would be an absurdity. The First Amendment amends a political  document and takes its meaning from the context of the document's language and  structure, including the proclamation of national political orthodoxy (the  guarantee of a republican form of government). This is why the word speech  should be taken seriously, not supplanted by expression.  </P> <P> The Founders, sharing Aristotle's definition of man as a language-using animal,  specified protection of "speech." They did so because speech is intrinsically  connected with the distinctive human capacity, reason, by which individuals  govern themselves and communities achieve self-government.  </P> <P> After many years of miseducation, the court is convinced of, and hence the  country is committed to, this proposition: The Constitution mandates protection  of any behavior that "expresses" a politically tinged attitude. Today's court  cannot fathom that the Founders used language with a precision -- a precision  born of philosophic clarity and subtlety -- that is foreign to the court.  </P></p>

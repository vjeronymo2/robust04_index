Liu Guoguang, a noted Chinese economist and vice president of  the China Academy of Social Sciences, comprehensively elaborated  his views and opinions on these questions this morning during a  colloquium jointly sponsored by the provincial government  general office and research center.    Liu Guoguang pointed out that the modern enterprise system  differs from the conventional state-owned enterprise management  mechanism in six aspects: 1) It operates on the basis of clearly  defined property right relations; 2) it is characterized by the  separation between government administration and enterprise  management; 3) it is characterized by diversified investments;  4) it is run to achieve a single objective--the very function  and target of modern enterprises is to make profit; 5) it  practices limited liability management; and 6) it pursues the  principle of survival of the fittest and lets enterprises  operate under a competitive mechanism.    Liu Guoguang also presented his opinions on the ongoing  project to introduce the company system into state-owned  enterprises and on other supporting reforms as well.    Executive Vice Governor Lu Ruihua presided over the  colloquium today.</p>

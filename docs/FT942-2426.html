			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Danes seek Maastricht amendment The Danish Social Democratic party, trying to restore its fortunes after a poor performance in last week's European Parliament elections, is seeking an amendment to the Maastricht treaty to ensure that environmental safety takes precedence over European free trade in goods. The SDP is Denmark's largest party, with 69 seats in the 179-seat Folketing (parliament), and it dominates the centre-left coalition government. Mr Ove Fich, a former Euro-MP and the party's parliamentary spokesman on European affairs, said the party intended to make the environmental issue the main plank in the Danish position at the 1996 inter-governmental conference at which the future shape of Europe would be discussed. 'It must be affirmed by treaty that consumer interests, the environment and the work environment take precedence over free trade,' said Mr Fich.</p>

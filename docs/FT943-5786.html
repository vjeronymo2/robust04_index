			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Peril of fragmentation over free trade pacts - UN economist warns Latin America against forming 'fortresses' Latin America must not allow the web of free trade agreements across the region to fragment into 'four or five fortresses', but should strive for greater integration, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean urges. Bilateral and multilateral accords, now numbering more than 30, could 'merge into one great bloc or, on the downside, divide the region,' Mr Gert Rosenthal, commission executive secretary, said in an interview. As well as 22 bilateral accords, several sub-regional pacts have been formed recently, including the tripartite North American Free Trade Agreement of the US, Canada and Mexico; the Mercosur customs union of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay; and the Group of Three, made up of Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela. Blocs are also emerging in Central America and the Caribbean basin. Mr Rosenthal said there was a danger that the outbreak of such accords was merely re-directing trade rather than creating it. Regional trade had grown 'spectacularly' - exports within the region have increased at 50 per cent a year since 1990 - but it was very difficult to pinpoint cause and effect. 'We don't know how much of (the increasing trade) is due to the existence of preferential treatment, how much is due to the indirect effect of business communities becoming aware of each other, or how much would have happened anyway in the absence of a trade agreement.' What seemed certain was that nations on the margins of free trade pacts  - such as Caribbean states in the case of Nafta - were likely to lose out, both in terms of trade and of investment, he said. Even Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, had claimed that preferential agreements within Nafta, particularly those pertaining to capital goods, had resulted in lost trade worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Multiple pacts had also created an administrative bureaucracy that militated against efficient commerce, Mr Rosenthal said. Tariffs on the same product could vary enormously, depending on the country of origin and the stage of a given treaty, most of which phased in preferential treatment. Mr Rosenthal was not seeking to call a halt to the process. 'What we're saying is: 'Why don't you proceed with these trade agreements in such a way as to minimise the risks of trade deviation and maximise the potential of trade creation?'' Governments could move in this direction by standardising trade agreements, using Gatt rules as their starting point, and by broadening the range of goods covered by pacts. Nations should join existing accords rather than form bilateral alliances. 'It is ridiculous that there are 22 bilateral trade agreements. We would like to see them multilateralised as quickly as possible.' In this respect, Mr Rosenthal thought Chile should join Nafta, rather than sign a separate accord with the US. He also supported Chile's initiative to become an associate member of Mercosur. 'I would like to see Chile taking on both commitments simultaneously,' he said. 'Conceptually, they are not saying they are going to join Nafta but turn their back on the rest of the region. They are trying to do in practice what we are preaching - that is to take on multiple commitments.' On the positive side, Mr Rosenthal thought that Latin American governments, nearly all civilian and democratically elected, shared a political vision of closer integration. 'There is a more favourable environment for actually doing these things. There was a lot more rhetoric 10 or 15 years ago.' The concept of integration, in the 1960s driven by notions of import substitution, has now shifted to free-market terrain. 'Governments are trying to rediscover the meaning of international integration in a more open trading system.' But the danger of economic fortresses and continental fragmentation still existed. One possibility - 'not necessarily desirable' - was that political realities in the US would halt the expansion of Nafta and that Brazil's proposal for a South American free-trade area would take off. 'Maybe, by 2000, you will have a fairly solid regional bloc in South America and another in North America. 'It is too early to tell where all this will lead,' Mr Rosenthal said. 'It could have a happy ending. On the other hand, the ending may be more complex.'</p>

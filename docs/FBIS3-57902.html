			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that the  incidents in Belgium show us the proportions that such incidents  might attain in the event the separatist terror organization is  not banned in the other European countries as well.    Cetin was replying to an off agenda speech delivered by Baki  Durmaz, True Path Party deputy from Afyon, at the Turkish Grand  National Assembly that met under Yasin Hatipoglu today. He said:    [Begin Cetin recording] While our workers employed in Europe  are deprived of the right of free movement, certain countries  grant the right of free circulation to terror organizations.  This stand, of course, has begun to disrupt the public order in  the countries concerned. Some 200 militants arriving from  Germany caused the recent incidents in Brussels. Following  these incidents, the Foreign Ministry has taken all the  necessary steps, be they at headquarters or in Brussels, and has  shown the necessary reaction and interest. In a bid to contain  the incidents, all the personnel at our embassy and our  consulate general as well as all the religious personnel and  teachers in the region have tried to soften and ease the  situation. Certain Belgian press organs or officials are trying  to give the impression that the incidents occurred between  ethnic groups. The issue is not a Turkish-Kurdish clash. The  issue is not a clash among our citizens. It is an incident that  occurred between a terror organization and our citizens. [end  recording]    Referring to the phone conversation he held with the Belgian  foreign minister yesterday, Cetin recalled that he told the  minister that if measures are not taken the incidents might  spread to other European cities as well. He added that the  issue will be brought up again at the NATO member countries  meeting to be held on Sunday [9 January].</p>

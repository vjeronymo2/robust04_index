			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Clementina Filip and Daniel Uncu: "The PD-PDSR </F> Bilateral Negotiations Have Concluded for Good"]    [Text] It seems that the efforts made by the opposition to  convince the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] to attempt  a possible modification of the parliamentary majority have  failed. The result of the last round of PD [Democratic  Party]-PDSR talks, which was held yesterday, 26 April at the  headquarters of the Senate, can be summed up through Adrian  Nastase's [executive president of the PDSR] statement: "The  talks have concluded for good!"    Sources of the negotiating teams revealed that, in the  attempt to divert attention from the major objective of the  negotiations (that is, the modification in the parliamentary  majority) the ruling party proposed that a draft accord  regarding the political conduct and cooperation between the  parliamentary parties and the PDSR, as well as a draft economic  and social program for 1994 that was to be examined by experts  of other parties, should be discussed. The PD negotiators  believed that the ruling party's proposals regarding previous  demands of the opposition and of Mr. Roman's party were  insufficient and inopportune. Therefore, eventually, the sides  proceeded to discussions on the issue of parliamentary  restructuring. The same sources revealed that the PDSR took  into consideration the variation in which the PUNR [Romanian  National Unity Party] should be one of the balancing factors of  this majority. In turn, the PD negotiators rejected the  proposal, which they considered inadequate from the opposition's  viewpoint. Considering that the power of invention of the PDSR  is unlimited when it comes to political "arrangements," they  proposed that the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian Democratic  Party] together with the PD and the PDSR should participate in a  possible government formula. Not being able to start  negotiations on behalf of the PNTCD, the PD proposed a summit  meeting with all leaders of the opposition (in spite of the  PDSR's aversion to the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania  and the Liberal Party '93), a meeting that should create the  common ground for discussions.    In practical terms, in this way, these negotiations could  continue endlessly if the ruling party is not determined to take  a clear decision.    Here are the statements of those who carried out the  negotiations:    Ion Solcanu, representing the PDSR: "This stage of the  negotiations has to conclude with a proper examination of the  economic and political situation in our country. Likewise, our  talks identify the necessary solutions to overcome the current  deadlock. The dialogue might be extended to other opposition  parties as well."    Adrian Severin, representing the PD: "As far as we are  concerned, we cannot accept political bigamy. We cannot accept  that the PDSR cooperates with the parties included in the  current pentagon [PDSR, PUNR, Greater Romania Party, Socialist  Party of Labor, and the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania]  and, at the same time, with the opposition parties, in a  possible parliamentary or government formula. The PDSR has  still not succeeded in understanding the fact that it is not  possible to propel the country toward democracy together with  extremist parties or nostalgic-restoration parties. The talks  have concluded for good, in spite of our efforts."</p>

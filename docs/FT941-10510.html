			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Leading Article: EU secrets Ever since Danish voters rejected the Maastricht treaty in June 1992, the governments they thus rebuffed have spoken frequently of the European Union's need to improve its image by showing greater 'openness'. Unfortunately, the rhetoric about transparency and accountability is still mocked by the practice. Debates in the council of ministers remain shrouded in unnecessary secrecy. The Commission, for all its promises of a more systematically open approach, has yet to produce change where it matters. Now the member states are becoming embroiled in an embarrassing legal wrangle over attempts to limit public access to information on their decisions. The member states cannot be faulted on the stated aim of their code of conduct on information, which is to allow unrestricted access except where monetary stability, national security, commercial confidentiality, privacy or relations with non-member countries might be endangered. In December, however, the council, by majority vote, inserted an exemption giving EU institutions the right to reject requests for information that could be 'contrary to the efficiency and good order of the institution'. Infuriated by this potentially open-ended confidentiality clause, the Dutch government has decided to seek annulment of the code of conduct in the European Court on the grounds that a purported attempt to improve the rights of EU citizens should have been settled by unanimity rather than majority. Its action is thoroughly welcome. If the December decision is not changed, it will seriously undermine such moves to 'openness' as have already occurred and allow EU institutions to maintain their traditional approach: that all information is secret unless they decide otherwise. Reversing this move, however, will only be a first step in bringing genuine transparency to EU affairs. Ideally, the Union would adopt a comprehensive freedom of information act along US lines, and allow the full televising of its main legislative body, the council. As a basic minimum, it should publish the full agenda before council meetings and disclose how governments voted thereafter. Only then will the citizens of EU member states be able to exercise proper scrutiny of the decisions being taken secretly in their name in Brussels.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> TEACHERS' PAY RAISE GETS TENTATIVE OK  </P> <P> Conejo Valley teachers would receive a 20% raise over the next three years  under a tentative agreement reached Friday, union and school district officials  said.  </P> <P> Negotiations between representatives of the United Assn. of Conejo Teachers and  the Conejo Valley Unified School District wrapped up Thursday night, followed  by a closed session discussion by school board members.  </P> <P> The union's executive board, representing 712 teachers, unanimously approved  the tentative agreement Friday morning.  </P> <P> The school board is scheduled to consider the proposed contract at its Jan. 10  meeting.  </P> <P> Union members will vote on it Jan. 23.  </P> <P> The proposed new contract calls for a 7% raise in the 1990-91 and 1991-92  school years and a 6% raise for the 1992-93 school year, which union officials  say will bring teachers' salaries in line with those of neighboring school  districts. The union was seeking a combined 22% raise over the three years.  </P> <P> "It was close enough that I feel we met our goals," said Hal Vick, executive  director of the union. "This does a lot to make up for past sins of the  district."  </P> <P> Class size will be reduced from a maximum 37 students to 36 students for grades  four through six. The size of secondary physical education classes also may be  reduced due to a new class-size formula.  </P> <P> Teachers will receive a small lottery bonus in early 1991, but will no longer  get a portion of the district's lottery funds.  </P> <P> "The teachers got an excellent contract," Assistant Supt. Leean Nemeroff said.  "The district addressed as many issues as we could." STEPHANIE STASSEL  </P></p>

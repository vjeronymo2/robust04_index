			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Call for referendum dismissed by Lang MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, said yesterday that campaigners for a referendum on Scotland's political future were 'scurrying around like headless chickens, seeking a re-run of the general election in the hope of getting a different result', James Buxton writes. Since the election there has been growing pressure for a multi-option referendum on Scotland's constitutional future. On Tuesday the Scottish Trades Union Congress called for a referendum. The Scottish National party is also seeking one. Mr Lang dismissed a call for 'civil disobedience within the law'. The call was issued on Tuesday by Mr Charles Gray, Labour leader of Strathclyde Regional Council, Scotland's largest local authority, as part of the campaign to win constitutional change in Scotland. Mr Lang said it was a case of 'post-election rhetoric' as well as a contradiction in terms. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said yesterday that the case for a referendum was 'unanswerable'. Refusal would cause 'bitterness and frustration', he told the Scottish TUC annual conference in Perth.</p>

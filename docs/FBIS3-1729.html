Kosei Fukunaga, second daughter of Pu Jie, spoke with  reporters the day after his death and eulogized him as a kind,  loving and unselfish father who was like a saint to her.    Half of Pu Jie's ashes will return with his daughter to  Japan  and the other half will remain in China, she said.    The remains of Pu Jie's wife and eldest daughter, which have  stayed in Beijing, will be kept together in Nakayama shrine, she  said.    Pu Jie's younger brother, Aisin Giorro Pu Ren, joined her.    "While he was living, father felt that he was indebted to  many of his Japanese and Chinese friends," Fukunaga said  solemnly in recalling the latter part of Pu Jie's life after New  China was established.    "Father's most unhappy thoughts were that mother died before  he," she said.    Dressed in a finely cut black jacket and matching skirt,  Fukunaga, 53, remained composed while discounting Pu Jie's role  as a high-level military official in the puppet state of  Manchuria, set up by the Japanese Government in the early 1930s.    "In such a wartime situation, he didn't have much choice,"  she said, adding that overcoming such an "adverse situation"  made Pu Jie a better person in later life.    Pu Jie, the younger brother of the last emperor of the Qing  dynasty, Aisin Giorro Pu Yi, died Monday morning in a Beijing  hospital from complications due to pneumonia and an enlarged  thyroid gland.    His funeral will be held on Monday at Beijing's Babaoshan  cemetery.</p>

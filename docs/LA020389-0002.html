			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELAINE DE KOONING, 68; NOTED ARTIST, COMMENTATOR, PROFESSOR  </P> <P> Elaine de Kooning, an artist whose works ranged from realism to abstraction for  more than 30 years, died Wednesday of lung cancer. She was 68.  </P> <P> She entered Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia in November and she was  diagnosed as having cancer. She had been hospitalized in New York the last two  weeks and died early Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I always say I'm an escape artist," she told art critic Rose Slivka when asked  to describe her style. "Style is something I've always tried to avoid. I'm more  interested in character."  </P> <P> Her works are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim  Museum in New York and are featured in other institutions throughout the  country.  </P> <P> She was married to Willem de Kooning, a renowned abstractionist, for 45 years.  Asked by a Times art writer in 1984 how she reconciled their careers, she said  she never believed she operated in his shadow.  </P> <P> "I was working in his light," she said emphatically.  </P> <P> Over the years she established herself both in and out of her studio, as art  commentator and as a professor at the University of New Mexico, University of  Pennsylvania and Yale University.  </P> <P> She was born Elaine Catherine Fried in 1920. She attended Hunter College, then  switched to the Leonardo da Vinci Art School in Manhattan, where she found  friends active in the abstract and realism movement.  </P> <P> She met De Kooning about that time, and they were married Dec. 9, 1943, about  five years after she had become his private student.  </P> <P> Her first solo exhibition was in 1952 at the Stable Gallery in New York. Her  most recent work was inspired by Paleolithic cave paintings of Lascaux in  France and Altamira in Spain.  </P> <P> When she was taken with a theme, as she was with the caves, or with the first  bullfight she saw three decades ago, she drew series of watercolor sketches  before immersing herself in a single picture.  </P> <P> She also was considered a talented portraitist and was commissioned to do two  portraits of John F. Kennedy. One hangs in the Truman Library in Independence,  Mo., the other in the Kennedy Library in Cambridge, Mass.  </P></p>

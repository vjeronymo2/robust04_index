			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Paivi Repo: "Blood Donor Center Quizzes Donors </F> Closely on Their Sexual Behavior"]    [Text] On Tuesday [5 April] the Finnish Red Cross adopted a  new form with which blood donors are more closely than before  questioned with regard to diseases and sexual behavior.    The blood donor has to indicate whether he or she has high  blood pressure or allergies, has ever had malaria, and whether  he or she has suffered from a sexually transmitted disease  during the current year. The organization is trying to pinpoint  so-called risk users by asking donors more personal questions  than before.    The donor has to indicate whether he or she has had partners  other than his or her regular sex partner during the past two  months, whether he has had sexual relations for which he paid  during the past year, or whether he or his regular partner has  ever used drugs injected with a needle or narcotic medications.  Men are asked whether they have had sexual relations with a man.    "We don't want any risk to either the donor or the recipient  stemming from the donation of blood," chief physician Tom  Krusius emphasized.    The donor is reminded in the form that he must be over 18  but  under 65 years old and weigh at least 50 kg. If he suspects that  he may have been infected with HIV or hepatitis, he should not  give blood for two months following the [suspected] infection.  During that period he could infect someone else, even though the  infection does not show up in the test.  <H5>  Less Than 100 Cases of Infection a Year Found </H5>   The blood donor center looks for syphilis and hepatitis B  and  C, which cause inflammations of the liver. Nearly 100 cases of  hepatitis infection, nine of syphilis, and only one of HIV were  found last year.    About 300,000 bags of blood a year are given and there are  180,000 donors. The average donor is a 38-year-old male who has  given blood eight times.    The blood donor center constantly needs new donors when the  old ones drop out. However, risk users will not do because "the  epidemiology of the HIV virus has changed. People living in a  heterosexual relationship and women are becoming infected  increasingly more often," Tom Krusius said. Homosexual males  account for nearly half of the cases of HIV infection in Finland.    Every blood unit that is given is tested in the laboratory  and any viruses remaining are killed by heating or chemically  treating the blood. About 350,000 units of blood products a year  are administered, but not a single case of HIV infection  transmitted by blood products has occurred since testing was  begun, that is, in nine years. Three Finns were infected with  HIV through blood transfusions abroad.</p>

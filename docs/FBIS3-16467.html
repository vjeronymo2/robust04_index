He emphasized that the  matter was up to the Russian and Ukrainian presidents to decide.    Baltin said so in response to the last week's remarks made  by  Vladimir Beskorovainiy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy, who  said that "Ukraine no longer raises the possibility of  transferring Black Sea Fleet ships to Russia as payment for  debts accrued from oil and gas supplies." Beskorovainiy  believed that the document signed in Massandra was a protocol of  intent, not an agreement. "The fleet has to be split half and  half before the end of 1995," Beskorovainiy emphasized.    Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy commander-in-chief of  the Russian Navy, commented on Beskorovainiy's remarks by saying  that the Massandra document "might be a protocol of intent, but  it was signed by the presidents."    "If these remarks had been made by Kravchuk, this would make  all the difference," Kasatonov said.    As he put it, "a political decision was made which  recognized  the interests of the world community as well as Russia. The  world views Russia as a reliable and strong partner who is  acting for peace, calm and stabilization."    The presidents of Ukraine and Russia Leonid Kravchuk and  Boris Yeltsin signed an agreement in Mukholatka, near Yalta,  whereby the Black Sea Fleet was to be the core of the Russian  and Ukrainian navies. Until the two navies are formed the fleet  was to be jointly commanded by the two presidents.    The presidents signed another agreement in Moscow on June  17,  1993, on dividing the fleet half and half.    Under their latest agreement signed in Massandra, southern  Crimea, on September 3, 1993 Ukraine was to transfer its part of  the Black Sea Fleet to Russia as payment for supplies of Russian  fuel. The specifics of the compensation mechanism and the use of  naval bases in the Crimea was to be agreed on later through  negotiations. The procedure of evaluating the fleet's assets was  to be negotiated within a month, but the talks became deadlocked.</p>

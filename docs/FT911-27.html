			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Fletcher Challenge shares placed FLETCHER Challenge (FCL) yesterday announced it had successfully placed NZDollars 195m (USDollars 115m) worth of shares with international institutional investors in a move designed to ease its debt burden. However, the company did not announce the fate of a further 25m shares which were being offered as oversubscriptions and were not underwritten. It is hoped these shares would raise the total to NZDollars 292.5m. News of the unexpected placement forced the share prices sharply lower yesterday, ending a month-long rally. FCL dropped 22 cents to NZDollars 3.92, which was 2 cents above the placement price for the 50m shares. The placement was underwritten by brokers CS First Boston NZ and Potter Warburg Markets. Mr Hugh Fletcher, FCL chief executive officer, said the placement showed international investors strongly supported the New Zealand company which has diverse holdings in the forestry products and building materials industries. An FCL spokesman said the additional funds would represent a reduction in group debt levels of about 1.4 per cent. The company last month revised its forecasts, warning that full-year profits might be about 10 per cent below the NZDollars 662.4m for the year to June 30 1990. FCL, the second largest newsprint producer in the world, has suffered from declining demand for its paper and a drop in prices for pulp and timber. The spokesman said capital spending peaked last year at NZDollars 1.3bn and was expected to fall to about NZDollars 800m. He said the group had to sell all its property interests, valued at about NZDollars 500m held through Fletcher Construction and Challenge Properties.</p>

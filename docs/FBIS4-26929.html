			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Top Chinese leader Li  Ruihuan had an hour-long discussion here today with Kwok  Ping-sheung, chairman of Sun Hung Kai, one of the biggest real  estate companies in Hong Kong.    Sun Hung Kai and the Beijing Dongan Group have decided to  invest 300 million U.S. dollars to rebuild the Dongan market in  downtown Beijing into a modern business center. The new market  is scheduled to open in 1996.    Li, a standing committee member of the Political Bureau of  the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and chairman of  the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, praised Sun Hung Kai for making  investment in the mainland.    Li also praised Kwok and other Hong Kong residents for their  efforts in upholding Hong Kong's prosperity and stability,  hoping that they will work together for Hong Kong's smooth  transition and its prosperity and stability after July 1, 1997.</p>

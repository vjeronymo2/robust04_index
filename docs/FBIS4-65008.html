			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Harald Stanghelle report: "Progress Party Below </F> Representation Threshold"]    [Text] The Progress Party's voters are leaving the party.  Only some 3.5 percent of voters support the party, Opinion's May  poll shows.    The poll is based on 1,000 interviews carried out on Monday  to Wednesday [2-4 May] this week. This means that most  respondents were interviewed after it became known that three of  the Progress Party's Storting deputies were leaving the party.    Voters' reaction to what is happening is clear: Opinion's  poll on party standings tells of a party in free-fall. In  comparison with last month the Progress Party has lost 0.8  percent. This in itself is nothing dramatic. But the April  poll was already showing a very poor result -- 4.3 percent voter  support -- and with today's 3.5 percent the Progress Party has  for the first time in many years fallen below the 4-percent  threshold for representation in the Storting.    The seriousness of the situation can be seen from Opinion's  background findings. These show that only 34.1 percent of those  who voted for the Progress Party in the last Storting election  would do the same today. A month ago this so-called loyalty  index was 51.3 percent -- in other words more and more loyal  Progress Party voters are leaving the party.    A little over 20 percent of those who said that they voted  for the Progress Party last year said that today they would vote  for the Conservative Party. A total of 36.4 percent form the  group that is undecided about how it will vote. This figure is  the only glimmer of light for the man whose 50th birthday is  today -- Progress Party leader Carl I. Hagen -- a politician who  has already built up the Progress Party from bottom levels. It  remains to be seen whether he can do so again.    Opinion's poll is characterized by stability for most  parties. The Labor Party falls back 0.5 percent, and has 38.2  percent support. The Christian People's Party has also lost  ground, and after a loss of 0.6 percent the party records  support of 6.9 percent in the May poll. The Center Party  remains stable with the same result as in April, all of 18.3  percent. Despite the trickle of Progress Party voters, the  Conservative Party has fallen back by 0.5 percent to 17.8  percent.    Following the fortunes of the Socialist Left Party is very  interesting at present. We saw in the April poll that the  party's voter leakage to the Labor Party was coming to an end,  despite the fact that the party did lose a little ground. In  May this trend really registered: With gains of 2.1 percent the  party now has a level of voter support of 9.6 percent -- almost  2 percent more than in the Storting election. The background  figures indicate a very high loyalty index -- all of 77.4  percent -- and a trickle of voters from both the Labor Party and  the Center Party. It will be interesting to see whether future  polls will confirm signs that hint that for the first time for a  very long time the Socialist Left Party is on the offensive  again.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Dominican Vice President Carlos </F> Morales Troncoso by unidentified reporter in Cartagena de Indias  on 16 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] Amid complications, restrictions, and  endless competition with the local media, we were able to  approach Dominican Vice President Carlos Morales, and ask him  about the Cuban [as heard] situation.    [Morales] What is not being said is that we, Dominicans, are  the hardest hit by the Haitian situation. As a result of the  continuing Haitian problem, our country has over 1 million  illegal Haitian residents, which constitutes an extremely heavy  burden. We support a prompt, but democratic solution.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] NATO Secretary General Woerner has canceled his  participation in the NATO foreign ministers' meeting, which is  scheduled next week in Istanbul. In a letter to the 16 member  states, which was published today, Woerner says that he is  following his doctors' advice in not attending the meeting.  After the summer vacations, however, he expects to be able  fully to resume his responsibilities again.    The former FRG defense minister has been suffering from  cancer of the colon since 1992.</p>

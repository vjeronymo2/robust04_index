			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (22): LloydsLink - Technology File THE LLOYDSLINK system uses personal computers in customers' offices linked to the central switching system, the Logica Transaction Director, based on fault-tolerant computers from Tandem. The central hardware consists of three processors which work together and back each other up. Lloyds further ensures fault tolerance by having a duplicate stand-by system at another site. The central system handles messages and links to other services such as the Chaps clearing system. LloydsLink facilities available to customers through their personal computers include balance reporting; statement reporting, with details of sterling and foreign currency transactions; transfers between Lloyds accounts; and initiation of sterling payments through the national Chaps or Bacs services, or through Lloyds, including salary payments to individuals. Links from the switching system to the external NDC bank network service enable customers to look at their accounts held in other banks. Lloyds has not revealed the total cost. Almost 70 per cent of expenditure has been on equipment and software developed externally. At the peak, there were 150 people on the project, including two dozen from Lloyds.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: France expected to price BNP share offer today THE French government is expected today to launch the first share sale in one of Europe's most ambitious privatisation programmes by announcing the price of the shares to be sold in Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the leading banking group. Sources suggest that the economy ministry plans to announce the share price late this afternoon after the close of trading on the Paris stock market. However, the government will only proceed with the sale if it is convinced that market conditions are right. If not, it will postpone the offer until the investment climate improves. The success of the BNP issue will be critical to the prospects for the rest of the privatisation programme, which could include the sale of as many as 21 state-controlled companies to the private sector, including the Elf-Aquitaine oil group and the Renault motor company. BNP, the traditional bastion of French banking, is one of the most prestigious companies on the privatisation list. The consensus among analysts is that the BNP shares will be priced at between FFr250 and FFr275, valuing the group (which will have a total of around 180m shares) at between FFr45bn and FFr49.5bn (Dollars 7.9bn-Dollars 8.7bn). Exact details of the allocation of shares in the offer have yet to be confirmed. However the government, which owns 72.9 per cent of BNP, is expected to sell 72m shares, or a 40 per cent stake. Approximately half of these shares will be sold to French individual investors. Some 17.4m shares have been earmarked for French institutions and 32.6m will be available to foreign investors. Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the insurance group which now owns 10 per cent of BNP, plans to raise its holding to 15 per cent. Another 15 per cent tranche will be set aside for long-term strategic investors. A 17 per cent stake is likely to be set aside for the holders of investment certificates in BNP, who currently hold the same proportion of its equity, although the precise terms of conversion for the investment certificates have yet to be finalised. The government will be left with a 13 per cent holding in BNP. Of this, it will cede a stake of up to 10 per cent to Dresdner, the German bank with which BNP has negotiated a cross-shareholding venture. A further 8m shares are earmarked for sale to the bank's employees, with the rest of the state's holding reserved to be given as loyalty bonuses to long-term investors. After the completion of the BNP offer, the government hopes to press ahead with the privatisation of Rhone-Poulenc, the flagship French chemicals company, which is scheduled as the second issue in the share-sale programme. The Rhone-Poulenc offer is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>

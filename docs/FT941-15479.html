			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Renault to examine Volvo links Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, has asked Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman of Renault, the state-owned motor vehicle group, to examine the future of its industrial and legal links with Volvo after a meeting of the Swedish company's board next week. But officials at the French industry ministry rejected French press reports that Mr Longuet would dismantle the legal agreements and cross-shareholdings established between the groups in 1990. The agreements, which include Volvo's 20 per cent stake in Renault SA and an 8 per cent holding by the French group in Volvo AB, remain in force despite the collapse of the planned merger last December. French officials say the shareholdings and existing industrial agreements do not necessarily obstruct the government's plans to privatise Renault. Mr Longuet said on Wednesday that privatisation would take place this year, following the sale of Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, and Union des Assurances de Paris. The prospect of a review of the existing agreements, however, contributed to a sharp rise in Volvo's shares. In early afternoon trading, Volvo's B shares had gained more than 2.5 per cent to stand at SKr600.</p>

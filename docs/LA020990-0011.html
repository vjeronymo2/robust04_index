			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL OFFICIALS AT OPEN HEARING REFUSE TO EXPEL 4 BLACKS;  </P> <P> DISCIPLINE: SUPPORTERS SAY THE STUDENTS, WHO WERE ACCUSED OF ROBBERY, ARE  VICTIMS OF PREJUDICE. BUT TRUSTEES AND SHERIFF'S REPRESENTATIVES DENY THE  CHARGES.  </P> <P> Over administrators' objections, trustees in the Antelope Valley Union High  School District refused to expel four black basketball players accused of  attempted robbery in a case that also exposed the growing racial tensions in  the area.  </P> <P> After an emotional three-hour hearing, held in public at the request of the  students' parents, the board early Thursday voted 5 to 0 to allow the four  teen-agers to return to Antelope Valley High School. Supt. Kenneth Brummel had  urged they not be allowed to return to the school this semester.  </P> <P> "We're convinced a lesson has been learned. Heaven help you if that lesson  hasn't been learned," said board member Jarold Wright, addressing the four  students at the end of what school officials called the first expulsion hearing  in their memory held in public. "If you ever appear before this board again,  you've had it," he said.  </P> <P> The students and their parents joined with classmates, some black and some  white, and other supporters from the black community to demand leniency. They  said the four were victims of a racial backlash against blacks by whites who  believe that blacks are responsible for growing gang violence in the area.  </P> <P> "We have to address ourselves to what caused this to escalate to the point  where it became a black-white, a gang thing," said Jewel Junior, the mother of  one of the youths. She and the others said school officials and Los Angeles  County sheriff's deputies overreacted, mistakenly thinking the four were gang  members.  </P> <P> The only black member of the school board, President Larry Rucker, sided with  the crowd. "Some of it is racism, no question about it," Rucker said. He said  black students are being disciplined more stiffly than others and warned "this  valley is going to have one heck of a time" unless that changes.  </P> <P> But school and sheriff's officials denied that a double standard exists for  black students. And fellow board member Steve Landaker later angrily denounced  Rucker's remarks as garbage.  </P> <P> "I don't buy it," Landaker said of the racism charges.  </P> <P> The episode began the afternoon of Dec. 14 when the four black students  surrounded a car of four white students in the school parking lot. One of the  black students allegedly placed a gun to the head of one of the passengers and  demanded money. The black student said he was only wearing a black glove and  pointed his finger at the white student's temple.  </P> <P> No one was injured and no money was taken. But the four black students were  arrested the next day after school officials learned of the incident. The four  were charged with attempted armed robbery. A Juvenile Court judge last month  rejected that charge but sustained misdemeanor assault charges against them.  They face sentencing Feb. 28.  </P> <P> In testimony before the school board Wednesday night, the four teen-agers, all  reserves on the high school's varsity basketball team, acknowledged their role  in the incident. But they insisted they meant it only as a joke and claimed  that the white students in the car understood they were just joking.  </P> <P> "I think this case has been escalated to a higher level than it should have  been," said Kevin Junior, 17, who admitted seeking money from the student in  the car. "I admit it, now that I think about it, that it was a bad joke. Look  where it got us," he said.  </P> <P> Junior and the other three players -- Martine Stokes, 17, Herbert Sellers, 17,  and Joseph Montgomery, 16 -- spent five days in custody in Juvenile Hall after  their arrest. All four have been suspended from school since Dec. 15, but were  given permission to return Thursday.  </P> <P> The four will not return to the basketball team this season, however, because  they are academically ineligible.  </P></p>

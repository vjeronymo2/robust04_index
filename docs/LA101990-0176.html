			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BARRY DROPS REQUEST FOR RETRIAL  </P> <P> Mayor Marion Barry today withdrew his request for a new trial on a misdemeanor  cocaine possession.  </P> <P> "I have spoken with my client, and he has decided to withdraw that motion for a  mistrial," defense lawyer L. Kenneth Mundy told U.S. District Judge Thomas  Penfield Jackson during a pre-sentencing hearing.  </P> <P> Barry, scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 26, faces up to a year in prison and a  maximum fine of $100,000. He did not attend today's court session.  </P> <P> Law enforcement officials had said U.S. Atty. Jay Stephens might consider  retrying the mayor on a dozen charges the jury could not resolve if Barry  pushed ahead with his request for another trial. Stephens had said earlier that  he would not conduct another trial.  </P></p>

The metallocene catalysts  introduced at the end of the 80s made possible the "custom-made"  synthesis of rubber-elastic, heat-resistant and other  interesting plastics. In addition, the new plastics are lighter,  reprocessable and accordingly more environmentally friendly than  the standard first-generation plastics.    As Rolf Muhlhaupt of Freiburg emphasizes, it has  become  possible by choosing the catalyst to synthesize polyolefins  having desired properties. The mechanical, optical,  morphological and processing properties of the plastics can be  altered selectively by means of the new high-tech catalysts.  Above all, the discovery of single-site catalysts has opened up  entirely new capabilities for the synthesis of polyolefins.    Muhlhaupt writes in the journal NACHRICHTEN AUS  CHEMIE,  TECHNIK UND LABORATORIUM (Vol 41, p 1341) that examples of this  are copolymers in which, as in the case of a  polypropylene/polyamide blend, one kind of polymer is compatibly  grafted onto others, and filled polymers. In addition, with  alicyclic polyolefins--ethene tetracyclododecene, for  example--plastics are available that can be used in engineering  as high-grade structural materials and special plastics. The new  polyolefins can be produced with less energy consumption than  can the typical high-pressure polymers and are halogen-free in  addition, they say.</p>

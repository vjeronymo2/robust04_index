Mazowiecki has insisted on the  importance of this event for quite some time in his reports.  The opening of the airport defended by the Muslims in Tuzla in  Bosnia was announced by Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian  Serbs in Moscow on Tuesday.    Mazowiecki, special rapporteur of the UN human rights  commission on the observance of human rights in the former  Yugoslavia, returned to Warsaw from Geneva on Wednesday, where  he had presented his report on Monday.    The conflict entered a new phase from the moment that the  heavy divisions left Sarajevo in result of the pressure exerted  by the UN secretary general and NATO, emphasized Mazowiecki,  adding that for the first time the international community has  put its words into action. "This is why we can hope that peace  in this region is possible," he concluded.</p>

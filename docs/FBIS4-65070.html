			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has  announced a "new era in relations" when the last Russian  soldiers have left Germany. This was stated by Yeltsin in Bonn  on Wednesday [11 May] before beginning political talks with  Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl that will focus on the modalities  of the troop withdrawal, among other things. After an unusually  cordial welcome between Yeltsin and Kohl, the Russian president  said he was confident Germany would help his country even after  the conclusion of the troop withdrawal.    Russia wants to be a member with equal rights in all  European  organizations. He was hoping that, with the beginning of the  presidency in the European Council on 1 July of this year, Kohl  would advocate Russia's access to these institutions. Russia is  Germany's most important neighbor, Kohl said.    The chancellor, who addressed Yeltsin with the familiar  "du,"  said wisdom and vision were the preconditions for making the  right decisions in a world that is undergoing dramatic changes.  It was Germany's desire that Yeltsin and his reform policy be  successful. "This success is a success for Europe and the  Germans."</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Choices at Chevening THE QUESTION that Mr Norman Lamont, the host of this weekend's Treasury house party at Chevening, should be asked is not whether he should have stayed on after the exchange rate mechanism debacle, but whether he should have wanted to do so. The charades may be fun. Discussions of the UK's fiscal prospects will not be, unless they too are turned into a charade. British economic policy is on an unsustainable course. What is not sustainable will not endure, as was demonstrated so dramatically on September 16 1992. The question therefore is not what the government says. Governments say many things, most of them beside the point. What matters is what the government will choose to do. In 1993-94 the public sector borrowing requirement is forecast by the Treasury to be 7 per cent of gross domestic product. Without privatisation receipts it will be close to 8 1/2 per cent of GDP. This is fiscal policy Italian-style. Even if the Treasury were to prove right in its working assumption of economic growth between 1993-94 and 1995-96 of 3 1/2 -4 per cent a year, the PSBR is likely to remain over 6 per cent of GDP in the latter year. This uncomfortable fiscal outcome rests on the assumption that every throw of the policy dice will turn up a six. The UK has had several chancellors who acted upon that assumption. They have all lost their gambles. The traditional British cure for an economic depression is increased consumer spending. This is precisely what the prime minister has suggested with his misleading references to the recovery of the 1980s. But for the personal sector to shrug off its debt-induced woes and go out and spend once more would prove a cure as bad as the current disease. On plausible assumptions, a recovery in demand sufficient to lower the PSBR substantially would also increase the current account deficit, from 2 1/2 per cent of GDP this year to perhaps twice that level two to three years from now. Yet if the economy were to grow at, say, 1 per cent this year and 2 per cent a year thereafter, so limiting the rise in the current account deficit, the PSBR could be 10 per cent of GDP by 1995-96. Lower output The cause of the government's predicament is clear. According to the 1990 autumn statement, total general government spending should have risen only 6 1/2 per cent between 1990-91 and 1993-94 in real terms. Now the Treasury says it will rise 12 1/2 per cent. The 1990 Financial Statement and Budget Report forecast that in 1993-94 real GDP would be 9 per cent bigger than in 1990-91. In fact, it may be 2 per cent smaller. Higher spending is one blade of the scissor; lower economic output is the other; what has been cut up is the government's reputation for fiscal prudence. Export-led growth is the solution. But that would mean a further depreciation, probably brought about by lower interest rates. Such a depreciation would threaten achievement of the chancellor's target of 1-4 per cent annual inflation. Fiscal tightening Looser monetary policy would have to be offset by fiscal tightening. Such a tightening should be designed to deliver a sustainable fiscal position in the medium term. On plausible assumptions, the structural fiscal deficit may be as much as 6 per cent of GDP. Reducing that to sustainable levels could take an adjustment of perhaps 4 per cent of GDP, or about Pounds 25bn. If all went well, maybe half of this could come from a decline in the share of public spending in GDP as the economy recovers. Even so, taxation would have to rise by the equivalent of 6p on the basic rate of tax. The likely fate of the chancellor, or his successors, is to preside over an economy that does not grow fast enough to prevent further increases in unemployment. It is to watch the one achievement, that of low inflation, endangered by a probably inescapable depreciation of the real exchange rate. It is to impose the tightest possible constraints on those parts of public spending that are not purely cyclical. Last and worst of all, it is to raise taxes. Yet if this is, indeed, to be the chancellor's fate, it need not be now. Given the strong inherited fiscal position and the uncertainty about the pace of the recovery, it would make sense for the chancellor to duck the March Budget altogether, leaving any significant changes to the first integrated budget, due in the autumn. If there is to be a budget, however, it would be absurd to fiddle with trivial fiscal changes, such as offsetting the money lost when car tax was abolished. It would be better to do something dramatic, such as coupling the abolition of mortgage interest relief (worth maybe Pounds 5bn) with lower interest rates or abolishing the upper earnings limit on national insurance, thereby eliminating two large anomalies in the current fiscal structure. A chancellor who has remained in office after the recent disasters certainly wants the job. But if he wishes to go on enjoying it a while longer, he might do best to have fun this weekend and postpone both the serious discussions and the budget until next autumn.</p>

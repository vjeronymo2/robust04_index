			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Excerpts from article by Wang Sicheng [3769 2448 2052], </F> senior engineer in the Ministry of Machine-Building and  Electronics Industry's Sixth Institute, Beijing: "The Current  State of Photovoltaic Power Generation and China's Lag"]    [Excerpts] Photovoltaic [PV] power generation is an  important branch of new energy resources. PV power generation  systems are safe and reliable, noiseless, and non-polluting, do  not require the consumption of fuels, do not require the  construction of high-voltage power transmission lines, have  short construction schedules, and can assume any scale. Because  PV power generation system have no mechanical or moving parts,  they have extremely low breakdown rates and are simple to  maintain. Furthermore, PV power generation is subject to only  minimal restrictions by regional resources and is far better  than other renewable energy resources (such as hydropower, wind  power, geothermal, marine energy, etc.) because light resources  are evenly distributed across the globe. It is precisely because  of this that PV power generation has attracted the universal  attention of all countries and developed very quickly. World  output of solar cells was just 2.5MW in 1980 but had grown to  60MW by 1992.    [passage omitted]    Applications of PV power generation in China began in the  1970s but they did not actually develop until after 1982. During  a period of just a few years from 1983 to 1987 we imported seven  solar cell production lines from the United States, Canada, and  other countries, causing China's solar cell production capacity  to leap from 200 kW before 1984 to 4.5MW in 1988. Because of  financial restrictions, however, it was very hard to open a  market and the rate of construction starts for solar cell  production during the past several years has been extremely  inadequate, only about one-tenth of our production capabilities  (see Table 2).

In certain new types  of solar cells such as spherical cells, MIS cells,  polycrystalline membrane cells, and other areas, the domestic  situation is almost a blank.    In the area of applications, solar cells in China at the  present time are mainly used in communications systems and  frontier regions. Many applications realms such as photovoltaic  water pumps, civilian appliances, and so on have yet to be  opened up. For the long-term market, however, such as PV power  generation grid connection systems, battery-powered automobile  charging systems, seawater desalination systems, and so on,  development and demonstrations have still not been included on  the agenda.    In summary, China's research, development, production,  applications, and other areas concerning PV power generation lag  substantially behind the developed countries and many problems  also exist.    PV power generation involves systems engineering and touches  upon a variety of industrial realms. Silicon, the raw material  for solar cells, falls under the metallurgical industry. Sealing  materials such as low iron and steel chemical glass, EVA,  silver, aluminum slurry, and so on fall under the chemical  industry. The matching storage batteries fall under the battery  industry. The retransformers used in PV power stations and PV  water pumps fall under the electric power and electronics  industry. Power station control systems, special purpose  instruments and equipment, and design software fall under the  electronics and computer industries. High efficiency  energy-saving loads, such as lamps, refrigerators, and  televisions, fall under civilian appliances. Thus, truly  high-quality inexpensive PV products are determined by overall  national industrial foundations and levels. To develop China's  PV power generation industry, we must emphasize the following  points:    1. The emergence of China's PV power generation industry is  not the result of market demand but was instead the result of  imports. At present, all producing plants are in difficult  straits and hope that the state will be able to provide  substantial inputs to spur technical progress in this industry  and encourage scientific research departments to vow to solve  the production problems that now exist in plants such as a shift  to domestic production of raw materials and auxiliary materials,  raising finished production rates, improving the conversion  efficiency of solar cells, and so on to ultimately attain the  goals of reducing costs and improving quality to spur the course  of industrialization of the PV power generation industry.    2. We must pay attention to the establishment of development  and experimental base areas for PV power generation systems that  combine technology development and production development, and  that take responsibility for engineering and personnel training,  engineering experiments, and production quality inspection and  control to guarantee the quality of PV products and consolidate  the existing market.    3. Make major efforts to open up markets and establish  demonstration projects in potential applications realms in the  market such as PV water pumps, seawater desalination stations,  power grid terminus grid connection systems, and so on. Use the  demonstrations to derive technological breakthroughs and design  and operating experience and lay a foundation for future scale  applications of PV power generation.</p>

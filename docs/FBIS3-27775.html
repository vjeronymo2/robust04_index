			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ikuya Shigeta] </F>   [Text] The focal points at issue at the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks have been narrowed down to two: whether  Japan will be able to work out well-conceived plans for  expanding domestic demands under the current political confusion  and before the Japan-U.S. summit talks, and whether it will  accept U.S. demands for setting numerical targets as part of the  objective criteria to measure the degree of market access in  such sectors as automobiles, auto parts, and government  procurement. If Japan should fail to present drastic plans for  expanding domestic demands, no accord will be reached at the  framework talks, whose major theme is to cut Japan's current  account surplus. Then, there will be considerably less  significance in holding a summit.    Concerned with the deadlock at the framework talks, some  domestic observers tend to hope that the summit will be  postponed. However, the summit allows for no postponement  because Japan must work out measures to stimulate its economy  and to open up the market as an immediate task for overcoming  its prolonged recession as soon as possible. Certainly, these  measures should not be worked out for the sake of the United  States.    In the sense that the Japanese Government must indicate its  targets to the people, efforts must be made to carry out such  tasks as the compilation of the draft budget as originally  scheduled and before the summit. Deregulation efforts that are  directly connected with market opening involve abolition of  unreasonable standards and an authorization system as well as  bidding system reform. Proposals for such efforts must be  indicated to the United States in a positive way.    Hardly any progress can be noted at the talks on numerical  targets, even at the general meeting at the vice ministerial  level currently under way in Washington.    Japan and the United States may try to reach an agreement  quickly in the future. However, in case Japan should make a  political decision to accept numerical targets, there is a  danger that foreign countries may come to share an understanding  that the best way to win over Japan in trade talks is to bring  the issues to talks at the top level.    When the current economic situation is taken into account,  domestic industries, such as automakers, will lose confidence in  promoting business recovery if such restrictions as future  targets of procuring foreign products should be imposed on them.    Thus, Japan should insist on arguing that the United States  is wrong in trying to introduce numerical targets. Japan should  make further efforts to find a way to break the stiff stance  taken by the United States by making positive proposals for  opening up its markets that may also bring about benefits for  its own people.</p>

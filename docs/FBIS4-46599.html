			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second and Final part of report by Colonel Aleksandr </F> Oliynik: "Moscow Military District Receives Troops."]    [Text]  <H5>  Moscow-Voronezh-Boguchar -- In a Field Near Boguchar </H5>   The ancient city of Boguchar is in the Voronezh Oblast  "hinterland." Legend has it that it got its name from Peter I.  One day when the young sovereign was sailing completed ships  north along the Don he weighed anchor at the mouth of an unnamed  stream. Strong drinks were poured into goblets, but there proved  to be one goblet too many. "This goblet is for god [Bogu charka  siya]," Petr said in jest, knocking it back. From that day the  stream became the Bogucharka and the town got its name from it.    Now the once quiet rayon center in the very south of the  oblast is experiencing a rebirth. "Life in Boguchar is changing  drastically," the rayon newspaper SELSKAYA NOV wrote in a May  issue. "And as we know the foundation to this change was laid  by the transfer of an armored division from Germany. Some 7,000  people will come to us, as many as live in the rayon center  now...."    I do not know how it is for the Boguchar inhabitants but for  the servicemen of the 10th Ural-Lvov Volunteer Armored Division  which has come here from Germany life in a new place has indeed  changed drastically. For the worse, unfortunately.    Before the armored troops arrived it was planned to  construct  at a preferential rate at least the main establishments --  barracks, headquarters, storehouses, shelters for equipment, as  was done for other troops arriving on the territory of the  Moscow Military District. I shall note that construction was  still being carried out 12-18 months ago when there were funds.    Now only ferroconcrete posts rise up alone in place of  barracks. All the heavy vehicles -- and that includes modern  T-80 tanks and 152mm self-propelled artillery mount vehicles --  are in the open air. There are not even any fences or roads --  after each rainfall you can neither walk nor drive across the  black earth.    "In fact the division has been put out of action for the  time  being," Major General Yevgeniy Vorobyev, a task force leader  from Voronezh, agrees with me. "But we are not to blame -- the  corps too is only being created and the Moscow Military District  has given us what it can. There is no one in the division to  service the vehicles -- soldiers under contract (almost all tank  crews in the regiments consisted of volunteers) have not  extended their contracts and have gone home. The majority of  officers and ensigns are on leave and we do not know which of  them will serve in this `hinterland.'"    Indeed, the armored troops have been unlucky, so to speak,  in  their new stationing. The country is wonderful here, but the  infrastructure is very underdeveloped. It is 65 km to the  nearest railroad station, Kantemirovka. Fuel is delivered from  Voronezh, 250km away. Even water is brought in.    It was not only strategic aims which were being pursued in  the early nineties when the venue for the 10th division's  withdrawal was determined. I was told at the corps headquarters  that the deciding factor was that Bogucharskiy Rayon agreed to  take in the armored troops, counting on the city being built up  and on the railroad being extended to the rayon center....    "Why are there so few people in the fields?" I asked Colonel  Vladimir Skokov, the division's deputy commander, a Muscovite,  incidentally, who says he does not want to return to the  capital. "After all the formation's withdrawal is virtually  coming to an end?"    "But where are people to go?" Vladimir Viktorovich answers  one question with another. "There is no housing, even  containers with their personal belongings are a problem to  accommodate. In addition many have children at school. So they  have gone their separate ways. Some have taken their families  to their parents, some are still in Germany. But in a month or  two the main backbone of the division will be here...."    One wants to hope that is how it will be. People will come  to a new place but how will they serve here if there is just a  small flag where the future headquarters should stand?    "When do you think you will construct the barracks?" I asked  a group of obviously bored construction workers.    "No one knows," work superintendent Vladimir Pecherskiy  spoke  for them all." "If we had the funds we would complete  construction in a few months. But we have not been paid wages  for April yet and there is no money for construction materials.  So we sit idle for weeks yet we are no less interested in work  than the armored troops -- our families have nothing to live on."    It has turned out that the local construction workers  consist  of Russian refugees who have come to Boguchar from Tajikistan.  There are now several thousand of them in the city and they  live where they can, half starving. To give them work the city  administration has created the "Bogucharstroy" enterprise to  erect the barracks and the division's vehicle pool facilities.  They reckoned that the military department had the necessary  funds and it would be possible to earn money.    While Colonel Skokov and I were walking across the field  where the construction should be I thought: This is where we  should bring the State Duma and government politicians who,  despite it all, try to put the Army on financial starvation  rations! After all it is the uncertainty over the military  budget and the lack of money which above all have struck a  pitiless blow to the units withdrawn from remote and nearby  foreign parts. In Boguchar, Yelnya, Vyazma, and other regions  of the Moscow Military District. And not just in the Moscow  Military District....    It is shameful to write but the armored troops are in fact  living on the city's charity. They receive bread, food, and  coal on credit. They do not even have the money to wash or to  clean their clothes. Never mind combat readiness -- just  surviving is enough!    At the vehicle parking area of one regiment I met an officer  with an armband -- the pool duty officer. He was Senior  Lieutenant Dmitriy Slyusarenko, commander of a repair platoon.  In rubber boots and dirty overalls he differed little from the  construction workers. I do not write this to criticize him. It  is hard to observe uniform regulations if you are in mud up to  your knees and there are just a few officers for a tank  regiment. They go on duty every other day. They have been  living in a site hut without their families for over six months  now. Slyusarenko, for instance, sent his wife to her parents in  Tomsk. He has not received his wages for several months. He  has already sold his videorecorder, his television set is next.  He needs something to live on.    All the division's officers and ensigns and their families  are in this unenviable position. And under these conditions  when, as one officer put it, the state has left them to look  after themselves, the officers are continuing to serve. They  are continue, I may add, on enthusiasm alone -- those who are  not indifferent to the fate of the Russian Army and its future.    From dawn until dusk the task forces from the regiment take  in vehicles with freight, unload them by hand, and stack the  munitions and food. They work without counting the time,  without sparing their strength. But there is a limit to  everything. They cannot pay for the construction of barracks  out of their own pockets. And neither more nor less than 102  billion rubles must be paid to the rayon for the allocation of  land for a testing range.    "That price is fair, in strict accordance with the law on  the  land," I was told by Nikolay Zhmykhov, head of the Bogucharskiy  Rayon administration. "We realize that the military department  now has no money from the budget -- let them give us vehicles  for the countryside, equipment for processing agricultural  products in exchange. After all, we must seek a way out of the  situation -- every summer day counts. Otherwise the division  will spend the winter in tents...."    The people who are not losing an hour, never mind a day, are  the construction workers from Turkey. For German marks they  will erect a whole town for the armored troops in Boguchar. Here  there will be over 40 high-rise apartment blocks, a school with  a pool and a greenhouse, two kindergartens, a sports center, a  savings bank, and stores.... The cost of the contract is 153  million deutschemarks. The deadline for commissioning is August  this year. According to Mr. Akhmad Sarvash [name as  transliterated], the construction chief, they are also 4-6 weeks  behind the construction schedule. It is for that reason that  over 2,000 workers are now working on constructing the city in  three shifts -- day and night. Let me add that all work here is  automated and with that pace the construction will probably be  completed on time. The first new apartments for the armored  troops are planned for early August.    ....I would like to end these far from gratifying notes with  that impressive fact. But I cannot. Before my eyes is a peg  with a little flag on the site of the future headquarters and a  senior lieutenant in rubber boots standing along next to the  tanks. How wet will they get under the rain and snow?</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: US exchanges in clearing software project THE Chicago and New York Mercantile Exchanges have agreed to develop a Dollars 15m software project to upgrade and standardise their trade-clearing systems. The project, which stops short of common clearing for the two exchanges, will produce a state-of-the-art system that the exchanges hope will become a standard throughout the world in the futures industry. The planned system will, for the first time, allow each exchange to back up the others' operations in the event of a calamity, a feature that has become more urgent in the wake of the Chicago flood in 1992 and the World Trade Center bombing in February. Both disasters disrupted US futures trading. The CME and the Nymex are, respectively, the second and third-largest futures exchanges in the US, after the Chicago Board of Trade.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Teledyne accused of false testing THE US Justice Department has accused Teledyne, a leading maker of military electronics, of having falsified tests on a basic component of sophisticated weapons and spacecraft, according to the New York Times, Reuter reports from New York. In a civil lawsuit, the department maintains the company's failure to test the components properly defrauded the government of as much as Dollars 250m, the newspaper said. The suit against Teledyne asserts that the company routinely certified to the government, in 1983-1990, that the components, known as electromagnetic relays, had passed rigorous tests of reliability, when in fact the parts had often failed. At times, the test results were distorted by faulty test equipment, the suit charges. Each year, Teledyne makes hundreds of thousands of the relays, which have been used in the US space shuttle, the Patriot anti-missile system and dozens of other items. Teledyne, which also makes industrial products, had disclosed it was the subject of an investigation of testing irregularities, the newspaper said.</p>

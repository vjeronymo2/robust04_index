			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Kuan Wen-liang (7070 2429 5328): "The </F> Purpose of Clinton's `Human Rights Diplomacy'"]    [Text] Since the Clinton administration took office a year  ago, it has incessantly practiced "human rights diplomacy"  toward China. Beijing calls this "interfering in its internal  affairs" and claims that "it will not yield to the United  States." Some people overseas suspect that Washington is trying  to "foster opposition forces" in China.... What was the Chinese  reaction to "U.S. human rights pressure" exerted over the past  year? Do a few people think Washington has achieved the  expected results in practicing the U.S. human rights concept?  <H5>  United States Ignores China's Judicial Sovereignty </H5>   On Clinton and his administration's position concerning the  summoning of a parolee, a professor at Beijing university who is  also a telecommunications expert, said in Shenzhen: "The United  States has its judicial system, under which the police can  arrest and detain law breakers according to its laws. Why is it  that Chinese judicial authorities cannot summon a parolee who  has broken his parole?" He accused U.S. politicians of being  "arrogant and conceited," of "bullying others too much," and of  "applying dual standards." He added that in everything the  United States has done in recent years, it has very seldom  respected China as an independent country: this was  "unacceptable" to any Chinese with national dignity.    U.S. politicians asserted that the two people "were arrested  because of involvement in freedom of speech," but Beijing claims  that this was "summoning according to the law." The professor  said: "Every country with complete sovereignty has its own  judicial system. Although China's legal system is being  improved, this does not mean that there is no judicature in  China. If the United States regards China as an equal  independent country, it has no right to meddle in this affair!"  <H5>  Chinese Despise U.S. Human Rights Concept </H5>   The professor from Beijing asked: There are more than 140  countries in the world, but only the U.S. President "talks  glibly about human rights." Is it that all other countries "do  not respect human rights" and only the United States does?    An intellectual who lived in New York for four years  criticized the United States by saying that "it is not entitled"  to teach China how to respect human rights. His reason is that  the United States itself is a country which "simply does not  have" human rights, adding: From 1979 to 1991, almost 50,000  children were shot dead in the United States, an average of more  than 4,000 each year, and more children have died in recent  years. This ranks first in the world. "Now 13 children die  through guns every day, and 30 others are wounded...." "Is  there anything else more valuable than the lives of innocent  children? Are there human rights in the United States?" He  advised that "Asia Watch" "who specialize in fabricating" "human  rights violations" in the Third World should change to "U.S.  watch," who should "look into the human rights record of the  United States itself."    From Beijing to Guangzhou, it is not difficult to notice  that  the Chinese using public U.S. information and data to criticize  U.S. society for "having no human rights." Cadres and  intellectuals who are concerned with state affairs generally  despise the U.S. human rights concept and even ridicule the  Clinton administration's "human rights diplomacy."  <H5>  Human Rights Diplomacy Serves as Negative Example </H5>   The Chinese are generally of the opinion that the U.S.  "human  rights theory" is hypocritical; therefore, the more the Clinton  administration presses China on "human rights improvement," the  more the Chinese become repugnant to what the United States says  and does, and the more they are doubtful about the U.S. human  rights record. This circuitous response has appeared in Chinese  society.    The Chinese believe that this "circuitous response" emerged  from a "bad thing" and has become a "good thing" which "helps  the younger generation to understand deeply the hypocritical  nature of U.S. human rights and hegemonism." Some Chinese  regard the Clinton administration's pressure as a "negative  example." A retired Chinese diplomat said: "Some young people  in China cherish unrealistic illusions about the outside world;  we frequently teach them to view the United States from a  rational angle. Having rational knowledge alone is not  adequate, they should also have perceptual feelings."    The Human Rights Baton Awakens Younger Generation    This deep "perceptual feeling" occurred last year, during  which U.S. politicians and the mainstream media tried every  possible means to stop China from hosting the 2000 Olympics,  under the pretext that "there are no human rights" in China. At  that time, Chinese in foreign countries condemned U.S.  politicians for their "ugly politics" and "mean" tricks. In the  meantime, people north and south of the Chang Jiang,  particularly workers and young intellectuals in the cities,  responded most strongly to this. Even a 10-year-old primary  school pupil in Beijing sadly asked his father: "Why did the  United States not allow us to host the Olympics?...."    Some friends who had previously "worshipped" the United  States also admitted that they had "awakened." What did they  awaken to? The awakened to the fact that "there is indeed  hegemonism in the world and this hegemonism is targeted at  China." In December last year, a researcher in the Beijing  Academy of Social Sciences said privately: Problems should be  viewed from a dialectical angle. Unquestionably, Washington's  "human rights diplomacy" has caused "much trouble" to  Chinese-U.S. relations, but at the same time it has also  "taught" the Chinese to clearly understand hegemonism and  "unified" this understanding.  <H3>  If a Country Refuses to Become a Puppet, that Country Will  Be Accused of "Having No Human Rights" </H3>   In recent years, the United States has accused Beijing of  selling "long-range" missiles to Pakistan. It has created  rumors that the Yin He was carrying materials for chemical  weapons; it has framed China by saying that it exported  prison-made products; it has closed down a Chinese firm in the  United States; it has imposed a discriminatory embargo on trade;  it has threatened to ban imports of Chinese products into the  United States.... Moreover, every day it accuses China of  "having no human rights" and threatens to revoke China's  most-favored-nation status. Since assuming office a year ago,  the Clinton administration has noisily made anti-Chinese remarks  and exerted pressure on China. This has made the following  impression on the world: The Clinton administration has never  respected China as an independent country and has never  considered that the Chinese people are entitled to national  dignity.    On a plane from Beijing to Guangzhou, the manager of a  state-owned enterprise said in jest: "If you are willing to  become a U.S. puppet, the United States will say you have human  rights and will make you a pro-democracy hero. Otherwise, they  say you have no human rights. Do the Chinese not understand  this simple theory? Do you know why so many Chinese  spontaneously commemorated Mao Zedong's centenary? Because Mao  Zedong was the symbol of the Chinese spirit and national  self-respect!"</p>

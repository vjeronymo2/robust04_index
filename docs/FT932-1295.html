			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Letter: Tinkering will not change how effectively the Commission is run Sir, Lionel Barber is quite right to raise the issue of the way the Commission is run ('The towering bureaucracy', June 21). His classic solution - improve the quality of the people at the top - will not however do the trick. In the past 30 years there have been many very able people working in Brussels and the message from them has been almost universal: the system prevents sensible and swift solutions to the issues facing Europe. Anyone who has dealt with the Commission, at any level, and in its many guises knows that there are fundamental problems, common to many bureaucracies, of how work is done, who is responsible and what the objectives are. It seems extraordinarily difficult to change the established patterns of how things are done. And, of course, people tend to be too busy with the immediate issue to look at the structural problem. This is not a situation which will be put right by a few gestures, some intelligent appointments and some high level training - however well intentioned. A system designed for a smaller, simpler Commission is bound to need some fundamental rethinking as the size and shape of the tasks change. What is required is a planned, targeted and sustained approach to changing working methods within the Commission. It will take time and determination. It means changing how people work, not merely what they do - fewer rules, more effective decision taking, a clearer sense of results and less concern with processes.

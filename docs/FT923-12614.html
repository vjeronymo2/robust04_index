			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Lecturers' 6.75% pay rise is vetoed UNIVERSITY lecturers yesterday became the latest targets of the government's campaign to limit public sector pay to about 4 per cent. In an unusual intervention ministers have vetoed a pay settlement agreed by university employers and unions, in the process sparking a row over who runs Britain's 48 universities. The 10-week-old settlement is worth a total of 6.75 per cent, including 1 per cent for local performance awards. The government is withholding a grant of Pounds 24m which the universities need to finance the settlement. Ministers say they will withhold the extra money until university employers and unions reach a settlement worth less than 5 per cent, including 0.75 per cent in local pay awards. Mr Nigel Forman, further and higher education minister, said government willingness to agree a settlement higher than 4 per cent signalled recognition of productivity gains in the universities. The government's move follows a 7.8 per cent rise for school teachers agreed through their pay review body. The row is bound to fuel demands for a similar body for university teachers. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which represents the universities and related institutions, and the Association of University Teachers, which represents 31,000 employees, yesterday refused to renegotiate the settlement and called for a meeting with Mr John Patten, the education secretary. Professor Stewart Sutherland, vice-chancellor of London University, said the government's attitude left a clear question over 'Who manages the universities?' He said it seemed universities were no longer free to negotiate pay deals with their staff. Ms Diana Warwick, general secretary of the AUT, said: 'Members will be enraged by this rejection of a moderate, deserved pay increase.' She said it was in line with other pay deals this year. Sir Pat Lowry, who chaired the negotiations for the original settlement, said that unlike every other group, university teachers' pay had not kept pace with retail prices.</p>

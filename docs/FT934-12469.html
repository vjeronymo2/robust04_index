			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (13): A chance to reduce the paperwork / A look at ways to cut back on printed documentation and reduce costs in the electronic office by using new software packages ONE of the biggest myths of the early years of the information technology revolution was that the use of computers would lead to the end of the use of paper for communications and the start of the 'paperless office.' It is now clear that this paperless society is, at least so far, a myth. New technology has actually led to an explosion in the use of paper: the page design tools on personal computers allow anyone to create good looking documents, but the urge to get the design just right by tweaking tiny details mean that several draft copies may be printed where one typed memo would have sufficed. Then, once finalised, the document may be faxed or posted to different sites, where it will be copied several more times for distribution and filing. The disadvantages of this system are quite obvious: firstly, contrary to current ecologically-friendly trends, a large amount of paper is used. Secondly, the costs of copying and transmitting the document can be huge and, despite the care taken with the design, the quality of the received document (once it has been faxed, then photocopied, then comments added, then faxed back) can be unpredictable. Thirdly, though by no means finally, if the recipient wants to take sections from a document to incorporate into another document, they cannot do so without re-entering the data into their computer. Yet while distributing such documents as computer files, either down telephone lines or on disc, clearly solves many of these problems, this method has never become popular. This is mainly attributable to the difficulties caused by the different data formats which each computer and program uses. Transferring plain text, the lowest common denominator of the different machines, has always been possible, but sending complex documents, containing text in different sizes and fonts placed around pictures is very difficult unless the sender and recipient have exactly the same software packages and fonts installed on their machines. In some organisations this has led to packages being copied illegally just so that everyone could read electronically-distributed documents. Two new software packages aim to solve this problem. Both 'Common Ground' from No Hands Software and 'Acrobat' from Adobe Systems claim to allow documents created with any application program, and incorporating any combination of fonts, graphics and colour, to be sent electronically to other users' computers and viewed on-screen. The sender and recipients need not have the same applications or fonts installed, nor even be using the same type of computer - both products allow documents created on Apple Macintoshes to be viewed on personal computers running Windows, and vice versa. Adobe is also working to bring users of DOS PCs and Unix machines into the Acrobat world. Both systems appear to operate in the same way. Once installed, they add an option to the print command to output the document as a special format file, called 'digital paper' (dp) in Common Ground and 'portable document fortmat' (pdf) in Acrobat. The files, which preserve the look of the original document, can be distributed on disk or by modem, and be read on-screen using a viewer program - Common Ground even allows a mini-viewer to be included with a document, so that anyone can read it. Once opened, the document can be searched for words or phrases, and sections of text can be copied to other documents. Acrobat adds further facilities like 'sticky notes,' the electronic version or the familiar Post-It note, and hot links where selecting a phrase like 'see the attached graph' would take you directly to that graph, and will eventually support the standard SGML document structure system. If green-consciousness permits, both systems allow documents to be printed. Beneath the surface, however, the two systems differ greatly, in ways which affect both the quality of the documents when printed and their file size. Common Ground files contain a bitmap image of the document - a 'dot by dot' copy of the on-screen image. When creating the digital paper file, the resolution can be selected to be 72 dots-per-inch (about the same resolution as appears on computer monitors) or 300 dots-per-inch (standard laser printer resolution). The 72 dpi files are smaller, but appear ragged when printed or enlarged on screen; the larger 300 dpi flies give much clearer results. The technology behind Acrobat is much more complex. The portable document format is an extension of Adobe's established PostScript page description language most familiar from high-quality laser printers. Rather than creating a bitmap copy of the document, Acrobat stores the 'metrics' of the fonts used. Using the company's 'Multiple Masters' font format a system where one font can be stretched and distorted to give many variations of the design the receiving system. generates close copies of the original fonts. Though it has problems with highly decorative typefaces, the advantage is that the resulting fonts are resolution independent if you print them on a high quality laser printer they will appear at the resolution of the printer, whereas those from Common Ground would be stuck at 300 dpi. Acrobat also offers a number of compression systems to reduce the size of pdf documents, which is advantageous since it reduces both telephone transmission times and storage requirements; in some cases, 2Mb files can be reduced to around 100K. However, documents cannot have a view included - to read a document you need an Acrobat Reader, and these are only currently available in minimum quantities of fifty, priced at Pounds 36 a copy. 'Exchange,' the program which creates pdf files, costs Pounds 140 per copy; and 'Distiller,' which takes existing PostScript files and turns them into pdf format, costs Pounds 500. 'Common Ground,' in contrast, costs just Pounds 149 for the Maker/Viewer. The two system will however, find favour with different markets, Common Ground being ideal for distributing small-scale documents while Acrobat is more adept at large works containing extensive cross-referencing or full colour images. Providing recipients avoid the urge to simply print-out documents, both systems will reduce costs and paper usage greatly. And while neither is yet perfect, both give the 'paperless office' concept a new chance. Acrobat is from Adobe Systems, distributed by Principal Systems (0706.831.831); Common Ground is from No Hands Software, distributed by Gomark (071.731.7930).</p>

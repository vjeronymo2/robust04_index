			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Productivity static in engineering sector THE engineering industry has yet to reap any productivity gains from the recession in spite of the severity of the downturn, which is expected to dog the industry for most of the rest of this year, according to a report published yesterday by the Engineering Employers' Federation. The report declares that, in spite of the loss of 165,000 jobs from the industry during the past year, productivity growth in the engineering industry will remain at its 1989 level until next year. In the recession of 1980 to 1981 engineering productivity grew during the recession and surged as the economy emerged from it. The federation's index of productivity in the industry is forecast to rise by about 2.5 per cent between 1989 and 1992. That contrasts with a rise of about 11 per cent between 1979 and 1982. The implication of the report is that this downturn is far less likely to bring the industry long-term gains. The federation's spring economic trends report suggests that the industry may struggle to exploit the opportunities of renewed growth as it fights off intensifying international competition. The report sees a rising engineering trade deficit as growth next year sucks in more imports. It sees lower growth of exports and manufacturing investment stuck at its mid-1990 level until at least 1994. The report, prepared by the federation's economic policy committee, the says renewed growth in UK manufacturing will depend on growth elsewhere in Europe. The report forecasts that engineering employment will fall by a further 60,000 in the next 12 months, after falling to about 1.85m in the first quarter of this year from 2.1m two years ago. Engineering sales are likely to rise by about 4 per cent between the second half of last year and the first half of next year, led by a projected 12 per cent growth in motor industry output. Imports are forecast to rise by 11 per cent, with export growth at only 3 per cent. Engineering companies need an improved tax climate to help them to compete with manufacturers in Europe, Japan and the US, according to Mr Nigel Chubb, chief executive of the Engineering Employers' East Midlands Association. He suggested signs of an upturn had been slow to come but would increase this year.

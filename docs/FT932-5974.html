			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / People: Yeoman changes guard Nicholas Berry, the younger son of Lord Hartwell, has added the chairmanship of Yeoman Investment Trust to his portfolio of other directorships. He succeeds Maurice Baring the long-time chairman of Yeoman, no relation of the banking family, who has turned 70. At the same time, Lord Gowrie joins the trust as a non-executive director. Berry says he is wary of the City's tendency towards overspecialisation. What he is looking for in Gowrie, currently chairman of Sotheby's Europe and tipped as a possible future chairman of the Arts Council, is 'a basic level of wisdom'. Asked whether he had employed headhunters in the search, Berry replies:'I have a perfectly good head myself'. The fund is a split capital trust, currently capitalised at Pounds 75m. Previously independent, Abbey Life recently won the management contract, although it was not instrumental in the Gowrie appointment. Despite its origins as the Java Investment &amp; Loan Company, Yeoman does not invest overseas - 'it's difficult enough knowing what is going on next door' says Berry, who is fond of the slogan 'elephants don't gallop' in support of his preference for taking large stakes in small companies and adopting a long-term view. Berry, an old Etonian as is Gowrie, has had a varied career. He caught the headlines briefly when helping his family fight off, unsuccessfully, Conrad Black's bid for control of the Daily Telegraph. He has also had a long-running interest in the Manchester Ship Canal Company, where he was chairman for a spell until ousted in a bid in 1987 by northern developer John Whittaker. In addition, he ran and owned Harrap's publishers for 13 years, selling in 1988. It was during this period he met Ian Maxwell, with whom he remains a friend; he even contributed Pounds 125,000 towards bail for Robert Maxwell's elder son.</p>

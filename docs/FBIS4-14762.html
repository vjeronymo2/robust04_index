			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 1 TASS -- Leader of the Russian  Communist Party Gennadiy Zyuganov has admitted that his party  had renounced several important postulates of Marxism-Leninism.    Replying to an ITAR-TASS question during a press conference  in the State Duma here today, he said that in their future  programme, entitled "From Crisis to Stable Development," which  is now being discussed, the Russian Communists renounce all  "revolutionary leaps and forcible methods for settling  problems," and also the exclusiveness of state-owned property.    "We believe that domination of only state-owned property had  produced stagnation and paralysis," Zyuganov said, noting that  the theses of the Russian Communist Party recognise multiple  forms of economy as a reality. The communist leader mentioned  "popular state patriotism" and social fairness among the bedrock  principles of his party.    Asked about the work that is now being done by masterminds  of  the "Concord for the Sake of Russia" movement, Zyuganov said  that they were daily holding consultations and have already met  many scientists, heads of major enterprises of the  military-industrial complex, and leaders of many parties. He  did not rule out the possibility of the movement's constituent  congress being held already this may. Zyuganov said that the  organisational group maintained regular contact with Aleksandr  Rutskoy and representatives of his party, was actively working  on the movement's programme.    The communist leader spoke much more cooly about the  memorandum on civil peace and concord, which is now being drawn  up. Zyuganov said that the Communist Party on the whole backed  the idea of achieving civil concord in the Russian society, but  said he doubted that the given draft (about which he could judge  only from press reports) would contribute to this end. The  movement towards this goal, according to Zyuganov, should  proceed "from both sides." If the drawn up draft memorandum  really stipulates that the Constitution "should not be touched,"  the Russian Communist Party will hardly be able to sign such a  document, Zyuganov stated.</p>

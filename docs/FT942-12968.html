			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Shell disposal adds Pounds 350m to income Royal Dutch/Shell yesterday announced the disposal of an asset in the Far East which is expected to add some Pounds 350m to second quarter net profits. The company revealed few details of the transaction, saying it had signed a confidentiality agreement with the purchaser. Shell said the disposal was of a 'non-operating asset', which did not form part of its day-to-day operations. The announcement had been made merely to satisfy stock exchange requirements, and little further detail was expected when the second quarter results are announced on August 11. Countering suggestions that the transaction involved the sale of a Tokyo property, the company said the deal had nothing to do with the Showa Shell Sekiyu Japanese subsidiary. Last year, Showa incurred foreign exchange losses of Y115.3bn. It is believed to be seeking ways to repair the damage to the balance sheet. Shell also said the disposal had nothing to do with the discussions on the sale of the Billiton metals business to Gencor of South Africa. These continued and were expected to be concluded by the end of this year, Shell said. The company has been focusing on cutting costs and restructuring businesses  -such as its chemicals division - over the last year. In 1993 it incurred a Pounds 496m restructuring charge. The group also sold Pounds 672m of assets last year. Shell said it was not contemplating any other disposals of similar size in the near future. The company said it had no specific use for the proceeds.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / How To Spend It: Serve a touch of creativity at your table Maryse Boxer is a designer who has brought all her talents to bear on a small but fascinating area of domestic life - the table top. Originally a textile designer in France ('I was working with Cacharel in his heyday') she then produced the colours for Dior's first cosmetic line, but all the while she loved collecting china and playing with table settings, writes Lucia van der Post. When her husband's work brought her to London she started experimenting with her ideas for tableware. 'In the US there was a cheap and cheerful range of tableware called Fiestaware which came in lots of different colours and you could play around with different combinations and that was when I began to think about doing a range of my own.' To begin with she made modules in cardboard, playing with light, shape and texture - she would see how a matt small plate set off the contrasting gloss of a shiny one, how a round plate set on a bigger curvy one could enhance the interest in both and how a smooth finish would provide a rich contrast with a rough one. She began to see the table as a creative outlet for every woman's domestic talents. From having an original idea to a saleable product is usually a long and difficult step but when Joseph Ettedgui, the retailer behind the Joseph empire, said he wanted her to do a black and white collection for Joe's Cafe in Draycott Place which he was about to open, Boxer was off. 'I knew nothing about ceramics - I had just fiddled about with these ideas on bits of cardboard but Joseph did not want to know anything about my manufacturing problems. I was on my own. It had to be ready for the opening and it was. Joseph started selling the range in his shop Pour La Maison. Barney's in New York saw it and wanted it. Then The Conran Shop and so on.' After her minimalistic black and white range for Joseph she did Rainbowware  -a brilliantly coloured range of cups on leaf-shaped saucers offering a huge variety of colour combinations - for Aroma Cafe. The trendy crowd who drink Aroma's coffee can buy the ceramics when they finish. Since then her range has expanded to take in glass - champagne flutes which double as vases or candle-holders and drinking glasses and pale coloured plates, some of it made in Italy and embellished with gold-leaf. Then there are napkins - crinkled linen and polyester, completely washable and needing no ironing - and cups and saucers and plates of every size and in every mood. Her main aim is to offer her customers choices. 'I wasn't interested in designing just a glass. I wanted everything to be multi-media and multi-duty so that the table can be as personal and as creative a medium as the clothes that people wear. Everything I do is always hand-finished so that they are all slightly different. That is what gives the pieces life.' From this week the whole range of her wares can be seen in the basement of Chez Joseph, 26 Sloane Street, London SW1 where she shares the space with the furniture designer Carolyn Quartermaine.</p>

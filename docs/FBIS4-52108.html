			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The continued strength of  the Japanese yen is helping boost exports by the Korean heavy  and chemical industries, sources said Friday.    In the semiconductor area, Samsung Electronics Co., Goldstar  Electronics Co. and Hyundai Electronics Co. are engaged in full  operation to meet rising demand for the third quarter.    As for home electronic appliances, the companies are moving  to meet strong demand from Southeast Asia and are busy  increasing their competitiveness against Japanese goods.    A Goldstar official said, "in the first quarter exports rose  25 percent from the same period last year and sales in  Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand jumped more than 100  percent. Exports are their most active since 1988."    Production of such electronic parts as cathode-ray tubes and  refrigerator compressors is insufficient to satisfy surging  demand from abroad and Goldstar has expanded its video cassette  recorder production lines.    Korean automakers plan to raise prices in the United States,  Europe and Latin America because their Japanese rivals will  inevitably have to hike prices due to the yen's strength.    The shipbuilding industry recovered vigor in April and the  petrochemical industry is in contact with Southeast Asian buyers  who are snubbing Japanese products due to rising prices.    But the machinery industry here must import some important  parts from Japan, causing it to suffer from the strong yen, the  Korea Association of Machinery Industry said.</p>

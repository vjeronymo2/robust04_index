			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Again?: Ron Kovic, the war hero whose story inspired the movie "Born on the  Fourth of July," wants the United States out of the Middle East. Kovic, who  turned against the Vietnam War after coming home in a wheelchair, has given  copies of a 30-second TV commercial to members of Congress.  </P> <P> He says in the ad that U.S. troops are in the Persian Gulf "not to defend  democracy but to protect the big oil companies . . . . We don't want another  Vietnam . . . . Didn't we promise ourselves that we would never let this happen  again?"  </P> <P> Trump Card: Donald Trump took in the opening of Jackie Mason's new one-man  Broadway show last week and had to endure a few jokes about his friend Marla  Maples. "Women call Marla cheap," Mason said. "Men say, 'Really? How cheap?  Where is she?' " Maples was not in the audience, but others in the crowd  included Alan Alda, Michael Douglas, Joan Rivers and Mike Wallace.  </P> <P> Wallflower: Dancing with new Supreme Court Justice David Souter may be cruel  and unusual punishment. The quiet bachelor attended a White House dinner, but  did not take a date. When journalist Naomi Nover asked him to dance, Souter  politely declined. She persisted, prompting him to say, "I wouldn't put anyone  through the torture."  </P> <P> Close to the Chest: Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, 58, who failed in his  bid to become the first black governor of Georgia in the summer's primary  elections, says he will "continue to be involved in the political and economic  development of Georgia . . . . Whether that leads to another bid for governor  would probably be determined way down the road." Young was a top aide to the  Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and a United Nations ambassador.  </P></p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Delors rules out Danes' treaty plans MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, yesterday inflamed the controversy over Denmark's demands for exemptions from the Maastricht treaty, bluntly warning that binding legal agreements sought by the Danes were unacceptable. In the Belgian parliament, Mr Delors said the Danes could expect no more than 'interpretative declarations' to the treaty - an offer which falls short of Denmark's request for a UK-style opt-out on a single European currency and exemption from a putative European defence force. Mr Delors' remarks will upset the Danish and the British governments who face a delicate political balancing act in selling Maastricht to a sceptical public. However, his tough stand appears to be supported at this stage by other EC member states which have reservations about special treatment for the Danes. A Foreign Office memorandum, issued by mistake to journalists in London on Wednesday, said that the Danish proposals, in their original form, were unlikely to prove acceptable to some EC countries. The Foreign Office attempted to play down the memorandum's significance, saying it amounted to no more than 'some first thoughts' written last Friday by Mr Michael Jay, assistant under-secretary for EC affairs. The memo's conclusions contrasted with comments from Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, who described the Danish paper as 'strongly positive'. In his remarks, Mr Delors appeared to pre-empt what Brussels diplomats predict will be a protracted wrangle between Denmark and its EC partners on the terms of modifying the Maastricht treaty. He stated flatly: 'You can only solve the Danish problem by adding interpretative declarations (to the treaty), you cannot add a protocol because it has the value of a treaty.' In a veiled warning to Denmark and to Britain's Maastricht waverers, he said: 'You cannot force a country to ratify the treaty - and none can have such a large right of veto that it prevents others from progressing.' Last night, Mr Delors' chief spokesman played down the significance of his remarks, saying they were in line with earlier statements by the 11 ruling out renegotiation of the treaty. Italy yesterday ratified the Maastricht treaty on European union with an overwhelming vote in favour of support by its lower chamber of parliament. Meanwhile, the Spanish lower house of parliament approved the treaty almost unanimously in a first step towards expected ratification on November 25.

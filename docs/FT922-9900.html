			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Decision today on extending controls: Regulation of companies in the Isle of Man THE Isle of Man government will today announce the appointment of a senior officer to establish a regulatory system to control those in the island who form and administer companies and trusts. Such a system is urged in a report produced about company law and trust for the Manx government and published today. The structure of such institutions is regulated in Manx law while their practitioners are not. The highly confidential nature of trusts and some types of offshore company enables unscrupulous operators to create them for people who use them for illegal purposes. When such instances come to light it causes acute embarrassment to the Manx government and regulatory authorities. The Manx Financial Supervision Commission was set up in 1983 after the collapse of Savings and Investment Bank, and has worked hard to construct a regulatory system for the island's finance sector. Formations of companies and trusts  -the backbone of any offshore financial services centre  - is the final gap in Manx legislation. Today's report was commissioned by the island's government after publication in May last year of a report by Deemster John Corrin, the island's senior judge. He said then: 'I am very concerned about the integrity and competence of those who earn their living by holding themselves out to form and administer companies.' Deemster Corrin recommended legislation: To regulate and control those who form and administer Manx companies. To make those who acquire and use Manx companies accountable to the island's authorities. To establish a supervision commission for companies. The Manx government has accepted a recommendation in today's report that the job of implementing those recommendations should be given to the financial supervision commission. Deemster Corrin also called for legislation: To facilitate investigation of the affairs of companies  - consultation has already begun about inserting a clause in the island's Companies Bill to provide for inspections of companies. To regulate those who carry on business as trustees  - consultation has begun about a bill to regulate such people. To enable serious fraud cases to reach the courts and be heard more quickly. Legislation to secure a more speedy passage through the courts is expected this year. The commission will be given enough resources to appoint an officer and establish a system of regulation and supervision for all company and trust business except insurance business, which is regulated by the Manx Insurance Authority. The commission is to submit proposals to enforce company law more effectively and to consider legislation to make those acquiring and using Manx companies more accountable to the island's authorities. The authorities have already talked to financial professionals about the best way to regulate this area. Points discussed include a code of practice, a requirement for professional indemnity insurance, an obligation for somebody in each company to be responsible to the supervisory commission and controls on formation of companies in other areas by people based in the Isle of Man. Mr Jim Noakes, director of the supervisory commission, said he favoured a register for practitioners rather than licensing. He felt that the concept of 'fit and proper' should apply also to a company's directors, managers, owners and controllers. Failing that, they should not be allowed to stay in business in the Isle of Man. Mr Noakes accepts that it may be hard to find the right person to be regulating officer. 'We don't expect to do all this very easily, or without cuts and bruises,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- The Russian Federation  Council voted on Monday to accept the resignation of former  prosecutor general Aleksey Kazannik.    121 out of 130 present members of the upper chamber voted  for  the decision, four against and five abstained.    Kazannik offered to resign in February in connection with  the  release of anti-Yeltsin rebels after the State Duma proclaimed a  political amnesty.    Yeltsin accepted the resignation and appointed Aleksey  Ilyushenko as acting prosecutor general.    But Kazannik later changed his mind and the Federation  Council, which appoints and dismisses the prosecutor, voted to  reinstate him.    To end the crisis Kazannik offered to resign again.    The Federation Council now has to discuss the appointment of  Ilyushenko. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was entrusted by  the president to press for the appointment in the Federation  Council.</p>

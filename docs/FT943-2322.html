			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Holding on to the business - In a Nutshell Only a third of small business owners have long-term plans to sell up and retire, according to a survey by Lloyds Bank and the Small Business Research Trust. Most people want to maintain their relationship with their businesses in some form, usually working 'reduced hours' or 'visiting on an occasional basis'. The survey found striking differences between the responses of men and women owner-managers. Only 20 per cent of women wanted to sell up, compared with 38 per cent of men. Some 15 per cent of women said they would 'never want to withdraw' compared with 4 per cent of men. The report was based on responses from 350 small businesses in the north, the Midlands and south-east UK.</p>

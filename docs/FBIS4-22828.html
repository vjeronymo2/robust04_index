Ibatullin; UDC 669.14.018.8:621.791.72]    [Abstract] Specimens of 30Kh13 steel measuring 2 mm in  thickness were subjected to the following finishing heat  treatment used to harden medical tools: hardening in oil from  1,000C and tempering at 150C for 1 hour. After this  treatment the steel's microstructure consisted of martensite  with a uniformly distributed carbide phase. Next the specimens  were subjected to pulse laser treatment in an argon atmosphere  with a Kvant-16 pulse laser unit (W[.sub]E[/] = 0.5-3.65  J/mm[.sup]2[/]). The focal spot measured 4.0 mm in diameter.  Polished microsections made perpendicular to the irradiated  surface were used to study the specimens' microstructure on a  DRON-2.0 diffractometer. The specimens were also subjected to  x-ray phase analysis. Irradiation of the laser-treated specimens  at W[.sub]E[/] = 0.5 J/mm[.sup]2[/] did not result in any  noticeable change in the appearance of their anode  potentiodynamic curves as compared with those of the starting  steel. After irradiation at W[.sub]E[/] = 2.5-2.95  J/mm[.sup]2[/], the carbide peak shifted to the left, and  after irradiation at W[.sub]E[/] = 3.25-3.50  J/mm[.sup]2[/], the ``classic'' form of anode potentiodynamic  curve similar to the ideal curve of _a_-iron was observed. The  unevenness of the distribution of the energy of the laser  irradiation throughout the area of the focal spot and the  superimposition of heat-affected zones on one another (resulting  in repeated irradiation of selected sections of the steel  surface) had a significant effect on the structure and phase  composition of the irradiated surface. In addition,  metallographic analysis confirmed the definite electrochemical  effect of the dissolution of the carbide phase: After  irradiation at W[.sub]E[/] = 3.25 J/mm[.sup]2[/], no  carbide phase was detected in the surface layer, and after  irradiation at W[.sub]E[/] = 3.65 J/mm[.sup]2[/], the  surface was observed to have vitrified (thus indicating that  such a laser treatment regimen is unacceptable for treating  finished instruments). The biggest increase in hardness of the  steel's surface layer (to 800 H) was achieved upon total  dissolution of the carbide phase. Analysis of the change in the  width of the diffraction peaks recorded for the study specimens  indicated that as W[.sub]E[/] increases, the width of  B[.sub](110)_a_[/] remains virtually unchanged whereas that  of B[.sub](220)_a_[/] increases. This increase in  microstresses was hypothesized to be at least partly due to the  presence of the chemical inhomogeneity of the solid solution  that develops during the process of dissolution of the carbide  phase. The studies performed thus established the possibility of  controlling the regimens used to treat medical instruments so as  to increase their microhardness to 800 H without changing the  geometry of their cutting edges.

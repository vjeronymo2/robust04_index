			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Jan 5 (AFP) -- Six Russian newspapers said  Wednesday that they would suspend publication for one week from  Monday, during US President Bill Clinton's visit, to protest  against government restrictions on the press.    The shutdown, which had initially been threatened during a  press conference Tuesday, was sparked by a November 25  government decision that would cause a sixfold rise in newspaper  production costs.    The newspapers consider this as the latest move to strangle  Russia's emerging independent media, and blame the government  for fighting to control the mass media rather than to guarantee  freedom of the press.    The six politically diverse newspapers -- IZVESTIYA,  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS,  MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA and VECHERNAYA MOCKVA -- will be shut down  for at least one week from January 10, according to a decision  by their editors.    Russian journalists' union president Vsevolod Bogdanov said  that a majority of local and regional newspapers would also join  the movement.    The editors said, however, that they would be willing to  renounce the suspension if an immediate solution to their  problem was found.</p>

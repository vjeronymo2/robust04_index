The withdrawal schedule for last year was therefore  fully adhered to, Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, commander in  chief [of the Western Group of Forces], told journalists in  Berlin today.    The last soldier will return to Russia 31 August 1994 as  planned. Official functions marking the farewell to the troops  are to take place in the capital at the beginning of August.  President Boris Yeltsin has promised to attend.    According to Burlakov, the remaining 68,000 personnel,  including 32,000 servicemen and officers, as well as 17,500  items of equipment, will be withdrawn this year. Not a single  piece of ammunition will remain in Germany.    In contrast to the withdrawal of troops, only 65 percent of  program for building apartments for the servicemen and their  families returning home has been completed, Burlakov said, and  40-45 percent of families are still without an apartment.    Another 25,000 apartments must be built this year with  German  funding and 22,000 with Russian funding. However, Burlakov  doubts whether the program will be adhered to. Germany has  promised to contribute 8 billion marks.</p>

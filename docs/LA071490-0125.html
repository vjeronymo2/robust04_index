			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SO. BAPTIST UNIT FIRES ANTI-SMUT SALVO IN NEA DISPUTE  </P> <P> A policy committee of the 14.9 million-member Southern Baptist Convention has  told members of Congress the denomination will call for abolition of the  National Endowment for the Arts unless strict controls are enacted barring  federal funds for "obscene, highly offensive, morally repugnant and  sacrilegious art."  </P> <P> The Baptist group -- the nation's largest Protestant denomination -- became the  first major church body to formally demand strict and religion-oriented  controls over the NEA since a controversy broke out last year over endowment  funding of controversial artists and artworks.  </P> <P> The new action was taken by the convention's Nashville-based Christian Life  Commission, which is empowered to take positions on behalf of the entire  denomination, according to commission spokesman Louis Moore. Moore said the  commission sent letters to every member of Congress on June 10.  </P> <P> "Clearly, those who are responsible for awarding grants at the NEA have  (funded), and will continue to fund, activities which most Americans find  highly offensive," said commission executive director Richard D. Land. Land  noted that the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention in New Orleans  last month had been unable to act on the anti-NEA resolution because the issue  came up for action the last day of the meeting, when a quorum was absent.  </P> <P> "We have no doubt that if the convention had been given the opportunity to act  upon this resolution, it would have overwhelmingly approved it," Land said.  </P> <P> The commission's letter to Congress complained about photographs by the late  Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano -- the images that set off the  controversy last year. It also questioned the propriety of NEA grants to other  artists whose work has been the subject of bitter attacks by right-wing  religious organizations and conservative politicians.  </P></p>

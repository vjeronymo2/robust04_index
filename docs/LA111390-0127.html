			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 HOMES DAMAGED IN ROOF FIRES CAUSED BY BURNING TREE  </P> <P> Roof fires caused by embers from a burning tree damaged three houses on Monday,  fire officials said.  </P> <P> They said the fires caused an estimated $15,000 in damage to the three homes.  </P> <P> Burning embers from the tree near the Costa Mesa Freeway apparently floated  over the freeway, igniting the three shake roofs, they said.  </P> <P> The Orange Fire Department is investigating how the tree caught fire. "We think  some kids were over there starting it," Capt. Douglas Mochizuki said.  </P> <P> Ken Jones was home doing work for his construction business when he smelled  smoke. "There were ashes all over the neighborhood," Jones said. "I was worried  about my own home."  </P> <P> Jones ran outside and saw that the houses on both sides of him were on fire. He  then grabbed a garden hose and climbed on top of neighbor Francis Warring's  house. Three construction workers on a project nearby also spotted the blazes  and helped to contain them.  </P> <P> Warring, 72, was treated at the scene for heat and exhaustion before being  taken to St. Joseph's Hospital where he was examined and released, fire  officials said. It took about 20 minutes for engine units from Orange and  Anaheim to control the fires near the 2300 block of Sacramento Street, they  said.  </P> <P> "Luckily we had some very helpful citizens," Mochizuki said.  </P> <P> Jones' home was not damaged due to the precautions he had taken. He had removed  wooden shingles and installed sprinklers on the roof.  </P> <P> "These roofs are probably 20 to 25 years old and are very dry," Mochizuki said.  </P></p>

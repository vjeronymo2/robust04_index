			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Government launches debate on BBC's future: Corporation told to become more efficient THE GOVERNMENT yesterday launched a fundamental debate on the future of the BBC with a commitment to public service broadcasting coupled with a warning that the corporation would have to become more efficient. The consultation document on the corporation's future is the first stage in the renewal of the BBC's royal charter which runs out at the end of 1996 - with a 15-year renewal in prospect. Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, introducing the document, which seems more intent on modernising the BBC than radically altering it, said that in many ways 'the BBC had both embodied and communicated our national heritage'. Yet the corporation could not continue as if nothing had changed since it was granted its present royal charter in 1981. With more television channels and more choice, 'the role, function and organisation of the BBC was bound to change'. In contrast to government reform of the ITV systems, yesterday's document raised many more questions than answers and set out a range of options. The options for debate include: A smaller BBC concentrating on providing what the market does not supply. This option could lead to a loss of Radios 1 and 2 and only one national BBC Television channel. Privatisation or contracting out of many of the services supporting programme makers. Creation of a Public Service Broadcasting Council which could handle licence fee money but distribute it to a variety of public service broadcasters. Hiving off BBC Enterprises to an outside body for a fee. Mr Brooke's support for the more radical options seemed lukewarm at best. The licence fee is likely to survive, the green paper suggests, if only because an obviously better system has not yet been put forward. But however the BBC is financed in future, the government made it clear the corporation not only had to give value for money but demonstrate that it was doing so while maintaining programme quality. The BBC needed to develop performance indicators to cover the efficiency of its activities. Sir Michael Checkland, director general of the BBC, which will reveal its response tomorrow, said the expiry of its charter gave the BBC a chance to rethink its role and purpose. He said: 'It is a chance that should not be missed. I look forward to an informed public debate, based on a proper understanding of the issues. The green paper lays the ground for such a debate.' Earlier, Mr David Mellor, the former heritage secretary, attacked the idea of a Public Service Broadcasting Council as 'a stake in the heart of the BBC'.

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lack of exceptional cuts Grampian Hldgs INTERIM pre-tax profits at Grampian Holdings, the Glasgow-based mini-conglomerate, fell from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 2.05m. The comparable figure was distorted by an exceptional gain of Pounds 8.34m, against a charge this time of Pounds 1.22m. The company is holding the interim dividend at 1.7p, out of earnings down at 2.14p (14.7p). The group, with interests in animal pharmaceuticals, transport, retailing and sports goods, reported operating profits of Pounds 5.16m (Pounds 5m) on turnover down at Pounds 60.2m (Pounds 66.7m) in the six months to July 2. The pre-tax figure was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 1.89m (Pounds 2.56m) although net borrowings were static at Pounds 36m. 'Trading in the third quarter has shown an improvement over the same period in 1992,' said Mr Bill Hughes, chairman and chief executive, but 'marketplace uncertainties' persisted. Sales improved in all divisions but the company excluded from the group figures Pounds 8.18m of Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 8.3m) sales in its retail business, of which it now owns just 25 per cent following a merger with the privately-held Edinburgh Woollen Mills in March. Operating losses in retail fell to Pounds 475,000 (Pounds 1.2m) for the same reason. Pharmaceutical sales rose to Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 22.5m) with overseas sales up 21 per cent but the larger UK volumes were up just 6.4 per cent. Operating profits were Pounds 3.29m (Pounds 3.06m). Transport operating profits were Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 940,000) on turnover of Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 15.9m). Sporting goods fell into losses of Pounds 273,000 (profits Pounds 160,000) on turnover of Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 14.8m). The exceptional charges related to profits on sales of subsidiaries less reorganisation costs. COMMENT Grampian, a hope-postponed stock for some while, has solved some of its problems. The pharmaceuticals division has cut annual costs by more than Pounds 1m and has just obtained licences for two vaccines it has developed. The retail merger and sportswear licencing deals are good glosses on poor quality businesses, with royalties from the latter worth about Pounds 700,000 a year. Grampian can also enjoy something of a cyclical kick through its transport interests. Profits of about Pounds 9m this year before tax and exceptionals would put the stock on a multiple of 17.3 but, assuming the solutions achieved pay off, this drops to a good-value 11.1 in 1995.</p>

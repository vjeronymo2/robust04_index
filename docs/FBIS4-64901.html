			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Herzog Should Have Kept Quiet"] </F>   [Text] The FDP [Free Democratic Party] leadership is angry  with Roman Herzog, the Union's presidential candidate. FDP  General Secretary Werner Hoyer told the press in Bonn on Monday  [9 May] that not even the "intervention" of the president of the  Constitutional Court during the weekend had altered the demands  of the liberals concerning the possibility of dual citizenship.  In press interviews, Herzog had said that foreigners who do not  wish to take German citizenship should go back to their  countries of origin. The FDP acknowledged Herzog's stance, said  Hoyer. However, he continued, the FDP wonders whether it is a  good thing for the Union's presidential candidate to give so  many press and television interviews.    Hoyer said that the FDP leadership fails to understand why  Herzog should once again remind it that the Union has left the  liberals in the lurch on the subject of dual citizenship. It  would have been better if Herzog, who needs the FDP's votes for  his election, had kept quiet. However, the FDP leadership  considers it in its interests to back Herzog instead of Johannes  Rau for the office of president.    Hoyer was speaking during a presentation of the FDP election  program, due to be adopted at the FDP congress in Rostock at the  beginning of June. The FDP Presidium's draft resolution  presents the FDP as a "party of better wage-earners." "We are  the party of the producers and higher wage-earners of today and  tomorrow, and we want to give as many people as possible the  opportunity to become better wage-earners," says the resolution.  However, the FDP does not wish to repeat the Social Democratic  Party of Germany's "ghastly mistake" of attempting to define a  borderline between "better" and "worse" wage-earners, said  Hoyer. The FDP is also interested in people who have decided to  become better wage-earners through greater productivity.  Performance must once again be profitable, said Hoyer, a  principle that the FDP wants to implement with its "civic  benefit" concept, which is geared to the poverty line. Whoever  earns wages above the poverty line should pay tax; whoever earns  wages below the poverty line should receive this "civic  benefit," which includes such social payments as child benefit,  educational grants, family income supplement, and unemployment  benefit. But only a part of one's income should be taken into  account in this system, so that "it is profitable to work."    After two years of work, the FDP draft election program lays  down the FDP's stance on all spheres of politics. It mentions  the creation of new jobs, the internal unification of Germany,  and the assumption of political coresponsibility as some of the  most important objectives during the next parliamentary term of  office. The FDP wants to create new jobs by easing the tax  burden, among other things. The new laender should receive tax  concessions whereby products by east German manufacturers might  carry a lower rate of value-added tax.    The FDP election program should again provide the basis for  coalition talks with the Union, if the voters permit the  coalition to continue, said Hoyer. The FDP's demands include a  review of the solidarity tax surcharge after three years, the  liberalization of store opening hours, a five-year time limit on  subsidies, the abolition of car tax by raising gasoline tax, and  the gradual abolition of commercial tax. A so-called major  offensive to combat organized crime has been rejected in keeping  with FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel's position.</p>

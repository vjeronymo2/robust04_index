			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Airtours bid on hold awaiting probe move AIRTOURS AND Owners Abroad, the rival travel group it is bidding for, continued to trade shots as the Takeover Panel put the timetable of the Pounds 225m bid on ice pending a decision on whether it should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Owners Abroad accused Airtours of continuing to deny its shareholders the information they will need to make a decision on whether to accept the paper offer that is accompanied by only a partial cash alternative. An Airtours adviser said that Owners Abroad's annual report, published last week, was the first financial information that Airtours had received. 'It has some pot holes, not to say black holes,' which needed to be taken into account when, and if, Airtours was considering whether to raise its offer, he said. Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, called for the protagonists to get back to the 'real issues' of 'track record and what is good for shareholders' once the trade and industry secretary has decided whether to refer the bid. Answering questions posed by Owners Abroad last week, Airtours said that having a financial year-end of September 30, rather than at the end of October, after the end of the holiday season, had no material effect on its profits. Deferring the cost of 'empty legs' to the next year in this way has the effect of increasing profits by less than 2 per cent of profits, Airtours said. The bidder also said that while the figures were not directly comparable, Airtours provided more than double the amount for maintenance costs for its aircraft by comparison with the amount Owners Abroad provided for its 17 aircraft. Airtours repeated that it believed Owners Abroad did not have in place adequate forward foreign exchange cover. While Owners Abroad had Pounds 173m, or an amount equal to about 22 per cent of sales, Airtours had Pounds 195m or about 48 per cent of sales, according to Mr Harry Coe, Airtours finance director. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, is expected to announce whether he is referring the bid within the next few days.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Scope for Mid-East change, says Hogg - Foreign Office Questions THE GOVERNMENT appeared yesterday to countenance the eventual involvement of Palestinians from Arab East Jerusalem in the Middle East peace talks, as it called on the Israeli government to desist from commencing to build further settlements in the occupied territories. Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister, suggested that there was greater scope for changes to the Palestinian delegation in the context of a multilateral forum than in bilateral sessions. The views of Palestinians in East Jerusalem must be represented somewhere, he said. Mr Hogg also expressed the view that the Jerusalem government's settlement policies were 'a serious obstacle' to progress at the talks. Any announcement by Israel that it intended to desist from those policies would be 'an important confidence-building measure,' he said. Invited by Labour to respond to a statement by the Israeli Labour party that it would put a freeze on resettlement if it won a general election in June, Mr Hogg said that he welcomed any such statement by an Israeli politician. He hoped that would also be the policy of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, were he re-elected. Mr Hogg's remarks come in the wake of the exclusion of Palestinian delegates from formal deliberations at last month's multinational forum on Middle East issues in Moscow. The exclusions were because of a dispute over the identity of the delegation's nominees. It followed a decision by the Palestine Liberation Organisation to insist on the inclusion of diaspora Palestinians in their delegation. The government said yesterday that it was pressing for the former Soviet republics to be admitted to the IMF as soon as possible.</p>

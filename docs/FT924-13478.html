			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities lower as rate cut hopes fade MORE disappointing UK economic data, the absence of a further reduction in domestic interest rates and the lack of a much-rumoured Footsie takeover bid combined to produce a disappointing performance by the UK equity market. Also, lingering hopes in the markets that the Bundesbank may sanction a reduction in German interest rates all but disappeared as German bonds dipped in response to news that the Bundesbank was not planning a post-meeting press conference. News of further job losses at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, one of the market's important marketmaking firms, after UBS said it was pulling out of making markets in some 200 smaller stocks, came after the market close but had been rumoured around the City's trading rooms during the session. UBS is the third big trading firm to reduce its smaller companies dealing book in the past couple of months, following similar moves by SG Warburg Securities and County NatWest. The UBS cutbacks in smaller companies' trading coincided with news that the Stock Exchange is planning a new trading system, called the Stock Exchange Alternative Trading Service, or SEATS, expected to get underway on November 16. Under SEATS a single marketmaker in any stock will be allowed to operate along with the Stock Exchange's current Bulletin Board system. The Footsie 100 Index closed the session a net 10 points lower at 2,574.7. The Footsie Mid 250 Index performed broadly in line with the premier index, ending the day 9.9 down at 2,401.0 and the all-encompassing Footsie 350 settled 4.9 off at 1,237.0. Share prices began the day in reasonable form, edging ahead to record a 2.1 gain at 2,586.8 within the first hour of trading. But a big share placing in Glaxo plus a brace of programme trades, both sizeable and weighted to the sell side, took the heart out of the market, driving the Footsie down to a day's low point of 2,562.9, down 21.8, as Wall Street opened. The New York market looked uncomfortable at first but quickly stabilised after news of slightly better-than-expected retail sales for September and was showing a minor gain as London closed. Dealers noted the appearance of a handful of buying orders as the market moved towards the close, eventually leaving the Footsie 100 well above the day's low. The absence of the rumoured takeover bids in the banks area did not deter buyers in the sector with HSBC and Barclays both well supported and heavily traded. There was above-average turnover in TSB although traders said there was no evidence of any stakebuilding activity. Paper, packaging group Arjo Wiggins fell again as house broker UBS lowered its profits estimates. Turnover in equities was a disappointing 487.1m shares. Customer business in the market on Tuesday was valued at just short of Pounds 900m. The leading insurance brokers, Sedgwick and Willis Corroon came under persistent pressure, with Sedgwick especially vulnerable to bear selling.</p>

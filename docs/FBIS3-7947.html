This was  established by an army inspection headed by Jaromir Novotny,  director of the Foreign Relations Section at the Defense  Ministry.    The inspection found that, according to the applicable  tables  on issue of arms, the soldiers were armed for peace conditions.  "If something happened, each soldier would certainly have some  kind of weapon, but we have decided that he will be better  armed," Novotny said. He emphasized that the army command also  decided that each UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] battalion will  have a submachine gun. To date, submachine guns have only been  used by the soldiers authorized to do so by the appropriate  standards.    Novotny stated that the unit will have guided anti-tank  missiles at its disposal.    The better equipment for the Czech troops will be brought by  the 117 soldiers who yesterday left the UN peacekeeping forces  training base in Cesky Krumlov for Karlovac in Croatia.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Prem Shankar Jha; quotation marks, italicized </F> words as published]    [Text] U.S. officials may swear till they are blue in the  face that the statements made by the Assistant Secretary of  State for South Asia, Ms. Robin Raphel on Kashmir, do not spell  any change in the U.S.' policy towards Kashmir. But no  subsequent clarification can change the fact that Ms. Raphel's  remarks constitute the most dramatic and inexplicable turnabout  in U.S. foreign policy since the Clinton administration came to  power. It is not impossible that Ms. Raphel did not mean to  question the validity of the Instrument of Accession, but  despite being inundated with queries from Washington think tanks  and newspapers all over the world, the U.S. State department has  not issued a contradiction. Policy makers in New Delhi have no  option but to take Ms. Raphel's statement seriously and fathom  the motives behind it.    The shift has not really been sudden. Ms. Raphel started  several weeks ago by saying that the U.S. considered the whole  of Kashmir a disputed territory. She has since elaborated that  the U.S. no longer considered the Simla agreement a valid basis  for the settlement of the dispute. In support of this she cited  the fact that there had been very few discussions under the  agreement in the last 20 years. At this point observers in India  assumed that the U.S. was considering reviving the U.N.  resolutions of 1948, which proposed a plebiscite in the State  once peace had been restored. But in her latest briefing Ms  Raphel has broken entirely new ground.    The U.N. resolutions envisaged only two choices for the  people of Kashmir, whether to belong to Pakistan or India. If  Ms. Raphel's briefing truly reflects government policy, the U.S.  has explicitly delinked itself from that resolution. It now  believes that the Kashmiris must have the right to choose  independence if they so wish. What is more this right must be  exercised by the people in the whole of the princely state of  Kashmir, i.e., both Jammu and Kashmir and `Azad Kashmir,'  including Gilgit, and the other areas that Pakistan has already  explicitly annexed.    The possibility can no longer be ruled out, therefore that  the U.S. is now questioning the validity of the Instrument of  Accession that made Kashmir part of India because it would not  mind seeing a fourth nation in the subcontinent, carved out of  bits of India and Pakistan. If this is indeed so, Ms. Raphel's  remark questioning the accession was only undiplomatic and not  inaccurate.    What is genuinely surprising about the above stance is its  illogicality. To begin with, it is simply not true that the U.S.  did not accept India's sovereignty over not only present day  Jammu and Kashmir but over the whole of the original princely  state as it existed in 1947. During the Security Council debate  in April-May 1948, the U.S. permanent Representative, Warren  Austin stated categorically that with the signature of the  Instrument of Accession sovereignty over Jammu and Kashmir  passed from Maharaja Hari Singh to the government of India...  That was why, he said, it was India that had come to the U.N. as  the petitioner (Security Council Official Records, Vol. 1-15,  Page 371).    The acceptance of Indian sovereignty is implicit in the  U.S.'  support for the Security Council resolution of May 1948 which  called for the vacation of the entire state by Pakistani forces,  the maintenance of a sufficient number of troops by India to  ensure the return to peace, and a plebiscite after an  unspecified period of time to be held under Indian auspices.  Thenceforth every time the U.S. endorsed a plebiscite, it willy  nilly endorsed the fact that Sovereignty over the whole of  Kashmir vested in India till the time when it was held.    Ms. Raphel's remark that the Simla agreement ought to be  scrapped because very few discussions had been held under it,  turns logic on its head. Every border between nation is the  result of an agreement, sometimes explicit, at others implicit.  When both countries recognise the border there are no  discussions. These arise only when there is a dispute. Between  1972 and 1990 there were very few such discussions because  Pakistan accepted the LoC as the de facto  international border. They began to question it once more only  when an insurrection, carely fomented by them for four years,  broke out in 1990. It was India's mistake that it even agreed to  discuss Kashmir in any form or shape after that. That has given  the opening to the U.S. that it may be seeking to exploit today.    In questioning the Instrument of Accession the Clinton  Administration has questioned the basis of not only the  accession of Kashmir to India, but of more than 600 princely  states to India and Pakistan. What is more, since the Instrument  was the lynchpin of the transfer of British paramountcy over the  princely states to the successor governments of India and  Pakistan, it calls into question the transfer of power itself,  and consequently the legal basis for the existence of Pakistan  and India.    Why on earth should it want to do so? If one were to believe  its protestations it is with the noblest of motives -- Peace and  Human Rights.    Both of these are reasonable, even unexceptionable goals.  But  so far as the maintenance of peace is concerned, the U.S. would  achieve it far more easily if it put pressure on Pakistan to  stop fomenting rebellion in Kashmir, told it to forget its legal  claim to `PoK' [Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir] and told both  countries to respect the status quo and turn LoC into the  international boundary, with perhaps minor modifications, as was  envisaged beyond a shadow or doubt in the Simla agreement.    As for the Human Rights, Ms. Raphel who was in India when  the  Babri Masjid was demolished and quizzed several senior  journalists, including this writer, about its fallout on  Hindu-Muslim relations, knows better than anyone else in the  State department just how tense these relations are today. She  can hardly be ignorant of the holocaust that would follow if  Kashmir was snatched away from the country.    The U.S. did start down the road outlined above in 1991 and  to curb Pakistan activities in Kashmir it put the country on the  terrorist watch list, and it repeatedly urged both countries to  settle the dispute under the Simla agreement. But that was the  policy of Mr. George Bush.    To gauge what this might be just take a look at where  Kashmir  -- the whole state and not just Indian Jammu and Kashmir -- is  situated.    Kashmir is like a broad dagger thrust between Sinkiang and  Tibet. What is more it is ideally suited to dominate the largest  of the Central Asian republics, Uzbekistan. A free Kashmir,  acutely vulnerable to both India and Pakistan, because it is  dependent on both for markets, tourists and access to the sea,  will immediately look for a Godfather. Who could fill the bill  better than the Americans?    There could be a secondary purpose also. This would be to  drive a physical wedge between China and India. Unlike our own  intellectuals, U.S. analysts could not have failed to grasp the  significance of the Sino-Indian agreement on the Border areas,  of Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao's nearly four hours of  talks with the Chinese Premier, Mr. Li Peng, the great  importance that China attached to the visit, and the  unmistakable hints given by the latter that he expected much  closer cooperation with India on international issues in the  future. It is even possible that the outcome of Mr. Rao's visit  to China tipped the scales within the U.S. administration in  favour of the policy that it is now unveiling.    The above analysis admittedly gives a concreteness to U.S.  design that could be misleading. U.S. analysts must know that an  independent, united Kashmir will be resisted by both India and  Pakistan. They have also learned from the public's reaction to  the involvement of U.S. troops in Somalia, that Americans are  not deeply interested in international affairs, and especially  in military adventures abroad, if these mean a loss of American  lives. Despite this when India's very nationhood is at stake, if  the government's repeated assertions do not bring forth an  explicit endorsement of the validity of the Instrument of  Accession, it will do well to put the worst construction on Ms.  Raphel's statement.    The first need is to explore afresh whether Pakistan  realises  that it has finally reached a situation where it stands to lose  more from its adventurism than to gain from it. If so, an  agreement to settle somewhat along the LoC and then work jointly  to give the Kashmiris the maximum possible autonomy within  existing boundaries, may begin to look a lot more attractive  even to them. If it does not, then India will do well to close  the Kashmir dispute unilaterally, by declaring unambiguously  that the accession of the State to India is no longer open to  debate.    Secondly, India will do well to strengthen its bridges with  China. China faces similar problems with regard to Tibet and may  therefore welcome cooperation on this issue in its own  self-interest.</p>

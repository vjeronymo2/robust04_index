			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Auditors 'inhibited' by client pressure PRESSURE from clients is inhibiting many accountancy firms from qualifying accounts or voicing reservations about the figures in them, says a survey of 492 small and medium-sized firms carried out for the Management Information Centre. Thirty-two per cent of the firms said they felt such inhibitions in the present economic climate. Thirty-eight per cent said client pressure inhibited the honest assessment of whether a company was a going concern, while 79 per cent said that making a judgment on whether a company was a going concern was an increasing problem. Twenty-eight of the firms also admitted that they employed staff who were 'not competent in the use of audit procedures'. That disclosure came in answer to the question of whether firms were worried about the inspections under the audit regulation requirements introduced last year. Most said that they were. Assets and liabilities should appear in company balance sheets even if there is doubt about how to measure them, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday. The comments come in a submission to the Accounting Standards Board from the Financial Reporting and Auditing Group of the institute in response to two draft documents on the framework for new accounting standards.</p>

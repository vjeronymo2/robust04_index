			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Morgan Grenfell Equity Trust to raise Pounds 24m MORGAN Grenfell Equity Income Trust, a UK investment trust, is attempting to raise about Pounds 23.8m, after expenses, via an offer for subscription of C shares. The directors say that, in their opinion, 'the UK economic outlook currently provides attractive opportunities for investment' and therefore 'now is an appropriate time to expand the capital base of the company.' The trust, which was floated in October 1991, was second in the UK income growth sector over the year to November 1. Issuing C shares is now common practice among investment trusts which want to expand their capital. The C shares will be convertible into ordinary shares after January 7; by waiting to convert until the proceeds are substantially invested, there is no dilution of the net asset value of existing ordinary shares. Up to 25m C shares are on offer at 100p; the minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. Irrevocable undertakings to buy 8m shares have been received. The offer closes on November 23.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TEEN PLAYING WITH GUN FATALLY SHOOTS SELF  </P> <P> Seconds after a friend's warning not to play with a handgun, a Palmdale  teen-ager put the revolver he thought was empty to his head and pulled the  trigger.  </P> <P> Jason Sanders, 16, died instantly Saturday from a single shot to the head from  a .44 magnum revolver he had been waving playfully at two friends, Los Angeles  County coroner's investigator Eugene McDonald said.  </P> <P> Authorities said the boy and his friends had been drinking before the shooting,  but it was uncertain whether they were intoxicated.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Deputy Ronald Thomason said Sanders took the gun from the living room  of his house in the 3100 block of East Avenue Q-13 about 10:30 p.m. The gun  belonged to his mother's boyfriend, who left it out because he planned to go  hunting Sunday morning, Thomason said.  </P> <P> From the living room, Sanders walked to the front steps of the house and  pointed the gun in jest at two friends, Shane Patrick Sheahan, 19, of Las Vegas  and Darrell Timothy Worelds, 21, of Palmdale. Sanders ordered his friends not  to move before he placed the barrel of the gun against his temple and fired,  Thomason said.  </P> <P> Sanders, a junior at Desert Winds Continuation School in Lancaster, collapsed  on the front steps and was covered by a blanket when deputies arrived. He was  declared dead at 10:40 p.m., but coroner's officials said Sanders died  instantly from the shot.  </P> <P> Sheahan reportedly had told Sanders not to play with the gun and urged him to  put it away seconds before the fatal shot was fired, Thomason said.  </P></p>

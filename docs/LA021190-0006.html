			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE 7.1 EXPERIMENT;  </P> <P> FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, THE LOMA PRIETA TEMBLOR WAS A NATURAL DISASTER. FOR  SCIENTISTS, IT WAS THE OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME -- AND AN EARTHSHAKING  SURPRISE.  </P> <P> GEOLOGIST TOM HOLZER looked through red-rimmed blue eyes at the two dozen  rumpled men and women slumped in chairs before him. He was standing in a  conference room in the steamy, windowless heart of the U.S. Geological Survey  complex in Menlo Park, Calif.  </P> <P> "Has anyone seen faulting?" Holzer asked wearily. He spread his hands, palms to  the ceiling. "Anywhere?"  </P> <P> No one in his audience -- the exhausted scientists of the USGS branch of  engineering seismology and geology -- responded.  </P> <P> It had been 50 hours since the 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake convulsed Northern  California a few seconds after 5:04 p.m., Tuesday, Oct. 17, 1989. Holzer, 45,  and the engineering group that he directed could count on one hand the hours of  sleep they had sneaked since crawling from beneath their desks after the  tremors jolted Menlo Park.  </P> <P> Moments after the earth ruptured 10 miles east-northeast of Santa Cruz and 60  miles south of San Francisco, the group had been among a contingent of about  500 earthquake scientists who had swarmed into frenzied action. Riding  excitement the way surfers ride waves, researchers in Japan, West Germany,  Chile, the Soviet Union and Australia dashed madly to their computers to  observe the long undulations coursing through the earth to their seismographs.  About 50 others from universities and regional USGS offices in Hawaii, New  York, Colorado and Southern California grabbed their instruments and headed for  the USGS in Menlo Park, the nation's premier earthquake research facility, only  30 miles north of the epicenter.  </P> <P> "We think it's great!" a seismologist gushed at one point in the USGS press  room and then attempted to swallow his words. "Well, not great, but . . ."  </P> <P> It wasn't that he didn't recognize the sobering destruction, the lives lost,  the financial ruin or the paralyzing fear a major earthquake causes. It was  just that the same violent shaking that meant disaster to most people meant an  opportunity for him and his colleagues to gather data impossible to obtain any  other way. Their grand-scale seismic experiments always erupt courtesy of  Nature, unplanned and uncontrolled.  </P> <P> Although they can't put earthquakes into bottles or re-create them, researchers  did snare this temblor, and its echoing aftershocks, in their own fashion --  they trapped it in a vast, worldwide network of instruments. In the weeks  following the earthquake, they set out to identify the beast they had already  named after the most prominent geographical feature near the epicenter,  3,791-foot Loma Prieta, the highest point in the Santa Cruz Mountains. They  began their pursuit puffed with confidence. They had forecast this particular  animal -- magnitude, locale and time frame -- 18 months earlier. They were  armed with assumptions and theories built on decades of studying California's  700-mile San Andreas Fault system, which surely was the locus of Loma Prieta.  </P> <P> Holzer's group was responsible for measuring, mapping and analyzing the  physical effects of the quake, including liquefaction (where usually solid  ground had turned to mush), surface cracks and landslides. They had returned to  Menlo Park after a day in the field, crawling into sand-filled basements,  peering out of low-flying aircraft, bushwhacking through the Santa Cruz  Mountains. The bushwhackers had expected to find the surface expression of the  rupture: a disjointed but orderly series of cracks running along a 25-mile  segment of the San Andreas Fault. Instead, the fault-line team told Holzer in  puzzled voices, the hundreds of cracks they found -- some large enough for a  person to stand in, some only 1/8-inch wide -- ran perpendicular to the fault  or broke in a direction opposite of what was expected. It just didn't make  sense.  </P> <P> As the frustrated engineering group met, Andy Michael, 30, a round-faced,  normally cheerful seismologist, frowned over his computer screen a few doors  away. He and the other nine seismologists in the USGS seismology branch, had  expected their computers to produce a map showing a fairly straight line of  aftershocks echoing and tracing the main rupture along the San Andreas. But the  Loma Prieta aftershocks spread in a cloud across two minor faults nearby, the  Sargent and the Zayante.  </P> <P> Another anomaly was showing up on his screen as well: The epicenter -- the  point on the earth's surface directly over the buried hypocenter where the  rupture began -- was nearly 4 miles west of the San Andreas instead of right on  top of it.  </P> <P> And what was this speculation coming from the USGS regional office in Pasadena?  The land mass known as the Pacific Plate, the scientists in Pasadena suggested,  had shoved into and over the North American Plate. C'mon, Michael thought.  Everyone knows the San Andreas is a strike-slip fault: The Pacific Plate creeps  north and the North American creeps south along a vertical plane, which is the  fault itself. One day, all this creeping will make Los Angeles a suburb due  west of San Francisco. But no one expected the San Andreas to behave like a  thrust fault, an entirely different beast.  </P> <P> In fact, so much of the seismic information was unexpected that Michael and his  co-workers were wondering whether the computers had been knocked silly by the  earthquake. They had spent hours double-checking everything. The night was  dragging on. Nothing was changing.  </P> <P> Back in the conference room, a geophysicist named Will Prescott, head of the  USGS tectonophysics branch, quietly slipped in to hear the latest from the  engineering group. A slim, bearded 44-year-old, with brown eyes hidden behind  thick glasses, he had already heard about the data that had Michael perplexed.  It would be at least another day before his team of geodetic scientists --  geophysicists, geologists and technicians who measure and study changes in the  earth's crust -- could analyze the data it had collected so far and offer a  good picture of exactly how the area around Loma Prieta had shifted. But even  the geodetic group's preliminary data indicated something strange was going on.  Just hours before, a geophysicist reported that the quake had moved a mountain  only a few inches north. An earthquake the size of the one Prescott had felt on  Oct. 17 should have generated displacement that was, well, a little more  earthshaking.  </P> <P> Holzer ended the meeting after assigning the next day's tasks and settled down  to paper work. Fifty-two hours gone, and still the scientists hadn't grasped  the essence of Loma Prieta. If their assumptions were correct, they would have  known what the beast they had trapped looked like. It was becoming clear that  the San Andreas wasn't what they thought it was. "It wasn't fitting our model,"  Holzer said simply.  </P> <P> In other words, the Earth had fooled them again.  </P> <P> ON FRIDAY MORNING, Holzer's fault team trudged back into the mountains to look  for the fault-line cracks they thought had to be somewhere. Along the way, they  set out instruments to measure the creeping that usually occurs after an  earthquake. Holzer had asked the geologists to pinpoint and study as many  effects of the quake as possible before they were plowed under or washed away  by expected weekend rains.  </P> <P> Sue Hough, a 28-year-old seismologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty  Geological Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., had left her husband in charge of  their two young children and flown west on Thursday, Oct. 19, with five  colleagues. They came bearing the latest high-tech portable seismographs that  measure how different types of soils shake during an earthquake. Volunteering  their services and their equipment, they were sent by Holzer to a spot his  group had yet to inspect on foot: the area around the collapsed section of  Interstate 880, the Nimitz Freeway, in Oakland.  </P> <P> Early Friday, Hough -- a soft-spoken woman with deep-set hazel eyes -- walked  along side streets near the pancaked freeway and looked for surface signs of  the quake. In the warm morning sun, she saw rescue workers frantically digging  for survivors in the concrete rubble. "I used to live in this area," she  thought. "I used to drive this freeway and think about earthquakes. I used to  think it was a coffin."  </P> <P> Because of the detours set up by rescuers, Hough and two colleagues zigged and  zagged around the collapsed section, comparing an Oakland street map against a  soils map drawn by USGS engineering seismologist Roger Borcherdt in 1976,  nearly 20 years after the double-decker structure was built. The soils map was  the first produced to identify areas that would be particularly unstable during  an earthquake.  </P> <P> Hough was astonished to see just how closely the boundaries of the destruction  coincided with the change in soil types. The collapse began where the freeway  crossed from relatively solid sediments to fill that covered San Francisco Bay  mud. It looked like a textbook example of why the map had been drawn in the  first place. Now all she had to do was prove that the collapse was related to  the unstable ground below.  </P> <P> The next day, Hough and her colleagues placed five seismographs throughout the  area, including one on the fill above Bay mud and one on the more solid  sediments. For the next six days, the seismographs recorded all strong  aftershocks. Later, Hough would transfer the data to a computer disk and run it  through a computer program that translated the bytes into pictures of jagged  lines showing horizontal motion (side to side and forward and back) and  vertical motion (up and down). On Saturday, Hough put a sixth seismograph on an  uncollapsed section of freeway for 15 hours.  </P> <P> When the Loma Prieta earthquake ruptured nearly 12 miles underground, the earth  was responding to the still-mysterious forces in the asthenosphere where rock  flows like warm plastic. Riding this subterranean goo are continent-sized  jigsaw pieces of crust. Four miles to 40 miles thick, these tectonic plates  do-si-do past each other in a continuous square dance around the Earth. The  Pacific Plate moves past the North American Plate at an average rate of nearly  4 centimeters each year. In some segments, tons of compressed rock on the edges  of the plates get caught on some subterranean snag for years. When enough  pressure builds, they suddenly rip free and slam into adjacent rock, setting  off waves of different sizes and shapes that ripple, tear, undulate and  ricochet through the earth.  </P> <P> The first waves emanating from an earthquake, called the primary waves, act  like the waves coursing through a Slinky that is stretched out on the ground  and jerked at one end. The wave doesn't move up and down; it contracts and  expands the material through which it moves. These are the "What was that?"  waves, Holzer says. These waves break through the surface at about 4 miles per  second to disturb the air and create the terrible primeval roar heard as the  earthquake's slower, but more damaging, second waves come careering along at  about 2 miles a second. These secondary waves, called shear waves, wrench  buildings from side to side, toss desks into the air and fling refrigerators  across kitchens.  </P> <P> It was the shear waves from Loma Prieta that Hough wanted to measure. As the  waves traveled from the hypocenter, they weakened, until they encountered  loosely packed soils, which have room to shake more intensely than compacted  soils and bedrock. Bay mud was one of those soil types that could be expected  to amplify waves. Not only did Hough want to ascertain how much the mud  amplified the shear waves in contrast with the more settled sediments nearby,  she also wanted to see if the freeway resonated to those amplified waves. That  is, she wanted to see whether, in an aftershock, the freeway's normal vibration  pattern or frequency matched that of the amplified earthquake waves. If it did,  the increased frequency would cause the freeway to shake harder and harder.  </P> <P> While Hough was working around the collapsed freeway, dozens of others in  Holzer's group were chasing Loma Prieta's shear waves elsewhere. Seismologist  Paul Spudich headed a group placing seismographs along the tops, sides and  bottoms of ridges in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The destruction had been  incredible there -- houses twisted and thrown off their foundations, redwoods  snapped in half. David Boore, another seismologist, was awaiting results --  gathered by hand from old-fashioned, non-computerized instruments -- from  another type of seismograph called a strong-motion detector. Designed to record  jolts that would knock other seismographs off the scale, more than 120  detectors had been tucked into structures all over the Bay Area. When he  obtained the records from each one, Boore would see the pattern of the strong  jolts and how the various structures housing the instruments had responded.  </P> <P> Geologist John Tinsley coordinated the search for liquefaction in the Monterey  Bay area. On Friday, and every day for four weeks, he recruited a dozen people  to hunt down telltale miniature gray "volcanoes" -- sand boils. Wet and loose  sandy soils or fill not only amplify a shear wave, they also can be shaken so  severely that they liquefy. Sand particles collapse into each other, lose the  strength to support themselves and anything above them, and behave as if they  were fluids. The sand boils form when water, squeezed from between collapsing  sand particles, shoots to the surface, taking sand with it. Hundreds of sand  boils erupted during the Loma Prieta earthquake -- between Oakland  International Airport runways, at the Alameda Naval Air Station, at the east  end of the Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge and in San Francisco's Marina  District.  </P> <P> In the Marina, another liquefaction team headed by geologist Tom Hanks found  bits of tar paper and pieces of old glass -- ironically, detritus from the 1906  quake that had been used for landfill -- that also spurted to the surface. In  some cases, sand boils erupted with enough force to break through thin concrete  floors of basements and fill them with sand.  </P> <P> The liquefaction teams, once they found the sand boils, began taking aerial  photos, measuring displacement, drilling for soil samples. They also placed  seismographs to measure the aftershocks to determine how Loma Prieta had  transformed terra firma into melting Jell-O.  </P> <P> It would be a few more weeks before the engineering group slowed down enough to  begin analyzing the data. But a few things were becoming clear.  </P> <P> The assumptions they had made about the way soils would respond in a major  quake had been confirmed, with some minor surprises centering on how vigorously  the loose soils had shaken. What they were turning up now was enough data to  help create more and better maps and to tweak their early conclusions on the  way land around Loma Prieta responded when the San Andreas snapped. They were  already telling the news media and state and county engineers a mild version of  "I told you so."  </P> <P> But there was still the matter of those cracks. A week after the quake, the  fault-line search had petered out. There were simply no cracks that demarcated  the rupture of the San Andreas Fault. Unlike every other major San Andreas  quake ever studied, there was no place where you could stand on one side of the  fault line and see displacement on the other side. What emerged indicated a new  phenomenon. Although many of the cracks were landslide cracks indicating  shifting topsoil commonly seen in any earthquake, others were inexplicable. The  geologists were stumped.  </P> <P> At first Dan Ponti and his team of researchers theorized that the cracks  outlined huge blocks of ground that had rotated during the temblor. Later, they  proposed that perhaps the mountain ridges were spreading the way a loaf of  French bread splits in the oven.  </P> <P> Although they expected landslide cracks from shifting topsoil and rifts where a  fault ruptures to the surface, they didn't expect such dangerous fissures -- 3  feet wide and 10 feet deep. Nor did the researchers expect to see them so far  away from the fault line. Whatever the mechanics and the ultimate meaning of  the cracks, it looked as if they had discovered a new effect of earthquakes,  and a new hazard as well.  </P> <P> WHILE THE engineering team measured cracks and set out seismographs Friday, a  jubilant Andy Michael, parked once again in front of a blinking computer  screen, cheered silently. There was no doubt about it. The data were clean.  Something new had occurred on the San Andreas Fault, and he was part of the  team that discovered it.  </P> <P> What he was looking at was massaged data from a network of seismographs all  over the area that painted a cross-section of the aftershocks. On his screen,  the aftershocks appeared as a smattering of tiny octagonal dots whose diameters  increased with magnitude. The pattern showed plainly that the earth didn't  rupture along a neat vertical slice of the San Andreas as expected. Instead,  the dots showed a fault plane that tilted at a 70-degree angle. The Pacific  Plate, as it had moved north, pushed up and over the North American on that  angle; "it shows thrust," Michael said. This segment was an oblique fault -- a  combination of strike-slip and thrust faulting -- something unheard of on the  San Andreas before the Loma Prieta earthquake.  </P> <P> An angled San Andreas Fault plane also would explain the unexpected location of  the epicenter. Most of the San Andreas is like a vertical wall plunging miles  beneath the surface of the earth. Earthquakes begin to rupture somewhere along  the bottom of that imaginary wall. That rupture point, the hypocenter, is  usually found directly below the epicenter. In fact, before Loma Prieta, the  hypocenters of San Andreas Fault earthquakes were always located directly below  the epicenters. But Loma Prieta's epicenter was 4 miles from where the top of  the San Andreas wall ran through the Santa Cruz Mountains. That meant that the  wall in this case was tilted, as if the Pacific Plate was leaning against the  North American. And when seismologists drew a straight line from the hypocenter  to the surface, the epicenter was 4 miles away from the top of the wall.  </P> <P> Creating a detailed picture of what happened on the Loma Prieta segment of the  San Andreas Fault was what the seismology branch was all about. The puzzle  pieces these scientists were looking for were location (epicenter and  hypocenter), length of rupture, magnitude and the mechanics of the faulting  itself. Like the seismologists in the engineering group, they relied on  seismographs to provide them with wave data to analyze the earthquake. But  unlike the engineering group, their seismographs recorded only the primary  waves -- the first clean shivers that look so familiar when they're depicted as  jagged lines on a rolling drum of paper.  </P> <P> Today, those drums are old technology, and seismologists refer to them only  occasionally. Computers, with their ability to crunch massive amounts of data  quickly, collect and process the seismic data now.  </P> <P> In the basement of the USGS complex, about 100 technicians maintain the  seismology branch computers. They are hooked to a network of about 500  seismographs at 400 California sites. When Loma Prieta struck, the computers  automatically began processing the stream of data to change the bytes into dots  on the computer screen. The biggest dot was the epicenter.  </P> <P> Location is one of the first things the seismologists look to the computers to  discover. They used to calculate it off the printed jagged lines of the primary  and shear waves, using a formula developed in the 1890s. It's so simple that it  can be computed in your head, as long as you live far enough away from the  epicenter to feel the primary waves and the stronger shear waves separately.  (Close to the epicenter, the waves erupt right on top of each other and feel  like a jumble of violent tossing and turning.) All you have to do is multiply  the seconds between the first shake and the second by five. During the Loma  Prieta quake, a Sacramento resident, for example, could have multiplied the 20  seconds between the first jolt and the second by five and come up with an  epicenter that was about 100 miles away.  </P> <P> At Menlo Park, only 30 miles from the epicenter, so few seconds lapsed between  the first rumble and the second, that the researchers in the seismology branch  barely had time to crawl under their desks to avoid flying books and bookcases.  They raced to the computer room seconds later when they discovered that the  quake had knocked out their personal computers. Although backup power kept most  of the main computers in the basement running, the quake had also cut off about  20 seismographs near the epicenter.  </P> <P> That's one reason they believed their initial data was suspect, Michael said.  That first night, he and his colleagues in the seismology group, who were  accustomed to working on mostly self-assigned projects in their own offices,  were thrown together in the basement computer room, watching dot patterns of  aftershocks till dawn.  </P> <P> David Oppenheimer, a seismologist who specializes in calculating probabilities  of earthquakes, watched with some concern the computerized pictures of the  aftershocks creeping up the San Andreas Fault toward the San Francisco  Peninsula. For a while, he and the others thought another big earthquake might  be getting ready to occur.  </P> <P> They determined later that they used 38 seismographic stations to arrive at the  location of Loma Prieta. They relied on 267 to figure out the focal mechanism  -- exactly how the earth moved. But because their instruments were too  sensitive to record the enormous impulses coming from such a large quake, they  let the USGS National Earthquake Information Service in Golden, Colo.,  determine the magnitude.  </P> <P> The method of determining relative magnitudes of earthquakes was developed by  seismologist Charles Richter in the 1920s. Richter's scale compared the size of  the largest shear wave -- the highest crest on a seismogram -- and the distance  from the epicenter the wave was recorded. His scale is logarithmic: Each  increase of one in the rating indicates a tenfold increase in the amplitude of  the seismic wave, and about a 32-fold increase in total energy released.  </P> <P> The first Loma Prieta magnitude issued by the USGS seismologists in Golden was  6.9, based on four seismographs in Alaska. For the next week, however,  magnitudes poured into Golden from many of the 2,000 seismographic sites around  the world, including those of the World Wide Standardized Seismograph Network  the U.S. Department of Defense installed in the 1960s during the height of the  Cold War to monitor Soviet underground nuclear tests. Since the earth's crust  isn't uniform -- the speed and size of the earthquake waves vary at each  station -- not every seismograph calculates the same magnitude. The USGS  averaged hundreds of magnitudes, which ranged from 6.5 in Tahiti to 7.5 in  Eastern Europe, and one week after the quake, revised the magnitude to 7.1.  </P> <P> But the puzzle of Loma Prieta was missing one important piece: How close to the  surface did it come? For most earthquakes of this size, it would have been easy  to determine where the rupture ended because there would be a visible rift in  the ground. But because scientists weren't finding any evidence of a surface  break, Michael looked to the geodetic scientists in the USGS tectonophysics  branch for the answer.  </P> <P> PEOPLE THINK we have a great job," said geologist Karl Gross, 38, field  operations manager for Will Prescott's group of global surveyors, the geodetic  scientists. Gross, a former U.S. Marine who did embassy guard duty in the  Middle East, spends most of his time now measuring the great outdoors to a  tolerance of an eyelash. "They see us outside on top of mountains, in beautiful  places with great views. Of course, they're not up here when there's 30 knots  of wind and a temperature of 5 degrees." Or hunched over computers at 2 a.m.  fitting the measurements into a model that explains what happened 12 miles  under the earth's surface.  </P> <P> When the Loma Prieta earthquake hit, Gross and most of the other members of the  Menlo Park geodetic group were measuring other parts of California in a  continuing project to determine how the surface of the western United States is  changing shape. After hurrying back to the Bay Area and checking on families  and friends, the nine geodetic scientists and technicians began a schedule that  could have been a study in sleep deprivation. They arose at 4 a.m. to drive to  mountaintops as far as three hours away, took measurements until sunset, drove  back to Menlo Park to rest, changed equipment, went back out at midnight for  nine hours and returned to process data.  </P> <P> The plan was to remeasure the distances from Loma Prieta to several other  mountains in the San Francisco Bay and Monterey Bay areas. Placed on a map, the  measurements look like a black spider web with Loma Prieta in the center. After  gathering figures, with two types of instruments, on how much the earth had  moved during the quake, the scientists would begin to monitor the smaller  increments of post-quake creep.  </P> <P> Geophysicist Mike Lisowski and physical science technician Gary Hamilton,  bundled against the cold, dry air atop Loma Prieta, aimed a laser beam from a  contraption called a geodolite toward Mt. Allison 26 miles away through holes  they had cut long ago in a chain-link fence at a television station antenna  facility.  </P> <P> "We've measured this line every month for the last five years," said Lisowski,  who gulped a bite of cold oatmeal as he waited for Gross to find the benchmark  on the other mountaintop. The USGS or the National Geodetic Survey has been  planting benchmarks -- round brass plates -- on virtually every prominent spot  in the nation since the 1800s.  </P> <P> Gross set up a panel of reflectors that looked like numerous car tail lights on  a stiff board, radioed that he was in position and flashed a mirror against the  sun to help Lisowski aim the laser.  </P> <P> Lisowski peered through a telescopic sight on the side of the 100-pound white  geodolite, which was perched on a tripod above the Loma Prieta benchmark. He  made gentle adjustments until he could see a tiny red dot -- the laser beam's  reflection -- on the far mountain. He looked in the sky and spoke into a  walkie-talkie: "Tom, we're ready when you are." A Cessna 182 swooped overhead,  banked and flew from the top of Loma Prieta toward the mountain where Gross,  walkie-talkie in one hand, binoculars in the other, watched carefully.  </P> <P> "The airplane flies along the laser path to measure the temperature and  humidity," said the tall, hefty Hamilton. He munched on a bag of Corn Nuts.  "There's a delay in the signal that's caused by the density of the atmosphere."  They needed to know that delay to make accurate distance readings.  </P> <P> Lisowski, binoculars to eyes, guided the plane as a computer recorded the time  it took for the laser pulses to travel from Loma Prieta to the other mountain  and back. "A little left. A little up. Looking good." Soon the plane was out of  sight, and control passed to Gross. After the plane flew over Gross, it banked  and flew back to Loma Prieta on a second pass.  </P> <P> The work continued throughout the day as crews dragged reflectors to six sites,  from Mt. Allison in the East Bay to a low hill in Watsonville. At one point, a  woman with a benchmark on her property asked Gross how much her land had moved  during the earthquake. Lisowski consulted his computer and radioed back: "Tell  her she's 7 inches closer to Loma Prieta than she was two weeks ago."  </P> <P> At 2 the next morning, yellow and white lights glimmered brightly in the cold,  windless air from San Jose to Oakland. The soft machine hum of civilization  rose 2,659 feet to Mt. Allison, where geologist Jerry Svarc set up the latest  in surveying equipment: a small, white satellite receiver -- "the conehead," he  said.  </P> <P> The receiver works with the U.S. Global Positioning Satellite System, which was  designed as a military navigational aid. The essence of the system is that it  can tell people instantly where they are on the planet, to within a couple of  feet. With solar panels extended and plump bodies canted toward Earth, the  satellites resemble 1,500-pound fruit flies the size of Volkswagen bugs. Svarc  had to track four of them as they orbited 12,000 miles overhead, from 3 a.m. to  9 a.m., continually broadcasting radio signals indicating the time and their  location.  </P> <P> At 3 a.m., Svarc's conehead picked up the satellites' signals and transmitted  them to a computer in the back of a USGS truck. By pinpointing its position  relative to all four satellites, the computer calculated where it was --  longitude, latitude and altitude.  </P> <P> Once the computer locked into the satellites, Svarc sat in his truck and  waited, under orders not to abandon the $150,000 equipment. Just before dawn,  he watched car lights multiply on the freeways far below. This was the future.  In the past few months, geodetic scientists have shown that the satellite  system is in many ways as accurate as geodolites, and it doesn't require two  teams in the mountains or clear days. The satellites can be used day or night  in any weather.  </P> <P> With the geodolite and global positioning system, Lisowski and Prescott took  the data that they and the other geodetic scientists had collected and provided  the missing piece of the puzzle: how far below the surface of the earth the  earthquake stopped. They did this by working backward -- putting all the  surface changes in a computer and determining which model of a rupture fit  best. The answer they came up with was 3.7 miles.  </P> <P> So, two weeks after the earthquake, the seismologists and geodetic scientists  offered this description of the Loma Prieta earthquake: Eleven-and-a-half miles  below the surface of the earth, a 25-mile-long segment of the Pacific Plate  lumbered 6.2 feet north and pushed 4.3 feet up and over the North American  Plate. Even though the rupture stopped 3.7 miles from the surface of the earth,  the ground level uplifted as much as 14 inches and, in some spots, moved as  much as 7 inches north.  </P> <P> THE DECEMBER MEETING of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco was the  place in 1989 for geologists, geophysicists, seismologists, volcanologists,  meteorologists, physicists, oceanographers, hydrologists, geochemists and  engineers to swap theories and data. The gathering was especially exciting  because the earthquake scientists had a new temblor to show off: Loma Prieta.  </P> <P> Thirteen Loma Prieta scientists delivered 15-minute synopses of their  observations to colleagues packed into San Francisco's Civic Auditorium. Andy  Michael presented the seismology branch results. Will Prescott delivered the  geodetic scientists' conclusions. David Boore discussed preliminary data from  the engineering group. Sixty additional presentations were relegated to a  packed afternoon "poster" session, where researchers tacked their papers to  giant bulletin boards in a hangar-sized hall. Hundreds of scientists jammed the  aisles to read about liquefaction, aftershock warning systems and the way  helium in soil acted before the quake. Some scientists decorated their bulletin  boards with photos, elaborate illustrations and bold headlines; others  augmented their presentations with videotapes or slide shows.  </P> <P> Sue Hough preferred the subtle approach. Among the paper and photos tacked to  her bulletin board was a small plastic bag full of Bay mud. Her seismographs  had indeed shown that aftershocks had shaken the fill over the Bay mud harder  than the older, relatively solid sediments. It also looked as if the pancaked  section of the freeway resonated to the amplified earthquake waves, and thus  may have shaken even harder.  </P> <P> Like all the information coming out from the engineering group's research,  Hough's has a direct connection to life in the fault zone. She had already sent  her findings to Caltrans, which had to decide how and if it would rebuild the  collapsed freeway sections. "Last I heard, they were putting in a proposal for  a single-deck freeway," Hough said with a sigh. "As a seismologist, I'd like to  see them go in a little further onto stronger soils, but there are problems in  displacing communities."  </P> <P> The USGS liquefaction teams had their data posted in the hall, too: pictures of  sand boils and slumped buildings, and preliminary maps pinpointing problem  areas. "A sizable contingent of practicing engineers believes that once a  (soil) deposit liquefies, it doesn't do it again," drawled John Tinsley. "We  were eager to see if the same areas that (had problems in 1906) suffered  liquefaction. We found that generally to be true."  </P> <P> Dan Ponti stood around talking about cracks. The state, he said, may need to  zone some areas for what should be considered an earthquake engineering hazard  as serious as liquefaction and amplification. It was a hazard with a silver  lining, though. There's pretty good evidence, he said, that the ground had  cracked this way before, during previous earthquakes. That means, Ponti said,  that by "trenching" the cracks -- conducting an archeological dig in the area  -- geologists may be able to obtain a historical record of when and how other  earthquakes had occurred. And that is one step in predicting the next one.  </P> <P> In fact, the question of prediction was a hot topic at the poster session.  David Oppenheimer stood amid the billboards discussing probability studies. His  own research into the effects of Loma Prieta on other segments of the San  Andreas was just beginning.  </P> <P> Earthquake probabilities are based on the theory that the longer a segment of  the San Andreas goes without an earthquake, the more likely it is to break and  break big. There had been three forecasts -- prediction is too strong a word --  for the segment where Loma Prieta ruptured. They varied in probability from 30%  to 47%, over 30 years, and in segment length, from 18 miles to 45 miles. They  all agreed on the magnitude: 6.5. With the 7.1 temblor (six times larger than  the forecasts), seismologists consider the chance of another quake in that area  small. But what happens on the northern end of the segment? In the days  following Loma Prieta, while Oppenheimer was watching aftershock patterns, he  noticed a strong jolt under Daly City, on the next segment north from the Santa  Cruz area. He began a new research project, arranging for more instruments to  be placed on the peninsula segment. "Loma Prieta clearly loaded that section of  the fault," he said. But when will an earthquake occur there?  </P> <P> "Some models predict an earthquake in five years; some models say 50 years,"  Oppenheimer said. "It's really speculative stuff. We just don't understand the  process."  </P> <P> As the poster session drew to a close, Andy Michael looked forward to pursuing  his science at a slower pace, perusing some of the 100,000 individual records  of aftershocks. And he planned to finish the report he was writing when Loma  Prieta hit -- an analysis of the Whittier Narrows earthquake in Los Angeles in  1987.  </P> <P> The geodetics group was heading back into the field to finish its interrupted  terrain measurements in Mammoth and the Tehachapi Mountains while it continues  to monitor the Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas.  </P> <P> Tom Holzer and the USGS engineering seismologists and geologists planned to  finish their analysis in San Francisco's Marina District and the Santa Cruz  Mountains and present their reports to city and county officials early in the  spring. Holzer anticipated some controversy. The earthquake threw the  engineering group into the middle of discussions about whether residents in the  mountains would be allowed to repair or rebuild their homes, and the Marina  soils report promised to raise a political brouhaha as well. Many of the  repairs to homes and underground gas and water pipes are just "quick fixes,"  said USGS structural engineer Mehmet Celebi.  </P> <P> While the poster researchers packed up, dozens of scientists and engineers  swapped business cards and arranged to obtain raw data from the instruments  that had snared Loma Prieta's primary and secondary waves to do further  research. Researchers would be studying the effects of Loma Prieta and  producing scientific papers for years.  </P> <P> "There are probably things about this earthquake that we'll never understand,"  Ponti said. "The Earth doesn't want to tell us all of its secrets. But that's  the nature of the beast."  </P> <P> LOMA PRIETA: WHAT HAPPENED.  </P> <P> THE CAUSE  </P> <P> The Loma Prieta quake was both a strike-slip, (horizontal) rupture and a thrust  (vertical) rupture. Starting about 11.5 miles underground and extending to  within 3.7 miles of the Earth's surface), an angled segment of the San Andreas  fault broke as the Pacific Plate moved northwest in relation to the North  American plate and thrust up and over it. The angled, thrust motion never  before associated with the San Andreas, explains why the epicenter was miles  off the San Andreas Fault line. At the surface, the ground was pushed up 14  inches and north about 7 inches. At the rupture point or hypocenter, the Earth  moved up about 4 feet and north about 6 feet.  </P> <P> THE EFFECTS  </P> <P> Liquefaction and amplification which increase a quake's destructive power,  occurred widely during the Loma Prieta quake. In San Francisco's Marina  District, for instance, surface eruptions of liquefied deposits-sand boils-told  the tale. Amplification contributed to the collapse of Oakland's Nimitz  Freeway, which killed 42. Other physical effects included large cracks and  landslides near the epicenter.  </P> <P> Liquefaction: When seismic waves hit loosely packed deposits that contain  water, the waves increase in strength and cause the deposits to liquefy.  Liquefied deposits can erupt in a sand boil.  </P> <P> Amplification: When seismic waves hit loosly packed deposits-which have room to  shake more intensely than compacted deposits-the waves increase in strength.  </P> <P> The Probability of Earthquakes on the San Andreas Fault, 1988-2018, by Segment  </P> <P> I: North Coast: Less than 10%  </P> <P> II: S.F.Peninsula: 30%  </P> <P> III: Santa Cruz Mtns.: 30%  </P> <P> IV: Central Creeping: 10%  </P> <P> V: Parkfield: Greater than 90%  </P> <P> VI: Cholame: 30%  </P> <P> VIII: Carrizo: 10%  </P> <P> VIII: Mojave: 30%  </P> <P> IX: San Bernardino Mtns.: 20%  </P> <P> X: Coachella Valley: 40%  </P> <P> These probabilities were calculated 18 months before the Loma Prieta quake hit.  The quake fulfilled the forecast for Segment III; it also may have "loaded"  Segment II, increasing the chances for a major earthquake there.  </P></p>

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy The good news in the latest Dun &amp; Bradstreet business failures figures is that they tend to confirm that the recession is easing. The total is growing more slowly and the focus is shifting towards smaller companies, as it did after 1980-81. The bad news is that companies remain under intense pressure. Bad debts continue to plague 80 per cent of them and many larger companies are surviving only because of rigorous cost cutting, deferred investment and delayed payments to suppliers - hardly a propitious background for investing in recovery. After the last recession business failures continued rising until 1984, which suggests there may be a couple more years of increase to come this time. The difference is that, at 62,767, failures this year are already some three times the peak in 1984. So it is legitimate to ask when and how quickly banks' loan loss provisions can drop. The rate will be the principal factor behind any earnings recovery. With provisions running at over 3 per cent of their loan book, the main clearing banks are better protected than they were at the end of the last recession. Property prices may stabilise in the wake of lower interest rates, obviating the need for additions to existing provisions as the value of collateral falls. Still, it is hard to escape the conclusion that any decline in provisions will be tortuously slow. Less so, perhaps, for a bank such as Midland which provided early in the cycle and trimmed its lending. More so, for Barclays, which not only provided late but is also deeply involved in small business lending.</p>

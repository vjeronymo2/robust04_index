			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ichiro Ozawa, representative secretary of the Japan  Renewal Party, who is a behind-the-scenes real power holder of  the Japanese coalition government, said that he believes North  Korea already possesses nuclear weapons, and predicted that  power a struggle will arise in North Korea after President Kim  Il-song is retreated.    In a television interview this morning, Secretary Ozawa said  that North Korea apparently possesses nuclear weapons. But he  failed to show evidence that can support his allegation of  suspicion of nuclear arms development. He pointed out that  North Korea is an incredibly fanatic society and that the  struggle will be triggered so that the right succeeds to power  after Kim is retreated and that there is a possibility that an  upheaval will be touched off on the Korean peninsula.</p>

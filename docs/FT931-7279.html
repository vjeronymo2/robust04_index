			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Arts: Cosi fan tutte and Falstaff - Opera The latest season of English Touring Opera, launched this week at Sadler's Wells, joins last autumn's novelty, a Falstaff directed by Tim Hopkins, to a brand new Cos fan tutte. The Cos is the work of Claire Venables, her second staging for the company (she produced Albert Herring during its previous incarnation as Opera 80) and her third venture into Mozart. The Cos promised much. Colleagues have spoken highly of the Venables Magic Flute (for Opera Northern Ireland) and Figaro (for Norrlandsoperan in Sweden), and certainly the short essay which she contributed to the ETO programme suggested a serious examination of just what the opera is about: 'I am curious to test,' she writes, 'whether the opera is telling us that it is actually possible to fall in love with anybody. If this is the case it means everybody is loveable and can be loved. Once we grasp that. We can then choose whom to love.' Somewhere in that testing process, though, things seem to have gone seriously awry. The staging begins promisingly. Idit Nathan's designs fix it firmly in an art school where the lovers are fellow students and Alfonso their jaded teacher; the women's class is adorned with male icons, the men's with ideals of femininity. Through the first act art and reality are gradually melded together: as the men go off to war Alfonso evokes 18th-century military imagery, scrawling 'Love equals Death' across an easel while they make their farewells; Despina illustrates her views on men with Cagnacci's The Rape of Lucretia and Manet's Olympia. The lovers' portraits are caught on Polaroid, and when the strangers appear they are decked out as Laurel and Hardy, or perhaps, in this context, Gilbert and George. The effect of all this is to disorientate rather than to engage. Apart from the unfailing invention of Jeremy Sams's witty English text, the only common denominator is a low-grade knockabout humour. Once real life has been thrown out of the window (literally in the second act as the set begins to crumble away too) nothing is left to pull together the threads in the finale. Whatever the mise en scene for a Cos, the emotions have to be credible, the moral dilemmas real; Venables does not begin to make a dramatic case to match her own manifesto. Ivor Bolton nevertheless conducted briskly and with a good deal of stylish wit, and the performances of Julie Unwin as a feisty and always watchable Dorabella and Charles Johnston's cool Alfonso in particular followed him well. Andrew Burdon's Ferrando was forthright and Meurig Davies, apparently under the weather as Guglielmo, gained steadily in power and confidence; Catherine Pierard, though, seemed badly miscast as Fiordiligi. Eleanor Bennett's engaging Despina began with a strong Scottish accent and then allowed it to deconstruct, along with everything else in the production. The Falstaff by contrast is both consistently fascinating and coherent, even though it may not be to all tastes. The curtain rises on a Garter Inn that would serve for a production of Wozzeck or Die Soldaten; Falstaff and his cronies drink alone in bare claustrophobic cubicles, harshly lit; Dr Caius appears to have come straight out of Nosferatu, Bardolph and Pistol from an unnamed Buchner drama. None of the later images is so striking, but Hopkins's production (designs by Peter J. Davison) never quite loses that formalising element of mannered expressionism. Even if the result does not celebrate Verdi's glorious affirmations as wholeheartedly as it could (the final scene is very hard to mould into this concept) everything works; there is a discipline about the proceedings and a refusal to go for the easy jokes that is refreshing and revealing. Its one big miscalculation is to treat Ford's deeply serious outburst in the second act (well sung by Patrick Donnelly) with such levity, losing a precious element in the opera's miraculously balanced scheme of feelings. The cast maintains the dramatic consistency. Jonathan Velra's Falstaff seems less concerned with concepts of chivalry than with personal integrity and, in the end, with just getting through. He delivers all his music with a salutary straightforwardness; Amanda Holden's fine, relaxed translation is always easy to catch. There is a deft and nimble Alice Ford from Margaret Preece, a cutely pointed Mistress Quickly from Marie Walshe, and a small-toned but engaging Nannetta from Gaynor Morgan. Charles Peebles conducts without unnecessary rhetoric. It is well worth catching somewhere during the spring. Sadler's Wells until Saturday, then touring England until the end of May; London season sponsored by Arjo Wiggins Appleton</p>

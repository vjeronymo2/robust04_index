			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Small steps forward for European exporters: William Dawkins at the sixth EU-Japan ministerial meeting in Tokyo Satisfaction but not euphoria was how Sir Leon Brittan, the European Trade Commissioner, described his mood after the sixth EU-Japan annual ministerial meeting on Saturday. Sir Leon and his two colleagues, Mrs Christiane Scrivener, in charge of tax and customs, and Mr Rene Steichen, responsible for agriculture, returned to Brussels yesterday with a briefcase half-full of small, yet concrete, trade prizes designed to help European exporters make their way in the Japanese market. Individually, the fruits of the commissioners' visit are as technical and low-profile as the components of Europe's attempt to achieve economic integration - a process which may have lessons for Japan's present halting steps to economic deregulation. Yet in total, the outcome is enough, Sir Leon claimed, to show that Europe's diplomatic style of trade negotiations with Japan is bringing results. That message is intended to soothe any European executives who suspect they are being cut out of Japanese trade deals achieved by their US competitors through threats of unilateral action from Washington. The EU trade prizes are: A Tokyo declaration that it wishes private sector companies to allow no political considerations to influence commercial decisions. Given the traditional power of nods and winks from Tokyo, this could carry real weight, if backed up by bureaucrats in the ministries concerned. Tokyo is to negotiate with Brussels, starting immediately, on recognition of each others' industrial certification and product tests. The EU is the first trade partner with which Japan has had such talks. Japan has agreed that imported food can carry 'use by' dates, rather than the date of manufacture, as proposed in its most recent deregulation package, in July. Japan will accept Japanese standards certificates issued by EU bodies, for textiles imports. Imports of high-quality EU linen will be permitted to carry labels differentiating them from inferior competition. European exporters of 400 electrical appliances will be able to certify themselves as safe under Japanese standards from next year, rather than have their goods tested in Japan. On top of this, the Commissioners patted their hosts on the back for progress in opening the Japanese market since the last ministerial meeting in January 1993. They were especially pleased with a plan for clearer public procurement rules, tighter laws against bid-rigging, and a recent boost to the staff and operating guidelines of the formerly toothless Fair Trade Commission. Sir Leon pointed out that there was still a long way to go on other trade gripes with Japan, such as the continuing wide gap in tax on imported and Japanese spirits. Financial deregulation had not gone far enough and there was still a large number of official curbs on large stores, said a EU report. While Japan's trade surplus with the US has continued to rise, by 9.4 per cent to Dollars 44.29bn (Pounds 27bn) in the first 10 months of this year, its surplus with the EU is in its second year of decline, perhaps evidence that Europe's polite approach pays. Japan's surplus with the EU fell by 19.5 per cent to Dollars 18.55bn in the 10 months to October. Sir Leon firmly denies that the EU is tempted by the US strategy of trying to pin Japan down to targets for import market share or the reduction of its current account surplus to a certain ratio of gross domestic product. Yet the EU team's official 'expectation' that Japan's surplus would fall substantially by next year indicates that it wishes to apply at least polite pressure. 'We should not be starry-eyed. . . and yet we should not be overly cynical,' said Sir Leon.</p>

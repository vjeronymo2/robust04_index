			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / The Property Market: Improvement in quay quality - Salford's docks, like London's, suffer from empty offices Ten years ago, Manchester's Salford Quays epitomised the ugly face of industrial decline. The heart of what was once the country's third-largest port lay derelict and vacant. Its docks were deserted and its warehouses were a haven for rats. The canal was so badly polluted that someone falling in was alleged to be more at risk of dissolving than drowning. This was the unpromising crucible of one of the 1980s' most significant experiments in urban regeneration. In place of the decaying docks, there are now a hotel, cinema, flats, offices, promenades, green areas and sweeping vistas across canal basins. The water is clean enough to fish in. The transformation of Salford Quays provides a parallel with London's Docklands, the best-known example of the achievements and the difficulties of inner-city regeneration, although on a far smaller scale. The two areas have been moulded by similar forces: the decline of their docks, enterprise zone tax breaks, government-funded land reclamation and the property boom. There are also physical similarities between the two former docklands: the neat street furniture, the colourful brick roads and the bijou, toy-town architecture, which already looks dated. Both areas were governed by enterprise zones, set up by the government to offer tax incentives to investors. In Salford Quays, the Enterprise Zone expired in August last year, delivering so much new office space on to the market that its vacancy rate exceeds that of London's Docklands. About 800,000 sq ft out of a total of 1.2m sq ft lies empty, according to Lambert Smith Hampton, the chartered surveyor. The empty space is concentrated in three buildings: Manchester Ship Canal Company's 116,000 sq ft Harbour City, AMEC Properties' 247,000 sq ft building called The Anchorage, and Charter Group's 530,000 sq ft Exchange Quay. Charter Group's building has a close relative in the London Docklands, where the same company has erected a 503,452 sq ft building at Harbour Exchange. As well as physical similarities - both buildings are dark-glass behemoths - they have been a similar drain on financial resources. Charter Group sold the buildings to investors in Enterprise Zone Trusts, having guaranteed to pay the rent and running costs until tenants moved in. The developments have so far been unable to attract sufficient tenants, and Charter cannot meet its obligations to investors. 'Charter . . . is unlikely to meet its obligations and accordingly the Trust will be forced to pay these costs . . . ,' said the Property Enterprise Trust's managers in a letter to Exchange Quay's investors last month. An additional difficulty is that, even if the scheme does attract a tenant, it is unlikely to be willing to pay the Pounds 15 per sq ft guaranteed by Charter Group. The market rate at Salford Quays, after taking account of incentives, is Pounds 10 per sq ft at most. While London Docklands has suffered partly from its location, some distance from the City, Salford Quays is close to Manchester city centre and well served by roads and buses. However, London Docklands' well-publicised problems in securing the Jubilee Line extension have similarities - on a far smaller scale - with the extension of the metro to Salford Quays. The Salford extension would cost Pounds 17m - 100 times less than the Jubilee Line extension  - but it has foundered for the same reasons. It would need a contribution from private developers, which are in no position to provide the funds. There are also questions being asked over whether the construction of waterside flats and offices does enough for impoverished local communities. This point was highlighted a few weeks ago when there were disturbances in the surrounding area of Ordsall. Salford Quays' supporters, however, stress its human scale, and contrast it with the London Docklands. As Mr Stephen Pressman of Dunlop Heywood, a firm of surveyors with an office in Salford Quays, said: 'We are only two miles west of the city centre. You can go by car into the heart of the city in 10 minutes . . . It is more planned; there is a greater sense of identity.' The planning was carried out at the behest of Salford City Council, which has been one of the driving forces behind the regeneration of the area. The operation began at the start of the 1980s, when it purchased much of the land on Salford Quays for Pounds 1.7m from the Manchester Ship Canal company and secured derelict-land finance from the Department of the Environment. In 1985 it commissioned Shepheard, Epstein and Hunter, a firm of architects and planners, to produce a development plan. It drew up proposals to reclaim the area by constructing canals and quays, and putting in roads, pedestrian routes and landscaping. The canal was dammed and divided into basins, thus reducing the scale of the dock and making it more suitable for development. 'The water constitutes an asset which should be exploited with the same spirit of enterprise shown a century ago with the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal,' said the architects. By March 1991, the council, aided by government grants, had put in Pounds 30m of infrastructure, while the private sector's investment in industrial, residential and commercial buildings, a cinema and a hotel totalled Pounds 250m. The ambitions of the developers grew considerably in the late 1980s, to a level that many critics think was unrealistic. Mr Mike Butterworth, property director of the Manchester Ship Canal, developer of the massive Harbour City scheme, disagrees. 'If you look at the history of Salford Quays, it started with small industrial buildings. Gradually the quality and use has improved. This is merely the next stage,' he said. He conceded that the letting market was in a difficult state, but said he took comfort in the minimal land costs of the building and his company's decision to treat it as a long-term investment. 'We are not looking for a quick buck,' he said. That is probably just as well. Even enthusiasts reckon it will take three to five years to absorb the space in the Salford Quays market. Although Manchester as a whole is not burdened with an oversupply of office space, hopes that the property market would benefit from relocations from outside the area have subsided. The eventual verdict on Salford Quays will depend on its success at attracting occupiers. 'At the start, people were sceptical,' said Mr Pressman. 'It was Salford docks and there wasn't much cachet about Salford. But it has established itself and people who come down here like it.' Mr Roger Rees, chief executive of Salford City Council, points out that the area is now employing 3,000 people - as many as the docks employed in their heyday. Mr Rees wishes that the metro had been installed at the outset, but he is enthusiastic overall. 'As an example of the conversion of decaying, derelict docklands in modern uses, then I think it has been successful by 20th century standards,' he said. His dream is to crown the achievements of Salford docks by building a Pounds 34m arts complex for opera, ballet and galleries, which would house the L S Lowry collection on the last significant site on the Quays. The plans were unveiled last week. If this is ever built, the building would be the last work of its architect, Sir James Stirling, who died earlier this month.</p>

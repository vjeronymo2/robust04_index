			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Andrews Sykes The independent directors of Andrews Sykes are delaying giving a recommendation on the increased offer from Mr Jacques Murray, valuing the industrial services company at Pounds 10.7m, until they have received advice. In a statement yesterday they said they would be writing to shareholders in due course. Mr Murray, Andrews' chairman, increased the offer he is making through European Fire Protection Holdings, his private Netherlands-based company, on Wednesday. The independent directors gave split advice on the first offer, which valued Andrews at Pounds 8.24m. They said that risk-averse shareholders should consider selling in the market while those who had confidence in Andrews' potential should reject the offer.</p>

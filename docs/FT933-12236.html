			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Iraq denies missile fired at US jets: Baghdad seeks to play down incident over 'no-fly' zone IRAQ yesterday rejected US reports that a surface-to-air missile had been launched against a US air force jet over southern Iraq at the weekend, claiming the defence department report was either a 'plot' or a 'hallucination'. The statement followed reports from Washington that jets patrolling the 'no-fly' zone late on Saturday had seen a single projectile launched soon after a US F-4G had fired at and hit an anti-aircraft missile site in the area. The F-4G had been 'illuminated' by the site's radar. The Iraqi response to the incident, made in a statement handed to reporters in Baghdad, was less defiantly aggressive than previous reactions to reported clashes in the 'no-fly' zone, set up by the Gulf war allies to prevent Iraq using air power against rebel Shia groups in southern Iraq. However, the firing of an anti-aircraft missile would be the first attack on US jets since Iraq declared an informal ceasefire in the region following President Bill Clinton's inauguration in January. A Pentagon spokesman said that Saturday's missile launch had been witnessed by two US jets and was the second such skirmish within a month. Another F-4G 'Wild Weasel' fired at an anti-aircraft site near Basra on June 29. US aircraft patrolling the 'no-fly' zone from bases in Saudi Arabia are under orders to attack any missile site if they are 'locked' by its radar. Iraq said the defence department report 'is either hallucination on the part of the pilots or an attempt by US administration circles to fabricate a crisis'. Its dismissive tone suggests Iraq is anxious to avoid further tension with the US while it embarks on a fresh charm offensive within the United Nations, with the particular aim of persuading the Security Council to consider easing economic sanctions. Talks with the UN on a limited oil sale are expected to resume in New York this week. Wide-ranging discussions on Iraq's compliance with UN ceasefire terms are also scheduled to begin in New York as soon as next month. This results from last week's resolution of a confrontation over the installation of monitoring cameras at two missile test sites and Iraq's declaration that it would consider long-term monitoring of all its weapons programmes. A team of UN weapons inspectors arrived in Baghdad yesterday to install video cameras at the two sites as part of a compromise brokered between Iraq and the UN last week by Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN envoy. The cameras will be turned off pending the results of the UN-Iraq talks next month and the UN inspectors are expected to leave Iraq within four to seven days.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 12 May (INA)--Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim  Basindwah has stressed that the Yemeni people, with all their  national factions and forces, are confronting the secessionist  rebellion led by Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] members. In a  statement to an INA correspondent in Cairo before heading for  Amman, Basindwah said: What is taking place in Yemen is not a  civil war as depicted by some people, but a confrontation  against the remnants of secessionism and violators of the  constitution and legitimacy.    Basindwah said: Now that the separatist cliques have  continued with their agentry, fabrication of crises, and  igniting the war, the Yemeni people and the constitutional  government have decided to confront these cliques to restore  security, stability, and legitimacy. He stressed that matters  are proceeding in favor of legitimacy and the people, adding  that there is no question that they will triumph.    The foreign minister said that the government and people,  led  by Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, appreciate Arab  brothers' feelings and concern over unity. He added: However,  what is taking place in Yemen is an internal matter. Fighting  was imposed on us, so we have no choice but to defend law and  unity in the wake of the crisis fabricated by the separatists  over the past year.    Regarding the possibility of reaching a cease-fire and  holding dialogue, Basindwah said: If these elements do not  return to constitutional legitimacy and resort to law, and if  the gangs do not abandon their dreams and return to the  legitimacy represented by the Constitutional leadership under  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, we will continue to uproot them.    Asked about his current Arab tour, Basindwah noted that  Yemen  hopes that the Arab brothers will understand what is taking  place as well as the crisis fabricated by the YSP leaders to  strike at Yemeni unity. He stressed that some parties refer to  Yemen as South and North for separatist objectives, adding that  many members of the current government come from the South, such  as the new defense minister, the commander of the Navy,  fighters, and commanders.    Basindwah ridiculed the separatists' statements that Arab  parties are helping the Yemeni Government in confronting the  separatists. He said: We challenge them to prove this. It is  not strange to see these rebellious apostate elements making  such false statements at the instructions of foreign forces.    Asked about the nature of the Yemen's future political life,  Basindwah said: Following the regrettable incidents, Yemen will  enter a new phase of stability, democracy, prosperity,  legitimacy, and collective participation in the government in  accordance with the interests and Constitution of the Republic  of Yemen.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic to post loss after charges of Dollars 2.3bn Bell Atlantic, the US regional telecommunications group, said yesterday it would take after-tax charges of Dollars 2.3bn in the third quarter to cover a write-down in equipment values and a cut in the workforce. The charges mean the group will report a loss for both the quarter and the year. Most of the charges relate to the revaluation of the old copper-wire telephone network that the group is currently replacing with a digital network able to carry voice, data and video services. Another Dollars 100m of the charges will cover the cost of reducing Bell Atlantic's workforce by 5,600 over the next three years (a quarter of the cuts will come from management positions), while a further charge of Dollars 35m to Dollars 45m will go towards funding the group's withdrawal from several non-strategic businesses. Bell Atlantic is the latest of the 'Baby Bell' regional phone companies to take a big charge to pay for cost-cutting. Earlier this year New York-based Nynex took a Dollars 1.6bn charge and announced plans to cut its workforce by 16,800. Before that, BellSouth and US West both unveiled similar restructurings. The Baby Bells are slimming in preparation for competition in their local telephone markets and for the development of new businesses such as delivering interactive video, entertainment and information services to customers homes via the phone companies' telecommunications lines. Although the interactive business is still in its infancy, the regional phone groups are scrambling to forge alliances with entertainment providers. Bell Atlantic and two other Baby Bells - Nynex and Pacific Telesis - are said to be discussing plans with Creative Artists Agency, the Hollywood talent agency headed by Mr Michael Ovitz, to create a joint venture to deliver entertainment programming to consumers homes. According to the Hollywood newspaper Variety, the venture with CAA would be similar to the recently-announced alliance between three other Baby Bells and the Walt Disney group. Bell Atlantic's shares fell Dollars  3/4 to close at Dollars 56 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Matthew Clark rises 9% in difficult market MATTHEW CLARK, the British wines and mineral water producer, lifted first half pre-tax profits 9 per cent to Pounds 2.42m in 'a recessionary trading environment.' Earnings per share for the six months to October 31 improved slightly from 16.4p to 16.5p and the interim dividend is raised from 6.5p to 6.75p. Operating profit increased 21 per cent to Pounds 2.45m on turnover which declined 2 per cent from Pounds 27.65m to Pounds 26.06m. Sales of Strathmore Spring water, which the company acquired in May last year, rose 23 per cent in a market which remained static during the latter part of 1992, said Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive. 'Whilst we are confident that the UK market for bottled water will resume growth as the economy improves, competition in the sector will remain intense,' Mr Aikens added. 'We intend to build demand for Strathmore Spring Water with substantially increased levels of marketing expenditure.' Old England British sherry retained brand leadership in a market which grew 4 per cent compared with a 6 per cent decline in Spanish sherry sales. The company increased market share in spite of the inroads into brand sales by private label business. Stone's Original Ginger Wine performed well. The company is investing Pounds 3m in its Barchester Winery, which should improve quality, increase efficiency and provide better facilities for product development, Mr Aikens said. Cost reductions had been made in most areas of the business, particularly production and distribution. Mr Aikens said Christmas trading had ended satisfactorily after a slow start. 'We expect our core British wine business to perform rather better than the overall wines and spirits market for the rest of this financial year but we envisage continued pressure on margins. Strathmore should outperform the market as recent listings by multiple retailers and wholesalers translate into sales.'</p>

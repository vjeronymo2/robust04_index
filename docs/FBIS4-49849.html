			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>   [Excerpts] Members of the Standing Committee attending the  Seventh Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National  People's Congress [NPC] today [9 May] examined the Draft Law on  the Management of Urban Real Estate, the draft decision on  punishing criminals who violate copyrights, and other proposals.  [passage omitted]    Some members held that laws related to the Law on the  Management of Urban Real Estate, such as the Land Administration  Law, should also be formulated as quickly as possible. Some  members said that, in order to prevent disputes over trifles  among various real estate administrative departments, it is  necessary to let one department assume unified management.    In examining the draft decision on punishing criminals who  violate copyrights, some members said that, without clear and  specific laws and regulations, the people's court will find it  difficult to make punitive judgments. They eagerly hoped that  the decision could be adopted after revision as quickly as  possible.    The members today also examined the Draft Law on Judges and  the Draft Law on Procurators.</p>

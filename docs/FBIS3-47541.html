In this way, he clarified his view that he will not  accept the U.S. demand to set concrete figures as objective  criteria to measure the degree of Japan's market liberalization.    Japan and the United States are facing rough going in  discussions over the three sectors: insurance services, autos  and auto parts, and government procurement. As for the  establishment of the objective criteria in particular, the  opinions of the two countries are sharply divided.    In the 12 January meeting, Prime Minister Hosokawa stated:  "I said at the summit talks held last November in Seattle in  the United States that I could not accept numerical targets. I  would like to confirm this again at the upcoming summit talks."    Moreover, saying that "multilateral actions are needed to  prevent the United States from invoking Article 301 of the  Omnibus Trade Act," Hosokawa clarified his plan to use the World  Trade Organization (WTO), which will be formed in 1995 as a  result of an agreement reached at the Uruguay Round (new  multilateral trade negotiations of the GATT), to prevent  sanctions between the two countries.    As for the issue of financial resources for an income tax  cut, which will be a pillar of his economic measures, Prime  Minister Hosokawa stated: "The Social Democratic Party of Japan  understands the need to carry out a fundamental reform of the  tax system. However, it has a different understanding when it  comes to the consumption tax." In this way, he stressed the  difficulty of ironing out the differences of opinion within the  ruling parties over the issue of increasing the consumption tax  rate.    Moreover, he commented on the Finance Ministry, which wants  to limit a lead period of a tax cut to 15 months, and stressed:  "I do not know if it [15 months] is enough to convince the  people. We have to study how we can cut spending and accomplish  fairness in the tax." He also said that "some kind of political  decision will be needed" after the government's investigatory  council for tax reform reaches its conclusions on a reform of  the tax system for fiscal year 1994.</p>

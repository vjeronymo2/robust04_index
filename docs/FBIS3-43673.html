Diplomatic sources in Lusaka say Alioune Blondin Beye, special  representative of the UN secretary general in Angola and the  principal mediator of the peace talks, was able to bring the two  sides' views closer on the formation of the police.    The same sources said yesterday that the two sides had  reached an agreement that the police will be a state  administration organ. Over the past few days, Alioune Blondin  Beye has held separate meetings with the two sides to bring  their stands closer on the issue of the police.    What now remains to be discussed are national  reconciliation,  the future UN role, UNITA's active participation in the  government, and the second round of presidential elections. One  thing is clear, though, the riot police will have to be banned.    It is expected that the parties will today begin to discuss  specific principles connected with the national police and its  formation modalities. Regarding the riot police, there is  nothing to discuss. This wing of the MPLA-PT army which Spain  formed, in violation of the Bicesse Accords, will definitely be  banned in the interest of peace.</p>

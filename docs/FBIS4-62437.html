			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- President Leonid Kravchuk today visited the  "Kiev Spring Fair-94" exhibition, which opened at the Sports  Palace. After Leonid Kravchuk had viewed the exhibits he  answered journalists' questions.    Speaking about the new parliament, Leonid Kravchuk pointed  out that it is too early to draw a conclusion that the  parliament has become politicized, because its formation is  still under way.    Assessing a possibility that the parliament will consider  the  law on the delimitation of functions between the president and  the government, Leonid Kravchuk declared that the result of the  work done by the initiative group is not yet the opinion of the  parliament and the commissions. "Changing the Constitution is a  problem, which should be coordinated with the executive bodies  and the president. The situation with Crimea can serve as an  example. In 1990 it was granted autonomy. However, there are no  documents whatsoever that would regulate relations between  Ukraine and the autonomy. Only in two years' has a document on  the delimitation of their plenary powers been approved. Over  this time Crimea has approved so many various decisions that now  they must be brought in line with the Constitution of Crimea and  the Constitution of Ukraine. We found ourselves in a difficult  situation, failing to adopt in 1990 the documents on mutual  relations between Ukraine and its autonomous part. If now,  before the election of the president, we again have no documents  determining relations between the center and the territories,  the president and the executive structures, we will again find  ourselves in a difficult situation. It is necessary to  introduce amendments and additions to the Constitution  immediately, and not to hold elections for the sake of  elections. As far as the plenary powers of the president are  concerned, the executive power should be in one pair of hands:  If it is in the hands of the president, no premier is needed,  then this is a presidential state and this will lead to changes  in the Constitution and laws. If the plenary powers are vested  in the Cabinet of Ministers, it is necessary to determine its  status and the status of the president. There is no perpetual  scheme in this situation and one should proceed from historic  peculiarities.    Replying to a question from a UNIAN correspondent on his  attitude to the stance taken by Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, Ukraine's  acting prime minister, toward the Ukrainian Interbank Currency  Exchange, and on whether the ban on circulation of freely  convertible currency in Ukraine's monetary market would lead to  collapse, Leonid Kravchuk, noted: "This issue should be studied.  Only one currency is in circulation in other countries of the  world and there is no collapse. As regards misgivings  concerning a lack of cash, calculations will be made with  Ukraine's National Bank. In the world, "when a state is a  state," it has one currency, and it has banks and bureaux de  change, which can convert any currency "at a fair exchange rate"  into the national one. When five or six currencies are in  circulation in the country, you will not bring order to the  currency system. One should not approach the issue of the  Ukrainian Interbank Currency Exchange in a simplistic way; one  should take account of the current situation, all of the "pros"  and "cons." I am convinced that if we introduce the hryvna in  accordance with all the rules, all market and financial  structures will be made to correspond to it, including the  Ukrainian Interbank Currency Exchange.    To a question about what to do to make Ukrainian goods  appear  in the shops, which have become known in the world market,  Leonid Kravchuk noted in particular: "There are two problems:  to earn money and to pay people for labor in accordance with the  existing norms. The problem is not a lack of money, but the  lack of a mechanism to restrain the money earned. There are  people who receive unearned money and who buy products such as  foreign-made cars, but those who work cannot receive money. We  cannot increase pensions and wages on the basis of goods  produced. We should enliven production, make profits and then  increase social payments."</p>

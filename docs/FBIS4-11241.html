			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano; from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Doctor Gustavo Roosen has assumed the task of  revitalizing the Venezuelan banking system, after being sworn in  today at Miraflores Palace as presidential commissioner for the  reform of the financial system.    Roosen will exercise the office simultaneously with his  current position as chairman of the Board of Trustees of Banco  Latino. In a lengthy news conference held after being sworn in,  Roosen presented his six-point plan to rescue the national  banking system: reaching a solidarity accord with private banks,  strengthening the Superintendency of Banks, reorganizing Fogade  [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund], reducing  nominal interest rates and the differential between nominal and  real interest rates, defining new financial instruments to  replace the zero-coupon bonds, and establishing a plan of  rehabilitation or major surgery for banks assisted by Fogade.    [Begin Roosen recording] If we are able to strike a pact of  solidarity regarding what I mentioned in my initial explanation,  the country will see a change and will see a restoration in  confidence, which was key in the case of Banco Latino.    I am convinced by the conversations I held yesterday morning  and last night, which prompted me to accept this difficult task,  that the government is ready, the Central Bank is ready, and, as  a result of my contacts with fellow bankers as chairman of the  Board of Trustees, I am convinced the banks are also ready for  this solidarity pact. This is key to eliminating the uncertainty  that affects the financial system at this time. [end recording]    Dr. Gustavo Roosen said that meetings with the private banks  will begin this weekend in an attempt to sign the solidarity  accord. A 72-hour deadline was set for its signing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 (YONHAP) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin will pay an official visit to South Korea in the second  quarter of this year, according to a Foreign Ministry spokesman.    In a meeting with South Korean correspondents here,  Spokesman  Chen Guosang said Monday that "the Chinese leader will  definitely visit South Korea."    "A foreign visit by the top Chinese leader is customarily  decided upon in relatively short time before the actual visit  takes place," Chen said. "President Jiang's visit to South Korea  is just a matter of time."    The spokesman thus did not rule out the possibility that  Jiang's Seoul visit could be realized earlier than generally  expected.    President Kim Yong-sam extended an invitation to Jiang to  visit South Korea during their march summit meeting in Beijing,  which the Chinese president accepted.</p>

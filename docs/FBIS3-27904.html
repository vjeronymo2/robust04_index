When Japan annexed Korea in 1910 and ruled the country until  1945, Korean independence fighters set up a government-in-exile  in Shanghai, China. They later moved it to Chongqing along with  the Chinese nationalist party, when the Japanese invaded China.    "Seoul and Beijing agreed to restore the building of the  Korean provisional government in Chongqing last December and the  restoration work will begin in the first half of this year and  will be completed by Aug. 15 next year," the official said.    Aug. 15 is the day when Korea gained independence from Japan  in 1945 at the end of the World War II.    "The area near the site of the Korean provisional government  in Chongqing is to be demolished for land development, but Seoul  and Beijing have agreed to restore the building of the Korean  provisional government. Seoul will invest 1.3 million U.S.  dollars for it and Beijing will chip in 2 million dollars," he  said.    The premises will include two four-story structures and two  two-story buildings with an aggregate floor space of 1,712  square meters.</p>

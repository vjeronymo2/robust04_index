			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> HUD REFORM BILL PASSED BY HOUSE  </P> <P> A bill aimed at reforming the Department of Housing and Urban Development was  passed by the House on a voice vote and sent to the Senate. The bill requires  that consultants and lobbyists register with HUD, disclose whom they work for  and report their fees. Grant recipients would have to report any use of  lobbyists or consultants. The measure creates financial watchdogs for the  department and the Federal Housing Administration, revises the FHA mortgage  program and prohibits loans for second homes. It curbs the program of subsidies  for renovating low-income housing that is at the heart of the current probe of  influence peddling. Earlier, a panel had stripped from the bill a provision for  a major overhaul of federal housing programs.  </P></p>

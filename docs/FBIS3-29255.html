Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for  Asian and Pacific affairs, and Ho Chong, deputy chief of the  North Korean mission to the United Nations, met at UN  headquarters in New York Tuesday shortly after North Korea's  acceptance of inspections was announced. Their discussion  focused mainly on possible suspension of "Team Spirit," the  annual South Korea-U.S. joint military exercise, and holding the  third round of high-level talks, but details of their talks were  not immediately known.    Diplomatic sources here said that North Korea notified the  United States of its willingness to cooperate in allowing access  to an IAEA inspection team, and that Pyongyang urged Washington  to suspend Team Spirit and push ahead with the third round of  high-level talks.    Washington clarified that it would suspend this year's Team  Spirit and hold further talks with Pyongyang on condition that  inter-Korean dialogue on exchanging special envoys be resumed,  according to the sources.    Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said  at a regular briefing on Tuesday that the third round of  high-level talks between the United States and North Korea would  be held if satisfactory IAEA inspections were completed and if  inter-Korean dialogue on denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula was resumed at an early date. He added that it is  impossible to say exactly what caused North Korea to change its  stance on nuclear inspections.</p>

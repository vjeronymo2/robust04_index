			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Russian boost for aluminium - Market Report A Russian official's assurance that his country could meet its target of 300,000 tonnes of annual output cuts by end-April rallied the ALUMINIUM market yesterday and that helped to cushion falls in other base metals.

Three-months COPPER rallied from a low of Dollars 1,829 a tonne to close at Dollars 1,844.50, down Dollars 6.

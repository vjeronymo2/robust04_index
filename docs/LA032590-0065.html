			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DON'T LET RAIN DAMPEN SPIRITS  </P> <P> Juneau, Alaska's capital and gateway to the southeast wilderness areas, has a  temperate climate during the summer months.  </P> <P> I prefer August, the end of the dry season, because of its mild, warm days and  cool nights. There's still the summer lushness, but with a hint of coming  autumn. Be prepared for rain. It's part of the southeast experience and not  unpleasant.  </P> <P> Juneau offers various accommodations, including an excellent hostel -- the  Juneau International Hostel, 614 Harris St., Juneau, Alaska 99801, (907)  586-9559. It's $7 a night for members of American Youth Hostels, $10 for  nonmembers. Reservations are accepted.  </P> <P> There are two bed and breakfast inns: Mullins House, 526 Seward, Juneau 99801,  (907) 586-3384, and Frances House (same address and phone). Rooms are $50 to  $60 per night, double.  </P> <P> The Alaskan Hotel, a registered landmark, offers accommodations with a Gold  Rush flair -- 167 S. Franklin St., Juneau 99801, (907) 586-1000. Rooms $45 to  $50 double.  </P> <P> The Baranof Hotel, 127 N. Franklin St., Juneau 99801, (800) 544-0970, $89  double, and Westmark, 51 W. Egan Drive, Juneau 99801, (800) 478-1111. Rooms  $96, double. Accommodations more deluxe than others.  </P> <P> Another good choice is the Driftwood Lodge, 435 Willoughby Ave., Juneau 99801,  (800) 544-2239, which charges $62 double.  </P> <P> This summer, regularly scheduled service to Tracy Arm and Ford's Terror will be  offered twice weekly through Alaska Naturalist &amp; Photography Cruise Tours,  9951 Spruce Wood Park, Juneau 99801, (907) 789-7429. Round-trip cost is about  $90.  </P> <P> Wilderness Swift Charters, P.O. Box 022026, Juneau 99802, will transport and  pick up Tracy Arm kayakers. Cost for a vessel is $1.50 per mile. In addition,  virtually any charter vessel big enough would be willing to charter to that  area.  </P> <P> Juneau Sportfishing, P.O. Box 20438-JT, Juneau 99802, (907) 586-1887, will set  people up with charter vessels, most of which are big enough to accommodate  hard-shell kayaks.  </P> <P> Kayak and equipment rentals are available through Alaska Discovery, 369 S.  Franklin St., Juneau 99801, (907) 463-5500.  </P> <P> Double kayaks rent for $40 a day. Guided trips also are available. Alaska  Discovery is a good source to consult before planning any kayak adventure.

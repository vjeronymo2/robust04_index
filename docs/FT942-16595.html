			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Minister stresses transport shift Any fresh impetus to encourage private-sector investment in Britain's transport infrastructure will have to come from companies and banks rather than government, Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister, said yesterday. He said proposals would be considered on a project-by-project basis rather than by reference to a rigid set of rules. The approach would be deal-driven to allow flexibility, particularly in the early stages of negotiation and development. Mr Freeman's comments, made at a conference on Merseyside, may disappoint construction companies and other potential private investors in infrastructure projects which had been looking for a stronger lead from ministers. The government had encouraged joint financing of projects with companies by starting its private-sector initiative, he told the conference. Companies were 'understandably worried' about investing time, effort and money in uncertain or ill-defined projects because of 'legislative, planning and public-policy risks' in the early stages, said Mr Freeman, but he remained convinced these problems could be solved. To compensate for these risks the government had agreed to make contributions to the costs of preparing a bid. In the case of the Channel tunnel rail link this had worked out at Pounds 1.5m per competing consortium. Mr Freeman added that government might agree to dispense with competition for some projects, provided the private sector produced something innovative. No two projects were the same: the right solution for the west coast main railway line might not apply to a new Scottish air traffic control centre or a new road bridge over the Thames, he said.</p>

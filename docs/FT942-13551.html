			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / South African Elections: Viljoen woos Afrikaners - Freedom Front 'Compared to his right-wing cronies, he's practically Vaclav Havel,' writes the Johannesburg Weekly Mail's caustic columnist, Charlotte Bauer. That is the strength of the man who leads the right-wing Freedom Front, retired army General Constand Viljoen: amid the buffoons and dangerous lunatics who people the land of the far right, Gen Viljoen rises above as a man of integrity and disarming honesty. Also like the Czech president, he is no politician. That has probably hampered his election campaign, launched not quite as tardily as Inkatha's, but late enough to constitute a handicap. (The Freedom Front broke away from its predecessor, the Afrikaner Volksfront, only six weeks ago; it was formed to contest the election). The Freedom Front's message is simple: jaw-jaw and not war-war will win a volkstaat (homeland) for those Afrikaners who fear life in the new South Africa. It is a sober message and not the stuff to pump up the macho pride of the typical right-wing Afrikaner. And the dry Gen Viljoen - scarcely inspires a passionate devotion to peace. Passion is the province of neo-Nazi leader Eugene Terre'blanche, leader of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB). But he is widely despised in right-wing circles. Gen Viljoen reckons he needs a 40 per cent vote from the 1.8m Afrikaners (720,000 votes) to persuade the next government to give the Afrikaner a volkstaat. As some 800,000 people voted 'no' in the 1992 referendum on ending apartheid, there seems a fair chance of this. However, the ultra-right Conservative party, which organised the 'no' referendum vote, is boycotting the poll and this will hamper Gen Viljoen's campaign.</p>

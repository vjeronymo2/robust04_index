			<p>BFN     [Text] Talloires, France, May 26 (AFP) -- Negotiators for  Bosnia-Herzegovina's three warring parties and an international  contact group resumed closed-door talks here Thursday [26 May]  to try to establish a ceasefire and work out the country's  division.    There have been no official comments on progress, but a  member of the Croat press contingent who said he had access to  the meeting reported that the Croats and Moslems, who have  agreed to form a federation, had dropped demands for more  territory.    He said they had agreed to negotiate on the basis of a  European Union plan backed by the contact group, which is made  up of ther United States, Russia, five West European countries  and representatives of the United Nations.    This plan would allot 51 percent of Bosnian territory to the  Moslems and Croats and 49 percent to the Serbs.    The Moslems and Croats now control 30 percent of the  republic's territory and were demanding 58 percent -- about as  much as they held before the two-year-old war. Bosnian Serbs  control the remaining 70 percent of the territory.    The talks started Wednesday in this tourist town near Lake  Annecy in the French Alps, just over the border from Geneva.    Delegates include Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic,  Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic, the head of the Bosnian Croat  community, Kresimir Zubak, and for the Serbs, the head of their  self-proclaimed parliament, Momcilo Krajisnik.    The contact group is pushing for an immediate four-month  ceasefire as a test of the commitment of the belligerents to  reach a settlement.    Both France and Britain have warned they are ready to pull  all their peacekeeping troops out of Bosnia by the end of the  year if no serious progress is made towards restoring peace.    The meeting was to wind up Thursday then mostly likely  resume  in about 10 days at a location not yet announced to prepare a  conference of foreign ministers around mid-June as a follow-up  to one in Geneva on May 13.</p>

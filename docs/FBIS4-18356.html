			<p>BFN     [Text] Threats by Islamists against the Istanbul  Patriarchate have caused a chain reaction. The government has  talked about an attempt to create artificial tension and the  official opposition leader today called for lodging a demarche  with Turkey. Our correspondent Roula Kambouryianni has the  following report:    [Begin recording] [Kambouryianni] Official opposition leader  Miltiadhis Evert today said: Any new aggressive action against  the patriarchate must be considered by Greece as casus belli,  that is a cause for war. Mr. Evert called upon the government  to lodge a demarche and seek action by the World Council of  Churches.    [Evert] On the verge of the 21st century, it is not possible  that similar actions are taking place in any part of the world,  no matter how backward it may be.    [Kambouryianni] Commenting on Evert's statement, government  spokesman Evangelos Venizelos pointed out that the patriarchate  knows very well how to conduct intrachurch relations. He added  that the Greek Government's absolute support for the  patriarchate is a given fact. Mr. Venizelos further noted that  the initiative by Archbishop Iakovos [of North and South  America] to brief U.S. President Clinton on the issue falls  within the same framework. The government spokesman then  recalled the historic presence and international status of the  patriarchate and stressed that many circles in Turkey are trying  to cultivate a climate of artificial tension between the two  countries.    Commenting on the Islamic provocations against the  patriarchate, Public Order Minister Stilianos Papathemelis  emphasized today that a firm answer is needed from our side.  The Ecumenical Patriarchate and Patriarch Vartholomeos have  become the target of the Islamist municipal authorities.  Islamist Mayor of Istanbul [name indistinct] said: I will pass  through the "gate of hatred." He meant the patriarchate gate  that has been closed since 1821 when [Patriarch] Grigorios V was  hanged there. The Istanbul mayor added that he will not allow  the revival of the Byzantine state that the patriarch allegedly  seeks. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG ADVANCES LEAVE CHILDREN OUT IN THE COLD;  </P> <P> HEALTH: FEW NEW MEDICINES ARE BEING TESTED ON YOUNGSTERS. PEDIATRICIANS WANT  DRUG MAKERS TO PROVIDE BETTER GUIDELINES.  </P> <P> Nancy Sander was elated when she read of a new allergy medicine that did not  cause drowsiness. Her 15-year-old son, Michael Gregory, suffered terribly from  hay fever-type symptoms in the spring and fall, but all of the antihistamines  his doctor recommended made him too groggy to concentrate in school.  </P> <P> Sander immediately called the pediatric group near her home in Fairfax, Va., to  request a prescription for the drug, Seldane. But the doctor on duty refused.  </P> <P> "Seldane was not approved by the (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) for  children my son's age," Sander recalls. "I was really irritated."  </P> <P> Sander's experience is typical.  </P> <P> The last 50 years have seen a virtual explosion in new drugs to combat disease  and alleviate suffering. But children have largely been excluded from these  medical advances.  </P> <P> Most new prescription drugs have never been tested on children, leaving  pediatricians with a limited FDA-approved drug arsenal. Some pediatricians are  also concerned about the possibility of civil lawsuits should they prescribe  drugs lacking FDA approval, even though the agency does not prohibit the use of  such drugs.  </P> <P> Nancy Sander, however, is not one easily put off by such technicalities.  </P> <P> She is the founder of Mothers of Asthmatics, a 5,000-member educational and  advocacy organization born of experiences with her daughter, Brooke, a severe  asthmatic since infancy. Brooke's life had been saved several times by drugs  lacking FDA approval for use in children, so Sander was not about to let such a  restriction on Seldane deny her son its potential benefits.  </P> <P> She waited until the family's regular pediatrician returned from a trip, and  she made a convincing case for at least trying the drug.  </P> <P> "Every year since, Seldane has prevented his allergies and he's just fine,"  Sander says.  </P> <P> Sander's experience ended happily, but such is not always the case.  </P> <P> The history of drug development in the 20th Century is pocked with disasters  resulting from inadequately tested drugs. Ironically, most victims of these  mistakes were children, among them the thousands of babies in Western Europe  maimed in utero when the drug Thalidomide was given to pregnant women.  </P> <P> The FDA, as we know it today -- a screening agency to which drug companies must  prove their products are safe and effective -- was born out of a tragedy in  1937 involving the early antibacterial drug sulfanilamide. Seeking to  capitalize on its popularity, one company sought to market a more easily  administered liquid form, unaware that the company chemist used as his solvent  diethylene glycol, an ingredient of antifreeze and a deadly poison.  </P> <P> The error was never picked up in the company's pre-marketing tests, which  looked only at fragrance, texture and appearance, according to Wallace F.  Janssen, the FDA's historian. One hundred and seven people died, most of them  children whose parents had been advised to administer the syrup for sore  throats.  </P> <P> There were smaller-scale catastrophes in newborn nurseries when drugs used  successfully in adults were discovered to be toxic to babies with immature  kidneys and livers.  </P> <P> "You have to understand that children are not little adults, when it comes to  calculating doses or anticipating side effects," says Dr. Edwin N. Forman,  professor of pediatrics at Brown University and director of the children's  cancer center at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence.  </P> <P> Most cancer drugs -- powerful agents with a host of potentially lethal side  effects -- are marketed for adults before they are tested on children. Forman  uses these adult drugs very cautiously, sharing observations and experiences  with counterparts at about 50 other pediatric cancer centers.  </P> <P> Known as the Pediatric Oncology Group, his is one of several such cooperative  organizations nationally that maintain a data bank that doctors can use to  guide their use of cancer drugs on children.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, this sort of monitoring system for the use of adult drugs in  children is the exception rather than the rule.  </P> <P> Many drugs that clear the FDA without scientific studies in children will  eventually be used on them in isolated, experimental situations when  conventional treatment fails.  </P> <P> The results eventually may be shared at professional meetings or through  medical journals, but the delay in delineating a drug's therapeutic value -- or  harmfulness -- in children is often counted in years, according to Dr. Ralph E.  Kauffman, director of clinical pharmacology at Children's Hospital of Michigan  in Detroit and chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on  drugs.  </P> <P> Kauffman is at the forefront of a growing movement to improve children's access  to pharmacological advances, and he has a lot of support from pediatricians  such as Forman, who has spent 30 years struggling with inadequate data from  drug manufacturers to guide use of their products in his patients.  </P> <P> "New drugs are constantly being developed because the standard therapy is  inadequate," Forman says. "But children are left out of these advances. As  pediatricians, we are always behind and always dependent on guesswork."  </P> <P> Only about 20% of new drugs are evaluated in children before they get FDA  approval. The rest usually end up described this way in the Physicians Desk  Reference -- the standard text that provides doctors with pharmaceutical  manufacturers' instructions -- "Safety and effectiveness in children have not  been established."  </P> <P> "It does not mean physicians can't use the drugs, but that they have no data to  guide their use," says Dr. Wayne R. Snodgrass, chief of clinical pharmacology  at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Like Kauffman, he is  among about a dozen specialists nationally in pediatric pharmacology.  </P> <P> Under such circumstances, doctors will adjust for a child's size and factor in  differences in infant metabolism and physiology to cut the recommended adult  dosage. They may consult by telephone with doctors more experienced in using  the drug. They may search the pediatric medical journals for an account of the  drug's performance under similar circumstances in young patients. But it is a  rough calculation at best.  </P> <P> Most of the inhaled asthma drugs, for example, are not approved for use by  young children, yet thousands of youngsters depend upon them for relief of  wheezing and coughing -- and have for more than a decade, according to Dr. Gary  Rachelefsky. The Los Angeles allergy specialist says he has been studying the  use of inhaled steroids in asthmatic children since 1974.  </P> <P> And virtually all of the drugs used to treat the life-threatening conditions of  premature babies have not been approved for use in children, Snodgrass says.  </P> <P> Why pharmaceutical companies market drugs without adequate testing in children  is the subject of a long-running debate. Several medical conferences were held  on the issue as far back as 1974, but the situation has changed little since  then.  </P> <P> Lately, though, the debate has taken on greater urgency as more children with  serious, long-term illness such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome, certain  cancers and other immune-compromising conditions confront the dearth of drugs  scientifically evaluated for pediatric use.  </P> <P> In addition, the relatively small numbers of children with chronic heart  problems, high blood pressure or other diseases more commonly seen in adults  have always had to depend on adjusted dosages of adult medications.  </P> <P> But requiring pediatric testing as a condition of approval raises a different  set of problems, FDA spokesman Mike Shaffer says.  </P> <P> First, the FDA is not authorized to require such tests, Shaffer says. Congress  would have to give the agency additional muscle, Shaffer says, to order  pediatric drug tests as a condition for marketing approval.  </P> <P> Second, long delays already characterize the progress of new drugs from test  tube to market -- a journey averaging seven to 10 years, according to Jeffrey  L. Trewhitt, spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn. The  association represents about 100 drug companies that develop most of the new  drugs in the United States and Europe.  </P> <P> Drug development does not come cheaply, either, averaging $125 million in  up-front costs for each drug that clears the FDA, Trewhitt says.  </P> <P> The agency worries that a pediatric testing requirement would further slow the  process. And since new drug development depends greatly upon a drug company's  willingness to absorb the costs, the FDA is reluctant to discourage the  industry with additional regulation.  </P> <P> "The population (of seriously ill children) is so small that it doesn't justify  a drug company's trouble and expense to seek approval in this area," says the  FDA's Shaffer.  </P> <P> For its part, the pharmaceutical industry plays down the profit factor,  justifying decisions not to test certain drugs on children on ethical and legal  grounds.  </P> <P> "From the ethical standpoint, the concern is that children can be more  vulnerable," Trewhitt says. "They raise more cancer concerns than adults  because they are still growing. There is also a concern that testing  experimental drugs in children could affect growth in a key body organ. And  legally, product liability lawsuits abound in this country."  </P> <P> But Kauffman decries such justifications as a disingenuous cop-out.  </P> <P> "You can see that when there is an economic incentive, they have done the  work," Kauffman says, pointing to drugs commonly used to treat conditions that  affect large numbers of children. In order to get FDA approval for pediatric  use, drug companies have voluntarily tested antibiotics for the ear and  respiratory infections that occur frequently in childhood as well as  over-the-counter preparations for fever and colds.  </P> <P> But for the most part, the drug companies don't voluntarily test more  specialized drugs that might be used by a smaller group of children.  </P> <P> "To me," Kauffman says, "the most unethical thing to do is to subject kids to  drugs that have not been tested in children, so that each child becomes an  individual experiment."  </P> <P> His cause is gaining momentum.  </P> <P> "The FDA isn't ignoring the problem and neither are we," Kauffman says. "The  committee on drugs (of the pediatrics academy) now has a contract with the FDA,  and we are working with them to identify information from medical journals and  other sources on drugs used in children and compile it to include in drug  labeling."  </P> <P> Also, the Institute of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health has been  sufficiently aroused to convene a conference on the subject next April.  </P> <P> "We have a long way to go," says Kauffman, "but there are some things happening  that give us hope."  </P></p>

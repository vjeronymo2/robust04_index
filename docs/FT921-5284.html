			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Italian defence chiefs told to halt criticism ITALY'S defence minister, Mr Virginio Rognoni, yesterday issued a blunt warning to senior military officers to stop challenging proposals for a radical re-organisation of the country's defences. In an open letter published in Corriere della Serra, he said the services had been fully consulted and had had ample opportunity to express their views during more than two years' discussion on a new defence strategy. 'The time for discussion is over. . . and now the matter has passed to parliament,' he said. The proposals, involving a substantial cut in the armed forces, are to meet the changed requirements of the 1990s for Italy and the Nato alliance. They have led to attacks from disgruntled high-ranking officers and the resignation of a senior general since being put to parliament on November 26. The complaints have centred on plans to break up traditional units and establish new command structures co-ordinating the three services. There are also fears over lost jobs and continued low pay. Concern has also been voiced about de-militarisation of the para-military carabinieri police and creeping unionisation of military structures. But this week General Luigi Federici, in charge of the Alpine corps, added another controversial ingredient when he complained that switching to a volunteer army would lead to 'meridonialisation', with the bulk of recruits coming from the poorer south. Roughly 80 per cent of current volunteers come from the south. His comments appear to have spurred Mr Rognoni to read the riot act. The reforms, to be examined by parliament after the April 5 elections, would cut at least 90,000 civilian and military personnel from the forces by the end of the decade. The cuts, equivalent to 23 per cent of the forces' 1990 strength, will be greatest in the army (28 per cent), followed by the air force (13 per cent) and navy (12 per cent), with a further 20 per cent among civilian employees. National service personnel will be halved. The army, with a new rapid intervention role accorded by Nato for the alliance's southern flank, will be remodelled round 15 brigades instead of the present 25. Five will contain frontline troops trained for rapid deployment, including out-of-area actions. The navy will have less of an ocean-going role, while six air force squadrons will be cut and the number of air bases reduced from 24 to 20. The overall cost of the changes is expected to add an extra L40,000bn (Pounds 18.5bn) to the defence budget over the next decade. However, this will help shift the burden of expenditure away from personnel costs and more towards materiel. Italy's inflation slowed to a three-year low of 5.4 per cent in February, down from a year-on-year 6.1 per cent the month before, Reuter reports from Milan. The figures will give a boost to government parties in the election campaign.</p>

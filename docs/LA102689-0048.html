			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: DITKA MAY BE TURNING INTO A BIG TEDDY BEAR  </P> <P> Only two weeks ago, Chicago Bear Coach Mike Ditka was almost in a rage when he  said he doubted that his team could win another game. But after three  consecutive losses, Ditka apparently has decided to change his tune with the  Rams (5-2) coming to town Sunday.  </P> <P> The Bears (4-3) are one game behind the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Central  Division, where they are seeking a sixth consecutive championship.  </P> <P> "Fellas, with three losses you can dance into the playoffs backward," Ditka  said at his weekly news conference. "You can win your division backward with  three losses. Four losses will get you into the playoffs, maybe even five.  </P> <P> "Do I think we can go undefeated the rest of the way? Yes. It's possible, but  it will be tough.  </P> <P> "These are my players; I drafted them and if they don't win, it's my fault,"  Ditka said. "I take full blame for it. When you take enough blame, then  'peeeeng,' you're gone."  </P> <P> Add Ditka: If his club could play every game against the man Ditka loves to  hate, Coach Buddy Ryan of the Philadelphia Eagles, the Bears might go  undefeated.  </P> <P> Said Ryan after having been beaten by Ditka for the fourth consecutive time  since Ryan quit as a Bear assistant in 1986: "You can't lose to anybody this  many times and stay in this business very long."  </P> <P> Said Ditka after the victory: "These guys, they come in here and they think  they can talk their way into (winning) the game. It's unbelievable, and it all  comes from the fat man (Ryan)."  </P> <P> Ditka said his only regret was not having more time to savor victories over  Ryan. "Every time it happens, I'll savor it more. It's nine times better than  beating a (former Coach Tom) Landry team."  </P> <P> Last add Ditka: The entire Tampa Bay offensive unit won the National Football  League's player-of-the-week award after the Buccaneers beat the Bears. Said  Ditka: "My football team knows what I thought about that. They won't be player  of the week next time we play."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Who was the last player-manager to appear in and win a World  Series game?  </P> <P> Moving experience: Defenseman Mark Hardy, who spent nine seasons with the  Kings, was traded by the New York Rangers to the Minnesota North Stars in June,  1988, and reacquired six months later. Helene Elliott of Newsday quotes Hardy  on why he is renting in New York rather than buying a house: "When I went to  Minnesota, I thought I'd be there a few years . . . so I went out and bought a  house. It cost me $20,000 to get traded. I don't want that to happen again."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Lou Boudreau, who played shortstop for the Cleveland Indians as  they won the 1948 Series from the Boston Braves in six games.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Phoenix Sun Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons, on the Lakers after the  retirement of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: "It's been Magic's team for a long time. As  long as Magic is breathing, you have the Lakers to beat." GARR KLUENDER  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 15 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Military  authorities rejected today charges of human rights violations  during the conflict in Chiapas State, recalling that the armed  group began the attacks, and they reiterated their commitment to  act according to the law.    "The military's actions are and shall be at all times  directed toward respecting the physical and moral integrity of  the people" of the southern Mexican State of Chiapas, the  Secretariat of National Defense announced in a communique  released on Saturday.    The charges of alleged human rights violations by the troops  "are based solely on alleged rumors and sensationalism," which  confuse the people, the communique read.    The clashes in Altos de Chiapas, where the self-styled  Zapatista National Liberation Army occupied several towns on 1  January, left 100 dead and an undetermined number of people  wounded.    Those who accuse the Army of violating human rights seem to  forget that 24 policemen were killed and 35 were wounded, as  well as more than 100 civilians reported missing at the hands of  the armed group, the National Defense Secretariat stated.    It also recalled that the armed group began the clashes when  it attacked Rancho Nuevo Headquarters, near the town of San  Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas, 1,200 km southeast of Mexico  City.    The armed group occupied and destroyed public buildings and  "used terror to subdue" the population, hid their dead, and  "very probably buried them clandestinely."    The Defense Secretariat reported that the Army turned over  the individuals arrested during the conflict to civilian  authorities and informed them of the deaths registered among the  armed group.    It mentioned that, within the imitations imposed by the  conflict, the military authorities have provided their best help  to the National Human Rights Commission, which traveled to  Chiapas State at the beginning of the clashes.    The Army's participation is fully justified, as they have  responded to the attack against the garrison, the demands for  help from the government of Chiapas State, and the reiterated  aggressions on the troops, the secretariat added.    There is a relative calm in that area of Chiapas State after  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari appointed last week former  Foreign Minister Manuel Camacho Solis commissioner for peace and  reconciliation and announced the cessation of the Army's  offensive operations.</p>

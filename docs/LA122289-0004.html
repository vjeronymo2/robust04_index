			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILINGUAL EDUCATION  </P> <P> I am sorry that Rodolfo F. Acuna is dissatisfied with the Los Angeles Unified  School District's efforts to serve its Latino students ("Schools Fail Latinos  in Any Tongue," Opinion, Dec. 10). What would he have us, the classroom  teachers, do?  </P> <P> As a Caucasian teacher whose students are nearly all Latinos, I cannot be the  Latina role model which Acuna prefers. I can be a good teacher. I love and  respect my students; I expect them to succeed and direct my efforts to  motivating them toward excellence. My colleagues do the same.  </P> <P> Acuna cites many statistics, but fails to explain why Latino youngsters often  choose not to complete their educations, and choose not to become teachers. I  reiterate: choose. After all, motivation must come not only from teachers, but  also from students. Latinos, like others, must choose to succeed.  </P> <P> ROBIN L. WINSTON  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

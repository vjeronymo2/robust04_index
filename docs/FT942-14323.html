			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Irish bank governor appointed The Irish government has stuck to tradition and appointed a career civil servant to succeed the central bank governor, Mr Maurice Doyle, who steps down at the end of this month. He is Mr Maurice O'Connell, 57, currently second secretary at the Department of Finance, responsible for its finance division. Mr Doyle announced last month that he did not intend to seek reappointment for a second seven-year term, and it had been speculated that the government might choose someone from outside the civil service. Mr O'Connell is considered a leading expert on the European monetary system and central bank legislation. He is a member of the EU Monetary Committee and a director of the European Investment Bank.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Investors focus on food and drug sectors THE NIKKEI gained marginally as investors focused on the pharmaceutical and food sectors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average edged up 5.11 to 21,338.81, up 0.2 per cent on the week. Volume fell to 180m shares from 220m as dealers retreated to the sidelines ahead of the weekend. Advances led declines by 467 to 466 with 185 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 0.84 to 1,554.49 and in London trading, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.17 to 1,185.90. Hopes that a cut in the discount rate by the Bank of Japan would encourage individuals to shift funds from bank deposits to equities helped market sentiment. Institutional investors were seen buying drug-related shares in small lots. Mochida Pharmaceutical, the most active issue of the day, rose Y400 to Y3,320. Companies involved in Aids research continued to gain, with Morinaga Milk Products up Y15 to Y710. Mr Kaoru Shimura, head of securities management at Sumitomo Life, said institutions were likely to buy actively if the market showed signs of a recovery. 'Profits on long-term holdings have already been locked in ahead of the March book-closing, but we are looking to improve returns on short-term holdings,' he said. Some high-technology issues were slack on continued earnings concerns. Hitachi fell Y10 to Y840 and Toshiba lost Y2 to Y610. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y16,000 to Y712,000 after the finance ministry said that it was postponing a public sale of the remaining stock scheduled for the current fiscal year. The issue had risen recently on hopes of a stock split. The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) announced that individual investors remained net buyers of stock for the second consecutive week. In the week ending February 21, individuals bought a net Y70.2bn, while institutional investors remained net sellers for the fourth consecutive week. The TSE also said that the average daily share volume on the first section fell to 196m shares in February, the lowest since June 1982, when the daily average fell to 172m shares. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 14.02 to 22,955.57 in volume of 48.2m shares. Roundup THE Pacific Rim was mixed ahead of the weekend, though Hong Kong recorded its third consecutive record high. HONG KONG shed early gains on profit-taking and the Hang Seng Index closed up 33.93 at 4,929.06, a 4 per cent rise on the week. Turnover was HKDollars 4.06bn against HKDollars 3.77bn. In the property sector Cheung Kong rose 30 cents to HKDollars 21.90, while Hongkong Telecom gained 20 cents to HKDollars 8.40. KUALA LUMPUR consolidated its recent rise. The composite index rose 4.40 to 605.06, but down 1.7 per cent on the week. Carlsberg put on 30 cents to MDollars 12.10 after announcing good 1991 results. SINGAPORE remained cautious ahead of the budget. The Straits Times Industrial Index closed up 5.52 at 1,477.43 in turnover of SDollars 48m, but down 2.7 per cent over the week. SEOUL fell on local reports that the government was making large companies produce consolidated financial statements. The composite index lost 9.37 to 614.99, down 2.8 per cent on the week, in turnover of Won303.8bn after Won262.9bn.

MANILA was unmoved by good 1991 results from San Miguel and the composite index fell 17.44 to 1,183.67, but still 2.2 per cent ahead on the week. Turnover was 140.2m pesos against 174.1m pesos. AUSTRALIA was pushed lower by industrial stocks. The All Ordinaries Index fell 9.0 to 1,614.2, 0.4 per cent down on the week. Turnover was ADollars 381.9m. Brambles Industries fell to a 10 month low, closing down 60 cents at ADollars 16.20, after reporting a 13 per cent decline half-year net profits.

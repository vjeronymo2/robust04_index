			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE German Bundesbank's decision to move to a variable repo rate, leading to strong speculation of further cuts in UK base rates, enlivened a dull derivatives sector and sent Footsie futures moving sharply ahead, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening level in the December contract on the FT-SE 100 index was recorded at 2,617, which proved to be the day's low as the speculation on interest rates quickly took hold sending December steadily ahead and pulling the underlying cash market higher. The early strength of Wall Street led to renewed buying interest, a factor which took many dealers by surprise, leading to a squeeze in December and sending it to the day's peak of 2,668. The general strength of the market meant that December traded at a healthy premium to cash of between 30 and 40 points throughout the session with arbitraging seen at the higher levels. December closed at 2,657, around 17 points above its estimated cost of carry of around 23. Turnover reached 9,208 lots. Traded options were also lively and turnover improved to reach 38,097 contracts of which 10,442 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. Asda was the busiest stock option, with a total of 5,003 contracts traded by the close. This was followed by HSBC at 2,438 and British Steel at 1,117.</p>

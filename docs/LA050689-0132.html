			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP SOFTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO GAINS GROUND BY BEATING IRVINE  </P> <P> Sophomore Kerin Dull pitched a three-hitter and drove in a run to lead Mission  Viejo High School to a 3-0 South Coast League softball victory over Irvine  Friday at Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> The victory brings Mission Viejo (14-8, 5-3) within a game of league-leading  Irvine (15-7-1, 6-2) with two games to play. Mission Viejo has defeated Irvine  three times this season, including a nonleague tournament game.  </P> <P> "We're now in the same must-win situation that Mission Viejo was in today,"  said Irvine Coach Phil Dunmeyer, whose team was ranked fifth in the Southern  Section 3-A. "We have to win both games next week if we are to avoid the  possibility of being tied for the title, but I feel confident because the kids  have played well when we've had to this season."  </P> <P> Dull, who came within one out of pitching a perfect game last week against Dana  Hills, didn't allow a hit until the fourth, when Dunmeyer's daughter, freshman  first baseman Cheryl, beat out an infield grounder. Dunmeyer, one of nine  underclassmen starters for Irvine (five sophomores and four freshmen), had two  hits. Sophomore pitcher Jennifer Brundage (14-7) had the other Irvine hit.  </P> <P> Brundage, who retired nine in a row after Renee Pina reached first when  Dunmeyer dropped second baseman Karissa Meith's throw in the first inning, gave  up her first hit in the fourth.  </P> <P> Amy Bond started the inning with a single to right. Bond, who will attend UC  Santa Barbara in the fall, advanced to second on catcher Lisa Goodwin's passed  ball and scored two outs later on Dull's single.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo scored twice in the sixth on two errors and an infield hit.  </P> <P> In another South Coast League game:  </P> <P> San Clemente 6, Dana Hills 1 -- Host San Clemente broke through with a six-run  sixth inning. San Clemente (10-11, 4-4) had three hits and took advantage of  four errors in the inning. Dana Hills is 2-6 in league play.  </P> <P> In the Sea View League:  </P> <P> Tustin 2, Saddleback 1 (12 innings) -- Saddleback couldn't make a play on a  chopper hit by Tustin's Melissa Mazanet and Laura Teal scored from third for  the winning run in the bottom of the 12th. Tustin and Saddleback are each 11-2  in league play. Tustin is 14-7 overall; Saddleback is 23-4.  </P> <P> University 4, Newport Harbor 2 -- Lakita Johnson hit a three-run homer in the  top of the sixth to give University a 3-2 lead.  </P> <P> In the Sunset League:  </P> <P> Fountain Valley 8, Westminster 2 -- Shannon Dolan had two hits, including a  home run, and two RBIs for Fountain Valley (17-5-1, 6-2) at Westminster. Janet  Miyhara (10-2) pitched a three-hitter, striking out 11, for the victory.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach 2, Ocean View 0 -- Shane Bradley scored one run and knocked in  the other for host Huntington Beach (13-11, 5-3). April Crosby's infield single  scored Bradley in the fourth and Dana Jahr scored on a fielder's choice by  Bradley in the sixth. Pam Fogg (9-6) pitched her seventh shutout, a  five-hitter.  </P> <P> Marina 7, Edison 0 -- Willa Parchen (14-7) pitched a three-hitter, striking out  nine, for the Vikings at Marina.  </P></p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (9): Clicking on Bogart - Multi-media MULTI-MEDIA has been a buzzword in the personal computer industry for almost five years, yet few mainstream PC applications have been produced using this innovative technology - that is, until now. There are good reasons for this - the computer hardware which provided the power and function necessary to adequately run multi-media applications (combining speech, music, graphics, animation and still pictures) was expensive and multi-media development standards not firmly fixed. But now that PCs are capable of producing digital sound - and use CD-ROMs (Compact Disc - Read Only Memory) to read data and display high- resolution colour images, animation, sound and speech - multi-media systems are starting to become lower-cost commodities. In fact, manufacturers in the US have made moves in recent weeks to make multi-media computer hardware even less expensive. Zenith Data Systems and Tandy Computer have both announced plans to produce 'multi-media players' based around Tandy's new Video Information System standard - which allows multi-media software based on Microsoft's Windows system to be played through standard US television sets. Meanwhile Apple Computer, one of the pioneers of the multi-media market, has also announced new systems in the US that also make it cheaper to use multi-media technology with its Apple Macintosh range. There are probably more multi-media applications for the Macintosh than any other type of PC, which has been capable of using CD-ROM-based software for more than four. The CD-ROM systems at the heart of most multi-media designs are based on the same technology as ordinary home CD audio players - and can actually play audio CDs as well as those containing computer information. But as CD-ROM compact discs can hold about 450 times as much information as the average computer floppy disk - and cost little to produce - they are becoming a popular add-on to PCs. Having this much space also means that far less printed material clutters up the desk. Using, for example, the multi-media edition of Microsoft's integrated Works for Windows software, no longer means scrambling around to find one of several bulky manuals - and then spending another 10 minutes wishing that there was somebody around to actually demonstrate how to solve the problem. Multi-media technology, allows users to lock up their program manuals in a vault and means they should never have to look at them again. For almost any function, the multi-media edition of products such as this have an animated sequence, a tutorial section or a narrated 'short film' that will take the user through any problems, step by step. In all, there are 42 lessons in the Microsoft Works on-line tutorial - each of which has associated overviews comprising multi-media movies and animation. It is typical of the kind of work that is being done in the multi-media sphere to make computer software easier to use. Another method being employed is to imitate real-world technology for controlling software. In most multi-media applications, for example, these are standard VCR-like controls - so that users can fast forward, rewind, pause and playback any audio or video sequences they want to see again. This is all part of showing people how to use PCs in a non-threatening way. The list of requirements to run an average multi-media application on an IBM-compatible PC is somewhat longer than the average. MS-DOS version 3.1 is needed or, later, Microsoft's CD-ROM extensions version 2.2 or later, a PC with a 16Mhz 386SX processor (although some sound and animation sequences will run on the kinds of less powerful 10Mhz 80286-based multi-media machines sold by some manufacturers) and Version 3.1 of Microsoft Windows (although most are still able to operate using Windows 3.0 with Multi-media Extensions version 1). In addition to all this, 2Mb or memory of system memory is needed (4Mb is recommended), at least 30Mb of hard disk space, a CD-ROM with an access time of less than one second and a 150K per second data transfer rate. Needless to say, a VGA display adaptor is a requirement - as is an audio board with speakers or headphones. But once equipped with all this, the list of possible multi-media applications seems endless. It already includes animated 'talking books' for children, encyclopedias, dictionaries, an atlas (which not only shows maps and flags of the world, but also plays the anthems of most countries), 'biographies' of famous people with on- screen examples of their work and super-realistic computer games. Microsoft chairman Mr Bill Gates offers an interesting insight into the future of this technology. At a recent briefing to US financial analysts', he talked about a multi-media product he hopes will help move Microsoft to the centre stage of the consumer electronics market. It is a CD-based film guide for cinema buffs. Entitled 'Cinemania', it is a guide to anything and everything you might want to know about movies. It includes a powerful database 'search engine' with text information on more than 19,000 films - as well as lots of digitised pictures and sound clips from films. If, for example, someone wanted to know all the films that Humphrey Bogart starred in during the Second World War that won an Academy award, he or she would just enter that criteria on a form-screen that looks like a VCR remote controller. Cinemania then comes back with the answer 'Casablanca' and offers the user a huge variety of other information. It is possible to see a review of the film, an article about the making of it and obtain information on any of the leading actors, the director or the studio which produced it. By clicking on Bogart's name, for example, the user is offered a complete biography of him, featuring pictures, sound samples of him taken from various films and lists of all the films he has ever starred in. And that, as the man says, could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.</p>

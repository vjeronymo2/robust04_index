			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Ding-dong battle to be boss: Quality of life dominates the contest to be New York's mayor It is a misty autumnal morning on Manhattan's Upper West Side and jut-jawed Mr Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City, is out chasing the important Hispanic vote - and trying to make himself look a little less unlovable. Mr Giuliani, who is battling a reputation as a cold, impatient, short-tempered man, looks out stiffly across a hall of elderly, mainly female Latinos - a sea of permed grey hair, glinting spectacles and brightly coloured clothes - and tries to create a rapport. His speaking style is flat, his manner uncharismatic, and he fails to amuse the audience with a heavy-handed joke about his 84-year-old mother, who lives in the same apartment building as him. 'If I let you down, she's going to drive me crazy,' he says. But the pensioners suddenly break into enthusiastic applause when he promises to rid the city's projects (council estates) of their warring armies of gun-toting drug dealers. 'We owe you a safer city,' he declares. The audience warms like a bowl of chilli salsa. The incident highlights the choice facing New Yorkers in the November 2 election. On the one side there is Mr David Dinkins, the 66-year-old black Democratic incumbent, whose four years in office have left him with an extremely mixed record and a reputation for enjoyment of the formal trappings of office. In spite of this, Mr Dinkins comes across as a humane man and a bridge-builder, who has often managed to defuse racial tensions - no small matter in the world's most ethnically diverse city, where any utterance is prone to be construed as an insult to someone's colour or character. On the other is the Italian-American Mr Giuliani, 49, who became one of the best known lawmen in the US when, as US attorney in Manhattan in the 1980s, he staged a series of high-profile prosecutions of corrupt politicians, Mafia bosses and crooked financiers. It was he who caused a sensation on Wall Street by carting three securities traders away from their desks in handcuffs. He is certainly a man of immense zeal and self-belief, who might energise City Hall, but many New Yorkers question whether he has the temperament to build the complex coalitions needed to govern the metropolis, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly five to one. It therefore says a lot about the restless, demoralised mood of the New York electorate that Mr Giuliani, who lost by just 2 per cent of the vote when he first fought Mr Dinkins in 1989, is once again running neck and neck with the mayor in opinion polls that may significantly understate the challenger's strength. If he wins, he will be New York's first Republican mayor since the good-looking, aristocratic Mr John Lindsay, who ran City Hall from 1966 to 1973. He will also strike a serious blow to the national Democratic party, which is still smarting from the election in Los Angeles last spring of the riot-torn city's first Republican mayor in 36 years. The loss of New York would reinforce the theory that the Democrats' hold on big city politics may be weakening. The electorate, goes the argument, is disillusioned with policies that have failed to solve the severe problems of the inner cities, particularly the growth of an alienated, ill-educated black underclass - predominantly from single-parent, welfare-dependent homes - armed to the teeth with guns and willing to kill at the slightest provocation. Mr Bret Schundler, a 34-year-old Republican who catapulted from nowhere to be mayor of normally Democratic Jersey City, New Jersey, argues: 'You're seeing the unravelling of Democratic party dominance in the major cities. Big city machines are breaking down because the problems are so serious.' New York shares many of these problems. It has a high crime rate, is one of the leading drug-dealing centres of North America, and its constant struggle to balance its budget has left it with a rotting infrastructure. The crisis is epitomised by its schools, where metal detectors routinely check children for guns. They opened weeks late for the autumn term because of asbestos risks from crumbling walls and ceilings. Yet New York is also distinctly different from other American cities, a fact that both exacerbates its current financial problems but also offers long-term strengths. Its uniquely cosmopolitan nature, coupled with its almost European health and social welfare programmes, means it has more than a normal quotient of Aids victims, the indigent and the deranged. Their ubiquitous presence on the streets of Manhattan contributes mightily, along with crime, to the voters' sense that the quality of their life is deteriorating. So too does a four-year recession, just ending, which has wiped out nearly 400,000 city jobs. Yet this same cosmopolitan nature maintains the city as the world's premier financial centre and is constantly replenishing it with new, energetic waves of immigrants - the latest coming from China and eastern Europe. Both these forces - a sense that life is getting worse and the new immigrants - play to Mr Giuliani's strengths. Mr Mitchell Moss, who heads the Urban Research Centre at New York University, points out that many of the new, entrepreneurial Asian and Latino arrivals have no ties to the Democratic party machine and feel that Mr Giuliani's platform - which emphasises self-help and reform of New York's taxes and bureaucracy - is in line with their own values. However, the main focus of Mr Giuliani's campaign is his promise - wearing the prosecutor's mantle - to crack down harder than Mr Dinkins on crime, drugs and vagrants. The mayor replies - and the figures support him - that crime has actually fallen in New York on his watch, thanks to his large and costly expansion of the police force. But what matters in elections is not statistics, but perceived crises - and politicians' ability to present themselves as the solution to them. Here, Mr Dinkins has something of a credibility problem, not least because of his handling of two serious racial incidents during his term. First, he refused to take sides when blacks boycotted two Korean-run grocery stores. More seriously, an official report published last summer blamed him for failing to act decisively enough to prevent disturbances in the Crown Heights area of Brooklyn which escalated into four days of violent confrontation between blacks and Jews in 1991 - the city's worst racial unrest in over 20 years. At the very least this smacks of indecision, though critics also accuse Mr Dinkins of pandering to black interests at the expense of other racial groups. And this matters greatly in a city where the key to electoral success is patching together a coalition of diverse ethnic and interest groups. Mr Giuliani, who refers to Crown Heights as a 'pogrom', has gained ground among two important sets of voters: Jews and the Hispanic community, many of whose Catholic members have been offended by the mayor's bold support of homosexuals and the distribution of condoms in schools. In a city as volatile as New York, much could happen in the next 10 days to change the electoral climate. But, provided he keeps his personality in check, Mr Giuliani could become the latest in a line of outsider politicians, stretching back 100 years, who have temporarily wrested power from the Democratic machine by exploiting the feeling that the city is going to the dogs. On that score, the worried Hispanic grandmothers of the Upper West Side seem to have absolutely no doubts.</p>

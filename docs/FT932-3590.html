			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Jailed westerners in Baghdad Foreigners visiting westerners detained by Iraq confirm that a Briton and a German sentenced to eight years in prison for illegal entry are now in a Baghdad jail, diplomats said yesterday Reuter reports from Baghdad. They said the Briton, Simon Dunn, 23, and the German, Kai Sondermann, were in Abu Ghraib prison on the western outskirts of Baghdad where other foreigners charged with similar offences are serving their sentences. The two men were arrested at gun-point on May 28 and had been sentenced to eight years in jail on June 6 for illegal entry, a Foreign Office spokeswoman has said. Their imprisonment brings to six the number of Kuwait-based expatriates jailed by Iraq this year for illegal entry.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Recovery continues at Bayer with 30% gain The recovery at Bayer, the large German chemicals group, continued with a 30 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings and a 24 per cent advance for the half-year. The group, which started the year predicting a profits advance of up to 20 per cent for the full 12 months, yesterday reported pre-tax income for the first half of DM999m (Dollars 624m) on sales up 6 per cent at DM22bn. Rival Hoechst, which published its interim figures earlier this week, said pre-tax earnings had risen 39 per cent to DM1bn on barely-changed sales. Profits at BASF rose 41 per cent in the half. Bayer, like its competitors, yesterday indicated falling prices were still a problem. Turnover at Bayer AG, the German parent, was unchanged because a 4 per cent drop in prices cancelled out 7 per cent volume growth. The sales figure was also diluted by the transfer of the fibres business into another part of the group. Turnover at European subsidiaries edged upwards to DM13bn, while North America recorded a 9 per cent sales rise. The Asia-Pacific and African regions advanced 19 per cent. All operational sectors contributed to the recovery, with chemicals growing particularly strongly. Healthcare improved 8 per cent, while growth in consumer products sales, mainly in the Agfa film and tape business, was limited to 2 per cent. Bayer blamed poor domestic demand. The group attributed part of the profits progress to higher capacity use and cost-saving measures of the past few years. As with the other German chemicals concerns, Bayer has continued pruning costs, especially in its domestic operations. The total workforce fell 2,600 in the review period and the rise in personnel costs was limited to 2 per cent in spite of higher social security costs and adverse exchange rate movements.</p>

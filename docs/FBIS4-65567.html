			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Federico Orlando: "Oscars Night"] </F>   [Text] What is President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro playing at?  Shamelessly flouting the rules of the new television democracy,  he granted not a single smile, not the shadow of a smile, to the  television cameras that focused on him as he listened 26 times  to the litany of Berlusconi and his ministers pledging to him  their allegiance to the Republic, the Constitution, the laws,  and so on, and so on.    Why was Scalfaro not smiling, while the prime minister  openly  (and justifiably) displayed his joy and even [Interior Minister]  Maroni, in his casual gray suit contrasting with the prevailing  blue, looked less than usual like some character from one of  Ossian's funeral poems. We think we know why: On Republic  Night, the president felt his shoulders burdened by a second  responsibility together with that of guarantor assigned to him  by the Constitution -- an unexpected responsibility as leader of  the opposition.    This is no paradox. Since election day there has been no  opposition in Italy. There is no opposition from the Left,  which is lying like some huge, brain-dead organism; and there is  no opposition from the Center which, despite the million votes  gained, is represented in parliament by a tiny minority  undermined by many opportunists prepared to go over to the  winning side.    In fact, to be honest, this is not the first time that the  opposition has disappeared in Italy. During the years of the  historical compromise, which was previously called assemblyism  (because it substituted the parliamentary assembly for the  government in the role of the country's political leader) and  subsequently called associationism (that is, criminal  association between majority and opposition in order to avert  problems), Italy relinquished both the function of government,  which was delegated to the assembly, and the function of  opposition, which was eliminated by criminal agreement. Now  credit is due to the Right led by Berlusconi at least for its  loudly proclaimed determination to regain the function of  government.    But the opposition remains invisible, like some mythical  creature. The Left cannot make up its mind to throw out the  rubbish of the ideologies inherited from the 19th century and to  create the great Democratic Party -- liberal and Rooseveltian.  The Center cannot make up its mind to become intensely liberal,  that is, equidistant from the radicalism of the Left and from  the Reaganism of the Right, thus facilitating liberal gains and  at the same time opposing illiberal regressions.    In this coma being suffered by the opposition, which is as  profound as the new majority is coarse and unsubtle, there is  only one force on which democracy can depend to ensure that its  two supporting columns, government and opposition, remain  standing as best they can: Scalfaro. Berlusconi in government  and Scalfaro in opposition. This will be the Italian people's  democratic guarantee. We know that the Italian people do not  like Scalfaro much. Those of his own generation do not like him  because of his youthful Catholic intransigence, and the younger  generations do not like him because of his ecstatic manner of  talking, with his eyes raised to the heavens, using lofty words,  spelling out the most obvious concepts in the most leaden manner.    And yet this man is the repository of the trust of those  Italian democrats (by the way, how many democrats are there in  Italy?) who refuse to see guarantees and rules left like the  beaches on a Sunday after the encampment by the hordes, with  their baggage of lasagne, eggplant pie, toilet paper, and other  goods. We must hope that the chief of state and leader of the  opposition, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, will be granted the most  complete success, namely, the government's democratic  irreproachableness.</p>

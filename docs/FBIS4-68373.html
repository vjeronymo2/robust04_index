			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Leonid Polezhayev, governor of Omsk Oblast </F> and member of the Federation Council, by unidentified  correspondent; place and date not given: "There Will Be No  Shocks in Siberia"]    [Text] [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] The aphorism is that revolutions  take place in capitals, civil wars--in provinces. How great is  social tension now in Omsk and Siberia in general?    [Polezhayev] Even in the major regions of Siberia it has a  spotty character. The sociopolitical background in Omsk is even.  It is based on definite stability and a somewhat more  advantageous economic situation. But how it is possible to do  this is a special conversation.    Here is an example for you. Harvest campaigns always take  place with difficulty in Siberia: There is snow and rain, and  gathering grain from two hectares is like taking Berlin.  Naturally I have opponents, and there is an opposition, which is  especially well organized and united in the agrarian milieu.  They are all awaiting the kind of autumn when Polezhayev finally  fails. So, I calculated what forces were activated in gathering  the harvest in bumper-crop years (in the 1970's, etc.). In one  and the same land areas--2 million hectares of arable land--in  the years 1970-1985, 15-16,000 combines and 30,000 motor  vehicles took part in the harvest and 45,000 persons were drawn  in from city enterprises. Last year and year before, the biggest  harvests in the last 30 years were gathered in Omsk Oblast.  However, we managed to get by in the harvest with 7,000 combines  instead of 16,000, 3,500 motor vehicles instead of 30,000, and  we did not bring in one person from city enterprises. At the  same time, all the grain was harvested. What is the reason for  this? The kolkhozes and sovkhozes are now joint-stock  enterprises. Every stockholder has a share--several hectares of  personal land, depending on the area the joint-stock company  owns. In previous years a combine operator worked for wages. He  was a fifth category broad specialty machine operator. He could  earn a maximum of 500 rubles [R] per month in a harvest. Today  he does not work for wages. We did not operate a bureau, there  were no heart attacks, we did not expel anyone from a party, and  we did not employ the Ipatovo method. But the peasant worked on  his own field. He knew that he was gathering grain that would  feed him.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Leonid Konstantinovich, you are one of  the founders and leaders of the Siberian agreement. Just what is  it? Will it not lead to the creation of some kind of Siberian  republic? Will it not transform Russia, as the opposition  threatens, not just into 20 principalities, as there were in the  16th century, but into 89 uncoordinated components of the  Federation with an eroded central authority?    [Polezhayev] In my view the managers in the regions, after  all, are specialists in public law. None of them are infringing  upon the integrity of the state, nor on the priority of state  authority. When reform began, and when the Union collapsed, the  leaders of the Siberian regions, perhaps quicker than all the  others, became concerned about what would happen.    Let us analyze just what Siberia is for Russia? Is it simply  a geographic concept? Or a material-technical and raw material  base? Or is it an arms shop? How is Russia balanced internally  today in a geopolitical and economic sense with the loss of  Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltics? Very likely, it is now  necessary to look at Siberia precisely from this standpoint.  Siberia itself does not need the kind of economy that has  developed there. Believe me, it is nothing for me to produce 800  tanks per year. There are enough raw materials for 18 million  persons in Siberia to live independently: forests, oil, gas, etc.    When we begin to collate our budgets and our transfers to  the  federal budget, and compare them with the budgets of other  regions, we find an obvious imbalance to the benefit of the  center.    I once again return to the principle, which I did not  conceive, that we cannot have patchwork reform. It also cannot  be uniform for the whole country. In Siberia, for example, there  are branches that are not even subject to conversion. For  example, how can you convert an enterprise that was oriented on  the production of explosive substances or the atom bomb? They  simply have to be shut down.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] When Gaydar started his reforms, he  proceeded from the fact that there is no socialist economy and  there is no capitalist economy, that an economy develops  according to laws that are common to all. Just as there is no  socialist or capitalist physics or chemistry. Therefore, the  center cannot help but work on common problems, for example, on  the well-known liberalization of prices. But the regions have to  work on their own problems.    [Polezhayev] Thus it is necessary to give them the  opportunity to work on these problems. This is the first thing.  Second, even keeping in mind that the economy has common laws,  it cannot fail to take into account the peculiarities of that  territory on which these laws operate. It must take into account  the national features of the individual, his mentality and  psychology, and, separately, the psychology of work to which he  has become accustomed over the course of many years. Many of our  failures result from the fact that economists, who allegedly  project everything correctly, do not take these very important  elements and qualities into account.    I think it is necessary to have more trust in the local  authoritative structures and regional associations. Yes, we  should have a unified transport and unified energy system, and a  unified foreign policy and defense. But it is not necessary to  teach me how to live with bordering Kazakhstan. I know this  better than the Muscovites. Let us determine the specific sum  that we must give in the form of a federal tax for the  maintenance of the state structures and support of the state.  But now, Omsk gives 82 percent of its taxes to the federal  budget!    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] That is, you think that the tax system  is  imperfect?    [Polezhayev] Of course. Let even a small part remain in the  regions, but a reasonable one. This is necessary for  reproduction, the creation of jobs, and support of the social  and production infrastructure.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Yavlinskiy is working on reform for  Nemtsov in Nizhniy Novgorod, and someone has invited consultants  from America. Is there anyone in the Siberian agreement with  such a brilliant mind from Moscow, from the United States, or  from South Korea?    [Polezhayev] The development of regional economic policy and  regionalization of reforms here in Siberia is a job that was  handled by V.V. Malykhin. Unfortunately, he died recently. He  was a great economist.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] If Boris Nikolayevich offers you a good  post in Moscow, will you go?    [Polezhayev] I have had more than one offer. And if I have  to  say "yes" or "no" today, I will say "no."    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] That is, you feel that you have real  powers and real authority in Omsk?    [Polezhayev] Yes. But I could not work in isolation. I am  not  a charismatic figure, but simply a good business manager.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Is there a probability that the  Federation Council will clash with the executive authority?    [Polezhayev] I see no drama in this. Everyone should  function  within the scope of his authorities. But he should also be  confrontational on some questions.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] But not to the degree that occurred in  October of last year?    [Polezhayev] No. This is ruled out. There simply are  different people there. First, a majority of the members of the  Federation Council are people who know what ruling is, and what  responsibility is. The managers of the executive structures are  not secretaries of oblast party committees. I, for example, am  not a manager who can be manipulated. The Council will intervene  and compel the government to make adjustments to program  actions. But this is natural.    I will cite an example. I am a professional hydraulic  engineer. Years pass while you are building a large  hydroengineering complex, and there is an accumulation of water.  When the sluice gates are opened in order to let the water into  a new stream sector, a rapid current rushes in. Everything  foams, whirls, gathers up old rubbish, and together with the  foam, moves to the surface. But then everything quiets down, and  the foam is cast upon the banks. A calm and clean channel  remains in the center.    This resembles our political life. I think that the process  of forming the channel has already started. It will become  calmer and more sensible. But somewhere there is still erosion,  somewhere there are cave-ins, somewhere there are breakdowns.  And this is understandable.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> MURDER CHARGES LIKELY IN SHOOTING  </P> <P> Prosecutors are expected to file murder and assault charges today against two  men arrested in the drive-by shooting death of a 12-year-old Santa Ana boy who  happened on the scene of a drug deal gone awry, police said Thursday.  </P> <P> Police Lt. Robert Helton said investigators recovered a .45-caliber handgun  when they took Thomas Trung Nguyen 22, of Santa Ana and Minh Chi Nguyen, 19, of  San Bernardino into custody. Both suspects are being held in Orange County  Jail.  </P> <P> Pedro Sanchez Hernandez was fatally wounded late Tuesday as he and his  16-year-old brother Gus walked to the corner of Wood and Myrtle streets in  Santa Ana.  </P> <P> A short time earlier, two men in a white Nissan truck had allegedly attempted  to buy drugs from someone on the corner. A dispute erupted and police and  witnesses say several youths in the neighborhood hurled bottles at the truck.  The truck sped off, but returned moments later.  </P> <P> Witnesses said four shots were fired from the vehicle, one striking Hernandez  in the head and another hitting a 17-year-old bystander in the leg.  </P> <P> About two hours later, Westminster police stopped a truck matching the  vehicle's description and took two teen-agers into custody. After questioning  them and other witnesses, police later arrested the two suspects.  </P> <P> The central Santa Ana neighborhood where the shooting took place has seen a  flood of drug activity despite heightened police patrols, said Lt. Robert  Chavez. It is considered one of the city's "priority areas" for drug  enforcement, Chavez said. But many of the dealers warn each other of  approaching police patrols and have enlisted neighborhood youths to act as  lookouts, he added.  </P> <P> "We can't say we have been really successful," Chavez said. "Soon after we  arrest the dealers, they are back on the streets again."  </P> <P> The 12-year-old's death is the second drug-related homicide in the neighborhood  in four months. In May, Celestino Morales Davila was accidently shot by a  friend who was attempting to fire a warning shot to scare away a group of drug  dealers. LILY ENG  </P></p>

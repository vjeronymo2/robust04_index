			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENCY;  </P> <P> YEN DECLINES IN WAKE OF SCANDAL; GOLD PRICES FALL  </P> <P> The dollar headed sharply higher Monday against all key currencies,  particularly the Japanese yen, in thin post-holiday trading.  </P> <P> Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at  $390 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down $2 from late Thursday.  </P> <P> There was virtually no trading Friday in celebration of Good Friday. The  European financial markets were closed for the Easter holiday until Tuesday,  while many U.S. financial centers had scaled down operations Monday.  </P> <P> Earl I. Johnson, a currency trader with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said  the dollar's advance was mainly at the yen's expense. The yen declined partly  in reaction to a political scandal in Japan.  </P> <P> "This is really a story of weak yen, more so than a strong dollar," he said.  </P> <P> Johnson said higher oil prices due to the massive oil spill in Alaska also  supported the dollar.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar closed at 132.30 yen, up 1.03  yen from Friday's close. Later, in New York, the dollar stood at 132.70 yen, up  from 131.475 yen Thursday.  </P> <P> The dollar rose against the British pound, with sterling fetching $1.7085,  compared to $1.7195 Thursday.  </P> <P> Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Thursday, included:  1.8834 West German marks, up from 1.87375; 1.6415 Swiss francs, up from 1.6275;  1.19305 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1905; 6.36375 French francs, up from  6.3400, and 1,381.25 Italian lire, up from 1,376.88.  </P> <P> On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed  at $391.10 an ounce, down from $392.80 Thursday.  </P> <P> Silver prices also declined.

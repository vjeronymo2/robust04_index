			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: NORWALK;  </P> <P> COSTS WILL BE SPLIT 3 WAYS FOR COLLEGE STUDENT CENTER  </P> <P> After more than 20 years of struggle, students at Cerritos College will get a  student center under an innovative plan recently approved by the Board of  Trustees.  </P> <P> Under the plan, three administrative offices will be renovated and converted to  a student center for the 20,000-student campus.  </P> <P> A new administration building will then be constructed to house the displaced  administrative offices. Construction will take about 18 months.  </P> <P> The Associated Students of Cerritos College will contribute $400,000 toward  construction costs, while the administration will provide $245,000 and  financial aids programs will give $70,000.  </P> <P> It would have been too expensive for the Associated Students to raise enough  money to construct a new center, said Mark Wallace, public information  director.  </P></p>

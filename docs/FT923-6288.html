			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei's 2.5% gain fails to encourage Pacific Rim SHARE PRICES extended their gains on continued short-covering and bargain hunting, and the Nikkei average ended a volatile session with a rise of 2.5 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average added 411.08 at 16,627.96. The index fell to the day's low of 16,166.40 in the morning but later broke above the 17,000 mark, reaching 17,182.96. Some of the share price gains were trimmed in the last hour of trading as investors grew cautious about the pace of the rise. Volume jumped to 570m shares from Friday's 417m, surpasssing 500m for the first time since June 12. Rises outnumbered declines by 830 to 121, with 69 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 43.39 to 1,295.09, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index receded 12.25 to 1,053.50. Speculation that a reduction in the country's official discount rate would be announced at the end of the week, and continued optimism in the wake of the government's emergency economic package, spurred activity. Although the Nikkei index breached an important technical level, not all investors have been able to keep up with the sharp reversal in sentiment. 'The speed with which things have moved during the last few days have made it most difficult for fund managers,' said Mr Nick Cant at Baring Securities. The Nikkei has rallied 16.2 per cent since last week's announcement of emergency measures to help the ailing banking system, Foreign investors were seen buying financial issues. Tokio Marine &amp; Fire put on Y20 to Y1,200. Short-sellers bought back Nippon Housing Loan, the home-loan company facing financial restructuring due to problem loans. It was the most active issue of the day, rising Y80 to Y401. Other stocks which were also subject to speculative short-selling last week strengthened, with Okamoto improving Y110 to Y1,190 and Daikyo, the condominium developer, moving up Y80 to Y820. Banks also made firm gains, with Industrial Bank of Japan rising Y120 to Y2,280 and Sakura Bank Y170 to Y1,300. Sony, however, fell Y30 to Y4,040 on profit-taking and Nissan Motor lost Y4 to Y588. In Osaka, the OSE average surged 714.53 to 18,219.16 in volume of 24.9m shares. The index rose above 18,000 for the first time since July 23. Roundup WALL STREET'S fall on Friday had more influence on Pacific Rim markets than yesterday's rise in Tokyo. HONG KONG weakened on US-China trade dispute fears and worries that blue chip companies will announce disappointing half-time results. The Hang Seng index finished 118.46, or 2.2 per cent, off at 5,390.93, exaggerated by the thin turnover of HKDollars 1.96bn, down from Friday's HKDollars 2.62bn. HSBC Holdings, which reports its interims today, was down 75 cents at HKDollars 49.75 on expectations that the bank may announce a provision to cover its exposure to Canadian property developer Olympia &amp; York. Wharf Holdings retreated 80 cents to HKDollars 14 on fears of poor results being reported tomorrow. SEOUL was lifted by news of long-anticipated market-boosting measures and South Korea's signing of diplomatic ties with China. The composite index climbed 12.12 to 483.73. The Finance Ministry said institutions would be encouraged to buy Won3.4 trillion worth of equities and the Securities Stabilisation Fund would be required to raise Won500bn for buying equities. AUSTRALIA closed lower, the All Ordinaries index losing 19.8 to 1,539.5. National turnover was halved by a 5 1/2 -hour breakdown in the dealing system which wiped out morning business. Only 64.9m shares worth ADollars 115m changed hands. TAIWAN focused on smaller stocks as the weighted index rose 27.87 to 3,850.68, but turnover contracted to TDollars 19.17bn from Saturday's TDollars 23.4bn. NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 capital index dipped 3.98 to 1,476.26 in turnover of NZDollars 11.1m. Weakness in Fletcher Challenge, down 3 cents at NZDollars 2.41, was partially offset by Telecom, up 2 cents at NZDollars 2.31. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index shed 16.54 to 1,330.77 in volume of 22.77m shares, and in KUALA LUMPUR, the composite index ended 2.10 down at 565.56. MANILA fell in reaction to Wall Street and on continued investor aversion to the new board of Philippine National Bank. The composite index slipped 19.41 to 1,455.71.</p>

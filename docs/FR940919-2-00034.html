			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The small claim presumption of injury for this proceeding, exempts applicants whose claims are $10,000 or less, exclusive of interest, from the requirement to prove injury. Such an applicant need only document the volume of motor gasoline he or she purchased from Sunset during the audit period in order to be eligible to receive a full refund. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Enron Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 21 DOE &para;85,323 at 88,957 (1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mid-range Presumption <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Mid-range applicants; that is, applicants seeking refunds in excess of $10,000 but less than $50,000, excluding interest, are eligible to receive 40 percent of their allocable share without proving injury. Like small-claim applicants, these applicants will only be required to document the volume of Sunset gasoline they purchased during the audit period to be eligible to receive refunds. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Shell <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 17 DOE at 88,406.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> End-user Presumption. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We have presumed that end-users of petroleum products whose businesses were unrelated to the petroleum industry and were not subject to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Price and Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;751&hyph;760h, were injured by Sunset's pricing violations. Unlike regulated firms, end-users were not subject to price controls during the audit period. Moreover, these firms were not required to keep records that justified selling price increases by reference to cost increases. An analysis of the impact of the alleged overcharges on the final prices of non-petroleum goods and services is beyond the scope of a special refund proceeding. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> American Pacific International, Inc., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  14 DOE &para;85,158 at 88,294 (1986). End-users seeking refunds in this proceeding will therefore be presumed to have been injured by Sunset's pricing violations. In order to receive a refund, end-user applicants need only document the volume of Sunset product they purchased during the audit period. Meritorious applicants are eligible to receive their full allocable share. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Shell, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  17 DOE at 88,406. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Refunds in Excess of $50,000 and Other Applicants <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Applicants seeking refunds in excess of $50,000, excluding interest, will be required to submit detailed evidence of injury. These applicants must show that the overcharges were absorbed, not passed through to their customers. They will therefore be unable to rely upon injury presumptions utilized in many refined product refund cases.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not anticipate that other categories of applicants, such as, regulated firms, cooperatives, indirect purchasers or spot purchasers, would have obtained products from Sunset. Such applicants may nonetheless submit refund applications if they purchased motor gasoline from Sunset during the audit period. Any such applicants must demonstrate that they purchased products from Sunset during the audit period and show they were injured as a result of their purchases to be eligible to receive a refund in this proceeding. Regulated firms and cooperatives are exempt from the requirement to show injury. They must, however, show that they will pass through to their customers any refunds they receive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (4) How to Apply for a Refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To apply for a refund from the Sunset settlement fund, an applicant must submit an Application for Refund containing all of the following information: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The Applicant's name; the current name and address of the business for which the refund is sought; the name and address during the refund period of the business for which the refund is sought; the taxpayer identification number; a statement specifying whether the applicant is an individual, corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship or other business entity; the name, title, and telephone number of a person to contact for additional information; and the name and address of the person who should receive any refund check. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  If the applicant operated under more than one name or under a different name during the price control period, the applicant should specify those names. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Privacy Act of 1974, the submission of a social security number by an individual applicant is voluntary. An applicant who does not wish to submit a social security number must submit an employer identification number if one exists. This information will be used in processing refund applications. It is requested pursuant to our authority under the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 and the regulations codified at 10 CFR part 205, Subpart V. The information may be shared with other Federal agencies for statistical, auditing or archiving purposes, and with law enforcement agencies when they are investigating a potential violation of civil or criminal law. Unless an applicant claims confidentiality, this information will be available to the public in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (2) The applicant should specify the source of its gallonage information. In calculating its purchase volumes, an applicant should use actual records from the settlement period, if available. If these records are not available, the applicant may submit estimates of its gasoline purchases, but the estimation methodology must be reasonable and must be explained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A statement indicating whether the applicant or a related firm has filed, or has been authorized to file on its behalf, any other application in this refund proceeding. If so, an explanation of the circumstances of the other filing or authorization should be submitted;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If the applicant is or was in any way affiliated with the consenting firm, in this case Sunset Boulevard Car Wash, the applicant should explain this affiliation, including the time period in which it was affiliated. If not, a statement that the applicant was not affiliated with the consenting firm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The statement listed below, provided it has been signed by the applicant or a responsible official of the firm filing the refund application: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I swear (or affirm) that the information contained in this application and its attachments is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. I understand that anyone who is convicted of providing false information to the Federal government may be subject to a fine, a jail sentence, or both, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001. I understand that the information contained in this application is subject to public disclosure. I have enclosed a duplicate of this entire application which will be placed in the OHA Public Reference Room. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All applications should be either typed or printed and should clearly refer to the appropriate proceeding name (Sunset Boulevard Car Wash) and case number (LEF&hyph;0112). Each applicant must submit an original and one copy of the application. If the applicant believes that any of the information in its application is confidential and does not wish this information to be publicly disclosed, the applicant must submit an original application, clearly designated ``confidential'', containing the confidential information, and two copies of the application with the confidential information deleted. All refund applications should be postmarked no later than June 1, 1995, and sent to: Sunset Boulevard Car Wash, LEF&hyph;0112, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Minimal Amount Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Only claims for at least $15 in principal will be processed. This minimum has been adopted in refined product refund proceedings because the cost of processing claims for refunds of less than $15 outweighs the benefits of restitution in those instances. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mobil Oil Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 13 DOE &para;85,339 (1985). Using the volumetric methodology, an applicant must have purchased at least 173 gallons of Sunset motor gasoline in order for its claim to be considered in this proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (6) Additional Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OHA reserves the authority to require additional information before granting any refund in these proceedings. Applications lacking the required information may be dismissed or denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (7) Refund Applications Filed by Representatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OHA reiterates its policy to closely scrutinize applications filed by filing services. Applications submitted by a filing service should contain all of the information indicated in this final Decision and Order. Strict compliance with the filing requirement as specified in 10 CFR 205.283, particularly the requirement that applications and the accompanying certification statement be signed by the applicant, will be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (8) Filing Deadline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The deadline for filing an Application for Refund is June 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> V. Second Stage Refund Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any funds that remain after all first stage claims have been decided will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of PODRA, 15 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;07. PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not be required to refund monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governments for use in four energy conservation programs. The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to OHA, and any funds that OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitution to injured customers will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of PODRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It Is Therefore Ordered That: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications for Refund from the funds remitted to the Department of Energy by Sunset Boulevard Car Wash, pursuant to the Remedial Order finalized on October 22, 1980, may now be filed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> George B.

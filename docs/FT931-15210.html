			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Most unionists 'in white-collar jobs' MOST trade unionists are now non-manual workers and have educational qualifications of A level or equivalent, while 23 per cent have a university degree or equivalent. The 1991 Labour Force Survey, published today in the Department of Employment's Employment Gazette, estimates that 53 per cent of union members have full-time white-collar jobs and only 24 per cent work in manufacturing. The figures reflect the higher levels of unionisation in the public sector among health, teaching and central and local-government professionals. Union density among those at work has fallen to 33 per cent but the gender gap is narrowing. In 1991 42 per cent of men at work belonged to a union compared with 32 per cent of women. In 1948 fewer than 20 per cent of trade unionists were women. That proportion has risen to 40 per cent. Unions continue to find it hard to recruit part-time workers - only 22 per cent belong to a union - but 23 per cent of part-time women workers were in unions, compared with 12 per cent of men. The study also shows that workers under 24 are less likely to be in unions than other age groups. Thirty-seven per cent of workers, including the unemployed and self-employed, were trade unionists in 1991, the fewest since the middle of the Second World War and 15 percentage points less than in 1978, when membership peaked. Northern England has the highest union density, with 46 per cent of the workforce unionised. The lowest is in East Anglia, with 25 per cent. While 33 per cent of white workers were in unions, 46 per cent of West Indian/Guyanese, 33 per cent of Indians and 27 per cent of Pakistani/Bangladeshi workers were unionised. Employment Gazette.

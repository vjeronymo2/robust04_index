			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Lucas in German brakes contract Lucas Heavy Duty Braking, a Lucas Industries subsidiary, has won a contract worth up to Pounds 20m (Dollars 12.9m) to supply disc brakes to MAN, the German truck-maker, for its F2000 range of heavy trucks, Reuter reports. Lucas disc brakes are already fitted to the top-of-the-range 500hp F90 tractor unit; MAN will now make them available on all models as an alternative to front axle drum brakes. Drum brakes will remain a standard fitting on the rear axle. Production at Lucas' factory in Cwmbran will be increased to meet the new contract.</p>

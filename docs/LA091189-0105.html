			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Stealth Bomber Designers Honored: The Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics  has cited John F. Cashen, James E. Kinnu, Irving T. Waaland and the late John  Paterno for designing the B-2 Stealth bomber. Cashen, a former Bell Labs and  Hughes Aircraft scientist, is a specialist in low radar observability and was  chiefly responsible for the ability of the B-2 to elude enemy radar. Waaland  was the aerodynamicist credited with designing the B-2's unusual flying wing  configuration. Kinnu is a military electronics expert and Paterno was general  manager of the program.  </P></p>

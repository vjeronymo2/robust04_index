			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: FT-SE SmallCap index - Correction Monday's table of FT-SE SmallCap index constituents incorrectly included Manchester Ship Canal, Fleming International High Income Investment Trust and London &amp; St Lawrence Investment as constituents of the FT-Actuaries All-Share index from December 31 1992. In fact, these three companies do not meet the eligibility requirements. Other constituents listed in the table are correct, except that Taunton Cider was incorrectly listed as Thornton Cider. Leeds Group and Telemetrix were marked as new entrants; in fact, they are already constituents. We apologise for these errors.</p>

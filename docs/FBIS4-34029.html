			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Brigadier General Samuel Rodiles Planas by </F> reporter Hector Rodriguez, on the "This Very Day" program on 14  June, monitored in progress -- live]    [Text] [Rodiles] ...of unit troops. I remember our first  maneuver in 1962, directed by the head of the Army, Commander  Guillermo [not further identified]. I mention this as a  comparison to our Western Army's preparedness then and now. I  should mention that this took place in 1962, and the Army was  founded on 14 June of that same year.    The maneuvers began and we were assigned to carry out  offensive maneuvers. I was the head of Division 1270, and  Military Unit 2424 was subordinate to our unit, which was headed  by then Captain Mario [not further identified], regarding all  equipment, and we were unable to communicate with any of the  subordinate units. [chuckles]    [Rodriguez] So, there has been a total change.    [Rodiles] Yes, a very significant change. That is where we  realized we were lacking a lot of military preparation. We went  through other things as well.    I mention this example because an immense majority of those  soldiers filled officer ranks in the new Army. But as time  passed, the Army began to grow in knowledge and experience. I  also wanted to point out that after the collapse of the former  Soviet Union, our academies and military schools began offering  the advanced military courses that were offered in the USSR,  with the same efficiency as in the former USSR.    Today, we have more than 114,500 combatants and  internationalists in our western territory. That figure includes  combatants, from the production and defense brigades to our main  units, as well as reserves. In that, we can see the great combat  experience that our Army has acquired. All the officers and  specialists, after graduating from military schools, went on to  the General Staff and the troops, and once again received the  practical knowledge of how to lead the troops in a modern  battle. That is how we continued strengthening ouselves in  theoretical principles, as well as in the practical knowledge of  leading the troops.    Beginning in the 1980's, the doctrine of the people's war  began to be taught. Our main leader, the commander in chief, and  the minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], realized  that it was necessary to develop this type of defense in all its  aspects since the defense of our socialist fatherland would  eventually depend on our, the FAR's, and the Cuban people's  effort and knowledge. That is how, in the eighties, the concept  of the people's war was established and taught.    I do not exaggerate when I say that since then, we have  trained tens of thousands of cadres and militants in the  Territorial Troops Militia [MTT]. This is in addition to the  preparation given our recruits and officers, who have gone  through our command to create the real conditions to carry out  that sacred mission assigned 33 years ago. In this concept of  the people's war, we have linked ourselves more and more to the  production and defense brigades, the defense zones, the  municipalities, the MTT's. In a nutshell, the concept of the  people's war is of the working and revolutionary people.    Together with the increase in volume of the equipment and  quality of the armaments, we have carried out and continue to  carry out serious work in the preparation of the military  operations theater. We have the experience of the war in Iraq.  At this moment, our armaments and equipment are ready to  counterattack an enemy attack. It has the necessary vitality and  conditions to carry out the mission successfully.    Taking all this into account and faced with the question of  what our Western Army represents today, I would say it defends  the largest territory of our country. It includes the capital of  our Republic, where the leadership of the party and the Army,  the revolutionary government, and a large part of the important  industries in our country and objectives of such importance are  located.    The armaments that our Army has are significant in power and  capacity. If this is an important objective, since the country's  leadership is located here, we believe this is of strategic  importance. And for its defense -- I am not revealing any  secrets by saying this -- we have troops who can guarantee the  success of that mission and form part of the country's strategic  goals. We understand the high responsibility that the Western  Army has because of its sacred and historic mission.    I wanted to conclude by pointing out that on one occasion,  the commander in chief stated that we would defend that sky,  this flag, and this land regardless of the cost. To our  commander in chief, we say the Western Army, beginning with its  head, will defend the capital of the nation regardless of the  cost and conditions. It will never surrender to an enemy  aggression. We are sure of this.    [Rodriguez] General, I know there is competition -- I have  called it beautiful competition -- among the three armies. Well,  there is also the Youth Labor Army [EJT], but they do not have  the same characteristics. They are the fourth Army. But the  Western, Central, and Eastern Armies are competing to be the  best and most outstanding command. I would like for you to  address this.    [Rodiles] Hector, a pure, healthy, beautiful competition  exists among comrades. This competition is fraternal and  fruitful. We have no doubt that the FAR will be who ends up  winning because the results will be greater preparation,  capacity, and combat readiness to defend the fatherland, the  Revolution, and the achievements of socialism. Nevertheless, the  Western Army has the conditions of being named the first  command. In other words, it is in condition to be given the  honor of best command of the FAR.    [Rodriguez] [Words indistinct] in the Eastern Army.    [Rodiles] Today, our dear brother Espinosa of the Eastern  Army has it.    Last year, the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces  [Minfar] held its inspection. We were also part of that  inspection. It was a rigorous inspection. We obtained the high  grade of good. That inspection demonstrated the morale and  enthusiasm of all our comrades as well as the party and  government leaders of the provinces and municipalities, the  defense zones, and the production and defense brigades. This  inspection covered the military aspects, as well as the aspect  of the defense directed by the party and the government etc.,  and we were graded as good. That result was demonstrated.    The inspection also demonstrated the ties, cooperation, and  harmony that exists between the people's defense forces and the  Western Army. Once again, it demonstrated the great affinity  that exists between the Minfar and the military commands that  were being inspected.    The increase in the military operations theater is  significant. I have already mentioned that it guarantees the  vitality of the forces and equipment that will carry out such  important missions. The political morale and discipline are  high. Without discipline, there is nothing, as the minister of  the FAR has said. We have reached first place in the  conservation of armaments and equipment -- and a colonel who has  already been here can attest to this.    The agricultural-livestock sector is also very important.  Raul challenged us to increase production by 30 percent. In some  areas, it is much more than 30 percent: tubers, grains, and fish  breeding. In self-sufficiency, our military heads have the basic  economic training to establish an inventory of goods produced.  Because of all this, we believe we will reach first place.    [Rodriguez] You are still in the fight.    [Rodiles] Yes, we are still in the fight. [words indistinct]  victorious and invincible in Havana at 33 years of age. Today,  our Army is 33 years old. At that age, we will dedicate the  achievement of obtaining first place in this fraternal  competition to our commander in chief.    [Rodriguez] I know there is a strong competition and it is a  competition in which the FAR will be the winner. The FAR will  perfect itself during this competition. I know that the best  command is the Eastern Army, but this year you hope to obtain  that distinction. There is one topic, to conclude, that has been  stressed. The minister has emphasized this. We are talking about  the attention to the soldiers and officers. I would like you to  discuss this briefly.    [Rodiles] This is one of our main areas of work, which has  been stressed by the commander in chief, as well as by the  minister of the FAR. Despite the critical and difficult  conditions that we are all aware of, brought about by this  special period in peacetime, we have not wavered in our  attention to the workers in general. We continue working to  perfect living and working conditions for all categories of  personnel in the Western Army. In some units, we are even  working intensively to complete housing before 26 July to  improve those conditions.    In the recreational, cultural, and tourist areas, we are  improving centers for the relaxation of our troops and officers  in general. This year, several thousands of comrades, officers,  and their families enjoy this attention to the worker. Beginning  this year, we are going to at least duplicate the conditions and  possibilities so our personnel can enjoy those vacations and  recreational and cultural activities.    To conclude, I want to say that we have an ambitious plan to  build low-cost housing to improve the living conditions of our  officers and their families, a large number of whom are living  at the military unit due to the shortage in housing that we all  know about. The officers, their relatives, and friends work in  the construction of the houses. In other words, it is a family  effort which will make them appreciate the houses even more.    [Rodriguez] Brig. Gen. Samuel Rodiles, thank you for your  participation on this program.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Russia favors the soonest  settlement of the Haiti crisis on the basis of complete and  unconditional fulfillment of U.N. Security Council resolutions  and the return of overthrown president Jean-Bertrand Aristide to  the country, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's information  and press department Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing here today.    In his words, Russia is concerned over the military junta's  proclamation of a member of the Haiti Supreme Court temporary  president in evasion of constitutional procedures.    "The recent illicit action of the Haiti regime testifies to  its unwillingness to listen to the insistent appeals of the  international community for restoration of Haiti democratic  institutes. It will make more complicated the uneasy  achievement of political settlement in Haiti," stressed the  Russian diplomat.</p>

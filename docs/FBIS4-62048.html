			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev report: "Ivan Rybkin Is Opposition's New </F> Target"]    [Text] Judging by the information emerging from the State  Duma, the first plenary session to be held in that parliamentary  chamber's new building -- the former building of the Ministry of  the Economy -- on 11 May has every chance of returning us to the  atmosphere of parliamentary political crisis so characteristic  of the former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet.    This time the speaker of the chamber, Ivan Rybkin, could  become the victim of a showdown among deputies. The opposition  seems to have begun seriously to consider putting into effect  the threat voiced at the last plenary session by Deputy S.  Baburin to examine the State Duma chairman's personal file if he  went ahead and signed the Treaty on Social Accord. Ivan Rybkin,  as people will know, ignored the threats and signed the treaty,  and it is to be supposed that the revenge of the former comrades  in arms of the Russian Unity bloc will not be long in coming,  particularly as the speaker has long caused acute irritation to  the majority of left-wing factions by his desire to cooperate  with the executive branch and his firm refusal to play a  Khasbulatov role in the Duma.    If the "Rybkin personal file" is put on the agenda, the Duma  chairman could be placed in a pretty difficult position. Deputy  Baburin's initiative will not, of course, be supported by the  right-wing factions -- Russia's Choice, Yabloko [the Yavlinskiy  bloc], the 12 December group, or the majority of centrists --  the members of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES],  Women of Russia, and New Regional Policy factions.    There is no reason to expect unity in the left-wing section  in the Duma hall of sessions either. The Agrarians, who will be  asked to oppose their own nominee, will find themselves in a  difficult position. And the already small Democratic Party of  Russia [DPR] faction has been split since its leader, N.  Travkin, joined the government. So only the Communist Party of  the Russian Federation [CPRF] faction and the small Russian Path  group of deputies are consistent and firm opponents of Rybkin.    Much could be resolved here by the stance of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]. From a superficial  standpoint it would be illogical for Zhirinovskiy to oppose a  fellow signatory of the treaty. However, it cannot be ruled out  that the Liberal Democrat faction will form a bloc with the  Communists on this occasion. Admittedly, this will only happen  in the event of a guarantee that the vacated speaker's chair  goes, for example, to A. Vengerovskiy, first deputy chairman of  the LDPR and deputy chairman of the Duma. However, it is  difficult to imagine the Communists and the members of Russian  Path agreeing to pay such a price for Rybkin's resignation.    A far greater threat to the State Duma chairman is posed not  by the configuration of forces in this chamber of parliament but  by the theoretical possibility of a revision of the results of  the election for speaker. As you will recall, Rybkin scraped a  majority. Moreover, dubious ballot slips, which were deemed  invalid, were discovered when the ballot boxes were opened.  Many contentious issues also remain over the determination of  the quorum for voting. All this gives grounds for questioning  the legitimacy of Rybkin's election. And here the opposition  could gain allies in the shape of a number of radical deputies  from right-wing factions.    All this clamor raised over the figure of Ivan Rybkin --  the first person in the history of contemporary Russian  parliamentarianism to have tried to turn parliament from a  political club into a genuine legislative body -- shows very  graphically that periods of political stability in Russia's life  remain of short duration, lasting as a rule less than a month.  The pattern here is obvious. And there is scarcely any point  in seeking the cause of the latest potential minicrisis solely  in the spoiling tactics of Deputy Baburin and like-minded  individuals from the Accord for Russia movement. It is  difficult to expect political stability in a country with an  unstable economy.    This latest, expected spiral in political tension coincides  to perfection with the advent of a new stage of economic crisis  in Russia. Our home-produced consumer goods have begun to lose  out in price to imported goods. In the opinion of leading  economists in the country, the domestic economy is already in a  crisis of overproduction. The first reaction to this was the  demands at the start of the year to increase import duties.    The political forces existing in Russia today propose two  ways out of this situation: either a drive to solve the  nonpayments crisis by the classic method -- through the  bankruptcy of enterprises -- or reversion to a closed economy.  This, of course, is to protect home producers. The first path  is long and hard. To start moving along it you need at least  six months in order to prepare the legislative base -- to  change, in particular, the Law on Enterprises, to introduce laws  on bills of exchange and bankruptcy, to seek a solution to the  problem of the depressed regions, and to do much, much more  besides. On the other hand, if Russia does manage to complete  this path, real grounds will emerge for discussing the  possibility of genuine stability not just in the economy but in  politics too.    Recent actions by the president indicate that he has decided  to go in precisely this direction and has opted to pursue this  path toward an open economy for at least two years.    At the same time there is a real prospect that uncompetitive  economic structures will unite, their main demand being a  restoration of the closed economy. The military-industrial  complex is seen as the undisputed leader here. Its financial  potential and links with the power structures and the special  services could turn such an amalgamation into a powerful force  -- and not just a political force. And the longer Russia takes  to overcome the crisis, the greater this force's chances of  winning victory, even by unconstitutional means, will be. The  strengthening of imperialist and nationalist motifs in the  policy of various parties reflects this trend.    Ultimately the question comes down to whether the president  and government will manage to extricate the country from crisis  by the next presidential election.    There are grounds for thinking that at the current stage of  development of the political situation in Russia the president  sees his main task as inducing the opposition to operate solely  within the constitutional framework and thereby avoiding another  threat of a putsch or coup, because since 12 December the  opposition, contesting the president on the constitutional  field, has been unable to pose any special danger to him. The  campaign launched to collect signatures in favor of the Treaty  on Civil Accord, which is designed to consolidate the  president's constitutional role, is, I think, primarily linked  to this.    Both in August '91 and last October Boris Yeltsin was  victorious, not because he relied on the law (regrettably we  cannot talk about respect for the law and legal standards in  Russia today), but solely thanks to the support of the people.  However, as the results of the elections to local organs of  power show, this support does not appear unconditional today.  The people are withdrawing from politics. The president is  forced to rely more and more on the political and state  nonmenklatura.    The diplomatic domestic political activity demonstrated by  Boris Yeltsin in recent days -- the unpublicized renewal of  contacts with Yu. Skokov, leader of the military-industrial  complex, and the appointment of N. Travkin to the government --  stems, it may be supposed, from awareness of this fact. It is  clear that the president is seeking to utilize all levers to  prevent any change before 1996 to the strategic economic course,  the main threat to which could be posed today by  unconstitutional actions on the part of the opposition.</p>

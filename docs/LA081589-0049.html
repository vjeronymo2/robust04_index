			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN CHARGED WITH THREAT TO TV'S LANGE  </P> <P> A 57-year-old unemployed Los Angeles laborer, who for five years purportedly  sent letters and gifts to television anchor Kelly Lange, was charged Monday  with making a terrorist threat against the KNBC-TV newswoman.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police arrested Warren Sevey Hudson, 57, on Friday at the Linda  Motel on West Washington Boulevard. Investigators said they found a .38-caliber  Colt revolver and ammunition in his room.  </P> <P> KNBC notified the Los Angeles Police Department last week that someone had been  telephoning Lange and sending her gifts -- which were returned -- although she  had never seen the man or spoken to him.  </P> <P> While investigating the threat, police said they found an employee at a  downtown gold and silver exchange -- where Hudson formerly worked -- who quoted  Hudson as saying Aug. 9 that he was "bored with life and that he was going to  Burbank to shoot Kelly Lange."  </P> <P> Lange and the station refused to comment Monday on Hudson's arrest, according  to station spokeswoman Regina Miyamoto.  </P></p>

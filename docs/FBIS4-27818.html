			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan's economic planning  chief Yoshio Terasawa lamented Friday [3 June] as  "old-fashioned" and a "waste" the nation's male-dominated hiring  practices. The director general of the Economic Planning Agency  (EPA) said he told other cabinet members that "Japan is strange"  in not hiring large numbers of women as a matter of course, as  he said U.S. and European banks and securities firms do.    Terasawa did not offer statistics on foreign hiring  practices  but told a regular news conference he was giving his impression  from more than 20 years in the United States, including a stint  as vice president of Nomura Securities Co. and head of its U.S.  subsidiary. "It's obvious there are a lot of excellent women,"  but corporate hiring practices hold them back, he said. "It's  certainly a waste for Japan's excellent women."    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata sought the cooperation of all  related ministers at a gathering after the morning cabinet  meeting to promote fairer hiring of women, according to top  government spokesman Hiroshi Kumagai. Hata said women must be  allowed to participate equally in various sectors of society to  demonstrate their abilities, said Kumagai, chief cabinet  secretary and minister in charge of women's issues, at a  separate news conference.    Terasawa, citing Japanese corporate hiring quotas for each  sex among business school graduates, said, "it's old-fashioned  to say, 'how many men and how many women.' "    Labor Minister Kunio Hatoyama agreed in principle, Terasawa  said, but responded that if companies don't allot a certain  number of spaces for women, "they'll end up (hiring) all men."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mas'ud Roghani Zanjani, the Iranian vice </F> president and head of the Budget and Planning Organization, by  an unidentified correspondent on 31 January; place not given --  recorded]    [Text] Following the Islamic Majles debate of the budget  bill for the year 1373 [1994-94] today, our correspondent  interviewed Mr. Mas'ud Roghani Zanjani, the vice president and  the head of the Budget and Planning Organization. We draw our  dear viewers attention to this interview.    [Correspondent] The deputies and various commissions of the  Islamic Majles have proposed amendments to the Budget Bill for  the year 1373, some of which were ratified. The Majles has  approved the ceiling for the revenue earned from the sale of  oil, and also the revenue from taxation. I would like to ask  Mr. Masud Roghani Zanjani to explain the government's revenue  for the year 1373 and the effect of the Majles amendments.    [Zanjani] Up until now, that is 725 [figure not further  clarified], the total revenue originally proposed by the  government is reduced by 3 trillion rials. Since we are in the  second reading of the expenditure debate, it is not yet clear  how the esteemed Majles intends to distribute the cut among  various departments. No doubt there will be some cuts in the  current expenditure and some in the [long-term] development  plans. It is certainly clear that if we were to put this into  practice, it would be impossible to implement some of the  country's current plans. We have to wait and see what policies  the Majles will adopt vis-a-vis the expenditure now that revenue  is reduced.    [Correspondent] What sort of price have you envisaged for a  barrel of oil to reach the figure of revenue ceiling from the  oil sale? And what will be the daily production figure?    [Zanjani] The Majles has compiled the budget at [estimated  figure of] 13 dollars [per barrel]; whereas the government's  figure was different. For the same reason the oil revenue is  reduced.    [Correspondent] What about taxation?    [Zanjani] The Majles has proposed increased taxation figure.  That is, we had proposed taxation revenue of 6.4 trillion  [rials]; whereas, the esteemed Majles has proposed 7.88 trillion  rials for the time being. The figure has not been finalized yet.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Ministers firm on Pounds 400m deal for Jubilee Line ANY FUTURE owner of Canary Wharf would be held to an agreement to contribute Pounds 400m towards the planned extension of the Jubilee Line Underground railway if Olympia &amp; York collapsed, ministers insisted last night. But, amid disquiet about the severe blow it would deliver to the future of Docklands, ministers accepted that the government would face intense political pressure to inject more public money into the area to sustain confidence. With O&amp;Y seeking protection from its creditors, the government faces an acute dilemma over whether to scrap the rail scheme if the banks refuse to meet, or seek to scale down, the developer's contribution. Officials predicted an intense cabinet debate before the government agreed an approach. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, could be expected to lead calls for an active role in preserving confidence. Last year he fought successfully for the routing of the Channel rail link through east London as part of an ambitious strategy to spur the development of the east Thames corridor beyond Docklands. But the officials said he would face fierce opposition from the Treasury to any increase in spending to support Canary Wharf. Downing Street said Mr John Major was being kept closely in touch with the progress of negotiations between O&amp;Y and the banks. Following O&amp;Y's action, it is thought that his first priority will be to limit the political damage but also to minimise any immediate commitments until the future of Canary Wharf becomes clearer. There was little surprise at the suggestion that negotiations between O&amp;Y and its creditors might collapse, but there was acknowledgment in Whitehall that the final demise of the developer would mark a severe setback for the government's ambitions for the area. The ministers said that the departments of the environment and of trade and industry were still talking about the possibility of moving civil servants to Canary Wharf. But, so far, O&amp;Y's package had not been sufficiently competitive to match a Commons pledge by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, that any decision would be strictly commercial. A minister closely connected with recent talks insisted that, if Canary Wharf went into admin-istration, the government would expect the banks to to contribute towards the rail extension. The government plans to inject more than Pounds 1bn into the Jubilee Line. It argues that the Pounds 400m due to be contributed by O&amp;Y is significantly less than the additional value that a rail link would place on Canary Wharf. There is private acknowledgement, however, that there is no binding contract to force O&amp;Y or any subsequent owner to contribute to the line.</p>

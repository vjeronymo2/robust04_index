Authorizations granted on this basis are developmental authorizations. In general, the FCC grants developmental authorizations in situations and circumstances where it cannot reasonably be determined in advance whether a particular transmitter can be operated or a particular service can be provided without causing interference to the service of existing stations. For example, the FCC may grant developmental authorizations for: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Field strength surveys to evaluate the technical suitability of antenna locations for stations in the Public Mobile Services; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Experimentation leading to the potential development of a new Public Mobile Service or technology; or, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Stations transmitting on channels in certain frequency ranges, to provide a trial period during which it can be individually determined whether such stations can operate without causing excessive interference to existing services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.403  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> General limitations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions and requirements of this section are applicable to all developmental authorizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Developmental authorizations are granted subject to the condition that they may be cancelled by the FCC at any time, upon notice to the licensee, and without the opportunity for a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Except as otherwise indicated in this subpart, developmental authorizations normally terminate one year from the date of grant. The FCC may, however, specify a different term.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Stations operating under developmental authorizations must not interfere with the services of regularly authorized stations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) A grant of a developmental authorization does not provide any assurance that the FCC will grant an application for regular authorization to operate the same transmitter(s), even if operation during the developmental period has not caused interference and/or the developmental program is successful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.409  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Developmental authorization for a new Public Mobile Service or technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCC may grant applications for developmental authority to construct and operate transmitters for the purpose of developing a new Public Mobile Service or a new technology not regularly authorized under this part, subject to the requirements of this section. Such applications may request the use of any portion of the spectrum allocated for Public Mobile Services in the Table of Frequency Allocations contained in part 2 of this chapter, regardless of whether that spectrum is regularly available under this part. Requests to use any portion of the spectrum for a service or purpose other than that indicated in the Table of Frequency Allocations in part 2 of this chapter may be made only in accordance with the provisions of part 5 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preliminary determination.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCC will make a preliminary determination with respect to the factors in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section before acting on an application for developmental authority pursuant to this section. These factors are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) That the public interest, convenience or necessity warrants consideration of the establishment of the proposed service or technology;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) That the proposal appears to have potential value to the public that could warrant the establishment of the new service or technology; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) That some operational data should be developed for consideration in any rule making proceeding which may be initiated to establish such service or technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Petition required.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications for developmental authorizations pursuant to this section must be accompanied by a petition for rule making requesting the FCC to amend its rules as may be necessary to provide for the establishment of the proposed service or technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Authorizations for developmental authority pursuant to this section will be issued only upon a showing that the applicant has a definite program of research and development which has reasonable promise of substantial contribution to the services authorized by this part. The application must contain an exhibit demonstrating the applicant's technical qualifications to conduct the research and development program, including a description of the nature and extent of engineering facilities that the applicant has available for such purpose. Additionally, the FCC may, in its discretion, require a showing of financial qualification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Communication service for hire prohibited.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Stations authorized under developmental authorizations granted pursuant to this section must not be used to provide communication service for hire, unless otherwise specifically authorized by the FCC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Adherence to program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Carriers granted developmental authorization pursuant to this section must substantially adhere to the program of research and development described in their application for developmental authorization, unless the FCC directs otherwise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Report requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon completion of the program of research and development, or upon the expiration of the developmental authorization under which such program was permitted, or at such times during the term of the station authorization as the FCC may deem necessary to evaluate the progress of the developmental program, the licensee shall submit a comprehensive report, containing: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A description of the progress of the program and a detailed analysis of any result obtained; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Copies of any publications produced by the program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A listing of any patents applied for, including copies of any patents issued; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Copies of any marketing surveys or other measures of potential public demand for the new service; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) A description of the carrier's experiences with operational aspects of the program including_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The duration of transmissions on each channel or frequency range and the technical parameters of such transmissions; and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right years for interest rate rises Sir, My review ('Powerful threat of German weakness', September 29) of David Marsh's book, Germany and Europe: The Crisis of Unity, contained a small error. The Bundesbank increased interest rates three times in 1991 and again in July 1992, not in 1992 and 1993 as stated in the article. Giles Radice, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

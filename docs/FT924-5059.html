			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / International Company News: NEC says charges will push it to Y9bn loss NEC, the Japanese electronics company that dominates the domestic personal computer market, yesterday said it would post a consolidated net loss of Y9bn (Dollars 72.58m) in the 12 months to the end of March next year. The company earned Y15.28bn last year. NEC has been hit hard by the decline in domestic capital spending and the sluggishness of personal consumption, which have eaten deeply into sales in its main lines of business. In the half-year to September, net profits declined by 77.3 per cent to Y4.25bn. Sales fell by 7.1 per cent to Y1,688.2bn. However, the company expects second-half results to be much worse because of two factors: rising depreciation charges stemming from the completion of semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America and Japan, and charges resulting from a restructuring of NEC's home electronics business in North America. On a pre-tax level, profits in the first half of the year plunged by 83.9 per cent to Y8.26bn. For the full year, the company expected Y10bn in pre-tax profits. For the interim period, sales of communication systems and equipment were down 9 per cent to Y452.98bn. Computers and industrial electronics systems were down 6.3 per cent to Y838.7bn, while electron devices, including semiconductors, fell 6.9 per cent to Y299.2bn.</p>

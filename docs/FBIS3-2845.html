			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhou Zongmin (0719 1350 2404), and Li Pei </F> (2621 3805)]    [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (XINHUA) -- The plane with the  Tibetan delegation to the Second Session of the Eight National  People's Congress [NPC] landed slowly at Beijing Xijiao Airport.  The deputies, wearing Western-style business suits, Tibetan  gowns, or jackets, stepped down the ramp, carrying briefcases  with digital locks or colorful Tibetan bags.    As soon as he stepped down from the plane, Jian Zeng, who  wore a business suit, told us: "Medog County can now be reached  by car!"    Medog used to be the only county in Tibet not accessible by  car. Two years ago, Jian Zeng walked nearly two weeks from his  county to Lhasa to catch a plane to Beijing to attend the Fifth  Session of the Seventh NPC, but because of the rugged terrains  he missed the plane, and his belated arrival made him a figure  in the news. For this reason, many deputies forwarded a motion  at that session that all counties in China must be accessible by  highways. This wish has eventually materialized.    Although Jian Zeng is only 39, he has served as deputy to  two  NPC sessions. He said: "I am particularly excited to be in  Beijing today. People in my county asked me to deliver a  message of thanks to the government for its concern and support.  From now on, people in Medog have a way leading them to become  well off."    The Medog highway was a regret in China's communications  history. The state attached great importance to the highway's  construction and invested more than 35 million yuan in building  it in mountainous areas. The highway was eventually completed  and opened to traffic on 1 February. During the construction,  dozens of road builders gave up their precious lives and nearly  100 workers have been disabled.    According to Jian Zeng, people in Medog cannot wait to open  shops along the new highway. He added that people in the county  are working on projects of setting up village and town  enterprises, and that the local people's per capita income has  now reached 800 yuan.    Bai Zen is one of the two female deputies of the Tibetan  delegation. Speaking on changes in Tibet, she said no changes  can be greater than the change in people's minds. Along with  the establishment of the market economy, she said, the "roof of  the world" has also opened its door. Even women who used to  stay home all the time have become a main force in economic  construction by setting up stores and restaurants and even doing  business in coastal areas in southeast China.    As the principal of the No. 1 Lhasa Primary School, she said  she is proud that boys and girls in Tibet now have the same  opportunity to receive education. She said that half of her  school's pupils are girls and 90 percent of the teachers are  female.    Pingcuo is the only deputy representing the Moinba  nationality -- a people with the smallest population in China.  He said that none of his ancestors had ever thought of coming  to Beijing to take part in state affairs discussions like he  has. He said: Although the old Tibetan Government "Garsa"  (parliament) also met once a year, serfs did not have any rights  to express their views at all! Today, we and people of the  other 55 nationalities have become the masters of our country  and we have our own seats at the NPC where we can take part in  state affairs discussion.    Pingcuo, who has put on a brand new Tibetan gown, said:  Tibetan delegation members have carried with them the wish  shared by the more than 2.6 million Tibetan people, namely  working with people of all nationalities in the country to  achieve a better life and head for prosperity together through  developing the economy.    Before coming to Beijing, the Tibetan deputies had  extensively solicited the views of people in all quarters, and  they are ready to forward 15 proposals with regard to how to  develop Tibet's economy and revitalize its agriculture and  animal husbandry.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Signs of recovery in trading revenues - US banks With net interest margins largely unchanged, this week's second-quarter figures from leading US money centre banks will turn in large part on how well they have coped with trading in unsettled foreign exchange and fixed income markets. Trading revenues are generally expected to recover from the poor first quarter, but lag average 1993 quarterly income by some 25 per cent. The greatest year-on-year earnings advances are likely to come from banks that have continued to recover from past credit problems. Most analysts forecast earnings per share for Citicorp at around Dollars 1.22 (up from 82 cents) and BankAmerica at Dollars 1.31 (Dollars 1.19) - the latter an indication that the Californian economy has finally begun a recovery from its three-and-a-half-year recession. Regional banks, meanwhile, should see stronger earnings growth as a group despite higher US interest rates. If rising interest rates have an effect, it is likely to be on the earnings of banks that have used interest rate swaps to boost their margins in the past. Foremost of these is BancOne, which in recent periods has boasted a net interest margin of more than 6 per cent but is expected to see this fall fast (in part due to falling margins on credit cards). BancOne's second-quarter earnings per share are expected to be level with the previous quarter and a year before, at 81 cents.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Snack foods move behind advance to Pounds 1.84m at JLI A MOVE into snack foods helped JLI, the food processor and distributor which supplies popcorn to UK film audiences, increase first half pre-tax profit by 61 per cent. It rose from Pounds 1.14m to Pounds 1.84m in the six months ended September 30 1992 and was generated on sales 27 per cent higher at Pounds 50.9m (Pounds 40.2m). The strongest performance came from the snacks division, built up on the back of two rights issues (raising Pounds 20.7m) and three acquisitions in little more than a year. Operating profits from this operation rose from Pounds 450,000 last year to Pounds 1.3m. Distribution suffered a decline in sales and profits as the group abandoned low margin business. Operating surplus fell from Pounds 840,000 to Pounds 730,000 on sales Pounds 5.6m lower at Pounds 21.3m. The group expected to benefit from the trend towards more adventurous eating in the UK through the acquisition in late September of Brookerpaks, distributor of products such as garlic and ginger. The ingredients division saw profits fall 14 per cent to Pounds 550,000 on sales 38 per cent ahead to Pounds 14.9m. The enlarged share capital depressed earnings per share from 3.4p to 3.2p. The dividend is raised just 0.05p to 1.55p.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Tyne and Wear economy exceeds national growth Manufacturing in Tyne and Wear outperformed both the UK and the northern region on every main measure between 1989 and 1991, says a report. It adds that the county's prospects in the mid-1990s, underpinned by a large and growing motor industry, look good. The report, by Tyne and Wear Research and Intelligence Unit, says output rose 1 per cent in the two years compared with a 14 per cent UK fall. Productivity rose 4 per cent to match UK levels for the first time since 1983, and manufacturing investment soared 46 per cent to Pounds 483m, 60 per cent of which was accounted for by the motor industry. Profit margins exceeded UK levels for the first time since 1979, and the only two main indicators which fell - employment and profitability  - recorded modest declines well below the northern region and UK levels, the report says. It says high investment, the closing of the productivity gap and improved profitability all suggest a much better outlook for Tyne and Wear manufacturing in the 1990s than the 1980s, although it predicts some decline in manufacturing employment because of strong productivity growth. The report, based on the Central Statistical Office census of production, warns that some of the county's relatively strong 1991 performance might have been due to the late impact of the recession on its industries.

Another reason for this is the intention by certain circles  in the USA to impose a "time-out" in its relations with Russia  and watch the developments in Moscow.    As is the established procedure, Russia's competent bodies  do  not intend to comment whether the Ameses worked for Russia.  This is explained by the fact that Moscow would not like to  influence the trial which will be soon held. Moscow believes  that the court will have to toil enough, because there is no  substantial evidence against the Ameses, according to the US  press.    The Russian competent bodies categorically disagree with the  point of view widely shared in the USA that America has "special  powers" and may carry out intelligence activities against  Russia, while Russia cannot do so. Moscow and Washington have  never signed an agreement to give up intelligence activities  against each other. Moreover, the CIA does not even try to hide  the fact that Russia remains one of its priorities.    Interfax also learned that the Russian competent bodies were  amazed at the deportation of a Russian diplomat, Aleksandr  Lysenko, who had been introduced to the American side as a  representative of the Russian intelligence, according to an  agreement between the Russian secret service and the CIA.  Lysenko arrived in the USA last June and, as a matter of fact,  was only being put in the know of developments.    If the CIA delegation composed of two persons tried to  represent the deportation as "a forced victim" with the aim to  "loosen the situation," then Moscow believes that Lysenko was  made a "scapegoat."    Regarding this action by the US Department of State as  purely  political, Moscow decided to declare the advisor of the US  embassy in Moscow, James L. Morris, persona non grata as a  measure of "mutual payment." The decision was made on the level  of the Russian president.    Moscow believes that the deportation of J. Morris will be a  full stop in the disagreement, and the staff of the Russian  embassy in Washington will not be reduced by a single person.  Otherwise, Moscow's reaction would be prompt. However, the  escalation of this issue was not a choice of Russia.    According to Interfax information, the decision by the US  Department of State followed the arrival in Moscow of a CIA  delegation composed of two persons. The CIA officials tried to  force the Russian secret services to recognize their involvement  in the Ameses' case by voluntarily recalling the Russian  diplomat who allegedly worked with the Ameses couple.    The American officials also insisted on Moscow's taking no  measures in response and making no comments to the press. This  was made condition to continuing the mutually profitable  cooperation between the Russian and US secret services.    All these demands were regarded as unacceptable in Moscow.    At the same time, the Russian competent bodies were not in  the least interested in fanning "spy mania." They have evidence  of several dozens attempts to recruit Russian citizens by the US  secret service. In a number of cases, Americans used "illicit  methods" such as blackmail which is not in use by the Russian  intelligence. However, Moscow did not make a fuss using this as  a pretext, like the USA did it with the Ameses' case. Nor the  Russian secret service put emphasis on other cases when Russian  citizens collaborating with the CIA and the FBI were arrested  and brought to trial.    The Russian secret service understands that the Ameses' case  was a serious psychological blow to the CIA, but it does not  want to gloat at it.    Moscow believes that the CIA internal security should not be  made issue of interstate relations, and the further developments  will entirely depend on the American side.</p>

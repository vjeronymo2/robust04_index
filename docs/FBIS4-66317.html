Then these features are transformed to  enable free use of Carpenter and Grossberg's ART2 [Adaptive  Resonance Theory 2] ANN for automated radar target  identification of aircraft.    In the computer simulation experiment, the total number of  learning patterns selected was eight and the number of input  features was six (three parameters each for the engine inlet and  the tail); after numerous self-regulation training cycles, the  technique was able to accurately recognize four aircraft  targets--Concorde, DC-10, 707, and 747--with a minimum warning  line (i.e. threshold value) of 0.3. The one figure shows the  polarization ellipse, while the one table compares values for  the six features of all four aircraft calculated via reference  [1] with those calculated by the authors' method.  <H5>  References </H5>   1.

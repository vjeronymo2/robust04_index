			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee producers mount effort to boost prices LATIN AMERICAN coffee producers, who account for almost two thirds of world production, are to retain 20 per cent of their exports from the start of October. The move was agreed over the weekend in San Salvador, capital of El Salvador. It follows the collapse in March of talks in London to renegotiate the International Coffee Agreement, the producer/consumer price stabilisation pact, which expires at the end of September. Indonesia, the world's third biggest coffee producer, and some African producers indicated yesterday that they might join the Latin American's scheme. World producers are thought to have lost a cumulative Dollars 10bn since the International Coffee Organisation's export quota system collapsed in July 1989, more than halving world prices. September robusta coffee futures on the London Commodities Exchange closed up Dollars 24 yesterday at Dollars 952 a tonne. The New York arabica market was closed for the Independence Day holiday. But last Friday September arabica futures closed 2.45 cents higher at 62.25 cents a lb in anticipation of the San Salvador meeting. 'I think the markets will begin to take us seriously now,' Mr Herbert de Sola, El Salvador's top coffee negotiator, told the Reuter news agency after the San Salvador meeting. 'This will have an immediate effect on prices. They have to believe that the political commitment is there among producer nations, even if they question how the agreement will function.' The plan to retain 20 per cent of exports was proposed by Brazil, the world's biggest producer. It supersedes an agreement made last May under which the Central American producers - Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala - were to withhold 15 per cent of their production while Brazil and Colombia were to limit exports to 17m and 13m bags (60 kgs each) respectively. The countries meet again on August 15 as the Confederation of Coffee Producing Countries, when they will work out the details of the scheme. It will aim to reduce the level of exports retained as market prices rise. London analysts expect the market to move ahead in the initial stages. 'I'm quite positive about it,' said Mr Peter Kettle of ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house. 'I don't think producers have to do a large amount to turn it around a bit.' He argued that the producers were not seeking a huge increase in prices, but were going for something fairly modest. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, put a ceiling of 80 cents a lb for the nearby New York arabica contract on any upward move. Above that level, he argued, consumers would resort to their 20m-bag stockpile and producers would start to circumvent the retention scheme. 'The problem with the scheme is verification,' he suggested. 'Who is going to determine the crop size? How do they know the volume of exports? What happens if someone cheats?'</p>

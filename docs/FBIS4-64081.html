The "Development of Reforms and Stabilization of the Russian  Economy" program was adopted in November of last year, and  covered the period from late 1993 through 1994. Today it has  been partially implemented, and it has become partially  obsolete. That is why the Ministry of the Economy, represented  by First Deputy Minister Yakov Urinson, proposed that certain  clarifications and additions be introduced.    First of all, it is proposed to change the procedure for the  adoption of decisions. Whereas last year's version proposed  proceeding on the basis of presidential edicts, which were to be  subsequently ratified by laws, now the elaborators of the  program will be aiming for the adoption of full legislative acts  straight away.    As for the content side, the following additions were made.  The section on the reform of state enterprises, elaborated on  the basis of recent presidential edicts, is being included in  its entirety in the program. Measures to carry out structural  policy are being outlined. A list of hopeless production  capacities liable to closure is being drawn up.    The investment section will tackle in particular the  procedure for the implementation of federal targeted programs,  as well as a reduction in their number. Apart from that, a  methodology for selecting projects for financing is being  proposed.    A federal program for exports and a government decree on the  basic guidelines of energy policy will also be ratified within  the framework of the program for the development of reforms.</p>

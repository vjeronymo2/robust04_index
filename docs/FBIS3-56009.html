One would like to hope  it would also promote technical and economic cooperation",  Vladimir Shcherbakov, president of the International Foundation  for Assisting Privatisation and Foreign Investment, told  ITAR-TASS. "It is wrong when potential of the two countries is  used to one tenth of a per cent".    Shcherbakov expressed perplexity that COCOM restrictions on  the granting of new technologies to Russia have not yet been  lifted. "It is not easy for Russia to receive technologically  perfect products from the United States. Russia needs such  products for economic development, for market development. U.S.  companies do not use sufficiently vast opportunities for  investment in Russia that brings mutual advantage".    Shcherbakov said that his foundation and the Lemont Brothers  firm secured a tender for a feasibility study for the  development of the Moscow aviation junction. Considerable  advantage is promised by a private telecommunications network in  Russia that is being created by joint effort of the foundation  and the U.S. Andrew company.    Shcherbakov said there are plans for joint utilisation of  missile silos jointly with several U.S. companies. Large amount  of equipment, valuable metals and materials remain during the  elimination of strategic missiles in silos. All this will be  extracted and used.    U.S. firms are offered to participate in the implementation  of the Russian programme for the utilisation of radioactive  waste from submarines that completed their service. "This  problem is encountered by Russia and the United States and form  the point of view of ecology by the whole world", he said.  "Russian scientists are far advanced in the working out of the  technology for the utilisation of radioactive waste. It is now  for the Russian and U.S. Governments to finance the works", he  said.</p>

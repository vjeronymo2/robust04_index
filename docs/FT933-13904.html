			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Petofi in Hungarian share issue BUDAPEST'S capital market has added another instrument to its increasingly sophisticated portfolio with the issue of redeemable preference shares by Petofi Nyomda, Hungary's leading packaging concern. Petofi has issued Ft1.35bn (Dollars 14.4m) worth of the securities, which have a fixed maturity of five years and carry a dividend of 17 per cent. Credit Suisse First Boston Budapest, arranger of the issue, has placed the paper with Hungarian institutions. For investors the redeemable preference shares behave like bonds but the advantage is that payments in the form of dividends are taxed more favourably than coupons would be. Petofi is controlled by western funds. Other western joint ventures are in a similar position and are expected to follow Petofi's lead. The introduction of redeemable preference shares is a mark of Budapest's increasing maturity as a financial centre.</p>

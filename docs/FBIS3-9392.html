Zdenko Vranjes reports from Mostar for Croatian Radio:    [Vranjes] The leadership of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna and Croat deputies are carrying out preparations  for two forthcoming sessions -- important sessions indeed -- of  the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna  scheduled for Saturday and the historic constitutional  [ustavotvoran] assembly of federal Bosnia-Herzegovina which is  expected to take place in Sarajevo on Monday and Tuesday.  Kresimir Zubak [president of the presidential council of  Herceg-Bosna] has told Croatian Radio the following:    [begin recording] [Zubak] [words indistinct] this session of  the constitutional assembly scheduled for Monday 28 March. We  have scheduled, prior to this, a session of the chamber of  deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna at which we  should inform the deputies about the documents we adopted in  Washington and prepared in Vienna.    All deputies to the chamber of deputies of the Croat  republic  of Herceg-Bosna are also deputies to the constitutional  assembly. This assembly of Herceg-Bosna is going to formulate  final standpoints and instruct the deputies at the session of  the constitutional assembly on Monday and Tuesday.    [Vranjes] Will all the deputies from the ranks of the Croat  people take part in the constitutional assembly in Sarajevo on  Monday? Has this been prepared and agreed yet?    [Zubak] All technical details relating to this have not been  agreed yet. I believe that today or tomorrow we will agree on  every technical detail. We are of the opinion that all the  deputies from the ranks of the Croat people who were deputies to  the former assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be present and  vote. It is a known fact that a constitution may be adopted by  a consensus of two peoples. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq says the PLO and Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] represent two aspects of a  national movement possessing rather similar long-term aims  vis-a-vis Israel. Lieutenant General Baraq added, however, that  the two organizations have different methods for arriving at  these goals.    Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports Lt. Gen. Baraq today  briefed the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee about  reports on agreements between the PLO and Hamas. Baraq said  that he will not be surprised if Hamas people join social  networks in Gaza and Jericho, such as schools and welfare  services. The chief of staff also said he will not be surprised  if one faction of Hamas will pursue the path of terrorism. The  chief of staff believes that the PLO will on the whole be  interested in proving that terrorism is on the wane in the areas  under their jurisdiction.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE CHARGES FILED AGAINST KEATING, OTHERS;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE EXPANDED 46-COUNT INDICTMENT AGAINST THE FORMER LINCOLN SAVINGS  OWNER AND THREE EX-OFFICERS COMES AFTER 22 COUNTS WERE DISMISSED.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County prosecutors Monday filed an amended and expanded 46-count  indictment alleging securities fraud against former Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan  owner Charles H. Keating Jr. and three others.  </P> <P> The new charges were submitted to Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lance  A. Ito 10 days after he set aside 22 counts in the original 42-count grand jury  indictment. He said the 22 counts either did not state a criminal offense or  were vague.  </P> <P> Deputy Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. William Hodgman, who had promised to  present a "bulletproof" amended indictment, said Monday that the latest version  should make it "easier to get a conviction" because a trial court jury would  better understand the complicated case.  </P> <P> Hodgman said the addition of four new counts won't expose the defendants to a  harsher penalty because a conviction on only six counts carries a maximum  10-year prison term. But the new charges increase the chances of getting the  convictions, he said.  </P> <P> Keating and the co-defendants -- Judy J. Wischer, Ray C. Fidel and Robin S.  Symes -- have pleaded innocent to the original 42 counts. Attorneys for the  four said they would seek dismissal of the amended indictment. They argue that  only the grand jury, not prosecutors, can alter the indictment.  </P> <P> "This is an invasion of the grand jury's province," said Donald Smaltz of Los  Angeles, attorney for Symes, a former Lincoln president.  </P> <P> Keating is the former chairman of American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, which  owned Irvine-based Lincoln. Wischer is former president of American  Continental, and Fidel succeeded Symes as Lincoln president.  </P> <P> In a separate action Monday, an administrative law judge in Washington denied  Keating's request to halt an administrative hearing on a $40.9-million  restitution claim that regulators have filed against him. Keating wanted the  hearing delayed until other civil and criminal cases are concluded. The judge  also denied Keating's request to change the location of the hearing from Los  Angeles to Phoenix.  </P> <P> Administrative Law Judge Paul J. Clerman said the hearing will start within  four months, adding that any "unwarranted delay . . . could only increase the  public's concerns." Regulators are seeking restitution from Keating and others  for three Lincoln deals.  </P> <P> The grand jury indictment accuses Keating and the three co-defendants of fraud  in connection with the sale of more than $200 million in American Continental  bonds to 17,000 investors -- mainly elderly Lincoln depositors -- at 29 Lincoln  branches in Southern California. Many investors said they were misled into  believing that the bonds were insured or safe.  </P> <P> The bonds have become worthless since American Continental filed for bankruptcy  protection in April, 1989, and regulators seized Lincoln the following day.  Lincoln's collapse is expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.  </P> <P> In an indictment unsealed Sept. 18, Keating and his co-defendants were charged  with securities fraud in the sale of the bonds. But defense attorneys argued at  a Nov. 9 hearing that the charges were too vague and should be dismissed.  </P> <P> Ito ruled that 20 of the 22 counts he set aside did not state an offense. They  allege that the defendants sold bonds in ways that exceeded the authority given  them by the state Department of Corporations, which approved the sales. The law  makes it a violation only if sales are conducted without authority.  </P> <P> Ito ruled that two other charges -- ones that accuse the defendants of lying to  the Department of Corporations and failing to clear advertising with the agency  -- did not give Keating and the others a specific idea of what they did wrong.  </P> <P> In amending 20 of the 22 counts that were set aside, the prosecution still  alleges that Keating and the others sold securities without authority, but it  left out the passage alleging that they exceeded the authority they had.  </P> <P> Smaltz contends that since American Continental had authority to sell bonds,  the defendants didn't violate the state law listed in the indictment.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRYSLER TO PURCHASE NO. 4 DOLLAR RENT A CAR;  </P> <P> RENTALS: THE BUYOUT OF THE PRIVATELY HELD, LOS ANGELES-BASED CAR LEASING FIRM  CONTINUES A TREND OF AUTO MAKERS BUYING INTO SUCH COMPANIES TO OBTAIN CAPTIVE  MARKETS FOR THEIR VEHICLES.  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. agreed Tuesday to buy Los Angeles-based Dollar Rent A Car, the  nation's largest privately owned auto rental company and the fourth largest  overall.  </P> <P> Neither company would disclose the purchase price. When it was reported earlier  this month that the two were talking, one source said the price would be $70  million to $90 million.  </P> <P> But Dollar founder Henry J. Caruso said in a telephone interview Tuesday that  such estimates were "way off base." He would not say whether the price was more  or less than the estimated range.  </P> <P> Caruso said that the firm's 500-member headquarters staff will remain in Los  Angeles and that he will stay on as a consultant.  </P> <P> "I hope to continue to be active," he said. "I will not be as close to the  day-to-day operations as I have been in the past. But I intend to offer what I  can from my past experiences in the growth of this company and from my  marketing experiences."  </P> <P> The transaction, scheduled to be completed Aug. 15, follows a trend in which  auto makers have turned the rental industry into a distribution system for  their products. Rental companies are the leading buyers of cars.  </P> <P> Owning a rental company also gives manufacturers a means of letting prospective  buyers sample their products in hopes that they will purchase them. "It gives  an auto manufacturer the ability to offer the consumer an experience he would  not get otherwise," said Thomas F. O'Grady, president of New York-based  Automotive Resources, a market research firm.  </P> <P> In a separate development Monday, Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, in  Cypress, completed its acquisition of a majority investment in Value Rent-A-Car  Inc. of Deerfield, Fla. It was said to be the first purchase of a car rental  company by an automotive importer.  </P> <P> Value has about 25 locations in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Arizona, Colorado  and Nevada.  </P> <P> Among American manufacturers, Ford Motor owns a portion of Hertz, the nation's  largest rental company, and has also invested in Budget Rent A Car Corp.  General Motors owns part of National Car Rental System and Avis Inc.  </P> <P> Chrysler bought Thrifty Rent-A-Car last July for $263 million and, five days  later, Thrifty bought Snappy Car Rental for $40 million. Dollar and the other  two rental firms will operate as separate entities under a Tulsa, Okla.-based  subsidiary of Chrysler, Pentastar Transportation Group.  </P> <P> Dollar, which buys 70,000 to 80,000 cars annually, has used General Motors cars  primarily.  </P> <P> "When you get volume orders like those from a rental company," said Chrysler  spokesman Tom Jakobowski, "it gives you more solid production. It keeps your  plants in operation, and that translates into quality."  </P> <P> But owning a rental car company doesn't guarantee that a subsidiary will buy  all its cars from its parent. Thrifty earlier this year bought about 4,000  autos from Mitsubishi, even though Thrifty is owned by Chrysler, because the  cars were less expensive.  </P> <P> Dollar, which has 762 rental locations in the United States and 550 overseas,  is primarily a franchising company. It owns only about about 18 of its  locations, including ones in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Burbank, Ontario and  Detroit. It has a fleet of 82,000 vehicles, 57,000 in the United States.  </P> <P> Although most of Dollar's locations are on airport property, most Thrifty  counters are just outside airports. Snappy specializes in renting cars to  people whose autos are being repaired. Caruso founded Dollar Rent A Car in 1966  as Dollar A Day. It had a fleet of 18 Volkswagens operating from one location  in downtown Los Angeles. Within a year, he had opened another five branches in  Los Angeles, and the company began selling franchises nationwide.  </P></p>

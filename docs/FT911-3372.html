			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd to press Kuwaitis on human rights - Foreign Office Questions MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, will raise concerns over human rights abuses when he visits Kuwait at the beginning of next month. Mr Hurd will be also be going to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan between May 1st and 5th. In the Commons yesterday he said the government was taking seriously the recent report by Amnesty International on the torture of Palestinians and others in Kuwait. 'We take the Amnesty report seriously, because it's been made clear by us to Kuwaiti ministers before the liberation, that we believe this should be a new and hopeful chapter in the history of Kuwait,' said Mr Hurd. While some retaliation and disorder was understandable, Mr Hurd said he would reinforce the message he had given the government in exile. During foreign office questions, MPs from both sides urged Mr Hurd to give an assurance that foreign policy would remain the concern of individual countries within the EC. Mr Peter Shore (Lab Bethnal Green and Stepney) said divisions within the European Community over the Gulf were 'very worrying indeed'. He said the government should 'oppose the extension of majority voting to any aspect of foreign policy'. Mr David Wilshire, (Con Spelthorne) said it was possible to be a good European by supporting economic aspects of the EC while questioning the wisdom of a common foreign policy. The advantage to Britain of joint action within the community should not be under-rated, said Mr Hurd who pointed to the relief effort for the Kurds as a good example of the twelve member countries working together effectively. Later Mr Hurd defended the presence of British troops in Iraq after warnings from a backbench MP about getting involved in the internal politics of Iraq. 'The purpose of the presence of our troops in northern Iraq is purely humanitarian,' said Mr Hurd. That did not prevent the government, when asked, from saying it believed the Kurds should have autonomy within the boundaries of Iraq, he said. Mr Douglas Hogg, the foreign office minister, insisted yesterday that full diplomatic links with Iran would not be restored until the three British hostages held in Lebanon were released. 'We believe Iran has a decisive influence over their future,' he said.</p>

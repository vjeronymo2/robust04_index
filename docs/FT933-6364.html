			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slips from peak despite strong bonds Wall Street AMID profit-taking, US stock markets either remained flat or eased off their record highs, in spite of a further sharp rise for bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.91 at 3,648.18, although the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.91 firmer at a record 461.04. For the second consecutive day the Nasdaq composite underperformed the rest of the markets, relinquishing 2.27 to 731.39. Trading volume on the New York SE was 254m shares. After posting a 46-point Dow advance over the previous two trading days, no-one was surprised yesterday when the equity markets failed to build on those gains. All year so far, profit-takers have been ready to move in every time stocks have reached all-time highs. The day's economic news - an 8,000 rise in weekly initial jobless claims - had little impact on the markets. Prices remained subdued throughout the day, apart from a brief surge mid-afternoon sparked by program buying. For once, higher bond prices, which pushed long-dated yields to new record lows, failed to stimulate across-the-board buying interest in equities. Buyers sought certain sectors, and continued to rotate between cyclical, consumer, car, pharmaceutical, technology, transportation and oil issues. Drug shares were among the leaders. Pfizer climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 63 1/2 , Bristol Myers-Squibb put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 55 5/8 , Schering Plough added Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 60 7/8 and Merck rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 32 5/8 . Selected oil stocks were also in demand. Exxon firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 66 3/8 , Texaco Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 65 1/8 , Mobil Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 78 1/2 and British Petroleum ADRs Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 58 7/8 . Cyclical shares eased with the wider market. Caterpillar shed Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 82 3/8 , International Paper Dollars 1 to Dollars 66 7/8 and General Electric Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 98 3/4 . Car manufacturers, however, were firmer, led by General Motors, which rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47 5/8 . Certain technology stocks were out of favour, although all ended above the day's lows: Compaq lost Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 52 1/2 , Motorola Dollars 1/2 at Dollars 94 3/8 and Texas Instruments Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 80 3/8 . Disappointment that Philip Morris did not raise its dividend continued to hurt the stock, which fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 48 1/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Novell dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 19 1/8 in reaction to Wednesday's late news of a third-quarter loss (which included a charge) and several downgrades from broking houses. Other leading technology issues also ran into heavy selling, with Microsoft retreating Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 72 1/8 and Apple Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 26 7/8 . Intel, however, rallied after an early decline to end a net Dollars  7/8 up at Dollars 63 3/8 . Canada TORONTO retreated a little after setting a record high in the previous session. The TSE 300 index slipped 7.3 to close at 4,115.6, although advances just outscored declines by 362 to 360. Volume was 57.6m shares. Eight of the 14 sub-group indices ended higher, including energy and financial services, although there were no significant gains. The golds index lost 3.09 per cent as the bullion price fell USDollars 4.50 an ounce in New York. Hudson's Bay, up CDollars  5/8 at CDollars 35, reported sharply higher second-quarter and six-month earnings.</p>

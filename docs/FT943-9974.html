			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Company News: Insurers set for a beneficial interim - Other Companies Three of the UK's largest composite insurers are expected to report substantially increased profits in their interims this week. The results will be boosted primarily by recovery in UK underwriting, reflecting high premiums and stable claims. Analysts have warned that the balance sheets may be weaker as a result of the turbulence in equity and bond investments. General Accident is set to announce its half-year results tomorrow. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 177m-Pounds 200m are expected, against last time's Pounds 126m. The forecast dividend is in the range 10p to 10.25p, against 9.7p last time. Commercial Union is expected to unveil its results on Wednesday, although the timing may be changed or separated from details of the way in which the insurer is to pay for its purchase of Groupe Victoire, the French insurer, earlier this year. Analysts are predicting half-year profits of Pounds 168m-Pounds 180m, up from Pounds 66m. The dividend range is 10.1p to 10.25p, against 15.1p last time. Royal Insurance is due to report on Thursday, with forecast profits of Pounds 127m-Pounds 150m, with an average of Pounds 138m. This compares with just Pounds 52m last time. The predicted dividend range is 3p to 3.5p, rising after the company cut its dividends substantially two years ago.</p>

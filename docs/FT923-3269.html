			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Sport: Lord Shelburne's elegant answer - Golf LORD Shelburne was worried. The noble brow was furrowed. His family had owned Bowood House and farmed it successfully for nearly 300 years, but now the yield from a parcel of land laid out to arable farming was appalling. Profits were plummeting faster than ripened apples. He looked at the figures for 1985-86. There would be a profit of Pounds 7,000 on a turnover of Pounds 1.2m. 'It was as clear as can be that if we continued like that we'd had it,' he says. Something had to be done with the unprofitable 1,500 acres on the estate near Calne in Wiltshire. Several suggestions were made; the one that was followed was to build a golf course. Golf courses were in vogue. At first, the proposal was as grand as the house itself, where Joseph Priestley discovered oxygen in 1774. It has rooms designed by Robert Adam, and grounds laid out by Capability Brown. There would be an hotel, a country club, a championship golf course. Nothing but the best would do. The Savoy Group was coming in as a partner to run a 120-bedroom hotel. Planning permission was granted. A sum of Pounds 8m would be raised by debentures to cover the total cost of the project, which included a 40,000 sq ft clubhouse built on American country club lines with swimming pool and tennis courts. Now came the first stroke of luck for Bowood. The hotel group pulled out of the venture. On the other hand, the project was going ahead and the golf course, designed by Dave Thomas, was untouched. The Gulf War is not a pleasant memory for many people, but it has its appeal for Lord Shelburne. By October 1990 he realised his scheme was still too grand. The sale of debentures was not going well, not only because of the Middle East crisis but in part because a new golf club at Castle Combe barely 10 miles away was competing for the same sort of rich investors. He cancelled the debenture scheme altogether. 'I was depressed,' he says. 'I had now made two changes in five years. I began to wonder whether I was ever going to get this off the ground.' Other changes were made. The clubhouse was scaled down from 40,000 sq ft to 12,000 sq ft. Instead of being a purpose-built project, it was decided to convert an old farm and its associated out buildings. Most significant, it was also decided to make Bowood a pay-as-you-play course, with a small number of memberships available, what the Americans call a semi-private club. It was a case of third time lucky. There were no further hitches. Bowood Golf &amp; Country Club, laid out on 200 acres in the western corner of the park, opened this summer. It has 200 of its desired 250 members. It is averaging 50 rounds each day; during the summer, an average of 1,500 rounds each month were played. The course is long and testing, quite capable of staging a championship. It sprawls comfortably within its distinguished surroundings and is pleasing to the eye, although I find the lake on the side of the 4th an eyesore. In addition to the course, there are three practice holes, known as the Academy, where Nigel Blenkarne and his assistant professional do most of their teaching, and a driving range. The conversion of the old farm buildings into a clubhouse that looks like a large Cotswold house with outbuildings has been achieved with taste. Exposed beams are everywhere. The men's locker room, which is too small, is in a building erected in the mid-18th century. Corridors are floored with 200-year-old flagstones. The shop and office for the professional have been converted from a barn, which also contains a self-service restaurant. The driving range is made out of cedar, the wood coming from an elderly and extremely large tree that was blown down in the storm of 1989. The surprises at Bowood do not end there. Golf clubs, being dominated by men, are almost always managed by men, often retired service types. Bowood is managed by a sparky woman who once sold non-ferrous metals and later ran two engineering businesses. Sally-Jane Coode, currently a regional business woman of the year, was appointed chief executive in April 1991. If her appointment was a surprise to everyone else, it was not to Lord Shelburne. 'It is all new to her and new to me but she had a proven track record,' he said. 'Running any business has a structure. So long as you learn and listen and get the structure right one business is very similar to another.' With the welcome briskness of one who is not bound by tradition, Coode has swept aside some typical golf club shibboleths. Men and women are treated exactly the same - same rates, same rights. She has no truck with pompous signs for the captain, lady captain and so on in the car park. Her feminine touch ensures the visitor receives a warm welcome. There is no joining fee. Dress in the dining room, so often a thorny problem, is relaxed. 'Men spend all week wearing a jacket and tie. I see no reason to make them dress the same way at the week-end.' She has even met and defeated the greatest challenge of all - that of maintaining the quality and quantity of soap in the men's changing room. Bowood is a young venture and it has cost a lot of money. Buildings had to be dismantled, sheep and cattle replaced, existing buildings converted. The course cost nearly Pounds 2m and consultancy fees from the start were considerable. In all, the venture cost nearly Pounds 6m. To my mind it is an object lesson in the way to build golf courses in the 1990s. Apart from anything else, it represents good value for money. You can pay Pounds 500 annually and Pounds 10 for each round or Pounds 875 annually, for which you become a card holder or a member by any other name. It deserves to succeed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- Major Japanese steelmakers  are curtailing operations of their blast furnaces to increase  cutbacks in pig-iron production amid a prolonged steel market  slump, industry sources said Wednesday [23 February].    Pig iron is a direct product from blast furnaces and is  refined to produce steel or remelted into special shapes.    The sources said, however, steelmakers are reluctant to shut  down their furnaces, because once closed down it would cost more  than 10 billion yen and take several months to restart.    Kawasaki Steel Corp.'s mill in Chiba, east of Tokyo, is  running only two blast furnaces at reduced operation rates.    They said Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., Kobe Steel Ltd.,  Nippon Steel Corp. and NKK Corp. are running their blast  furnaces at reduced operation rates, but they are still higher  than Kawasaki Steel's cutbacks.    Nippon Steel and NKK export surplus pig iron to South Korea  and Taiwan, the sources said.    If an oversupply in pig iron continues, the companies would  have no choice but to consider shutting down the furnaces, the  sources said.</p>

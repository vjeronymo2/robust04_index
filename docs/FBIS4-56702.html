			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bulletin No. 2 issued by the Electoral Tribunal [TE] at the </F> Atlapa Convention Center in Panama City; read by TE Press  Secretary Doris Chong Guardia -- live]    [Text] Today, Sunday, 8 May, the National Vote-Counting  Board will be installed at 1400 at the Atlapa Convention Center.    On 50th Street, a car carrying former Costa Rican President  Rodrigo Carazo Odio collided with another vehicle, but there  were no serious problems for the distinguished guest who has  been invited here by the Electoral Tribunal [TE] as an observer.  Carazo later met with ex-U.S. President Jimmy Carter.    In Bocas del Toro, a TE source reported that the process is  proceeding smoothly at the province's 211 voting sites. This is  one of the few provinces where there are no independent  candidates.    As for Cocle Province, it has been reported that a phone  call  warning that a bomb had been planted was received at the  Dominican Republic School voting site. The incident was handled  by the Police Investigations Department, the Public Force, and  the National Civil Protection System. The area was evacuated  for 30 minutes. It was confirmed that the call had been a false  alarm. In Colon, the 346 voting sites opened normally. Nothing  unusual has happened in the province.    Our correspondent in Chiriqui reports that the voting is  going smoothly and that the people are displaying a great sense  of civic responsibility. In David, electoral officials  penalized certain businesses which, in violation of the law,  sold alcoholic beverages. Everything is normal in Herrera  Province, it was reported at noon. A large voter turnout is  reported in Los Santos Province.    In Panama Province, voters went to the voting sites in an  orderly manner, particularly in metropolitan Panama. In Canita  de Chepo, a candidate for representative was detained when he  was caught with electoral material in a state-owned vehicle.  The candidate also verbally abused the electoral official who  questioned him. The vehicle was confiscated. Voting sites 1832  and 1833 in Rio Iglesias opened to voters at 1300 after damaged  ballots for corregimiento representatives were replaced.    The general consensus, at least in Panama City, is that the  doubts on the use of the single ballot have been dispelled. The  ballot is being used with no problem.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Unions fear job cuts at Elf unit Elf-Atochem, the chemicals arm of Elf-Aquitaine, the French oil group which is due to be privatised within the next few weeks, is planning to cut about 400 jobs over the next two years, the company's unions said yesterday. The cuts will affect the company's French operations, which employ 21,600. They will be achieved through voluntary redundancies and by shifting employment between the group's production sites. The plan is due to be officially approved later this month. According to the unions at Elf-Atochem, the sites which will be affected include Vendin and Lens, in northern France. Production of polyethylene at Lillebonne, near Le Havre, is expected to be transferred to Carling in eastern France. The job cuts are part of Elf-Atochem's plans to adapt to the depressed European chemicals market, which is undergoing its sharpest downturn since the second world war. However, industry analysts in Paris said that prices and demand were beginning to stabilise and that a series of restructuring measures at Elf-Atochem should enable the group to break even this year. Union representatives criticised the planned job cuts. 'They will hit areas which are already depressed and are unnecessary because Elf-Aquitaine remains in profit,' said the Confederation Generale du Travail, the communist-led union group.</p>

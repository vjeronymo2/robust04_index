The study was conducted under the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, and section 2904 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;486. By memorandum dated January 7, 1993, the President authorized the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Commandant of the United States Coast Guard to proceed with the study.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The study is available at the Public Reading Room (Room 1E&hyph;190), U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-4 p.m. EST, excluding Federal holidays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Copies of the study have also been placed in the following reading rooms: U.S. Department of Energy, San Francisco Operations Office, 1333 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94612; U.S. Department of Energy, Rocky Flats Public Reading Room, Front Range Community College Library, 3645 West 112th Avenue, Westminster, CO 80030; U.S. Department of Energy, Public Reading Room,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Largo Public Library, 351 East Bay Drive, Largo, FL 34640; U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office, Public Reading Room, 1776 Science Center Drive, P.O.

After reviewing the hazards posed by plutonium, applicable transportation safety and physical protection regulations, pertinent research and experience, and contingency plans, the agencies participating in this study conclude that plutonium can be shipped safely by sea.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public Law 102&hyph;486 also requires the preparation and submittal to Congress of an Implementation Plan that describes the plan for implementing the recommendations contained in the study. The Implementation Plan must be submitted to Congress and made available for public viewing 90 days after issuance of the study. Subsequent to enactment of the legislation calling for this study and Implementation Plan, and subsequent to preparation of the study, several individual members of Congress have raised additional concerns relating to the shipment of radioactive materials by sea. These concerns include the safety of shipment of other material proposed to be shipped (e.g., glassified high-level nuclear waste and mixed oxide fuel), as well as the need to evaluate risk assessment elements. These elements are shipping routes, adequacy of the revised International Maritime Organization code for radioactive shipments, the consequences and probability of the ``maximum credible accident'' in shipping by sea, and the examination of threats of sabotage and terrorism. The participating Federal agencies will address these additional concerns in the Implementation Plan to the extent that they relate to the recommendations in the study. Where certain issues raised do not fall within the framework of the study and Implementation Plan, the agencies will ensure that they are addressed through direct communication with the members of Congress who raised them.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on February 18, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard J.

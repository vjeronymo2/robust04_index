			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> THE JANUARY PAN: Who got the worst review of the month? The winner is . . .  Guns N' Roses, whose "G N'R Lies" EP got blasted by Washington Post critic Mark  Jenkins as a "platter of half-baked filler." Calling the group "corny" and  "mawkish," Jenkins wrote: "Guns N' Roses is an acutely sentimental band with a  reverence for cliche that would impress a Hallmark card copywriter." Assessing  side one of the EP, which features four live songs first released in 1986, he  says: "To hear these tired tracks is to develop a new appreciation for Geffen's  A&amp;R department: only a professional prospector could have seen the  commercial potential in these bar-band Aerosmith moves. . . . The solemnity  with which they replicate early '70s hard rock is almost sad. Platinum album or  not, these guys aren't rock's conquerors -- they're its victims."  </P></p>

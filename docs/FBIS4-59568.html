			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 14 (AFP) -- A radical Islamic daily on  Saturday [14 May] protested against a visit by a group of U.S.  newspaper editors and said it would boycott a meeting between  the journalists and representatives of the Iranian press.    The chief-editors of 13 US newspapers and magazines arrived  here earlier this week on a three-day visit to "raise their  understanding of present-day Iran," a U.S. journalist told AFP.    They have already held several meetings with representatives  of the Iranian media and were to meet Saturday with the  editors-in-chief of the press in Tehran.    "It is not clear who invited the American editors to Iran  and  why the Culture Ministry has arranged a meeting between them and  Iranian chief-editors," said JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, a daily close to  Islamic hardliners.    The paper warned that the meeting could be a "ploy" by  Washington to try and reopen talks with Iran through an indirect  channel.    Tehran and Washington broke diplomatic ties in 1980 after  radical students stormed the U.S. Embassy here and took its  staff hostage.    The United States has called several times for direct  negotiations, but the two sides have yet to make a breakthrough.  Islamic hardliners are fiercely opposed to any talks with  Washington.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Armenian Minister of Agriculture Ashot </F> Voskanyan by unidentified correspondent: "`There Is Someone to  Think About the Peasants...'"]    [Text]    [Correspondent] How has the introduction of national  currency  and the financial shocks which ensued had an effect in the field  of agriculture?    [Voskanyan] I could not truthfully say that the peasant has  suffered more than city residents, let us say, as a consequence  of the monetary exchange. The rural living standard is higher  today. The exchange of money would have taken place more  favorably if we had had the appropriate market substructures,  aside from the state structures, and had buying and selling  organizations in the private sector. They could have been given  certain privileges to bring agricultural products into the  market. I want to emphasize that a large amount of output has  been accumulated in the countryside today, especially potatoes  and vegetables. Our objective is to deliver 420,000 metric tons  of potatoes to city residents.    [Correspondent] In a press conference several months ago,  you  advanced the idea of establishing purchasing organizations and  insisted that it be put into effect without fail. What has been  done in this regard?    [Voskanyan] The Ministry of Agriculture itself has studied  this problem, and I can say that we have procured 1,500 metric  tons of seed potatoes. This means that we will be able to work  with the peasant in the spring, that is, to sell or grant him  credit to buy seed potatoes. We have been trying to find markets  outside the republic. One of these days our ministry  representatives will travel to Pyatigorsk, where a trade fair  will be organized and we will sell wool, geranium oil, and  seeds, which our republic has in abundance. And I think we  should proceed to privatize with confidence and establish  purchasing organizations based on different forms of ownership.  Certain steps have already been taken in this direction.    [Correspondent] Be more specific about them, if possible.    [Voskanyan] A commission on barter has been formed in the  Ministry of Agriculture which can buy products locally and sell  them where there is a demand for them. Despite the fact that  this is not part of our ministry's responsibilities, we will  make changes in our charter enabling the Ministry of Agriculture  to engage in sales matters as well. This is a specific measure  provided in the program for 1994. So the commission has already  been formed and it is functioning.    [Correspondent] Mr. minister, please tell us what will  happen  to the credit emission (13.5 billion rubles [R]) allocated for  agriculture, especially as the agricultural administrations have  permitted a large number of abuses in the emission's  distribution, according to peasants and official reports.    [Voskanyan] According to our assessments, use of the credit  emission in agriculture has been very effective. To begin with,  R7.5 billion of the R13.5 billion were allocated to the rayons  for them to distribute locally, and R6 billion were allocated to  various organizations in the agricultural system. What did we  achieve? First of all, we were able to maintain the number of  fowl in poultry farming, which had decreased to the lowest  point. If we have credit funds in 1994, we will provide them for  peasant farms once again, since the system is working.    Some 420,000 metric tons of potatoes have been produced in  the republic. This is the highest indicator in recent decades.  Light frosts last year caused substantial damage to viticulture,  and the gross output of grain reached 310,000 metric tons. We  regret to point out that the average yield of grain crops  declined, but vegetable production reached 480,000 metric tons.  This indicator does not take cabbage production into account.    I would like to say a few words about the number of  livestock. We do not see an overall decrease in the number of  livestock in the republic. This problem has to be approached  from a different viewpoint. We must follow the best possible  path: the number of animals has to be brought into conformity  with the forage reserve in the republic. Concentrated feeds are  not coming into the republic as in previous years, and I do not  think they will be delivered in the years ahead.    [Correspondent] What is the situation with regard to the  supply of diesel fuel, which the prices of agricultural products  depend on to a large extent? Spring sowing lies ahead, and the  peasants are very concerned about this.    [Voskanyan] Joining my colleagues, I must note with regret  that the agreements concluded are not always put into effect.    Our preparation period is in December and January, and we  will try to make the best use of it. We intend to bring 5,000  metric tons of fuel into the republic through the Ministry of  Agriculture's efforts alone. The government will also allocate a  certain quantity, but I cannot say how much yet.    [Correspondent] At what prices will it be sold to the  peasants?    [Voskanyan] At prices lower than market prices, naturally.  And generally speaking, all those measures which are implemented  with the help of the Ministry of Agriculture are always at  prices substantially below market prices.    [Correspondent] And a final question. What would you like to  say to a peasant in this difficult situation which has taken  shape?    [Voskanyan] There are many states in a similar situation,  but  these problems will pass like rainy days. I think the current  government will manage to bring the republic out of the  situation that has developed. Our peasant farms and our peasants  should realize that they are thought about. It would be correct  if they were not only consumers, but obtained the needed  fertilizer, seeds, and so forth beginning today to rescue us  from inflation. I repeat: the Ministry of Agriculture will do  everything in its power.</p>

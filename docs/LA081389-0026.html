			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'A PRIEST ON ABORTION'  </P> <P> I am so pleased to read Regas' most sensitive and informed views on abortion.  It is important to me, and to people like me, that religious leaders break  their silence (because most are pro-choice) and speak out in defense of a  woman's right to choose.  </P> <P> I am a baptized and confirmed Episcopalian. Thank you, Father Regas, for making  me feel proud of the church I was brought up in. You inspire me to share a bit  of my own story.  </P> <P> I had a safe, legal abortion a year ago. It was a very difficult decision that  I arrived at only after much prayer and introspection. Those who would make  abortion illegal claim that abortion in this country has become too easy an  answer. They push for more restrictions in the hopes that women will make what  they consider to be moral decisions.  </P> <P> There is nothing easy about being faced with an unplanned pregnancy (no matter  what solution is chosen) and there is nothing moral about decisions that are  forced upon us. In my own case I know this to be true. My situation was painful  and serious enough without the added danger of illegal abortion as the only  alternative to carrying an unhealthy and possibly unsafe pregnancy to term. I  ache for women who are poor and alone, because they are the ones who will  suffer the most from the Supreme Court's most recent decision.  </P> <P> Because I was not coerced by lack of funds or government restrictions, I was  emotionally able to hear the answers to my prayers. With those answers I made  what was the most moral and loving decision -- for me and for the potential  human life I was carrying.  </P> <P> Thank you, Rev. Regas, for reminding us that women must be allowed to make  these most intimate decisions for themselves.  </P> <P> DOROTHY MAE WHITE  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

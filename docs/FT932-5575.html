			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / School heads jeer and hiss speech by Patten EVEN BEFORE he stood to speak Mr John Patten, the education secretary, knew he was in for a rough ride. Mrs Pat Partington, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, drew a round of applause when she said it had become 'almost an unusual event' for an education secretary to attend the conference of the association, which represents 31,500 heads and deputy heads in England and Wales. There was further applause from the 420 delegates when she told Mr Patten: 'We believe that many of the things that you are doing are wrong, unworkable and not properly thought out.' The first shouts of 'rubbish' came as Mr Patten defended his plans for national curriculum testing in English and Welsh schools this year, which are being boycotted by the three largest teachers unions. To abandon testing, he said, 'would leave parents, teachers and the wider community in the dark about our schools and how they are performing'. The reaction provoked Mr Patten into an unscripted remark that the tests were needed in open society. This was greeted by further jeers from the head teachers. The barracking continued at a more muffled level while Mr Patten announced a minor concession - next year's secondary school tests in England and Wales will be moved forward from June to May. There was derisive laughter when Mr Patten announced that he had said all he wanted to say about testing. Mr Patten then diverted from his script. He launched a defence of league tables of school results accompanied by growing laughter. Another shout of 'rubbish' greeted his assertion that 'without a testing regime and the publication of results, then neither government, taxpayers nor the wider community will have any idea what's happening in schools'. When Mr Patten spoke on teacher training there were more muffled jeers, but there was handclapping when he assured them: 'We shall want to listen to what you say.' He commented: 'I bet that bit's not on television tonight - someone applauding a secretary of state.' There was muted applause for a few seconds as Mr Patten resumed his seat. But he could not leave before Mrs Partington, head of a Nottinghamshire primary school, had administered another rebuke. 'We did not hear the message which will enable us to go back to our schools with optimism. Where there should be optimism I feel foreboding.' Shouts of 'Shame' greeted her announcement that Mr Patten would not take questions and Mr Patten left the hall to loud hissing. Delegates praised Mrs Partington as they left. 'She really destroyed him, that was beautiful, really fantastic,' said one headmistress. Afterwards Mr Patten said he was 'very sorry' to have received such a reception. 'I came here to make a major speech to the NAHT conference on teacher training.'</p>

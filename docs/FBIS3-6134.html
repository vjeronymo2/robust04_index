The trial run made on several occasions covered the  long distance from Mangyongdae District's Songsan to Sopyongyang  Stations passing by Potonggang District's Kwangbok, Red and  (Kyongun) Streets. All of the streetcar's operative functions  and spare parts operated smoothly in accordance with the  technological demand. The streetcar moved swiftly and this made  the people happy.    By upholding the party's intention of developing the  country's transportation and freighting system, and providing  safer and more comfortable transportation conditions, the  workers of the Kim Chong-tae electric locomotive general  enterprise highly manifested the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude to make a new type streetcar and  underground electric railcar in just 70 days. They also  successfully guaranteed the trial run of the streetcar and  underground electric railcar.    The streetcar was manufactured and completed safely in  accordance with the topography of the capital and the passenger  demand. According to the automatic operation of the streetcar,  all the electric equipment and damping devices were operated  smoothly from the first trial run.    In particular, the efficiency of the starting apparatus,  made  by introducing the structural method of the electric circuit in  accordance with our country's situation, was very good. This  made it possible for the traction electric motor's starter to  move freely, and firmly guaranteed its operation's reliability  and safety.    The underground electric railcar also had a successful trial  run covering many blocks. All the elements including the  traction part, electronic equipment, damping device, and buffer  device operated normally.    In the vigorous road of the overall march of socialism of  our  own style, our heroic working class magnificently produced a  modern streetcar and underground electric railcar through their  own strength, technology, and material, and successfully  guaranteed the trial run. This has made the mass production of  the vehicles possible to develop the country's transportation  and freighting system. It is also of great significance because  it provides safer and more comfortable transportation conditions  and cultivated living conditions for the people.    The streetcar and underground electric railcar, which will  actively contribute to displaying the might of the country's  self-dependent national economy and developing the capital's  transportation and freighting, will soon go into mass production.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi </F> Miyazawa by commentator Soichiro Tahara; place and date not  given: "Japan's Political Goals for 1994"]    [Text]After All, the Present Government Has Neglected  the Economy    [Tahara] It has been four months since you resigned your  post  as prime minister, has not it?    [Miyazawa] Yes, it has been.    [Tahara] You had been in a position to view the nation from  a  broader point of view. First of all, I want to ask your opinion  about the economy. If the present situation continues as it is,  Japan's business conditions will become worse than the serious  Heisei depression [as published], and some people are even  afraid that the Japanese economy might collapse. People used to  say that "Miyazawa is the economic expert." What is your  opinion about the current economic situation?    [Miyazawa] I understand the situation is so serious as to  require government intervention. In the spring of 1993, when I  was prime minister, I was expecting that a sign of the business  recovery might be seen around the beginning of fall, when the  inventory adjustment would be completed. To my regret, however,  the situation did not change for the better as I had expected.    Besides, although I myself was involved, there was  unexpected  political confusion. Although I thought that the confusion  would not have so much influence on the economy, it turned out  that the new government that was born to deal with the confusion  was a cabinet which places importance on political reform. The  new cabinet was not necessarily good with economic matters.  That is why the problem of the economy tends to be neglected.    [Tahara] Do you mean that the Hosokawa government is not  concerned about the economic problems?    [Miyazawa] As far as results are concerned, we should say  that the economic problems are being neglected. Because so many  different parties are allied together, it is natural that the  economy cannot be managed effectively. Besides, although we  experienced the cold summer and the strong-yen situation last  year, the government could not, after all, deal with the  situation effectively. In my opinion, this fact has created  distrust, which further created the violent fluctuations in the  stock market. I still believe in the persevering strength of  the Japanese economy. Honestly speaking, however, as far as the  present situation is concerned, it is not possible for me to  foresee when the situation will take a turn for the better.    [Tahara] I think I myself should be held responsible in that  the new government has given primary attention to political  reform. What measures do you think should have been taken?    [Miyazawa] Originally, it should have been possible to carry  out political reform and to grapple with the economic problems  at the same time. If there were indications that cold-weather  damage is likely to occur, the government should have taken  prompt action to meet the situation by preparing for the  disbursement of mutual aid funds and by making available  low-interest loans, etc. As to the strong-yen situation,  although there will be no quick remedy, the government at least  should have demonstrated its positive attitude in dealing with  the situation.    [Tahara] Speaking concretely, what do you think should be  done?    [Miyazawa] One of the measures that the government should  take now is drastic reduction of the income tax. The government  should by all means reduce the income tax, whether by 6 trillion  yen or 10 trillion yen. However, it is wrong to try to cover  the reduction with a consumption tax.    The change in tax revenues depends on the state of the  economy. After the Plaza Accord was reached in September 1985,  because of the sharp rise of the yen, Japan's economy  encountered never-before-experienced difficulties. This  situation occurred soon after I became finance minister, and I  thought the only way [to escape the difficulties] was to first  effect a tax cut, and then to cover the decrease in revenue by  issuing deficit-covering bonds. It took me two months to  persuade the executive officials of the Ministry of Finance, and  it also took another two months for the executive officials to  obtain the preliminary informal consent from within and outside  of the Ministry of Finance. Opposition against my idea was so  strong that we had to spend great amounts of time in persuading  persons. Consequently, there was a natural increase in tax  revenue -- 51 trillion yen -- in the six-year period from the  second year of the Plaza Accord to 1991, which means that  economy had been normalized to that extent. In other words, if  the economy starts to run well with a tax cut, this enables  corporations to go into the black and to pay corporate taxes.  Income taxes withheld at the source also will increase because  of the increase in hours worked and the resulting increase in  overtime pay. If the stock market becomes active, then  securities transaction taxes will increase. This is the natural  course. It is too hasty an idea to think that the consumption  tax should be increased by this many trillion yen because the  income tax was reduced by this many trillion yen. While this  should be an easy type of logic for an expert to understand, it  may be difficult for a person in a responsible post to make a  practical decision about.  <H5>  What Should Be Done With the Bad Bank Loans? </H5>   [Tahara] As you noted before, Hajime Funada, then director  general of the Economic Planning Agency, expressed his personal  belief in the spring of last year that "from now on [business  conditions] will show an upturn". Does this mean that you also  thought the same thing?    [Miyazawa] Yes. To my regret, however, there was no  business recovery, although we had taken urgent economic  measures in the amounts of 10 billion yen and 13 billion yen.    [Tahara] I understand that the urgent measures were taken in  the form of public investment. As to the depression that we are  presently experiencing, not only the government but also many  economists and executives have expressed incorrect predictions  again and again. Why do you think they have been wrong?    [Miyazawa] I think the major reason is that they did not  fully recognize the influence that the bubble economy had on  business enterprises, and particularly its influence on  financial institutions.    [Tahara] Do you mean that they underestimated the  consequences of the bubble economy?    [Miyazawa] Yes.    [Tahara] If that is the case, I should ask you what on earth  the bubble economy was. You were the finance minister when the  bubble economy began.    [Miyazawa] That was at the initial stage of the bubble  economy.    [Tahara] There are some indiscreet people who say that  Miyazawa is to blame for creating the bubble economy. What on  earth was the cause of the bubble economy?    [Miyazawa] When the Plaza Accord was concluded in September  1985, one dollar was equivalent to 240 yen. The exchange rate  rose to 200 yen at the end of the same year, and further rose to  150 yen in the summer of the next year when I assumed the post  of finance minister. It was really a sharp rise.    [Tahara] The exchange rate rose by 90 yen in less than one  year.    [Miyazawa] People thought this rate was by all means  unbearable to Japanese companies, so I effected urgent economic  measures, including the tax cut. I also had the official  discount rate reduced. Also, to moderate the strong-yen  tendency to the extent possible, I even bought dollars on the  open market at the rate of $1 billion per day. To buy dollars  means to sell yen, which means that so much amount of yen is  supplied to the public. In other words, with the supply of yen  becoming excessive, enterprises gradually became accustomed to  the strong-yen trend, and the surplus purchasing power created  under this situation was used to purchase stocks and land. Such  behavior seems to have brought about the unfavorable results.    I still wonder whether there was no better way to absorb the  surplus purchasing power. I suppose the Bank of Japan was also  trying to decide when to raise the official discount rate.  First of all, however, the anxiety that the strong-yen trend  caused to enterprises and the people was too serious. At that  time, the business world was in an extremely confused state,  with there being 10 job seekers for every two job openings.  Because the most important duty of politics is not to cause the  people anxiety, I believe that I should have applied a brake to  the situation. But, I still cannot clearly see what the best  point would have been [to apply a brake].    [Tahara] There is an opinion that [the authorities  concerned]  may have become excessively eager to control the bubble economy  and, as a result, may have destroyed the economy itself, thus  creating the present depression. In short, people are thinking  that [the authorities concerned] have frozen the flow of money  by making land transactions virtually impossible or by  unreasonably raising the official rate.    [Miyazawa] In the present situation wherein the Japanese  economy has become large and the people now realize how the  economy works, it seems difficult for the government and the  Bank of Japan alone to change the direction of the economy. In  such a situation, the authorities concerned are supposed to be  taking drastic measures to direct the economy. Although it may  be desirable if moderate measures can be found, it does not seem  so easy for this to be done.    [Tahara] Supposing you again became finance minister or  prime  minister at the time when the bubble economy collapsed, do not  you think you could find a better way to manage the economy?    [Miyazawa] I was asked the same question at the Diet, too,  and I asked myself that question again and again. To my regret,  however, I cannot think of any better policy which I might have  adopted in a certain situation. This might be a limit of my  ability.    [Tahara] At the beginning of this interview, you mentioned  that "risk management" would be necessary. At that point, there  was an idea of establishing a public organization to purchase  the unsalable lands held by banks as mortgaged properties. What  has become of that idea?    [Miyazawa] It was in August 1992 [that the idea was proposed  by the government]. At that time, with the slump in stocks, I  believed that if the situation worsened, the government should  then carry out risk management; I felt that something should be  done to avert the crisis, even if this meant the stock market's  being closed for one day. I consulted with some of the  officials concerned about my idea, including the idea you just  referred to.... I expressed my opinion that the government may  be officially involved in dealing with the bad loans held by  banks, that the banks may be allowed to write off part of their  bad loans as tax deductions, and that a special loan may be made  to the purchasing organization. I thought that the government's  intervention to that extent might be necessary to protect the  financial system itself.    [Tahara] Did you carry out your plan?    [Miyazawa] No, my idea was not realized as I intended. There  was strong opposition which claimed that the plan was intended  to save the banks.    [Tahara] Was there opposition?    [Miyazawa] The industrial circles asked, "Why should the  government help the banks to such an extent?" Also, as for  financial institutions, there were certain banks with less  exposure and certain banks with serious exposure. The banks  with less exposure felt that "While we can solve the problem  ourselves, it is regrettable to receive so much criticism from  the public", or "The government's policy is to save that and  that bank, and not to save us. It is ridiculous." It turned  out after all that the financial institutions improved the  situation by themselves.    [Tahara] I see.    [Miyazawa] This problem has not been solved yet. The problem  of bad loans held by financial institutions remains a big  problem at the base of the current depression. I still think  that public aid to a certain degree may be necessary to  normalize the present situation, which is excessively  constrained. There are examples of this in the advanced  countries.    [Tahara] There is an opinion that the current depression  might be pressing Japan to change its economic structure.  Drastic deregulation is considered necessary to establish an  economic structure guaranteeing free competition. Although I am  afraid I may be preaching Buddhism to Buddha, most of the  industries in which 50 million workers out of the 60 million  workers in Japan are employed are not related to exports and are  more or less affected by regulation. People think that while  the yen remains strong, domestic commodity prices remain  excessively high because regulations on these enterprises have  not been removed.    Also, it is considered necessary to convert the so-called  Japanese-type management to the U.S.-type management. There is  a strong opinion that under Japanese-type management, business  enterprises are holding onto too many unprofitable divisions and  unnecessary workers, which should be totally slashed. Voices  are increasing that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] may also  be held partly responsible in this respect. What is your  opinion on this point?    [Miyazawa] It is really a problem of the Japanese  distribution system that consumers do not benefit from the  strong-yen trend. It is also true that the natural operation of  an economy based on the supply-and-demand relationship is being  disturbed by the delay in removing the regulations. I think the  present cabinet was correct in grappling with the problem by  setting up the Hiraiwa Commission, although I do not think that  this has produced an immediate effect.    It is also true that the economic situation in the United  States has been improved by what we in Japan call restructuring  or by what they call downsizing in the United States -- that is,  by carrying out a drastic cutback in employees. In his recent  book titled "The Postcapitalist Society," Peter F. Drucker  expresses the opinion that the future society will be a  thoroughly knowledge-oriented society and that those elements  other than knowledge should be excluded from enterprises. He  means that the excluded corporate units should be used in  medium-sized and small enterprises which specialize in such  fields. In fact, downsizing is rapidly being carried out in the  United States in line with his philosophy.    [Tahara] Japanese capitalism has been a capitalism based on  the production of goods. There are prevailing opinions that  such a type of capitalism is outdated and therefore should be  changed to a structure aiming at knowledge-intensive industries.  Furthermore, there is an opinion that Japanese-type management,  meaning the lifetime-employment system, is merely an illusion  and that the original capitalism means slashing unnecessary  workers, just as we slash unnecessary things.    [Miyazawa] We should note, however, that Drucker himself is  of the opinion that what is meant by "a drastic intellectual  society" is still unknown. I think it means "human beings."    [Tahara] You think intelligence is symbolized by human  beings.    [Miyazawa] In the case of our country, the  lifetime-employment system makes it possible to give advanced  training to employees. It is not worthwhile to spend money on  them if they move to other enterprises.    [Tahara] Then your opinion is that although the terms  "lifetime employment" and "seniority" may sound old-fashioned  today, what they really mean is that "human being should be  respected," is that not it?    [Miyazawa] That is right.    [Tahara] Under U.S.-type management, although capable  persons  are promoted to responsible posts, incapable persons are not  promoted and tend to fall behind. Do you think that is a wrong  system?    [Miyazawa] No, I do not think so. Each country has its own  tradition. Perhaps it would be impossible for Americans to live  in Japanese society, where the rule of seniority and the  lifetime-employment system apply. In the United States, a  success story is created by a capable person making a sudden  rise from obscurity and earning a high salary while moving  freely from company to company.    However, the same principle does not apply in our country.  For Japanese enterprises, teamwork has been supposed to be the  best way to operate in the business world, and, in the case of  Japan, I suppose it will also be the best way in the future.  <H3>  Participation in the United Nations Force Is Also Not  Permissible </H3>   [Tahara] Let me change the subject. If there were things  you left undone as prime minister, what would they be?    [Miyazawa] Though I am afraid my reply may sound haughty, I  am very confident that, except for political reform, I was, in  general, able to show ideal guidelines in carrying out domestic  and foreign affairs. First, it was my philosophy that Japan  should not become a military superpower. Also, I made it a  fundamental policy in carrying out internal affairs that an  affluent community and a quality-of-life superpower should be  created before the aging society emerges. My fundamental policy  in carrying out diplomatic relations was to make contributions  to the extent possible in order to build up a new order of peace  after the Cold War.    [Tahara] Let me ask a question on this point. What type of  country are you thinking of when you talk about a military  superpower?    [Miyazawa] ... [ellipses as published]    [Tahara] For instance, in his book titled "A Plan To Rebuild  Japan [Nihon Kaizo Ron]" Ichiro Ozawa says that "Japan should  become an ordinary country." Perhaps, by the expression `an  ordinary country' Ozawa must be referring to the United Kingdom  and France, and not the United States. In case the order of  world peace is disturbed somewhere, Japan should contribute to  restoring order. It seems to be his idea that, if the existing  Self-Defense Forces are not to be mobilized, it may be necessary  to organize a United Nations Force and to have the Self-Defense  Forces join it. Do you think this is a military superpower?    [Miyazawa] In my opinion, the only thing Japan should not do  is to use military power outside the country.    [Tahara] Do you mean Japan should not participate in the  United Nations Force?    [Miyazawa] My fundamental philosophy is that, under any  circumstances, and even if requested by the United Nations,  Japan should not exercise its military power abroad.    [Tahara] If, for instance, an incident similar to the  Persian Gulf crisis takes place, the world might again request  that "Japan contribute not only with money, but also shed  blood." Do you still think Japan should not participate in the  United Nations Force in such a situation?    [Miyazawa] No, that is not permissible. I also discussed  the matter with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali in February  last year, and he expressed his opinion that "the role of the  United Nations is not only to maintain peace which, as was the  case in Cambodia, has already been secured, but it should also  create peace through intervention in the area where disputes are  taking place." To his opinion, I replied that "in the past,  Japan committed errors under the flag of absolute justice. It  will require considerable time before we are convinced that all  the judgments made by the United Nations are correct."    Later, the Somalian incident took place. Though the action  of the United Nations might have been based on good intentions,  it turned out that, after all, the United Nations became the  enemy of all the Somalian people. The U.S. forces also have to  withdraw in March. An even more severe situation is being  created in Yugoslavia. I feel, therefore, that the people are  beginning to realize that they should not easily agree with the  opinion that Japan may also take part in such an activity so  long as it is carried out under the UN flag.    [Tahara] Yet, is it not possible that, as was the case in  the Persian Gulf war, Japan may be despised by the world, or  treated as an outsider, for not taking part in the UN activities?    [Miyazawa] It is true the Japanese people are beginning to  regret that Japan only contributed money without shedding blood.  It was under such a situation that the PKO [Peacekeeping  Operations] Law was enacted to show the limit of Japan's  contribution. Though I sincerely feel sorry that two Japanese  people died in Cambodia, I take pride in myself that, by playing  Japan's role to its limit, I clearly showed that Japan could not  go beyond this limit.    We have our own way of thinking, and we have our own  philosophy contained in the Constitution. I do not want to let  the United Nations make decisions for us.    [Tahara] The call for Japan to carry out concrete  operations to help maintain international order, even if it  means revising the Constitution, is growing louder. However,  you are opposed to this, and perhaps Gotoda is also of the same  opinion. Why are you so strongly opposed to the idea?    [Miyazawa] In the past, we exercised military power abroad  in the name of humanity. The people also believed it. Today,  however, the reason for our action seems doubtful. There is  even a prime minister who says we should apologize for our  action as it was an act of invasion. In such a situation it is  not easy to determine whether or not our action can be  justified. The United Nations made the same mistake in Somalia,  did it not? Secretary General Butrus-Ghali himself has  virtually admitted "it was a mistake."    [Tahara] In short, were you against the Persian Gulf war?    [Miyazawa] No, I think the war was justifiable in itself.    [Tahara] If you admit that the war was justifiable in  itself, does it not mean that it was alright for other countries  to take part in the war, but that Japan did not want to be  involved in it?    [Miyazawa] In the case of the Persian Gulf war, it was  apparent that Iraq invaded Kuwait, and the war was ended at an  early stage because of the decisive difference between the  powers involved. However, the disputes in Yugoslavia and  Somalia that took place later have not been, despite the United  Nations trying to help the situation. Therefore, we should  realize that it is not so easy to help other countries.    [Tahara] Then, suppose a second Persian Gulf war breaks out,  what do you think Japan should do?    [Miyazawa] That will be the very opportunity for us to take  action within the limit we are allowed under existing laws.    [Tahara] Yet, when the Persian Gulf war broke out, the Cold  War structure was in its last stage, with the United States and  the USSR playing the role of world police. Therefore, it was  possible to repel Iraq under the leadership of the United  States. However, if such a situation takes place in the future,  which country do you think can take the responsibility in the  post-Cold War world? Are we to totally leave [that country] in  the lurch?    [Miyazawa] As you mentioned, it is very clear that the  United Nations is not able to fully deal with the disputes which  are frequently taking place here and there throughout the world.  If your question is about what should be done in such  situations, I say that the only way for us is to help the United  Nations grow to be an organization capable of dealing with such  situations.    [Tahara] The disputes you are referring to -- the situations  in Somalia and Yugoslavia -- are what we may call civil wars.  However, if an apparent act of invasion takes place, as was the  case when Iraq occupied Kuwait, by which country and in what  form do you think the situation should be dealt with?    [Miyazawa] The ideal form is for the United Nations to be  equipped with its own military forces to suppress disputes.  That seems to be the fundamental way of dealing with disputes.    [Tahara] How do you think Japan should take part in such UN  activities?    [Miyazawa] I think it is quite alright for the Japanese  people to voluntarily take part in UN activities as  international public officers. In such a case, they should, by  all means, work as international public officers, and their  activities should not be regarded as use of force by Japan.    [Tahara] Is it not permissible to take part in UN activities  by forming an organization separate from the Self-Defense Forces?    [Miyazawa] I do not think it is permissible, since such  activities bring about the same responsibility to the nation.    [Tahara] During the Cold War era, both the West and the East  were respectively conscious they had a strong enemy in the other  side. Such an age has come to an end, and we should establish a  new world order after the Cold War. What kind of a vision do  you think the world should have? I think a more concrete vision  might have been presented if the Miyazawa government continued  for a slightly longer period.    [Miyazawa] It may be that the whole world is in agony  without knowing which direction to take. Basically, it is  important for every country in the world to be convinced that it  should not resort to war to benefit itself. Also, it is  important that, based on the interpretation of the respective  countries, each country places importance on democracy, a  commonly shared sense of value, on human rights, and on freedom.  It is desirable to exert ourselves to take such a direction.  <H5>  Comments on "A Plan To Rebuild Japan" Written by Ichiro Ozawa </H5>   [Tahara] By the way, referring to the LDP, I think that in  the past Japanese politics was carried out in the form of a sumo  match between the LDP as a grown-up man and the nongovernment  parties as a child. Whether it was the consumption tax or the  PKO issue, the nongovernment parties opposed everything, and the  LDP steered Japan by coaxing, persuading and intimidating them.  However, it seems the LDP has become a child the moment it left  power. Looking at the discussions involving the election system  reform, we do not quite understand what the LDP wants to say.  The party seems just like a fretful child.    It is not very clear what kind of an identity the LDP is  going to create, and what action the party is going to take.    [Miyazawa] I think the existing coalition cabinet is the  cabinet to realize political reform. To attain this purpose,  each party has shelved its own fundamental policies and public  promises, claiming that, as long as important matters are  concerned, it is going to succeed LDP policies. Though it is  important to carry out political reform, there are many other  things assigned to everyday politics. Therefore, should  everyday politics be neglected, problems tend to take place such  as the problem involving Nakanishi, ex-director-general of the  Defense Agency, and the confusion concerning the liberalization  of rice, and it seems natural that the people criticize the  government for totally neglecting the economic problems.    In this situation, it seems the duty of our party, as a  nongovernment party, to meet the needs of the people by pointing  out [the problems of the government]. Though, in certain cases,  it is inevitable for us to criticize the government parties, I  believe it is our duty to do so.    [Tahara] When I interviewed you while you were in the post  of prime minister, you referred to the 15 May incident [a coup  that took place on 15 May 1932 with young radical Navy officers  taking the initiative], and said that it was not a desirable  phenomenon for the country that such an incident should take  place. I vividly remember your comment. In the world today,  there is an increasing number of people who are beginning to  feel that the economic situation is not good; that the political  situation is unstable; and that the world situation surrounding  Japan is unstable; and that, under these circumstances, Japan is  going to enter a dark age similar to that of the beginning of  Showa [from the mid-1920's]. What is your opinion on this point?    [Miyazawa] It may be partly because I am an optimist by  nature, but I think it an important factor for social stability  that freedom is being guaranteed. It is also important that the  standard of living and the level of income do not differ so  much. As such fundamental conditions are being satisfied in  Japan today, it is not likely that a furious social anger will  explode, taking the form of the 15 May incident.    [Tahara] Yet, reading "A Plan to Rebuild Japan" written by  Ichiro Ozawa, we realize that he is concerned about Japan.  Ozawa repeatedly emphasizes the significance of leadership. He  believes that stronger leadership should be exercised in making  decisions. What do you think of Ozawa's patriotism?    [Miyazawa] I think his is also a free opinion. In short, he  is warning that Japan is not an "ordinary nation".    [Tahara] We may call it his irritation.    [Miyazawa] Yes, I agree. In my case, as I have lived a  little longer, the period of 50 years does not appear to be so  long a period. I rather strongly feel that we should not make  the same mistake again. Reischauer is of the opinion that the  country named Japan tends to be led in the wrong direction  whenever a leader with strong power emerges. In a world with  developed mass media such as we see today, it will be relatively  easy to control the people through the media if there is someone  who intends to do so. I feel it is dangerous to create such a  situation as the Japanese nation is, in a sense, very uniform.    It is true that, 50 years from now, an opinion similar to  that of Ozawa may be considered sensible. As for me, however, I  would like to say that, in the case of Germany, the country has  committed the same mistake twice.  NNNN</p>

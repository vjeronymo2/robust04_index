			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of the preliminary determination, we determine that glycerine and caproyl alcohol are not by-products. The value of glycerine for two of the four factories and the value of caproyl alcohol for all four factories is significant compared to the relative value of all of the products manufactured as a result of or during, the process of manufacturing sebacic acid. The reason why we find that glycerine should not be considered as a by-product is because we conclude that the quantity of production of this product appears subject to manipulation by management based on the variation in the quantity yield among the four factories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we allocated the factor inputs, e.g., materials, used to produce glycerine and caproyl alcohol, by the relative quantity of output of these two products and sebacic acid. We did not allocate the amount of labor, energy usage or factory overhead among the products because we did not have the information to allow us to make accurate adjustments ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> concurrence memorandum, dated December 27, 1993, for further discussion).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Best Information Available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's policy, as set forth in Lock Washers, is that all potential exporters owned by a given entity must cooperate in our investigation in order for the response to be considered complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MOFTEC did not submit a consolidated questionnaire response on behalf of all PRC exporters of sebacic acid. As noted above, the list of PRC exporters of sebacic acid submitted by MOFTEC contained the names of firms which have not responded to the Department's antidumping questionnaire. Since the Department must receive an adequate questionnaire response from each entity to which a separate dumping rate can be applied, all non-responding entities must receive a PRC country-wide rate. In the absence of adequate questionnaire responses from the other exporters of sebacic acid, we have based PRC country-wide rate on BIA. Section 776(c) of the Act provides that whenever a party refuses or is unable to produce information requested in a timely manner and in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation, the Department shall use BIA. We have done so in this investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology based on the degree of respondents' cooperation. According to the Department's two-tiered BIA methodology, when a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company the higher of (a) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation. This methodology for assigning BIA has been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Allied-Signal Aerospace Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993); see also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Krupp Stahl AG et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993).) Because some PRC exporters refused to answer the Department's questionnaire, we find that they have been uncooperative in this investigation. As BIA for these exporters, we are assigning the highest margin provided in the petition (243.40) as the PRC country-wide rate, in accordance with the two-tiered BIA methodology under which the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon those respondents who refuse to cooperate or otherwise significantly impede the proceeding. No adjustments were made to petitioner's calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

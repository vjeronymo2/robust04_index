			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / The storm abates for UK property: Vanessa Houlder reports on claims that values will soon recover Over the past two years, a hurricane has raged in the UK commercial property market. Some Pounds 70bn - more than a quarter of the total - has been knocked off the value of shops, offices, factories and warehouses around the country. Now the storm may be abating. 'The property market appears to have reached its turning point,' says Hillier Parker, a firm of chartered surveyors which continually monitors the mood of the market. 'The investment market is improving faster than expected,' says another surveyor, Savills Commercial. 'The sharpest positive movements in the IPD Monthly Index since October 1989 suggests a return of investor confidence,' says the Investment Property Databank, a research company. Bargain hunters are sifting potential acquisitions. 'Conditions like these come round once or twice in a generation,' says Mr Matthew Oakeshott, a director of OLIM, a fund management group. But confidence is fragile. For every bull, there is a bear; and even optimists qualify their enthusiasm with caveats about the importance of selecting the right location and tenant. While pockets of retail and industrial property are looking robust, values of Central London offices are still falling fast. The bulls' case rests on the level of property yields, the ratio of annual income to capital value, which have reached record heights over the past couple of years. When compared with yields of less than two-thirds their current level in the early 1980s, this can be interpreted to mean that property is very cheap. Buyers are further encouraged by signs that yields have started to fall in the autumn, reflecting the reduction in interest rates and an improvement in investor confidence. But those expecting a cyclical rebound may be disappointed. Some commentators wonder whether the market will ever be quite the same again. Mr Geoff Marsh, head of Applied Property Research, a research company, believes that the market is undergoing a fundamental restructuring. 'This is not a conventional cycle,' he says. Indeed, the very elevation of yields suggests that the market is in uncharted territory. For the first time in 30 years, property yields are converging with long dated gilt yields, according to the Investment Property Databank. This is a throwback to the years before inflation became a threat to investors. In those days, gilts traded at lower yields than property, because they carried less risk. Once inflation became a way of life, property became a better bet than gilts because it held out the prospect of real rental growth. Now, as in the pre-inflation era, property yields are converging with those of gilts. This suggests that the prospects of rental growth for property are barely enough to compensate for the risks, management effort and maintenance costs of holding property. In part, it reflects waning support from property's traditional supporters, the UK institutions. Property, which used to be discussed in the same breath as equities and gilts, became less important during the 1980s. Disillusioned with the relatively poor performance of property, fund managers shifted money into the new option, international equities. The crash of the last two years has further undermined property's traditional virtues, stability and counter-cyclical performance. The difference between the property crash and the equity crash of 1987 was its extended nature rather than its severity. And far from being counter-cyclical, the peak of the property market in August 1988 coincided with the high point of the economic boom. But the main reason for high yields is visible to anybody who looks out of a window, especially in London. The surge in construction in the late 1980s, combined with the recession, has left thousands of 'To Let' boards outside shops and offices. In the City of London, one of the worst affected markets, nearly one in five offices is empty. This surplus space is giving new power to tenants, after decades in which landlords have dictated terms. The 25-year lease, with upward-only increases in rents every five years, is seen as restrictive by many large tenants, who would favour an opportunity to break a lease at 10 or 15 years. 'The only real way to set a rent is when both parties can walk away from each other,' says Mr Mike Ruddell, who is head of property at Boots the Chemist. It may be that this shift in the balance between tenant and landlord lasts only as long as the surplus space remains on the market. If, however, shorter leases are here to stay, it will change the nature of property investment. Instead of tucking away a property like a bond, investors will need to woo tenants and manage their property more actively to maintain its value. Skilled landlords may be able to preserve their rental income, but the reduced security of the investment will force an increase in yields. In a recent survey by Chesterton, the chartered surveyors, Japanese investors believed that yields should increase by at least 1.5 per cent to compensate for the reduction in a lease from 25 years to 10 years. Another source of pressure on values is the imbalance between buyers and sellers. An enormous amount of property needs to find a buyer over the next few years, if the Pounds 40bn of loans outstanding to the UK property sector is any guide. At present, it is not clear where the demand will come from. Many potential buyers, such as property companies and Japanese investors have retreated, although their place has been partly filled by new buyers, particularly from continental Europe. Furthermore, the UK institutions, led by the Scottish funds, are gradually going back into the market, particularly for retail and industrial developments. But it is hard to see the institutions rescuing the over-borrowed property industry as they did in the last serious property crash. 'In similar circumstances in 1974, pension funds and insurance companies stepped in to fill the gap. Twenty years later institutional demand for property assets is no longer so fresh and the size of the problem is a far greater challenge,' according to Debenham Tewson, chartered surveyors. The twin depressants of poor investment demand and poor occupier demand will probably continue to dog the market next year. One forecast by brokers BZW (who are among the most bearish analysts) suggests that capital values will fall by another 6 per cent in 1992. The pessimists believe that a slight hardening of yields will fail to compensate for a fall in average rents. Economic recovery will not necessarily feed swiftly into enhanced demand: after the last recession it took at least four years for a recovery in rents. So it is premature to call the turn for the property market as a whole. But this does not mean that individual property buyers are wrong. Both the difficulty of acquiring good property in a rising market and the different prospects of various parts of the market make it worth sorting the wheat from the chaff. There is a world of difference between a high yielding building let on an inexpensive rent on a long lease to a financially strong tenant, and an old fashioned, poorly located building with a financially-stretched tenant. The best properties, with good, secure income, are in high demand. For example, industrial property, which commands a high yield, actually rose in value in 1991. The snag is that this rise in value only applies to a small proportion of the property market: perhaps as little as 15 per cent of the typical portfolio, estimates BZW. That excludes a lot of buildings: old buildings which do not meet the needs of modern businesses; or new buildings in obscure places which may never find a tenant. Even if the eye of the property hurricane has passed, dark clouds still hang over much of the market.</p>

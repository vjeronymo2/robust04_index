			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: A NIGHT AT THE BALLET  </P> <P> If you think attending a ballet is just too daunting, tonight may be a chance  to prove otherwise.  </P> <P> The Dorril B. Wright Cultural Center in Port Hueneme is welcoming the Royal New  Zealand Ballet, performing "Coppelia" for one night only.  </P> <P> Embarking on their first U.S. tour, the 40-member company has toured  extensively in Europe and Australia.  </P> <P> "This particular production is very easy to follow for the ballet layman,"  Denis Murrin, director of the cultural center, said. "It's really an accessible  piece."  </P> <P> Written in the late 1800s, the story follows a doll maker whose masterwork is a  mechanical, life-size female figurine, so lifelike it fools the township as it  frolics from an outdoor balcony.  </P> <P> However, "the plot is not the integral part to this ballet," Murrin said, "The  beauty of this performance is the choreography, dancing and music."  </P> <P> The production will be staged at 8 p.m. The cultural center is at 575 Surfside  Drive, Port Hueneme. Tickets are $20. Call 986-6598.  </P></p>

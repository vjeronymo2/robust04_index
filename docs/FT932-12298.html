			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Superdrug intensifies high street price war SUPERDRUG intensified its price war against rival high street retailers yesterday by announcing an immediate 25 per cent price cut on two-thirds of all branded sun-care products sold in its 680 shops. Prices of the remaining third of such products will be reduced by a quarter in the next few weeks. The price cuts will remain in force through the summer. This latest shot in the sun-care products market battle - worth Pounds 110m at retail prices - follows Boots' April 24 attempt to obtain an injunction preventing Superdrug, a part of the Kingfisher group, selling its rival's new Solait range of products. Boots said that Superdrug's Solait was in several respects an imitation of its own sun-care range, called Soltan. A legal hearing to decide on the injunction is likely in the next few weeks. Profit margins on sun-care products, like brand-name perfumes, are as high as 50 per cent in some retailers. The sun-care price war extends that being fought out between Superdrug and Boots on fine fragrances. In April 1992 Superdrug made a formal complaint to the Office of Fair Trading about alleged restrictive pricing and supplies in the brand-name perfume market. The OFT referred the matter to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission, which is expected to rule by September. Superdrug said yesterday that its experience was that consumers bought much more perfume when it brought down the retail price - by between 15 per cent and 50 per cent - in the approach to last Christmas. Superdrug said it had achieved a 1.5 per cent market share in the fine fragrance market - worth a total Pounds 450m at retail prices - last year. It is aiming at similar target in the sun-care market.</p>

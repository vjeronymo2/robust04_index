Reporters were turned away from the talks at a hotel in the  north Mogadishu enclave of General Aidid's enemy self-styled  interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed.    The secretary of the meeting, Mohamed Hassan, declined to  give details on progress at the talks, bringing together members  of Aidid's Habr Gedir sub-clan and Ali Mahdi's Abgal under the  chairmanship of a prominent Islamic leader, the Imam of Hirab,  without UN involvement. He said the participants, traditional  clan leaders and elders rather than warlords such as Aidid and  Ali Mahdi, would issue a statement when the meeting concluded  "in a couple of days."    Ahmed Darman, a member of the central committee of Aidid's  Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction, confirmed that Habr  Gedir representatives were attending. "The talks have been  going on over the past month in order to create an atmosphere of  understanding among the sub-clans," Darman told reporters at the  SNA office in Aidid's south Mogadishu stronghold. "Both groups  are well represented on the basis of the sub-clans, not  political organisations," he said.    Fighting between Ali Mahdi's Abgal forces and Aidid's Habr  Gedir militia reduced much of central Mogadishu to rubble before  the first U.S. troops landed in December 1992 to end a famine  that killed an estimated 300,000 people.    Darman, a former Somali ambassador to the United States and  China, expressed optimism about the outcome of the talks. "I  don't think there will again be war in Mogadishu between the  Abgal and the Habr Gedir," he said.    Ali Mahdi, however, has repeatedly warned that civil war  will  engulf Somalia after U.S. troops leave in March. He has urged  the UN to keep peacekeepers here despite Aidid's insistence that  they must go.    Aidid, Ali Mahdi, and 13 other factional leaders agreed at  UN- brokered talks in March to form a transitional national  council to govern Somalia for two years until elections. But  the process was halted by Aidid's conflict with the United  Nations, which cost the lives of more than 70 peacekeepers  before the world body dropped efforts to arrest the warlord in  October. Further UN-sponsored peace talks sponsored in Addis  Ababa last month collapsed without agreement. African and  Western diplomats have since voiced mounting pessimism about the  likelihood of a negotiated settlement.    Darman said the current clan meeting signalled a new  initiative, together with talks he said were going on in Nairobi  between Aidid and representatives of a group of 12 factions that  oppose him, led by Ali Mahdi.    Darman said eight senior SNA officials with Aidid in Nairobi  had been negotiating for two or three days with eight delegates  from the group of 12 led by Abdullahi Yusuf, leader of a faction  that controls northeast Somalia.    Sources close to Ali Mahdi said he was in daily contact by  telephone with General Abdullahi, whose Somali Salvation  Democratic Alliance belongs to the group of 12. But Ali Mahdi  himself was not immediately available to confirm that talks were  being held.    Darman said an agreement on Somalia's political future had  nearly been reached in Nairobi, but the 12 had backed out at the  last moment.    The head of the UN Operation in Somalia, Jonathan Howe,  seemed unaware of the clan talks in Mogadishu, but stressed that  "there's a lot of dialogue going on."    "It's a Somali process," he said Wednesday in remarks seen  as  a shift by the UN towards playing a less directive role in  brokering the restoration of civilian authority in Somalia,  without a government since the 1991 overthrow of former ruler  Mohamed Siad Barre.</p>

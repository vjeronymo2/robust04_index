			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Russia pledges metals for cash after court freezes accounts THE RUSSIAN government is desperately trying to raise cash by pledging as collateral metals in its strategic stockpiles. A central bank official said yesterday the government was offering foreign traders 'everything including rare earths and aluminium'. A western metals trader said his company had been asked to advance Dollars 45m (Pounds 30m) by tomorrow against cobalt and nickel from the country's strategic stocks. 'We are ready to do this but we want to make sure what we get is not devalued by similar deals with other traders,' he said. Rare earths are used by the petroleum, glass, ceramics and metals industries. The move follows a Luxembourg court decision last week to freeze more than Dollars 250m held in foreign bank accounts by Russian ministries, trading associations and the central bank itself. The accounts were frozen at the request of Switzerland's privately owned Compagnie Noga d'Importation et d'Exportation, which went to court to recover Dollars 250m in debts, plus damages, from the Russian government. Mr Nessim Gaon, Noga's chief executive officer, said yesterday: 'We cannot get any sense from anybody. I've wasted six months on Moscow and I was forced to take action by banks (I owe money to) . . . They've got to understand we are not a government but a private company.' He said the debts included Dollars 250m for veterinary goods and soya meal supplied in contracts concluded from 1991 to 1993. The goods were being paid for with oil until Russia stopped the shipments. Mr Gaon said negotiations had been dragging on since December. Russian offers of a settlement had not materialised. These even included a proposal to sell Noga debt owed to the former Soviet Union by Nigeria. The deal fell through after Moscow failed to get the consent of the Nigerian authorities. The Luxembourg court is due to sit on July 5 to hear Russia's appeal against the judgment. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations, has claimed that Noga owed Russia damages for breaking off unspecified obligations. Mr Gaon, however, said the accusations against his company were 'just an afterthought'. Although Russia has accumulated arrears with a number of creditors and assets such as ships have been seized in retaliation, this is the first time a creditor has managed to win a freezing of bank accounts. This example of Russian debt difficulties combined with administrative chaos comes as the country is poised to gain a new Dollars 1.5bn loan from the International Monetary Fund and to negotiate billions of dollars in fresh western aid at next month's Group of Seven summit in Tokyo. Only last week, the Russian government claimed it had Dollars 1bn from its first IMF credit deposited with the Russian-owned Eurobank in Paris. One cabinet member, who said he had been trying to find out whether that money was being used, said: 'It's not quite clear who is responsible for what these days.'</p>

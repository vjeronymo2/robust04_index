			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Russian courtesy Sir, Efficiency and helpfulness are not the west's usual view of Russians. Nevertheless, my experience last week in St Petersburg certainly had traits of both. The night before travelling back to London I realised that I had lost my air ticket. Next morning I went to have the ticket replaced at the hotel travel agent. The agent phoned KLM and was told that the Hermitage Museum had reported that a ticket with my name on it had been found in the coat check area and was being held for me at the museum. I went to retrieve the ticket with the aid of a taxi driver who accompanied me all the way into the administration area of the museum. The whole process took about three-quarters of an hour. I doubt museum staff and taxi drivers in western cities would have bothered.

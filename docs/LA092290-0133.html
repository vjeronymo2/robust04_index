			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LA QUINTA WINS, STAYS UNDEFEATED  </P> <P> Even though they had won both games this season, La Quinta High School Coach  Roger Takahashi had been concerned about his team's slow starts in the two  contests.  </P> <P> Worry no more.  </P> <P> The Aztecs, behind the stellar passing of Donald Hopkins, improved their record  to 3-0 with a 24-12 nonleague victory over Western (1-2) on Friday night in  front of about 1,500 at Bolsa Grande High School.  </P> <P> Hopkins completed 12 of 21 passes for 270 yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> The senior quarterback came out throwing and combined with wide receiver Steve  Quach on a 77-yard pass play down the right sideline on his third pass attempt  for La Quinta's first score with 3 minutes 29 seconds left in the first period.  </P> <P> La Quinta increased the lead to 14-0 with 9:09 remaining in the second period  when senior tailback George Sanchez capped a 43-yard drive with a two-yard  plunge on second and goal from two yards out.  </P> <P> Western's one-dimensional offense, which centers around quarterback/kicker  Gilbert Brito, finally scored with 1:41 left before intermission on a five-yard  pass from Brito to Alfredo Villegas. Brito provided the key play in the drive  with a 50-yard run along the left sideline that moved the ball to the Aztec  17-yard line.  </P> <P> Villegas also scored the other Western touchdown on a 16-yard pass from Brito  with 6:20 to play. The scoring catches were the only two receptions Villegas  had on the night.  </P> <P> Before that, however, the Aztecs had added a 24-yard field goal by Mike Berg in  the third period and a 19-yard touchdown pass from Hopkins to running back  Walter Dawkins early in the final period.  </P> <P> Dawkins finished with six receptions for 134 yards and with 35 yards rushing.  </P> <P> Brito rushed for 140 yards in 16 carries and completed six of 19 passes for 85  yards and one interception.  </P> <P> "I think our offense is coming around. We are beginning to jell," Takahashi  said. "I'm very pleased with the way the offensive line played. It couldn't be  at a better time. We have some momentum going into league."  </P></p>

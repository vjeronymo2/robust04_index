They could not have meant it, after all.    For, it is difficult to believe that those who are aware of  the mores of international trade could seriously oppose the  decision. India accounts for less than 0.6 per cent of current  international trade, whereas the European Community and the US  share 40 per cent of world trade. Had India abstained, it would  have made little difference to the proceedings, except that the  marginal gains it has made would not have been available either.  In fact, staying out of the GATT negotiations would have created  many other problems for India.    For example, it would have meant India's withdrawal from the  economic mainstream of today's world which was not feasible as  it does not have the capacity to withstand such isolation. Thus,  joining the negotiations and trying to wrest the maximum  advantage out of it was the most sensible step on India's part.    The biggest advantage of acceding to the GATT treaty is that  a multilateral trading organisation (MTO) has at last been  formed to conduct international trade. In the absence of such a  framework, trade would have to be conducted bilaterally between  two countries in which the junle [as printed] law of "might is  right" would inevitably prevail. Trade can now be conducted on  the basis of well-defined rules which have to be followed by  both strong and weak trading partners. A rule-based system is by  and large predictable and this should stabilise international  trading.    So far, so good. However, while arriving at these broad  parameters, certain interests have been sacrificed which many  believe smacks of colonialism. The two biggest economic powers  in the world, the US and the EC, have virtually dictated terms.  The weakest economic entities, namely the developing world, have  had to concede the most.    This was painfully apparent in the penultimate stages of the  Uruguay Round of negotiations. Till the very last moment, the  fate of the talks was uncertain because the US and the EC could  not agree on some point. But once the two Big Brothers hammered  out a solution, the agreement was pronounced complete  irrespective of any remaining differences.    The US and the EC have even humbled the economic giant  Japan,  and forced it to concede to a series of their demands. The  country had to capitulate on the highly emotional issue of rice  imports. Again, Argentina had to agree to a kind of market  sharing arrangement for its principal exports, which are all  agrarian products like wheat and beef.    In its present form, the completed round provides some  relief  to India. The agreement stipulates the phasing out of the  Multi-fibres Agreement (MFA) and quotas for the export of  textile items to the developed world. This should take care of  India's interests to some extent. However, till the last moment,  the US had tried to stall the phasing out of the MFA and wanted  the period to be extended from 10 to 15 years.    As for the provisions of phasing out agricultural subsidies  and continuation of a subsidised public food distribution  system, fortunately, the levels of subsidies in the western  economies are so high that ours are just a fraction of theirs.  Hence, there should be no compulsion to lower farm subsidies  just to accede to the Dunkel draft.    India, of course, would have to abide by the stricter codes  of the agreement for the protection of patents and trade-related  intellectual property rights. No doubt, these would affect some  sectoral activities in India, like sections of the Indian drugs  industry. However, even in a worst case scenario, the impact  would be minimal. In the broader interests of the country, it  might be better to honour the intellectual property rights  because Indian entities could soon have some claims on them.    With the GATT accord taking final shape, what remains to be  seen is the fine print of the agreement and the way it is  implemented. For the ultimate test will be how "fairly" the  agreement is adhered to.</p>

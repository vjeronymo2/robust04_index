			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Medstone to Report Loss: Irvine-based Medstone International said Wednesday it  will post a loss for its third quarter ended Sept. 30 because of the voluntary  cessation of shipment of its lithotripters. The company stopped distribution of  the machines, which use shock waves to disintegrate kidney stones, because of  non-compliance with reporting and technical standards of the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration. The company, which did not specify its quarterly loss, said it  has received FDA approval to resume shipment of the equipment.  </P></p>

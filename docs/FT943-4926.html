			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Caribbean countries earn US favour Caribbean countries willing to provide 'safe havens' for refugees from Cuba and Haiti will be treated 'favourably' by the US, but no Caribbean government is being pressed into accepting the refugees, according to a US envoy to the region. 'It is obviously true that any country which helps by taking the boat people that our ships are picking up at sea is doing us a favour, and it's obviously true that any country that helps us out in that regard and helps these poor people . . . would be doing a humanitarian service,' said Mr George Jones, US ambassador to Guyana. 'Would that be favourably looked upon in Washington? Of course it would be.' Several opposition parties in the region have suggested that governments are being pressed by Washington into accepting boatpeople, and into providing troops as part of a planned US and allied invasion of Haiti. Mr Jones described these suggestions as 'absolutely' untrue. Several countries have agreed to accept varying numbers of Haitians, and have been asked by the US government to accept Cuban refugees. Dominica, St Lucia, Surinam, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British possession, have agreed to accept thousands. Several Caribbean countries also agreed last week to provide about 300 soldiers for a non-combat role in a likely US-led invasion of Haiti to remove that country's military rulers and reinstate the exiled president, Father Jean Betrand Aristide. Mr Ralph Maraj, Trinidad and Tobago's foreign minister, said there has been 'no arm-twisting at all'. Dame Eugenia Charles, prime minister of Dominica, said that, while her government was willing to grant 'safe haven' to Haitian refugees, it had not agreed to accept any Cubans. The administration in the Cayman Islands, a British dependency, says it is in danger of being overwhelmed by refugees.</p>

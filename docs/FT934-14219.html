			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: Credito Italiano sale expected in December THE PRIVATISATION of Credito Italiano, the commercial bank 67 per cent owned by Iri, the state holding company, is expected to begin in early December. The timetable has been firmed up following changes approved last week to Credito's statutes. They have been revised to include a 3 per cent ceiling on single shareholdings by new shareholders. The aim of the 3 per cent limit is to encourage as wide a share base as possible. Within the government there were contrasting views, and Professor Romani Prodi, head of Iri, was reported to have been pressing for a maximum 2 per cent block. The same ceiling will apply to Banca Commerciale Italiano, the second of Iri's large banks. The sale of Iri's 57 per cent stake in BCI is expected to begin next April. Credito's privatisation was announced in September 1992. The original intention was to organise a trade sale, but a month ago a share offer, including a portion reserved for foreign institutional investors, was agreed. In another privatisation development, Eni, the state oil concern, has appointed Rothschild to handle the valuation and flotation of its energy interests. The Rothschild brief indicates that the privatisation proposed by Eni chairman Mr Franco Bernabe is broader than initially envisaged.</p>

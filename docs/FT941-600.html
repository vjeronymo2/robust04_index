			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Copenhagen airport share offer oversubscribed The share issue to sell the Danish government's 25 per cent stake in Copenhagen airport was oversubscribed 3.3 times, the ministry of communications said yesterday. An indicative price of DKr285 to DKr315 was placed on the 2.25m shares on offer when the issue opened. The final offer price was fixed at DKr310 and the yield from the issue will be DKr697m (Dollars 106m). The shares will be listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange from April 11. All international bids will be honoured in full, as will domestic bids for less than 300 shares. Bids for more than 300 shares will receive 300 shares plus two thirds of the rest. Mr Henning Birch, chief executive of Topdanmark, the insurance group, resigned at the weekend after criticism of the group's performance from leading institutional shareholders and in the Danish media. He was replaced by Mr Kaj G. Schou, who has been in charge of the group's accident insurance company. Shareholder criticism of Topdanmark has centred on Top's acquisition of a regional bank, Aktivbanken, in 1989.</p>

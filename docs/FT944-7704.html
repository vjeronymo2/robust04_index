			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Heatwave warms electricity earnings - Utilities Interim profits at Japan's electric power companies were supported by the surge in electricity demand due to the heatwave which hit the country in the summer and the economic recovery. A rise in electricity demand for air conditioning helped the nine leading electric utilities, excluding Shikoku Electric Power, to post strong increases in recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax. The companies were hit last year by an unusually cold summer and cuts in electricity charges. Lower fuel costs due to the yen's appreciation compensated for depreciation charges and lost income from further electricity rate cuts. Lower interest rates helped cut debt service payments. Tokyo Electric Power said record temperatures led to a 10.3 per cent rise in the company's total electricity sales volume. The further cut in charges squeezed the company's earnings by Y46.4bn (Dollars 471m), but an increased sales volume covered the loss. For the second half, the company expects the cut in electricity fees to affect its sales by Y44bn, but forecasts full-year sales to rise 4.8 per cent to Y4,950bn on a 15.7 per cent increase in recurring profits. Kansai Electric Power saw its first increase in industrial demand in three years. Total electricity sales volume rose 10.2 per cent, the first double-digit increase since 1973. For the full year to March, the company forecasts a 17.8 per cent increase in recurring profits to Y130bn on a 5.4 per cent rise in sales to Y2,500bn. Chubu Electric Power said household demand for electricity rose 14.2 per cent and industrial demand increased by 2.9 per cent. The company revised upwards its initial full-year forecast. It now sees recurring profits rising 11 per cent to Y90bn on a 3.3 per cent increase in sales to Y2,020bn. Electricity sales volume at Tohoku Electric Power grew 9.1 per cent. The company posted a rise in both sales and profit for the first time in three years. For the full year, the company forecasts sales up 4.2 per cent to Y1,400bn on a recurring profit increase of 8 per cent to Y85bn.</p>

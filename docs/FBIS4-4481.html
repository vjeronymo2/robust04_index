			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The Diet on Friday night  enacted a 50-day provisional budget for fiscal 1994 with a  record outlay of 11.05 trillion yen to bridge the delay in Diet  passage of the full fiscal 1994 budget worth 73.08 trillion yen.    The stopgap budget, effective the same day, was to be  enacted  Thursday but approval by the House of Councillors was delayed  over opposition demands to summon a witness in connection with  stock transactions done in the name of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's father-in-law.    The upper house budget committee had deadlocked since  Thursday evening after the opposition Liberal Democratic Party  demanded that a stock consultant, who has said the stock deal  was Hosokawa's, be summoned to testify before the Diet as an  unsworn witness. Hosokawa said it was conducted by his late  father-in-law.    The ruling coalition had rejected but finally accepted the  opposition demand Friday. Shozo Fujiki told reporters Wednesday  that he arranged a 418 million yen loan for an aide of  Hosokawa's from a stock investment company to help finance the  purchase of 300 shares of telecommunications giant Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in 1986 just after NTT went  public.    The prime minister denied allegations that he personally had  a hand in the 1986 purchase of the NTT shares.    The provisional budget was submitted to the Diet last  Tuesday, approved by the House of Representatives on Wednesday  and was sent to the upper house the same day.    Deliberations by the lower house on the full budget have yet  to begin because the LDP and the Japanese Communist Party are  refusing to participate in the budget debates due to  dissatisfaction with Hosokawa's explanation concerning 100  million yen he says was a loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa  Kyubin trucking group.    The provisional budget earmarks 2.78 trillion yen in  spending  on public works, about 30 percent of outlays included in the  full budget, to finance works carried over from fiscal 1993 and  to cover the roughly estimated amount usually necessary during  the first 50-day period.    An outlay of 14 percent is included as a minimum requirement  for labor, operating and other administrative expenses to keep  the government functioning.    Among other major expenditures, the provisional budget  allocates 2.20 trillion yen in social welfare spending from  13.48 trillion yen in the full budget, and 3.65 trillion yen in  tax grants to local governments from the full 12.76 trillion yen.    On the revenue side, the ministry estimates 3.83 trillion  yen  during the 50-day period, including 1.22 trillion yen in tax  income and 2.47 trillion yen from bond issuance.    To cover the estimated revenue shortfall of 7.23 trillion  yen, the ministry plans to raise funds by issuing short-term  treasury bills.    The 50-day provisional period is the second longest in  postwar history -- matching those in fiscal 1987, 1989 and 1990  when Japan also compiled stopgap budgets.</p>

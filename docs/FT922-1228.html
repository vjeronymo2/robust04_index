			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Employees' lot dealt blow by Japanese court: Bosses can restrict holiday time THE Japanese Supreme Court yesterday rejected an appeal from a company worker who protested about his employers' attempts to cut short his holidays. The judgment was widely seen as a setback for efforts to cut working hours, reduce unpaid overtime and generally improve the lot of the Japanese company employee. Trade union organisations expressed dismay about the court's verdict, saying it went against the trend of current thinking. The case concerns Mr Toshiaki Yamaguchi, a journalist who covered science and technology for Jiji Press, a news agency. In the summer of 1980, he wanted to take a 32-day holiday, including 24 days' paid holiday, to go to Europe to study the nuclear industry. Jiji did not dispute Mr Yamaguchi's holiday entitlement, but declined to allow him to take more than 15 days off consecutively. When Mr Yamaguchi took 30 days off, he was reprimanded and fined with a cut in his winter bonus. Mr Yamaguchi claimed Y750,000 (Pounds 3,190) in compensation and took his claim to the courts. When the Tokyo District Court rejected his claim, he appealed to the High Court, which upheld his suit and ordered Jiji to pay Mr Yamaguchi compensation. The court ruled Mr Yamaguchi had a right to take a long holiday. It noted Mr Yamaguchi's absence did not disrupt the work of his section since he had made efforts to arrange for other journalists to cover for him. But the Supreme Court yesterday cancelled the compensation order, saying that the timing of a long holiday should be decided at an employer's discretion. Employees who planned long holidays should take their employers' interest into account in deciding the time and length of long holidays, said the court. If they did not, an employer had the right to intervene and instruct an employee to change his plans. Jiji had not exercised this right unreasonably. The court sent the case back to the High Court for further deliberation. Commenting on the case, Nikkeiren, a leading employers' federation, said the judgment 'couldn't have been better', since it confirmed that employees were required to consult employers if they planned long holidays. But Mr Seigo Yamada, secretary general of Rengo, a trade union confederation, said the judgment ignored the fact that an individual's will should be treated with maximum respect as far as the timing and duration of holidays was concerned. Mr Yamaguchi, who still works for Jiji, said the Supreme Court had lost an opportunity to establish that Japanese had the right to take long holidays like westerners. He said he had taken a month-long holiday every year and would continue to do so until he retired. Most Japanese company workers would be delighted to take holidays even half as long as Mr Yamaguchi's. Large Japanese companies, including financial and industrial groups, allow staff an average of 15 days' paid leave a year. But employees are so busy that they take only an average of eight days' holiday. The law protects workers' rights to take paid holidays, but many people surrender their entitlements 'voluntarily' for fear of pressure from colleagues. For similar reasons, workers 'voluntarily' count sick leave as holiday. Japan will go to the polls on July 26 in nationwide elections for the upper house of parliament, the government announced yesterday, Reuter adds from Tokyo. It will be the first big electoral test for Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who took office last November. His Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will be looking to do better than in 1989 when, with sex and corruption scandals tainting the cabinet and party leadership, it lost control of the upper house for the first time since 1955. But the conservative, pro-business LDP, in unbroken power now for 37 years, retains its stable majority in the more powerful lower house.</p>

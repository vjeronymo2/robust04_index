			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Italian cabinet sets March date for watershed election President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro bowed yesterday to popular pressure for a complete renewal of Italy's political establishment and dissolved parliament less than 20 months after the country's last general elections. New elections to be held on March 27 - the date set by the cabinet - will mark a sharp break with Italy's post-war political traditions. The scale of the uncertainties ahead led President Scalfaro to use his constitutional powers to the limit in not accepting the resignation of Mr Carlo Ciampi, the prime minister, last Thursday. In the interim Mr Ciampi will govern as caretaker prime minister. The introduction of electoral laws which adopt a first-past-the-post system for 75 per cent of the parliamentary seats will move Italy away from the post-war era of fragmented multi-party politics towards a limited number of large groupings. The weakened status of the traditional parties, discredited by corruption scandals, and new electoral laws mean the elections will be fought by untried political alliances. The centre ground, long dominated by the Christian Democrats, is in disarray. Only the former communist Party of the Democratic Left has in place a viable alliance which can muster about 40 per cent of the vote. President Scalfaro gave three reasons for dissolving the legislature. The most important, he said, was the 80 per cent vote in last April's referendum favouring electoral reform. Second was the outcome of the two sets of local elections in 1993. If these results were projected on to parliamentary polls the four-party majority backing the Ciampi government had less than 20 per cent of the vote. Finally, President Scalfaro said the series of corruption scandals had undermined both public confidence in, and the credibility of, the current political class. Editorial Comment, Page 13</p>

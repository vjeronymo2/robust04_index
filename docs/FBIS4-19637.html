			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Criticism of Washington"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- "It would come as no surprise if short-term  interest rates went up again in the United States," said Otto  Graf Lambsdorff, economic spokesman for the Bundestag's FDP  [Free Democratic Party] faction, following talks that he had  held in Washington and Japan. A 3-percent economic growth might  be achieved in the United States this year, "relatively free of  inflation," he said. But the U.S. Federal Reserve is worried  about the stability of the dollar in 1995. Lambsdorff expects  an increase in medium-term U.S. interest rates to prevent  inflation.    While satisfied with U.S. industrial policy, the FDP  politician sharply criticized Washington's trade and foreign  policy. The U.S. trend toward bilateral trade agreements is bad  news not only for Japan, Europe, and the developing countries,  but also for entire world trade, said Lambsdorff. He said he  hoped Washington would adhere to the GATT rules agreed upon in  Marrakesh last week.    In U.S. foreign policy, Lambsdorff fails to see not only a  clear line, but also persons who could develop such a line. In  this connection, he described the challenge posed by North Korea  as the greatest problem. "North Korea is not of sound mind," he  said.    Lambsdorff returned from Tokyo with the realization that  Japan is strengthening its investment efforts in Asia. Because  Japanese exports are no longer so dependent on the U.S. market  as they used to be, Japan is no longer so submissive in the  trade dispute with Washington. Although German industry has  "missed" the economic growth in Asia, Lambsdorff says "there is  a chance for us if we involve ourselves there seriously." This  chance is mainly the result of the fact that not all Asian  countries are happy about the economic expansion of the Japanese  there.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lotte Mejlhede and Mikkel Thrane: "Maria and the </F> Narcotics Billions"]    [Excerpts] Enormous sums are involved when political  leaders, dealers, police chiefs, the UN, Interpol, and ministers  discuss how to stop "the global narcotics threat." [passage  omitted]    No one knows the precise number of substance abusers in  Denmark, but from many sources it seems there are around 10,000  people who regularly use hard drugs such as heroin,  amphetamines, and cocaine. Some 4,000 of these reside in  Copenhagen. But the narcotics problem is no longer only a  big-city phenomenon. Drugs are appearing in even the smallest  villages. Most substance abusers make their living from  trafficking profits. According to Jorgen Green, director of the  Storstrom County Youth Center, abusers cost society 400 million  kroner annually for this activity. [passage omitted]    The narcotics trade is a billion [kroner] business. A  cautious estimate assumes an annual street sale of hard drugs  amounting to at least 1.5 billion kroner. In 1992, the police  and customs seized 38.5 kg of heroin, 21.5 kg of cocaine, and  73.6 kg of amphetamines. Around 150 million kroner is used for  fighting narcotics violations. In Copenhagen alone there are 170  police officers who are exclusively engaged with narcotics and  narcotics-related crime. Ninety percent of all telephone taps  deal with narcotics. Drug abusers are connected with 25-50  percent of all break-ins. Their damages cost insurance companies  at least 450 million kroner yearly. [passage omitted]    One-fourth of judges' time is devoted to trying people  charged with drug violations. Around 40 percent of the places in  Danish prisons are occupied by drug abusers and drug dealers.  They cost society annually around 350 million kroner. Only a  very small percentage of those charged are convicted pursuant to  the drug-kingpin paragraph [in the law code]. By far the most  have been put behind bars for small-scale pushing, or because  they have had small amounts of substances in their possession.  [passage omitted]    No one has a purview of the the total amount spent on  treatment and prevention. But a rough estimate would be around  at least 350 million kroner for the entire country. In the  municipality of Copenhagen, which houses approximately half the  country's treatment places, 64 million kroner have been  appropriated for counternarcotics efforts in 1994. In addition,  funds are being spent on ambulatory treatment in physician  offices and hospital inpatient treatment, and money for this  purpose is also being provided to privately operated care homes  and shelters.

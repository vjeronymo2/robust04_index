			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Property: Yorkshire grit will out WE NEED Yorkshire determination, I have often thought this summer when 'carry on failing' became the motto of the English cricket team. It is wise to buy a house there. If Yorkshiremen built it, it will not collapse. The large county, soon to be re-arranged yet again, has something for everyone. Industry and farming work side by side. It is easy to escape from a day at the mill to walk on the moors or in the dales. Edward Waterson, of estate agent Carter Jonas in York, says it sells two out of three houses in country areas to outsiders. Many come to work in Leeds, take to the life of North Yorkshire and quickly want to stay for good. Yorkshire is packed with places for expeditions, from spas to fishing ports such as Whitby with its unaltered, box-pewed church, complete with a pew for 'fallen women.' Palaces such as Vanbrugh's Castle Howard and Carr's Harewood House show how country houses took over the dominant role in the rural economy that Yorkshire's great abbeys - Fountains, Rievaulx, Selby and Bolton - enjoyed until Henry VIII dissolved them. Roman York (Eboracum) was Britannia's second city and in the Yorvik centre, beneath York's Coppergate shopping precinct, the pioneer of the now fashionable 'time cars' resurrects the Vikings, following the old idea of end-of-pier ghost trains. Centuries later, the grand public buildings and factories of Sheffield, Leeds and Bradford symbolised the industrial revolution. The University of York, a 1960s' foundation, is a leader in the subject of conserving historic buildings. Waterson says July was Carter Jonas's best month for several years in terms of offers for houses. The momentum has carried into August. But Tim Blenkin, of Blenkin &amp; Co. - Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's associate in York - is cautious, noting that some houses are still over-priced compared with what the same money will buy in Gloucestershire or Sussex. Why? 'People have deep pockets in Yorkshire, and are cannier with their money,' he says. 'There have not been the business repossessions or Lloyd's disasters, as in the south. People are not aware of how bad things have been. But we still have some teaching to do - that buyers want value.' Vendors holding out for late-1980s' prices are unlikely to achieve a sale. At Wagwood House in Sheffield, with eight acres, faith and commonsense were rewarded. Bagshaws sold it by auction for Pounds 535,000 after bidding began at a modest Pounds 200,000. High on the North Yorkshire moors, Rigg End at Hartoft, near Pickering, has 41 acres, superb views down the valley of the river Seven and fishing on the river. It is on offer from Rounthwaite &amp; Woodhead or Jackson-Stops at Pounds 425,000, down from Pounds 450,000 in June. In Malhamdale Scalegill, near Skipton, there is a converted mill deep in the valley, with three cottages (for holiday lets) and two turbines which could be restored to provide power. Blenkin asks for offers over Pounds 400,000. Meanwhile, Longside House at Ramsgill-in-Nidderdale, high up the daleside, is available from GA for Pounds 325,000. Savills is selling three houses at Pounds 325,000. One is a horsey property, Holden House Farm at Upper Batley, near Leeds. It has 11 loose boxes and is two miles from the M62 for escaping to Lancashire. The second is Woodclose House, at Pateley Bridge, between Ripon and Harrogate. The garden and garden wall, with battlements and turret, overlook Nidderdale. The third is Long Marston Hall, 17th century and listed Grade II, where either Cromwell or Fairfax (on the parliamentary side) had their headquarters before the battle of Marston Moor in July 1644. The 14th century Farnhill Hall also has a military link. It is a peel, or fortified, house with four towers at each corner of a great hall, built on high ground for protection against the Scots. In need of some work, it is listed Grade I and priced at Pounds 350,000 from Westlake. Fellbeck Old Hall is more ancient still. It is a dales farmhouse of about 1260 which still has its cruck timbers and remains in fine condition. It used to belong to the monks of Fountains Abbey and has 25 acres and farm buildings. The house, at more than Pounds 450,000 from Cluttons, faces towards the strange formations of Brimham Rocks. For the 17th-cum-early-20th century Hanlith Hall, near Kirkby Malham, Cluttons asks Pounds 750,000; this includes a 501-acre let farm and an indoor swimming pool, sauna and solarium. It seeks offers over Pounds 1m for Scale House, near Skipton, with its 772 acres (376 of them let), pheasant shoot, and quarry with fossils that is a site of special scientific interest. For that price, an alternative is Strutt &amp; Parker's Skewkirk Hall, near York. In the hamlet of Street, in Great Fryup Dale near Whitby, Street Farm is a 1749 yeoman farmhouse in stone (from Jackson-Stops; price Pounds 155,000). Normanby Hill, on rising ground at Sinnington in the Vale of Pickering, first went on the market at Pounds 350,000 in 1990. Now, Blenkin is asking around Pounds 200,000, reflecting a need for repair as well as the decline in the market.

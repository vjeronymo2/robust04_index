			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Shattered City strives for business as usual FOR THE many City workers affected by Friday's IRA bomb, there was perhaps no more telling image than the sight of senior managers and employees of Sanwa Bank, wearing suits and protective hats, carrying black plastic bags down Cornhill. The bags contained the remains of the main London offices of one of Japan's largest banking institutions, which had its windows and furniture wrecked when the blast shattered the Commercial Union tower it occupies. Structural engineers who continued to inspect the area yesterday said up to 1m sq ft of office space was damaged by the blast. The cost of repairs, at an estimated Pounds 150 per sq ft, could total Pounds 1.5bn. Official estimates yesterday put the number of affected businesses at 36 in some 40 buildings. Although the Baltic Exchange and the neighbouring Chamber of Shipping are the only buildings that will have to be demolished, several blocks in the surrounding area remained cordoned off by police yesterday as engineers continued their inspections. BT said that up to 12,000 lines served by its exchange in the area had been disrupted by the blast, which was focused on St Mary Axe, a street linking Houndsditch and Leadenhall Street. BT engineers worked throughout the weekend, diverting telephone services for customers and providing lines and equipment to companies that had been forced to relocate temporarily. BT also set up two mobile payphone caravans yesterday at the junctions of Leadenhall Street and Bishopsgate, and at the junction of Billiter Street and Fenchurch Street, from which customers will today be able to make essential calls free of charge. Damage to the Commercial Union tower, which was opened in 1969, was concentrated at the north-east corner. Virtually all the building's glass was knocked out and there was widespread damage to floors, ceilings and fittings. However, early indications are that the building's core is intact. Power lines have not been cut and it is hoped that lifts can be restored. According Mr Richard Owen, a senior UK director of CU, there is 'no chance of re-occupancy for some months,' and repair work could take up to a year. Other insurance companies affected include two Lloyd's agencies, Cassidy Davies and Roberts &amp; Hiscox. Cassidy Davies manages underwriting syndicates at Lloyd's specialising in political risk insurance, and has pioneered insurance against kidnap and ransom. Ms Beryl Hobson, Cassidy's marketing manager, said yesterday that a small crisis management team had met over the weekend and had completed plans to move the company's operations to new premises near Liverpool Street station. The agency, which employs almost 80 staff, was still assessing the damage, but Ms Hobson insisted that it will be able to trade today. 'It's business as usual,' she said. 'We are not going to be deflected by this little lot.' Law firm Shaw &amp; Croft is moving staff to the Tower Hotel, near Tower Bridge while Bangkok Bank staff will move to the Lloyd's building. National Bank of Greece is unlikely to open, but National Westminster Bank will open as normal. Some staff of James Capel, the stockbrokers, are expected to move from Bevis Marks near St Mary Axe to Devonshire Square. It is understood that Midland Bank has told some of its staff to move to premises in London Wall. Saudi International Bank in Bishopsgate is believed to be relocating to JP Morgan offices in the City. Royal Bank of Scotland is understood to be transferring staff from St Mary Axe to its London headquarters in Lombard Street. Hongkong and Shanghai Bank will operate normally, in spite of receiving some damage to its Bishopsgate bulding. Rosehaugh and Stanhope, joint owners of the nearby Broadgate office development, moved quickly to allow companies affected by the blast to use office space which had previously been empty.</p>

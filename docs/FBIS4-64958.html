			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Shawkat Kazan, "number two" in the </F> Prosperity Party, by Muwaffaq Madani in Ankara; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Shawkat Kazan is in his  sixties, a self-possessed man with a clear view of his party's  principles. Like Prosperity Party leader Nacmettin Erbakan, he  has an air of Islamic conservatism tinged with new radicalism.    The following discussion took place between myself and  Kazan:    [Madani] What do the recent wins by the Prosperity Party in  the municipal elections mean to you?    [Kazan] The West has brought Turkey to this juncture. Every  infant draws his first breath in this country with 50 million  Turkish liras of debts to the West.    In the forties we were making weapons. In the fifties, the  Marshall Plan destroyed our military industries. Without the  Marshall Plan, we would have been making our own weapons now.    He added: They destroyed our ability to work. We needed  weapons during the Cyprus crisis. When we entered Cyprus, the  United States imposed an embargo on us and we responded by  confiscating U.S. bases. Three years passed without us getting  any assistance. Those were hard times. Then the doors opened  again and we turned once more to the Western military industry.  Right now we are using tanks against the Workers Party of  Kurdistan, but Germany says that we should not be using those  weapons against the Kurds. However, those are tanks that we  bought with our own money.    He asked: Why is the West afraid of us? The West is always  working against the Islamic world through NATO, the United  Nations, the Council of Europe, and other international forums.    Muslims constitute one fourth of the world population. Why  is there not a single Islamic country in the UN Security  Council? It is only natural and fair that we should have a  representative in the Security Council. Sometimes, a stray  Muslim country finds its way into the Security Council, but  without the right of veto. Therefore, we cannot expect anything  good to come out of the United Nations in anything that concerns  us.    He added: This is why we call for the establishment of a  United Nations belonging to the Islamic world. The Islamic  Conference Organization [ICO] is just a ceremonial forum. I  wonder what this ICO has done for the Bosnians.    I promise you, once the Prosperity Party comes to power, we  will establish a United Nations.    That is not all. An Islamic common market should be formed.  We do not have to remain dependent on the West. God Almighty  has given the Islamic countries plenty of resources. Once we  form an Islamic common market, the European Common Market will  be a thing of the past.    A third point on the Prosperity Party's platform, if it  reaches power, is the establishment of an joint Islamic defense  pact, an Islamic NATO.    A fourth point is the unification of the Islamic currency, a  move that would free us of the domination of the U.S. dollar.    A fifth point is the establishment of an Islamic UNESCO, a  cultural union among Islamic countries.    This is why the West does not want the Prosperity Party,  because its accession to power will upset the global balance of  power.    About a week ago, an Israeli bank chairman came to Turkey.  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres came today. They told the  Turkish officials: Whatever financial backing you need we will  give you, so long as the Prosperity Party does not come to power  in Turkey. We tell them that these people cannot be bought.    [Madani] I have understood from your program that you intend  to go back to the notion of the Ottoman Empire and the Sublime  Porte.    [Kazan] We will not be an Ottoman state. It had its day,  and we have ours. We are at the end of the 20th century, and no  country can stand alone. The same as the West unites to serve  its interests, the Islamic nation should unite for its own good.  This is both the logical and the reasonable thing to do. This  will save us not only in this world, but also in the one to come.    [Madani] How do you explain the victory of the Prosperity  Party?    [Kazan] It is natural. Since the seventies we have been  gaining more votes in every election we enter. In the coming  elections, we will get more than 35 percent of the votes. The  gain in votes made us develop the party, the same as it dictated  that the other parties decline in votes and in popularity. The  True Path Party and the Motherland Party won about 20 percent of  the votes in this election, but in the next one they will not  win more than 15 percent, if that. We could have gotten more  votes, but the media was very much against us. I hope our  people will not trust the media from now on. I would like to  give you an example about the media. The newspaper SABAH, one  of the most widely circulated papers in Turkey, published  results of an opinion poll it conducted one day before the  election. In Istanbul, it expected the Social Democratic  People's Party to gain 25 percent of the votes and the  Prosperity Party to gain 16 percent and to rank fourth. In  Ankara, the paper predicted the Social Democratic People's Party  to gain 35 percent of the votes and the Prosperity Party to come  in fourth with 14 percent. We know what the results are and  what the results of such media was. The other papers were not  much different. The election was a war between the media organs  and the people. We have won six central municipalities out of  15. The total number of municipalities we won throughout Turkey  is 325.    [Madani] Do you expect a collision between you and the  regime when you try to reach power, as happened in Algeria?    [Kazan] Turkey is not Algeria. This is not the first time  we have won municipal elections. We took over municipalities  that were billions of liras in debt. Now these same  municipalities are not one cent in debt. God willing, the same  will happen in the other municipalities we have taken over,  which are also in debt. As for the collision you mentioned;  that is with the Army; there is no separation between the people  and the Army. The Army is part of this people. The Prosperity  Party has won in several military areas. There is no conflict  between the people and the Army.    [Madani] But former President Kenan Evren warned the Turkish  Army and people about you.    [Kazan] Evren has become a rich man. He belongs in the  history museum, and his time is over. He is the last person to  speak like this because nobody in Turkey listens to him.</p>

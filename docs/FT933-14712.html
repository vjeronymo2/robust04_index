			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK newspapers Effective competition often involves doing what your competitors like least. On that basis, Mr Rupert Murdoch has delivered a dirty dig at Mirror Group Newspapers by launching a price war in the tabloid market. Just as MGN was beginning to recover its poise, it now faces the prospect of a long and bloody circulation war. Its knee-jerk response in cutting the Mirror's cover price to 10p for a day may have been an effective spoiler but hardly provides a sustainable long-term strategy. MGN's administrators now face a far trickier task in working out how to dispose of their 54 per cent holding. The biggest loser, though, may be the Daily Star. The timing is especially unfortunate given its parent, United Newspapers, is already having a rocky ride persuading shareholders to back a Pounds 190m cash call. Nevertheless, the muted response of United's share price is understandable. The Daily Star is only a small part of United's business while its core middle market newspapers are likely to emerge unscathed. As for News International, it can well afford the probable loss of Pounds 1m of revenue a week as it attempts to stimulate the Sun's flaccid sales. But past industry experience has shown that low prices are no substitute for editorial appeal.</p>

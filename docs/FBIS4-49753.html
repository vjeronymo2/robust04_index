			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wei Xuepu (7614 1331 2613) and Fan Dashui (5400 </F> 1129 3055]: "The Provincial Government and the Provincial  Military District Jointly Issue a Document Calling For Ensuring  a Good Job of Enterprise Militia and Reserve Service Work"]    [Text] The Anhui Provincial Government and the Anhui  Provincial Military District recently jointly issued a document  setting out specific guidelines for implementing the  "Regulations on Enterprise Militia and Reserve Service Work"  which were promulgated by seven departments and commissions,  including the General Staff Headquarters of the People's  Liberation Army [PLA,] the PLA General Political Department, and  the State Economic Restructuring Commission. The document urged  all localities, in the new situation of developing a socialist  market economy, to effectively strengthen the party's leadership  over armed work and to properly carry out enterprise militia and  reserve service work.    The document said that all localities should take various  measures to effectively publicize and carry out the  "regulations," strengthen leadership over enterprise militia and  reserve service work, conduct annual inspections and  evaluations, commend outstanding units and individuals, and  penalize those who have performed poorly. It said: While  carrying out structural reform and transforming enterprises'  operating mechanisms, all localities should ensure the  independence and stability of enterprises' armed service units.  Enterprises -- including wholly owned enterprises, joint  ventures, and cooperative enterprises -- which should have  established an armed service unit but have not done so should  establish an armed service unit as soon as possible. Those that  have abolished their armed service units should immediately  reestablish them. Enterprises' armed service organs must not be  abolished or merged without approval. If organizational changes  are needed due to changes in the enterprise system, they must be  subject to the approval of the provincial CPC Committee, the  provincial government, and the provincial military district.  The document also clearly set forth regulations on the  mechanisms of commendation, punishment, and giving incentives  for carrying out enterprise militia and reserve service work.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Israeli citrus growers given state aid after exports fall 36% ISRAEL'S parliamentary finance committee has approved Dollars 25m in emergency state aid to the country's citrus industry, which has been hit this season by a 36 per cent fall in exports caused by a damaging combination of low yields at home and depressed prices abroad. Traditionally the star in Israel's legendary 'blooming desert' agricultural industry, the reality for the citrus sector in recent years has been a story of declining export earnings as inputs such as water grew in price while growers failed to keep pace with demand for popular high-value 'easy peeler' and sweeter varieties. This season, yields have been slashed by prolonged spells of cold weather during the blossoming late last winter. Production of shamouti oranges, the standard variety that with grapefruits makes up the majority of Israeli output, is down by around 30 per cent, according to growers. At the same time, prices have slumped in European markets, the main destination for Israeli fruit. Mr Menashe Davidson, chief executive of the Mehadrin Group, Israel's biggest exporter, said the price of fresh fruit had fallen by some 15 per cent while the price for juice concentrate had tumbled by a third compared with last year to less than USDollars 1,000 a tonne. Initial reports showed fresh fruit exports up to the end of January, the height of the harvest, totalled 8.2m boxes, compared with 12.9m at the same stage last year. Mr Davidson estimated Israeli exports for the whole season would total 250,000 tonnes, compared with 320,000 last year. About 45 per cent of output goes for export as fresh fruit, 45 per cent goes as concentrate and the remainder to the local market. Mr Davidson said Israeli products had been undercut by low-priced orange and grapefruit concentrates coming from Brazil and Florida, while sales of deciduous fruits such as apples had increased sharply in Europe, cutting into demand for fresh citrus products. He said Israeli producers had also suffered from the weakening of the UK and Scandinavian currencies, two of their chief markets. Over the past decade, the annual value of citrus exports to Israel has fallen from about Dollars 250m to less than Dollars 150m in some years. In the same period, industrial exports (excluding diamonds) have grown to about Dollars 8bn a year. But the ministry of agriculture says the citrus industry still accounts for 40,000 jobs in total and needs the Dollars 25m state aid to help it weather a temporary crisis. Officials acknowledge that part of the problem is structural. The proportion of citrus exports made up of higher-value, more water-efficient modern varieties has grown rapidly in recent years to more than a third of the total, but progress has not been fast enough to blunt competition from countries such as Morocco and Spain. Some of this season's difficulties are attributed to the squeeze imposed on less efficient growers by the liberalisation of export marketing last season, which removed the shelter of fixed prices for producers imposed by the old monopoly Citrus Marketing Board. But Mr Davidson rejects hardline critics who argue that Israel should cut back hard on an industry that they say in effect exports subsidised water, which Israel cannot afford. 'What we have to do is be more efficient and produce better products. We can do it,' he says.</p>

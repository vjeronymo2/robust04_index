			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELVIS  </P> <P> Elvis always respected his fans and sincerely liked them as something more than  dollar signs. I don't believe the fans today feel that the estate respects  them. What a shame that Elvis' money is being very well looked after, and his  legacy is not.  </P> <P> SUE WIEGERT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

The time of completion hereinabove set forth shall be increased by the number of days of any such suspension, except when such suspension is due to the failure of the Contractor to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract. In the event that work is suspended by the Contractor with the consent of the Owner, the Contractor before resuming work shall give the Owner at least twenty-four (24) hours' notice thereof in writing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4. Unsuitable Workmanship. The acceptance of any workmanship by the Owner or the Engineer shall not preclude the subsequent rejection thereof if such workmanship shall be found to be unsuitable. Workmanship found unsuitable before final acceptance of the work shall be remedied, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder so long as any unsuitable workmanship in respect to the Project, of which the Contractor shall have had notice, shall not have been remedied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> ARTICLE III_PAYMENT <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.

Only ninety percent (90%) of each such statement approved during the clearing of a Section shall be paid by the Owner to the Contractor prior to completion of the Section. Upon completion by the Contractor of the clearing of a Section, the Contractor shall prepare a Final Inventory of the Section showing the total number and character of clearing units and shall deliver to the Owner a Certificate of Contractor and Indemnity Agreement in the form attached hereto, showing the total cost of the work performed and stating (1) that all persons who have furnished labor in connection with the Project and subcontractors who have furnished services for the Project have been paid in full and (2) that the Contractor shall hold the Owner harmless against any liens arising out of the Contractor's performance hereunder which may have been or may be filed against the Owner.

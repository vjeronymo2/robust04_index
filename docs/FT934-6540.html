			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Applied Holographics picks up Applied Holographics, the USM-quoted producer of holographic products for security and packaging uses, yesterday reported its first operating profit since it was founded in 1983. However, losses of Pounds 71,209 (Pounds 57,033) on CFC AH, a US joint venture, resulted in pre-tax losses of Pounds 60,115 for the six months to end-September. Losses last time were Pounds 622,383. Turnover was Pounds 3.04m (Pounds 2.37m), generating operating profits of Pounds 53,116, compared with losses of Pounds 522,317. Holographic product sales increased by 54 per cent, but the manufacture of hot stamping foils declined by 28 per cent as production was progressively transferred to Whiley Foils under a deal announced in May. The company said the second half had opened with a slightly lower level of holographic base business, but there were prospects of a number of potentially significant con-tracts. In addition, the new Chicago facilities of CFC AH were now virtually completed and should be in production for the last quarter. Mr David Mahony, chairman, said the company's business had now been stabilised. Its deficit now stood at Pounds 17.3m. Losses per share were reduced from 3.1p to 0.29p. The shares closed 6p lower at 65p.</p>

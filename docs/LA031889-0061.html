			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWRENCE BERKELEY LAB GETS NEW CHIEF  </P> <P> Charles Vernon Shank was named Friday to become the new director of the  Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the energy and life science research center run  by the University of California for the federal government.  </P> <P> Shank, 45, now heads an AT&amp;T Bell electronics lab in New Jersey. He will  take over Lawrence Berkeley in September, succeeding David A. Shirley, who is  resigning after nine years as director.  </P> <P> Shank earned his bachelor's, master's and Ph. D. degrees from UC Berkeley,  where Lawrence Berkeley is located. He is an expert in the field of  spectroscopy of ultra-fast events, the study of processes that take place in  femtoseconds -- a millionth of a billionth of a second.  </P> <P> Lawrence Berkeley has a staff of more than 3,000 and an annual budget of $220  million from the U.S. Department of Energy. Unlike the other two labs that UC  runs for the federal government, Lawrence Berkeley does not do work on nuclear  weapons, officials said.  </P></p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / As They Say in Europe: The Swiss corner of Chinatown - James Morgan foresees a cultural melting pot At the north-west corner of Leicester Square in London stands the Swiss Centre. It was originally planned as a cultural site to be called 'Forum of Switzerland'. That failed to take off because, characteristically, no Swiss was prepared to offer a guarantee to cover any deficits. Today, it houses a Swiss watch shop and the Swiss National Tourist Office ('the oldest such foreign travel office in the world'). Outside stands a 10m pole emblazoned with the arms of the 26 cantons. To coincide with the Swiss millennium in 1991, Westminster city council renamed the bit of street next to it Swiss Court. There is not a single facet of Swiss culture that goes unrepresented on the facade or in the environs: flags, cuckoo clocks, Swatches, coats of arms. Since it was established in 1965, the centre has been, what it was once for me, a leading trysting spot. It symbolises romantic hopes, shattered dreams and broken hearts. It is unfortunate, therefore, that it should now be at the heart of three complex problems - commercial, racial and political. 'Uncertain fate of the Swiss centre in London,' ran the headline in the Neue Zurcher Zeitung, followed by 'Tempting offers and contractual hurdles'. It emerged that the centre was transferred in 1986, in an in-house deal, to a holding company, the Swiss Centre Ltd, for a mere Pounds 3.2m. Its shareholders are the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) with 51 per cent, and two largely state-owned enterprises, Swissair and the Swiss Travel Office, dividing up the rest. But, 'the structural circumstances of the building make reconstruction necessary'. That will cost an estimated Pounds 45m. Now, last year the Swiss Centre was valued at Pounds 14m but today, says the paper with heavy use of italics, Pounds 30m has been offered for the present structure. The SBC is, says the NZZ, anxious to sell but its minority partners have the right to first refusal. The Travel Office in particular, as a government agency, 'does not wish this successful shop window to give way surreptitiously to an 'exotic funfair'.' This needs some explanation: the Bank Corporation says it is going ahead with the sale but the NZZ says there is a catch in the articles of agreement. It alleges there is a clause saying that any buyer has to guarantee the Swiss character of the building. Now it will not take any observer of the London scene long to realise there might be a problem if that is so. The offers made up to now are hardly reassuring: the Swiss Centre stands at the edge of Chinatown. 'Chinese investors are apparently ready to pay practically any price for this building.' But they are not prepared to accept any 'Swiss' condition. It is evident that this problem cannot be resolved by some superficial, papering-over-the-cracks solution such as turning the Movenpick restaurant into a Swiss-style chow mein centre. It is also evident that it is too late to offer Hong Kong as the 27th canton. But it does seem that both sides are unnecessarily overwhelmed by an assumption that there is some kind of incompatibility between them. This should not be so. In Chinese, 'Switzerland' is made up of characters pronounced 'Rui Shi,' which are considered auspicious by the Chinese. Then again, some Germans refer to the form of their language spoken in most of the Swiss cantons as 'Cantonese'. The two peoples share many characteristics: both seem able to accept iron rules in order to avoid anything resembling anarchy, or even excessive personal freedom. Both put a firm emphasis on family values while allowing considerable latitude to those who fail to stick closely to the more demanding of their marriage vows. And one of the sub-headings in the NZZ in covering this story was, 'What's a promise worth?' Just the kind of question a Chinese businessman might ask. A pragmatic approach to resolving such riddles is a shared quality so some kind of deal should be possible. But the NZZ which emerges as a leader of the pro-Swiss faction, says a face-saving solution is out of the question: 'The meaning of the contractual obligations of the three partners is clear.' A proposition SBC denies. There seems to be nothing for it but the creation of a Sino-Swiss Centre which would certainly add a touch of the unusual to the anonymous feel of Leicester Square today. I like the idea of buxom Swiss girls clad in cheong-sams serving up lashings of sweet-and-sour Rosti every August 1, Swiss national day. And alpenhorns would add to the festivity of the local Chinese New Year celebrations in February. With any luck, in years to come, a young man will be standing outside the centre, in the rain, clutching a bouquet of etiolated Taiwan edelweiss in his right hand and, in his left, a box of Madame Choy's Lucky Cuckoo Chocolate Mooncakes.

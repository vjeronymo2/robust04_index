			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News in Brief AHLSTROM, the Finnish forestry and machinery group, saw pre-tax losses fall to FM36m (Dollars 6m) last year from FM191m in 1991, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. The improvement came as sales grew 22.5 per cent to FM10.15bn from FM8.28bn and the operating margin rose to FM1.02bn from FM606m. ***** THE Julius Baer Swiss private banking group is looking for double-digit profit growth again in 1993, Mr Hans Baer, the chief executive, said yesterday, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The group's net profit jumped 15 per cent last year to SFr68m (Dollars 44.56m), driven mainly by a 27 per cent rise in commissions from asset and portfolio management. ***** FOLKETRYGDFONDET, Norway's national insurance scheme fund, one of the biggest institutional investors in the domestic securities market, yesterday reported an increase in unrealised losses on its share portfolio to NKr588m (Dollars 83.97m) from NKr158m in 1991, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Total assets at the end of last year rose to NKr66.75bn from NKr60.66bn in the same period a year earlier. The fund was also allowed to invest up to NKr5bn in state bonds and commercial paper. ***** Z-LANDERBANK Bank Austria, Austria's largest bank, has denied charges in two magazines that it laundered money for two east Berlin firms, Novum and Transcarbon, between 1989 and last year, writes Ian Rodger. 'It is absolutely untrue that we have had anything to do with laundering,' Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, chief executive, said. The bank said investigations so far showed that the bank had respected all laws and regulations. ***** KLOECKNER-Humboldt-Deutz, the German machinery and engineering group, will offer new shares to existing shareholders at a price of DM80 through the one-for-two issue announced late last month, AP-DJ reports from Cologne.</p>

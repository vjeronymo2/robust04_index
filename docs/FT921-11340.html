			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Rank up sharply on figures THE much-trumpeted adverse developments feared from Rank Organisation failed to materialise yesterday when the full-year figures were announced. Profits, earnings and debt all came comfortably within analysts' ranges, while the dividend - the target of worries which depressed the shares last week - was maintained. A relieved market sent the shares up 45 to 640p, just above their level of two weeks ago, in very heavy turnover of 4.6m. Analysts remain divided over prospects for the leisure group. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is cautious, while County NatWest, a long-time bear of the stock, also sees little prospect of recovery, advising a 'weak hold' until the dividend is paid. Ms Lisa Gordon at County also warns: 'Rank will have to address the problem of its debt, either through a rights issue or by disposals.' Smith New Court, however, is more bullish, believing that 'the company's credibility has been restored'. Kleinwort Benson is also positive. Mr Paul Slattery said: '1993 will be Rank's year for growth, particularly through its US operations.' He is raising his pre-tax profits forecast for the coming year by Pounds 35m to Pounds 285m, compared with Paribas' Pounds 305m, Smith's Pounds 282m, UBS's Pounds 280m and County's Pounds 270m. For 1993, Kleinwort and Paribas forecast Pounds 355m, Smith Pounds 345m, UBS Pounds 310m and County Pounds 305m. Heavy BT trade The two classes of BT stock between them easily topped the market's list of active stocks after the telecoms group unveiled third-quarter profits below those of the comparable period last year. The results were at the top end of market expectations but were closely followed by publication of the consultative document on BT tariffs by Oftel, the industry regulator. At the close, BT 'old' shares were 4 up at 329p on volume of 8.8m, while the 'new' settled 2 firmer at 119p on big turnover of 27m. At their best yesterday the two stocks touched 332p and 122p respectively. Mr Robert Millington, telecoms specialist at BZW, the investment bank, said the figures were the first manifestation of the tariff cuts instigated by Oftel during the summer and the recession in the UK, and that the chances of more big cuts are 'receding very quickly'. He noted that return on capital employed had already fallen to 'more acceptable levels'. Mr Christopher Tucker at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said the Oftel document 'will help to dispel some of the wilder speculation about a more aggressive price control regime'. Reuters favoured Interest in Reuters pushed the shares to Pounds 11 for the first time since their plunge 18 months ago, when they had reacted to a second-half profits warning. The spur, yesterday, was a belief in the market that US securities house Wertheim Schroder had put out a note reiterating the positive stance on the stock which it first adopted in December. There was also optimism over the trials for Reuters' much-vaunted automated foreign exchange system, Dealing 2,000-2. The Professional Investor Report, a US newswire service that concentrates on market speculation, labelled the trials as 'impressive'. The shares were strong all day, reaching a mid-price high of 1103p before closing 20 to the good at Pounds 11 with 1.6m dealt. GEC wanted GEC shares powered ahead to their best level since April 10 last year, closing 6 1/2 higher at 209p. Turnover in the stock, noticeably heavier over the past few sessions, expanded rapidly to top 14m yesterday. Last week GEC-Alstom announced a Pounds 550m-plus contract and there were suggestions in the market that more big orders could be on the way soon. Dealers paid little notice to some wild stories of a break-up bid for GEC. Dealers reported another burst of speculative buying in Premier Consolidated Oilfields, the oil exploration group, which rose 1 1/2 to 28 1/2 p on keen turnover of 3.5m. Monument Oil &amp; Gas, marginally ahead at 35 1/2 p, was suggested as a potential predator. Shell Transport, which figured prominently in the big programme trades executed yesterday, lost 3 more to 481p on turnover of 5.4m, not helped by a strong sell recommendation from Strauss Turnbull. SG Warburg rose 8 to 563p after being included in the prestigious County-30 list of best buys. County was also influential in hitting the insurance broking sector, which it viewed as 'significantly overvalued'. Willis Corroon slipped 3 to 350p and Sedgwick declined to 210p before bouncing to close 4 ahead at 218p. There was another heavy trade (7.4m shares) in Guardian Royal Exchange, where stakebuilding and takeover stories refused to die down. GRE settled 2 firmer at 136p. Vodafone eased a shade to 346p after Hoare Govett published a note detailing the increasing competition threat in the UK mobile radio market. Hoare labelled Vodafone shares as 'overvalued'. A recent broker visit to Volex resulted in some keen support for the stock, which moved up 6 to 295p. Dealers felt that a UK television documentary on Hanson, shown on Wednesday evening, had made little impact on the stock market. The shares, which had fallen on the previous day on concern over what the programme might reveal, bounced up 4 yesterday to 207p. Recovery continued in Fisons, which gained 14 to 396p on heavy turnover of 7.2m, with some traders talking of a chart break-out. News on Tuesday that the UK has relicensed all formulations of its Opticrom eye preparation product, coupled with the persistence of bid talk, ensured firmness. Glaxo fell 13 to 835p in a follow-through reaction to overnight US sales of the pharmaceutical group's American Depositary Receipts. The shares were later affected by fierce two-way trading in the US, where Merrill Lynch was said to be offering stock and Salomon Brothers was said to be on the buy. SmithKline Beecham 'A' climbed 14 to 963p and the Units were particularly strong, jumping 130 to 4268p. Hoare Govett reinforced its positive stance on the stock in a review of the sector published yesterday. The stock also benefited from speculation that the company had made a research breakthrough on an Aids drug. SmithKline later said there was no basis for the rumour. Pharmaceuticals group Medeva rose sharply for the second day running following a positive presentation to institutional investors by securities house Strauss Turnbull. The shares added 15 at 279p. Brewers weakened after Courage, part of the Australian-based Foster's Brewing group, told analysts that it expected UK beer turnover to fall by 4 per cent this year and probably not show an upturn until 1993. The brewer was also said to have voiced concern over the standard lager market. Bass, which produces Carling Black Label and Tennents lagers, lost 3 to 544p. The effect of a note by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew on Grand Metropolitan and its pension fund was compounded by speculation that the company might launch a bid for Pernod Ricard, of France, and the shares retreated 9 to 935p. A buy recommendation from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken helped Lucas Industries to appreciate 4 to 116p. Mr David Blackwood at Carr is predicting current-year profits of Pounds 36m, with Pounds 80m for the following year. Vickers hardened 5 to 176p as talk of interested parties for the company's Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary increased. Aerospace and electronics concern ML Holdings dropped 10 to 43p after reporting a first-half loss of Pounds 1.31m, compared with a Pounds 3.02m profit a year earlier. Food retailer Albert Fisher retreated 6 to 71p after several brokers reduced profits forecasts for the company. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (85).

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: End of the Ship Canal battle in sight - One of Britain's longest and most bitter corporate disputes THE MANCHESTER Ship Canal Company yesterday recommended a deal to shareholders that should end one of Britain's longest and most bitter corporate disputes. It should also transform the long term prospects of Peel Holdings, the Rochdale-based property developer. The Ship Canal Company, 82.2 per cent-owned by Peel, is offering to buy out minority interests for an eventual Pounds 33.50 per ordinary share. If it goes through, the Ship Canal Company will be absorbed into Peel and will lose its quotation on the Stock Exchange. The quote will disappear as the ship canal - one of the wonders of Victorian civil engineering - prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. It still operates profitably as a port, but the last 10 years have put its best markets and prospects in land and property, where it is already proving a sound operator. Its most alluring prospect is 300 acres of canalside land at Dumplington, on the edge of Trafford Park, at a nexus of motorways which puts 6m people within an hour's drive. After a series of public inquiries, the government last March gave outline planning permission for its development as a shopping and leisure centre It was this prospect that first attracted Mr John Whittaker, Peel's chairman, to the ship canal 10 years ago. The problem, however, was how to afford a takeover. But then he and the Manchester office of NM Rothschild, Mr Whittaker's merchant banker, spotted a critical weakness in MSC's share structure that provided a cheap way in. There were then 8m shares, split evenly between ordinaries and preference. The prefs yielded little, so were less than half the price of the ordinaries, which paid reasonable dividends. But each class of share carried equal voting rights. In 1985, Mr Whittaker - acting through one of his private companies - started buying preference shares and any ordinaries he could get. By the time MSC's incumbent board woke up to the threat, it was too late. Mr Whittaker launched a bid in 1986 having already secured the bulk of the prefs, offering Pounds 6.25 a share for the ordinaries and Pounds 3 for the prefs. The market price of the ordinaries doubled, so few ordinary shareholders accepted, but Mr Whittaker got enough votes by the 1987 annual meeting to take control. The first person sacked was Mr Nicholas Berry - son of Lord Hartwell and then owner of Harrap, the publisher - who had bought into MSC at a premium during the takeover battle and become its chairman. He developed an intense dislike of Mr Whittaker, whom he thought had got control too cheaply. He rallied the institutional shareholders to hold out for a better offer. Because they held a majority of the ordinary shares they could block any plans they wished. An offer of Pounds 20.70 per ordinary share was rejected nearly five years ago and Mr Berry has been waiting for a better one since. However, recession limited Mr Whittaker's scope. His private companies were over-extended and he was eventually forced to transfer his MSC holdings to Peel, the quoted company he chairs. In exchange, he allowed his family's holdings in Peel to fall below 50.1 per cent, almost certainly increasing Peel's attractiveness to outside investors, who could previously only watch him at work. Three factors have now made possible his settlement with Mr Berry: Mr Berry's institutional allies drifted away, selling to Peel under recessionary pressures of their own. The last, British Coal's pension fund, gave up in February. This left Mr Berry and the rump of small shareholders. Peel could afford to make an offer. Peel has pulled through the recession and last week reported a 34 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 9.4m. It is clearing away expensive bank facilities and replacing them with cheaper ones and looks well set to leap ahead as economic recovery gather pace. Dumplington's outline planning permission made the land's potential value genuinely negotiable. Even though the government's decision is being appealed by local authority opponents worried about possible effects on city centre shops, MSC expects to win, as the arguments have already been dismissed by public inquiries. The proposed deal, which Mr Berry thought up and negotiated with Mr Bob Hough, the MSC chairman, reflects this. The long-term value of the deal, however, will be to Peel's shareholders. As Mr Paul Deakin of Rothschild put it yesterday: 'Peel will be able to consolidate and integrate two attractive property portfolios. This will enable everyone to get fuller benefit out of the company.'</p>

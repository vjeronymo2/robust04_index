			<p>BFN     [Text] Armenian Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan chaired a  regular meeting of the State Commission on Coordinating  Armenian-Iranian Ties on 31 March.    The meeting heard a report on the work carried out by the  authorized commissions into the circumstances leading to the  crash of an Iranian C-130 military transport plane over  Nagorno-Karabakh on 17 March, and on the assistance provided by  the Armenian authorities for discovering the causes of the  tragedy.    In expressing deep regret over the unfortunate incident and  human losses, it was noted that Armenia provided and is  providing unreserved assistance to the experts from Iran and the  authorized commission from the CIS Interstate Aviation Committee  for the detailed study of all the circumstances surrounding the  crash of the plane.    The transportation of the victims of the tragedy from  Stepanakert to Yerevan and then to Tehran was organized on an  appropriate state level.    It was also noted at the commission's meeting that the  disinformation carried by some [word indistinct] news agencies  and presumptive assessments of the incident are turning this  tragic incident into a subject of political exploitation.    It was also stressed that many problems still needs to be  finally resolved. It is evident from the testimony of the  Iranian experts that the C-130 plane did not have a black box.  It was also clarified that after flying for 50 minutes from  Moscow, the plane's airtight seal was disrupted. As a result,  it dropped 2,400 meters. But the crew decided not to return to  Moscow airport and instead to continue the flight. The studies  show that, in general, the plane did not enter Armenia's  airspace and did not establish contact with Yerevan air-traffic  controllers, despite the fact that at the initiative of the  latter an attempt was made to establish contact with it through  the No. 954 flight of a Russian plane. And Yerevan controllers  learned from Georgian air controllers that the plane deviated  from its air route and that they too lost contact with it.    It is not clear why the plane sharply deviated from its  flight path after leaving Georgian territory, entered deep into  Azerbaijani territory, and flew some 4,000 meters lower. The  meeting expressed the hope that it will be possible to find  answers to all questions after a comprehensive study of the  incident by the experts and authorized commissions.    Underlying the vital necessity of establishing stability and  peace in the region, the meeting also expressed concern that  Azerbaijan's derailment of initiatives for the peaceful  resolution of the Karabakh problem is causing tragedy not only  for the sons of Armenians and Azerbaijanis, but also unwittingly  for the friendly Iranian people.    The commission also examined a number of problems related to  Armenian-Iranian economic ties.</p>

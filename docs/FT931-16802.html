			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Opposition says it will challenge Moi's election KENYAN President Daniel arap Moi was yesterday sworn in for a further five-year term as an opposition coalition promised a non-violent campaign designed to overturn last week's election results. At a hastily organised ceremony at State House, Nairobi, Mr Moi promised to 'serve all Kenyans, and I mean all Kenyans, with dedication and humility for the development and prosperity of our people'. Absent from the occasion was Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Commonwealth secretary general, who arrived yesterday to begin efforts to end the political impasse. Chief Anyaoku, who met the president in the afternoon, was said to be resting after his journey. Mr Moi faces his first test this week, when he is expected to announce his cabinet. Without representatives of the Kikuyu and the Luo, the country's two largest tribes, it will have little credibility, but the election showed overwhelming opposition to the president from both ethnic groups. The opposition alliance, comprising Mr Kenneth Matiba's FORD-Asili, Mr Jaramogi Oginga Odinga's FORD-Kenya and the Democratic Party led by Mr Mwai Kibaki, has come under criticism from some supporters for raising the prospect of a boycott of parliament. At a press conference Mr Kibaki renewed the opposition's claim that the poll had been rigged, but declined to say how it would fulfil its threat to stop Mr Moi exercising power. A non-violent anti-government campaign was being planned, he said, but declined to give details. Most observers believe the alliance has little option but to function as a parliamentary opposition. Ghana's President-elect Jerry Rawlings's party won 189 of 200 parliamentary seats after an opposition election boycott, Reuter reports from Accra. Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida swore in a National Defence and Security Council and a Transitional Council yesterday to help guide the country towards civilian rule, Reuter reports from Abuja.</p>

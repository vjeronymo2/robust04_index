			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Fourth Pakistani minister resigns CRACKS within the Pakistani government widened last night with the resignation of another minister, the fourth this week, from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government. Mr Haji Gulsher Khan, a senator and minister of state for zakat (Islamic tax), declared his support for President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in his rift with the prime minister, and said he would back the president if he sought a second term in elections later this year. Mr Khan told a news conference he had resigned because he could not accept an instruction from Mr Sharif to his ministers not to discuss the presidential election. Mr Sharif is trying to curtail the president's powers which allow him to dissolve parliament and to make senior appointments, such as that of army chief of staff. One of the ministers who resigned earlier, Mr Anwar Saifullah Khan, minister for the environment, is the president's son-in-law. The latest rift is being viewed with concern because Pakistan's two previous prime ministers sworn in since martial law was lifted in 1985 were both sacked by presidents before completing their term. However, Mr Sharif's close aides are confident his position is secure, with unwavering support from a large number of politicians in his home province of Punjab.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Madrid may inject cash into Iberia In the wake of the European Commission's controversial decision allowing the French government to provide fresh subsidies to Air France, the Spanish government is expected to request similar authorisation before the end of the year for Iberia, its financially crippled airline. Iberia is expected to lose Pta44bn (Dollars 343.7m) this year, up on earlier estimates of Pta30bn, and its accumulated losses by December will have effectively wiped out a Pta120bn capital injection authorised by Brussels in 1992 on condition that no more public money be made available until 1996. The request to allow immediate additional funds for the state-owned carrier, likely to total at least another Pta120bn, will be accompanied by a drastic cost-cutting programme. Iberia plans to lower salaries by an average 15 per cent over two years and to shed 2,120 jobs from its 24,456 labour force. The cuts, which form the basis of talks with the airline's unions over the next two weeks, are viewed as a test case for the government's declared policy of substantially reducing losses in the public sector. Yesterday the unions said they would not begin to negotiate the proposed cuts unless there was a shake up of Iberia's senior management. The heavy losses are likely to prompt the removal of Mr Juan Saenz who was appointed Iberia's managing director in September last year. A plan drawn up by Mr Saenz to segment Iberia's business by hiving off its maintenance, handling and systems units to other companies, was shelved in May after union opposition. Responsibility for Iberia's critical balance sheet could extend right up to Mr Javier Salas, the chairman of both INI, the public sector holding company which is the airline's sole shareholder, and, since September 1993, also of Iberia. The government is seriously worried that the airline is draining the resources of profitable INI companies such as Endesa, the partially privatised electricity utility. Iberia could show a small operating profit this year, but its balance sheet is heavily burdened by its fleet renewal and expansion in Latin America where it owns 85 per cent of Aerolineas Argentinas, and has substantial shareholdings in Chile's Ladeco and in Venezuela's Visa.</p>

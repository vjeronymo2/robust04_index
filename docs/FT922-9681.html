			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Arab banks' objections may put BCCI deal in jeopardy OBJECTIONS from a number of Arab creditor banks that are together owed Dollars 800m (Pounds 452m) by the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International could jeopardise the proposed Dollars 1.7bn settlement agreement worked out by the liquidator and majority shareholder of BCCI. The objections have come to light ahead of a High Court hearing in London, due on Monday, which is intended to examine the proposed compensation deal for BCCI creditors. In a letter last month to the BCCI creditors' committee, Mr Ahmed Hassan, deputy governor of Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt, said the majority shareholder of BCCI, which is the government of Abu Dhabi, had 'a moral (and possibly a legal) responsibility to ensure that creditors receive full compensation for the losses they have suffered'. Mr Hassan  - who stated in the letter that he was also writing on behalf of Dubai Islamic Bank, Tadamon Islamic Bank of Khartoum and Islamic International Bank for Investment and Development of Egypt  - dismissed as inadequate the present compensation offer to BCCI creditors of 30 to 40 cents in the dollar. The agreement with Abu Dhabi was announced in February by Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche Ross partner overseeing the worldwide winding up of BCCI. The deal proposes a flat payment of Dollars 1.7bn in compensation based on the current estimated liabilities of about Dollars 10bn. The figure could rise to Dollars 2.2bn if claims exceed Dollars 10bn or fall to Dollars 1.2bn if claims are below that amount. In return, the majority shareholders and liquidators are supposed to drop all claims and counter-claims, and creditors are supposed to sign over a number of legal rights. Faisal Islamic Bank's objections follow the more explicit rejection of the compensation package by the Depositors' Protection Association, a group of 300 individual BCCI creditors which is owed about Dollars 1bn. The letter from Faisal Islamic Bank, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times, says the bank creditors have insufficient information to decide whether the settlement proposal is in the best interest of creditors. In London, a Touche Ross official said he had not seen the letter and could offer no comment. Mr Smouha could not be reached. Next week's London court hearing is only one part of a complex series of steps to be taken before the creditors' package can go forward. The deal is also dependent on agreement from creditors owed 70 per cent of the bank's Dollars 10bn of liabilities and requires court approval in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands as well as the UK.

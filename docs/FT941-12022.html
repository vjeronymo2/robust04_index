			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: FT gold index moves to daily publication The Financial Times's new gold mines index is published daily on the world stock market page from today on. As previously notified, the index has been widened to include companies in Australasia and North America as well as Africa - the previous index, which will be published for at least another year, was based entirely on South African stocks. The present 34 constituents of the index account for about 53 per cent of western gold output. There is no set number of constituents and the eligibility of each company will be reviewed four times a year. The Mining Journal is helping with monitoring. For more information telephone 071 873 4613.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Elliott case 'not strong' The prosecution case against Mr John Elliott, the Melbourne-based businessman and former head of the Elders IXL group, in relation to an alleged ADollars 66.5m (Pounds 32m) sham foreign exchange transaction, was described yesterday as 'not a strong one' by the magistrate overseeing the committal hearing. Mr Graham Hicks, the magistrate, adjourned the hearing until next week, when the prosecution is due to make a final submission. He is due to rule on whether Mr Elliott, a prominent figure in Australian business circles in the 1980s and former president of the Liberal party, and other former Elders IXL executives should stand trial over the matter early next month. They are facing charges of theft and conspiracy. Yesterday, Mr Hicks said he was outlining his tentative view on the case. He said that there appeared to be an 'abundance of evidence' to indicate that there was a sham foreign exchange deal, but that the key question was what involvement Mr Elliott and Mr Peter Scanlon, another key Elders executive, had in this.</p>

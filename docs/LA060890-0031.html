			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE OVERRULES BID TO LINK CIA, DRUG LORDS IN CAMARENA TRIAL  </P> <P> A defense lawyer in the Enrique Camarena murder trial attempted to ask a key  prosecution witness Thursday whether he knew of any ties between major Mexican  drug traffickers and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency but a federal judge  prohibited the witness from answering.  </P> <P> Attorney Mary Kelly's question came during cross-examination of Laurence Victor  Harrison, a government-paid witness who had extensive dealings with both  Mexican law enforcement and drug traffickers. Harrison said there was a close  working relationship between the drug lords and prominent Mexican police  officials.  </P> <P> Harrison's testimony came during the fourth week of trial for four men who are  accused of involvement in the February, 1985, murder of Camarena, a U.S. Drug  Enforcement Administration agent.  </P> <P> The possible CIA link came after Kelly attempted to probe Harrison further.  </P> <P> At one point, Harrison testified that he had told drug kingpin Ernesto Fonseca  Carrillo, for whom he had installed a sophisticated radio system, that law  enforcement might go after him (Fonseca).  </P> <P> "He told me I was crazy," Harrison recalled. "He told me there was no danger."  </P> <P> Then the witness was asked, "Did Fonseca say it (his feeling of safety) was a  political thing?" Harrison replied, "Yes."  </P> <P> Kelly moved closer to the possible CIA link when she questioned Harrison about  Sergio Espino Verdin, a commander in Mexico's federal security directorate  (DFS), an internal security and investigative agency with close ties to the  PRI, Mexico's dominant political party. Harrison said he worked for Espino, a  close ally of Fonseca, who is currently in prison in Mexico after a conviction  for his involvement in Camarena's murder.  </P> <P> Harrison told the jury that Espino reported to Miguel Nazar Haro, who was DFS  director from 1977 to 1982, when he was forced to resign after it was revealed  that he was involved in a cross-border car smuggling ring.  </P> <P> The Nazar case was controversial in the United States and Mexico. William  Kennedy, then-U.S. attorney in San Diego, pressed the Justice Department in  Washington to indict Nazar, despite protests from U.S. officials in Mexico that  Nazar was "an essential repeat essential contact for CIA station Mexico City."  </P> <P> Kennedy was fired, but ultimately Nazar was indicted by a federal grand jury in  San Diego and is still considered a fugitive in the United States.  </P> <P> Harrison called Nazar his "overboss" and said Nazar was involved in drug  trafficking.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Kelly asked Harrison if Nazar was connected to the CIA. Prosecutor  Manuel Medrano objected on the grounds that the question was irrelevant to the  case. U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie sustained the objection.  </P> <P> Later, however, outside the presence of the jury, Kelly told the judge why she  thought questions about the CIA were relevant to the Camarena case.  </P> <P> "Fonseca thought his actions were condoned by the Mexican government, as well  as sanctioned by the CIA," she said. "This goes to the issue of whether this  was an illegal enterprise" and could help her client in her defense.  </P> <P> Among the charges against the four defendants who are on trial here are violent  crimes in aid of a racketeering enterprise.  </P> <P> Kelly said she wanted to reserve the right to call Harrison back for more  cross-examination. Rafeedie told her to submit a brief but no timetable was  set.  </P> <P> The defense lawyer said she was prompted to ask some of these questions because  of an interview that Harrison gave to DEA agents last September, a copy of  which was recently provided to the defense. In the interview, Harrison said  that Fonseca and another drug kingpin, Javier Barba Hernandez, talked to Cubans  in 1983 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Guadalajara about drug trafficking.  </P> <P> "They told me about it," Harrison told the DEA. "Barba also told me that they  could do whatever they wanted with the Americans or the Cubans. I took that to  mean they could do deals with the Americans or the Cubans."  </P> <P> Harrison also told the DEA that Fonseca met with an American involved in drug  smuggling who said he was "working with the Contras," a reference to  U.S.-financed rebel troops in Nicaragua. He said this man, who was unnamed and  told him he had been a mercenary in South Africa and also worked in El  Salvador, asked him a lot of questions about airstrips.  </P> <P> "I told him if he got close to the border that he'd have trouble with U.S.  radar," Harrison told the DEA. "He said he was the U.S., that he didn't have  any problem. He could do anything that they wanted."  </P> <P> In another development Thursday, Rafeedie ruled that prosecutors could play  tapes of narcotics traffickers interrogating Camarena shortly before they  murdered him. Prosecutor Medrano indicated that the government would start  playing the Spanish tapes, accompanied by English translations displayed on a  screen, today.  </P> <P> Times staff writer John H.

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> OAKLEY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IN RETURN TO LINEUP  </P> <P> Charles Oakley didn't ease his way back into the lineup. He pushed and shoved,  leading the New York Knicks to a 100-95 victory Thursday night over the Atlanta  Hawks at New York.  </P> <P> Oakley, returning after missing three games with an injury, played 36 minutes  and sparked an 18-5 run in the fourth quarter as the Knicks won for the 10th  time in 11 games.  </P> <P> Oakley, who had sprained ligament in his right knee, scored 15 points and  grabbed 12 rebounds.  </P> <P> "At the start of the game, I was rushing everything," he said. "I was too  excited. I made some quick fouls and some bad outlet passes. When I got back to  the bench, I just told myself to calm down. I'm just glad to be back and  contribute."  </P> <P> Gerald Wilkins led the Knicks with 23 points, and Patrick Ewing had 19 points  and 11 rebounds.  </P> <P> Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins scored 24 points despite nine-of-31 shooting and  grabbed 13 rebounds. The Hawks have lost three of their last four games and  three in a row on the road.  </P> <P> The Knicks outscored the Hawks, 32-20, in the third quarter to build an 82-70  lead, but Atlanta closed to 82-78 early in the final period.  </P> <P> Ewing, the NBA's third-leading scorer, failed to score in the first quarter and  finished with only four points in the half.  </P> <P> Denver 112, Sacramento 98 -- A sellout crowd gave departing coach Jerry  Reynolds a standing ovation, but Denver's Walter Davis spoiled the occasion  with 27 points as the Nuggets beat the Kings in Sacramento.  </P> <P> A crowd of 17,014 at Arco Arena gave Reynolds a one-minute ovation before his  final game as coach.

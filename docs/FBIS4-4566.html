			<p>BFN     [Text] Urasoe -- The Urasoe City Assembly (chaired by  Ichiro Akamine), at its March regular plenary session on 31  March, unanimously adopted a "statement opposing the relocation  of Naha Military Port." The assembly also unanimously adopted a  "resolution calling for the expansion of harbor areas near Naha  Port" in order to promote the second reclamation project, and a  "statement calling for an early lifting of the ban on the use by  civilians of water areas that are now used exclusively by  Makiminato Supply Depot."    The statement against relocating Naha Military Port said,  "there are news reports of plans to relocate Naha Military Port  to Makiminato Supply Depot."    It continued: "The relocation could greatly impede a  reclamation project that Urasoe City plans to promote. We  absolutely do not approve of the relocation."    Explaining why the ruling party supported the statement  against the relocation of the military port, assembly member  Genichi Uehara said: "The alleged secret agreement on the  relocation of Naha Military Port has turned out to be  groundless. Successive mayors of Urasoe City have opposed the  relocation."    The statement against the relocation of Naha Military Port  will be mailed to the prime minister, the foreign minister, the  transport minister, the director general of the Defense Agency,  the director general of Okinawa Development Agency, the director  general of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, the  governor of Okinawa Prefecture, and Okinawan officials in charge  of managing major ports in Naha City.    The resolution calling for the expansion of harbor areas  near  Naha Port was adopted by the assembly on the basis of an  agreement concluded between the mayors of Naha and Urasoe  Cities. Under the agreement, Urasoe City, not Naha City, is in  charge of managing the waterfront areas, and will meet the costs  of reclaiming land along the waterfront. The resolution was  adopted by a vote of 15-4.    A statement on the resolution issued by Naha City said: "It  is best if the assembly adopts the resolution unanimously, but  this is a case where it cannot do so."    In response, Urasoe City plans to ask the Naha City Harbor  Deliberation Council for advice on how to expand the waterfront  areas available for reclamation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "gw": "Better Export Opportunities Make West </F> German Industry More Confident"]    [Text] Munich -- The west German manufacturing industry  still considers itself to be in a bad situation, but the number  of negative reports is continuing to decline, according to the  latest poll on the economic situation conducted by the Ifo  Institute for Economic Research.    Prospects for the future have also somewhat improved,  because  of better export opportunities. Ifo was also able to establish  that the business climate in east German industry picked up in  December 1993, following the gloom of the previous month.    December orders in west German industry were almost at the  same level as in the previous month. Ifo noted that although  output remained almost unchanged, stocks were not as high. The  institute's experts still consider the level of unfilled orders  unsatisfactory, although they now cover a period of 2.6 months  and have somewhat increased compared to September. Utilization  of production capacity also somewhat increased according to Ifo  and rose to 79 (September 78) percent. Company production plans  for the next few months tend less and less toward cutting down  on production.    In the meantime, some reductions in prices have already been  noted in the production of preproducts and capital goods.  Contrary to the trend at the end of the year, Ifo expects very  slight price increases over the next few months. Price  increases in the western Germany's retail trade are also  expected to be markedly lower than a year ago. Although the  business climate in the retail trade was considered less  negative than in the previous month, retailers want to place  fewer orders in the coming months. Ultimately, retailers  continue to take a very skeptical view of how business will  develop over the next six months.    Things are also looking up for the manufacturers of  preproducts, because companies have noted somewhat higher  demand, which has enabled them to reduce stocks. That also  applies to the chemical industry. The industry has even  described business as good. In the capital goods industry too,  the number of companies reporting that business was bad has  fallen. Because of increased optimism in the industry with  regard to exports, the future is being viewed with less  skepticism. Thus, manufacturers of capital goods in the  electrical engineering industry want to increase output over the  next few months.    Since the spring of 1993, business for manufacturers of  consumer goods has been unsatisfactory, although there was  something of an improvement in December, according to Ifo.  Better prospects for exports have also led to an optimistic  assessment of future trends. In the case of automakers, although  orders were somewhat lower in December, a more positive view was  taken of exports. Output in the automobile industry will remain  static. In the consumer goods sector, there is pessimism about  prospects for the next months, especially as orders have dropped.    In eastern Germany, Ifo has noted that assessments of the  current business climate are not only better, but there is also  cautious optimism about the future. In December, both domestic  and foreign orders increased more markedly that in the previous  month. Although orders have now increased to cover 3.2  (September: 3.1) months, over half the companies questioned by  Ifo report that orders are insufficient. Utilization of  capacity was 75 percent (72 percent), three percentage points  higher than in September.    Although east German industrial output is continuing to  rise,  employment is still being reduced. However, in the future, Ifo  expects reductions in personnel to proceed more slowly than over  the next three months, the total number of employees should only  decline by 3 percent.</p>

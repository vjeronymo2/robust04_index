The African National Congress concluded its National  Reconstruction and Strategy Conference today, 23rd January 1994,  at Nasrec [conference center], Johannesburg.    The conference was called following a decision of the  National Executive Committee [NEC] in October 1992. The  conference involved delegations from ANC branches and regions,  representatives of the trade unions and other sectoral  organisations, the South African Communist Party, and parties  and organisations from the Patriotic Front.    Our national conference was the culmination of a process  that  grew up from the branch and regional level, entailing in-depth  discussion and elaboration of a reconstruction and development  programme, whose object is the creation of a coherent,  integrated policy framework to mobilise the people and the  resources of our country for the eradication of racial  oppression.    The ANC's reconstruction and development programme is  directed at uprooting the institutionalised injustices rooted in  our country's history of colonial conquest, racism and apartheid  which have resulted in massive poverty cheek by jowl with wealth  and power. The South African economy has been built by the  efforts of all in this country. Over decades it has been  systematically structured to serve the dominant white racial  minority, which has employed its exclusive control over  political power to enforce racial division in every facet of our  national life.    South African society is consequently deeply scarred by  racially determined inequalities. A handful of white owned  conglomerates dominate South African industry, finance and  commerce. Legally entrenched cheap labour policies, a racist  system of education and training, and studied neglect of  adequate fiscal provision for black education have resulted in a  virtual white monopoly of skills and the professions. Our  country's workforce produces far below its potential capacity  and is ill-equipped to cope with the rapid shifts in the  international economy. Small business remains severely stunted  and under-developed. Large corporations refuse to invest  adequately in research and development. South Africa has been  consigned to the status of a net producer and exporter of raw  materials, its manufacturing sector remains uncompetitive.    The undemocratic state structure that underpinned this is  both illegitimate and unrepresentative of the diverse racial,  cultural, class and gender composition of the South African  people. The state is consequently unsuited to the absolutely  necessary the purposes of reconstruction and social  transformation.    South Africa's approaching democratic elections, which are  the outcome of more than a century of struggles waged by masses  of our people, through their national liberation movement, the  trade unions, women's movements, civic organisations, student  bodies, the churches and other formations, hold out the promise  of building a better life for all the people of our country.  The ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme builds on  this shared heritage of struggle and democratic yearnings for a  just society.    For this potential of our country to be realised the people  of South Africa must harness the resources of our country in a  comprehensive strategy to raise our country and its people out  of the present crisis.    The National Reconstruction and Strategy Conference centred  on a study of the sixth draft of the Reconstruction and  Development Programme (RDP) in ten commissions stretching over  two days. Conference also produced a number of resolutions,  arising from commission discussions, which will form the basis  of a policy thrust and legislative programme for our country's  first democratic government.    Conference agreed that the indispensable condition for the  implementation and realisation of the RDP is a decisive victory  for the ANC electoral front on 27th April. The attainment of  political office by an ANC-led government of national unity,  will be the first step towards the incremental and steady  empowerment of all those who have been historically deprived and  disadvantaged on the basis of race, gender or class in our  society.    The RDP posits an integrated, coordinated plan that combines  reconstruction and development with a thorough democratisation  of South African society to unleash the energies and creativity  of our people. Fighting poverty and deprivation, with the  active involvement of those most afflicted by it, will be the  priority of the democratic government. The task of building one  South African nation, made up of people united in their  diversity, will remain elusive unless the inequalities and  disparities created by apartheid are swiftly overcome.    Conference affirmed that all participants will return to  their branches, regions, organisatons and sectors, with the firm  resolve to spare no efforts in working for a convincing ANC  victory in the forthcoming elections so as to ensure the speedy  implementation of this Reconstruction and Development Programme.</p>

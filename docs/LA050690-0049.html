			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENDING U.S. AID TO EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> The editorial "El Salvador -- a Big Question" (April 17) goes a long way toward  recognizing the futility and the immorality of U.S. intervention in El  Salvador. Yet in the end it accepts the logic that has kept U.S. arms aid  fueling the war for the last decade.  </P> <P> "Without outside aid," you say, "El Salvador's war-ravaged economy would  collapse." But for most Salvadorans, with the notable exception of the  oligarchic and military elite, the economy already has collapsed. More than  half the adult work force is unemployed, and living standards have plummeted.  </P> <P> Against the aid cutoff proposed by several congressional leaders, you argue  that such a move might tempt "leftist rebels to try and strike a knockout  blow." But it is clearly the hard-line right in the government and the army,  and not the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), that would prefer  a military solution at this point.  </P> <P> A cutoff of U.S. aid would help produce progress toward a negotiated political  settlement, with concessions made by both sides.  </P> <P> But even if, as seems unlikely, an aid cutoff were to bring about the outright  collapse of the Cristiani govennment, its replacement would most likely be a  coalition of all the democratic opposition forces on the center and left,  including the Christian Democrats, the social democratic parties, and the FMLN.  Such a reformist government would be a vast improvement over the nightmarish  regime now in power.  </P> <P> Until we back up our professed concern for human rights by halting all arms  aid, the war will continue and the negotiations under way now in Geneva will  achieve little.  </P> <P> MICHAEL J. DAVIS  </P> <P> Executive Director, El Salvador  </P> <P> Institute for Democratic Development  </P> <P> San Francisco  </P></p>

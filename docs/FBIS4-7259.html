			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Chae Hui-muk] </F>   [Text] Domestic business groups, including Hyundai and  Samsung, have been busy in preparing measures to cope with the  rapidly changing trade environment after the Uruguay Round  accord was signed by more than 120 nations in Marrakesh last  week.    Few clauses of the accord affecting Korea were changed,  except the agricultural sector, during the last week's  ministerial conference in the Moroccan city as the accord  formulated on Dec. 15 last year has remained untouched.    But wider opening of the domestic car market became a hot  issue at bilateral trade ministers talks with the United States  and the European Union (EU).    Observers viewed that Korea will be obliged to open the car  market wider as the two countries have insisted on it.    Environment and labor issues are expected to be closely  linked with trade as the Green Round (GR) and Blue Round (BR)  are expected to be the next global issues to the Uruguay Round  which has created a world trade "watchdog," the World Trade  Organization (WTO).    The observers forecast that the two issues will be an  obstacle to expansion of Korea's exports with environment  protection and labor rights in Korea are still below the  standard of advanced nations.    First of all, domestic auto manufacturers are expected to  face a flood of foreign cars in view of strong pressure from the  United States and the EU to allow easier access of their  manufacturers to the Korean car market.    U.S. automakers insist that Korea lower tariff rates on  foreign cars from 10 percent to the 2.5 percent imposed by the  U.S. government and that the acquisition tax on deluxe cars  valued at 70 million won or more be slashed from 15 percent to 2  percent.    They also called on Korea to advance the abolition of  restrictions on the acreage of indoor exhibition of their cars  slated for Jan. 1, 1996, and on advertisements in domestic media.    Advanced nations are expected to put more pressure on Korea  to open its markets wider through bilateral and multilateral  negotiations on the occasion of the inauguration of the WTO as  seen in the automobile sector.    In this changing environment, domestic business groups have  been forming teams exclusively for trade negotiations on both  group and subsidiary firm levels, while allocating more trade  negotiation experts.    Samsung Group has installed an environmental research  institute in the secretariat office to prepare for possible  green ground negotiations and has increased the number of trade  negotiation experts in subsidiary firms to cope with frequent  anti-dumping suits in advanced nations.    Hyundai Group has diverted some 50 trade experts in Hyundai  Corp. to automobile and shipbuilding subsidiaries which are  expected to face an uphill battle with foreigners.    Lucky-Goldstar, Daewoo and Pohang Iron and Steel Co. have  been training trade experts by region and commodity.    But analysts said that the UR accord will be favorable to  domestic manufacturers, except agriculture, the wholesale and  retail sector and intellectual properties.    They forecast that exports will increase sharply but imports  will not grow as fast as the exports do.    Steel and petrochemical manufacturers will benefit most as  tariffs will be reduced to zero in 10 years.    The steel industry, in top notch shape in competitiveness,  is  expected to increase products due to a gradual tariff rate cut  to zero, while benefiting from decreasing tariff on raw  materials of iron ore and coking coal, the analysts said.    The petrochemical industry will witness similar benefits as  tariff rates of trading partners are high at 20-200 percent  compared to 9 percent imposed by Korea. Tariff rates are to be  cut gradually to zero over 10 years.    In the electronics sector, Korea's exports are predicted to  increase, while foreign products are expected to rapidly make  inroads into the domestic market as well. A plus factor is that  more than 60 percent of domestic electronics production are  exported. In particular, more than 90 percent of semi-conductor  production is exported.    In the textile sector, Korea's exports will be little  affected for the time being as an import quota exists for 10  years with each item gradually being liberalized in import as  demanded by Korea in the Uruguay Round talks.    But the domestic textile industry needs to switch from  low-price items to high value-added ones to turn away any  challenges of developing nations.    But general machinery is expected to flood the nation as  Korean manufacturers heavily depend on foreign products, the  analysts said. Scrapping subsidies will only drive domestic  makers out of their domestic markets, they said.</p>

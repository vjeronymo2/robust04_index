			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 'HOME SWEET HOME' HAS A STICKY PROBLEM  </P> <P> Allen and Annette Clausen never thought much about the meaning of "home sweet  home" until they found a 6-foot-long, 300-pound beehive oozing honey inside a  wall of their new house.  </P> <P> An additional 50 pounds of honeycomb were found above a ceiling panel. Honey  was dripping down walls and spilling onto floors. Hundreds of bees killed by  fumigators last month were under the kitchen stove and behind fireplace tiles.  Some live bees have returned.  </P> <P> The Clausens bought the three-bedroom house last month from the U.S. Department  of Veteran Affairs for $78,500. It had been vacant for two years.  </P></p>

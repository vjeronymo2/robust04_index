			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods ready to put itself up for sale Attwoods, the UK waste services group, is today expected to promise shareholders it will put itself up for sale if investors reject the hostile Pounds 364m cash bid from Browning-Ferris Industries of the US. The company is likely to present shareholders with a series of alternatives to the BFI bid, which it believes will give investors more value than the hostile 109p offer. The options are thought to range from asset disposals to a promise to put Attwoods on the block if the bid fails. 'We have got to put forward concrete proposals,' said a company adviser. 'Investors have to believe we will deliver that value.' Today is the last day under the UK takeover code that Attwoods can publish any new financial information. Yesterday, the company geared up for its final defence with a widely expected document showing an improvement in the first quarter. Operating profits rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 15.4m, on sales 10 per cent higher at Dollars 151.3m for the three months to October 31. In sterling terms, operating profits were 2 per cent higher at Pounds 9.8m, on sales 5 per cent ahead to Pounds 96.7m. 'The profit estimate supports our recent comments on the outlook for 1995 as a whole,' Attwoods said. Attwoods also published an independent valuation of its UK property assets, which it said 'demonstrated the inadequacy of BFI's offer'. Chartered surveyors Grimley JR Eve revalued the UK assets upwards by Pounds 33m to Pounds 130.6m. 'BFI's bid takes no account of the underlying value of the UK assets,' Attwoods said. On both earnings and sales multiples, BFI's offer undervalued Attwoods, the company said. BFI attacked the profits figures as 'dismal'. 'The operating profit increase is less than we were anticipating,' said Mr Philip Angell of BFI. 'We had expected something closer to double digit growth.' Furthermore, operating margins had fallen and Attwoods had underperformed in the first quarter compared with other waste companies which showed on average 54 per cent growth. 'Attwoods shareholders should not take any comfort from these numbers,' said Mr Angell. The bidder said it would send shareholders a more detailed response following Attwoods' final document tomorrow. BFI has until November 18 to increase its offer. Attwoods is being advised by Robert Fleming, SG Warburg, and Smith Barney. CS First Boston are BFI's advisers.</p>

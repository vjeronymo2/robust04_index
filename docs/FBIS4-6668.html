			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 21 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] In connection with the issue of how to deal with the  DPRK's suspected development of nuclear weapons, which is one of  the focal issues in the ruling coalition parties' ongoing policy  coordination meeting, a government source said on the morning of  20 April that if a naval blockade is implemented as part of  economic sanctions by the UN Security Council, Japan "will not  participate in sanctions premised on the use of force." He thus  indicated that Japan will not participate in such a naval  blockade.    While a blockade is meant to ensure the effectiveness of  economic sanctions, and no use of force is involved in the  objective and mission of such an action, "corresponding  measures" are permitted under "certain conditions"--for  instance, if the other party resorts to armed resistance.</p>

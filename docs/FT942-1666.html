			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / People: 'Minister without portfolio' becomes chairman of Barclays Metals Group Barclays Metals Group, part of the UK banking organisation, is gearing up for a further phase of expansion with the appointment of Chris Green, one of the best-known personalities in the London metals business, as chairman. It is also recruiting Peter Sellars, at present managing director of the metals division of BICC Cables. Sellars becomes deputy chief executive, working alongside Laurence Jones, also deputy chief executive of BMG, as well as managing director of Barclays Metals Ltd, a ring-dealing member of the London Metal Exchange. BMG has grown quickly since Barclays decided to enter the metals business about three years ago. Green, now 59 and with 36 years' experience in the industry, joined as a director soon afterwards. He had previously been forced out of Cerro Metals, where he was chief executive, because the new American owners were unhappy about his spending so much time as chairman of the LME board. Leaving Cerro meant that Green was no longer eligible to serve as an LME director so he ended up losing not just one job, but two. He said yesterday he no longer harboured ambitions for an LME appointment and, in any case, the BMG chairmanship would give him a 'higher profile' in the industry. He had been 'like a minister without portfolio' since joining Barclays, in that he had no particular responsibility. Meanwhile, Sellars' role at BMG will be to concentrate on strategic development and Jones will continue to have responsibility for, among other things, Barclays' LME activities. Both report to Robert Mainprize, the chief executive.</p>

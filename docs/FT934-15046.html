			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (25): Stamp of disapproval THE British Post Office faced the stamp of official disapproval when it inadvertently breached an EC public purchasing requirement. In one of a number of complaints against the UK for failing to follow the rules, the Post Office purchasing and supply department in Swindon came adrift when it put out an invitation to tender for polypropylene mail bags. The contract notice advertised in the Official Journal did not make it clear that evidence of financial standing and technical ability would be required before tender documents were issued. Consequently, a German bidder complained about lack of information in the notice and the German Ministry of Economics took up his case. Initially, it raised the matter informally with the British Treasury, which stopped the case going any further by admitting that this was a breach of the open procedure public purchasing rules. In the Post Office's defence, the Treasury said that Swindon was unfamiliar with the open procedure, and that the German company was invited to express interest in future contracts as they arose. This satisfied the German bidder and the matter was resolved.</p>

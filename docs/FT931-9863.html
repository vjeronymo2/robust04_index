			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Letter: Classroom peace threatened by dogma and bureaucracy (1) Sir, Your leading article, 'Classroom peace' (February 9), makes eminent commonsense. Teachers, for totally professional reasons and not because they are so-called 'trendy lefties' intent on a fight with the government, sincerely believe that students will suffer if the government this summer presses ahead with its publication of English tests for 14-year-olds. My union agrees with your conclusion, that the way out is for the government to concede with good grace a year's delay in publishing the test results. Sadly Mr John Patten, the education secretary, appears unwilling to listen. Instead he appears to be looking for confrontation through a crude, old-fashioned exercise of teacher-bashing. He would receive praise not derision from teachers, and indeed parents, if he put the interest of pupils before a dogmatic desire to discredit a very caring profession. Peter Smith, general secretary, Association of Teachers and Lecturers, 7 Northumberland Street, London WC2N 5DA</p>

She said, firstly, it was Azerbaijan that together with the  former Soviet 4th Army carried out the forcible deportation of  thousands of Karabakh Armenians in the spring and summer of  1991. Secondly, as she went on, it was Azerbaijan which imposed  fierce economic blockades on Armenia and Karabakh that are gross  violations of human rights. Thirdly, it was Azerbaijan which  first used weapons of indiscriminate destruction against  Karabakh civilian people, including Grad multiple-missile rocket  launchers, that Baroness Cox witnessed herself while visiting  Stepanakert. Fourthly, only Azerbaijan has used aerial  bombardment of Karabakh populated areas. And, fifthly, only  Azerbaijan has used ground-to-air missiles against civilians.    As Baroness Cox affirmed, all these ways were used by  Azerbaijan to drive out completely Armenians from Karabakh. She  reminded of former Azerbaijan President Elchibey's words: "If  there is a single Armenian living in Nagorno-Karabakh in  October, the people of Azerbaijan can take me and hang me in the  central square of Baku". It is hard to find more convincing  proofs of Azerbaijan leadership's real intentions, she concluded.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Wace placing to raise Pounds 6.27m Wace Group, the pre-press and specialist printing concern, has agreed with de Zoete &amp; Bevan the placing of 3.69m new 20p shares at 170p each, to raise Pounds 6.27m before costs. The directors said the proceeds will be used for the early termination of a number of operating leases on printing equipment; to fund the surrender of an empty leasehold property in New York at a cost of Pounds 800,000, and to pay for the group's final earn-out obligations, which are estimated at Pounds 1.6m and due to be paid next April. They added that the primary objective during 1994 and 1995 was the continued reduction of borrowings through strong operational cash flow.</p>

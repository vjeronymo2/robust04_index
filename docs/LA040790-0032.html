			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIMBAUGH'S HECKLERS  </P> <P> I watched the sabotage of Limbaugh in disgust. Apparently satire is supposed to  be the exclusive province of the left, to be dished out to the sacred cows of  conservatives with glee, but never to be taken in kind.  </P> <P> I have enjoyed the right-bashing comedy of the Smothers Brothers, Norman Lear  and "Saturday Night Live" over the years, but it is refreshing to finally hear  the volley returned -- not by some Wally George pinhead but by an articulate  wag with an ironic sense of pompous self-parody.  </P> <P> WILLIAM S.

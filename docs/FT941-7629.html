			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Canada cuts industrial input duties Competitive pressures on Canadian manufacturers caused by free-trade agreements with the US and Mexico have led Ottawa to propose a unilateral cut in customs duties on a wide range of industrial inputs. One customs official estimated that about 1,500 items would be covered, notably electronic and other components. The cuts, announced by Mr Paul Martin, finance minister, in Tuesday's federal budget, will be part of a sweeping three-year review of the tariff structure by the Finance Department. That review is likely to include the rounding out of decimal points in specific customs duties, elimination of low 'nuisance' duties, and other measures to simplify and improve the transparency of tariffs. According to budget documents, the tariff structure has become increasingly complex and costly to administer, partly as a result of multilateral trade-liberalisation exercises, such as the recently concluded Uruguay Round. The 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement and the recently implemented North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) have put many Canadian industries at a disadvantage to US counterparts, which pay lower duties on raw materials, parts and components imported from third countries. The impact has been mitigated up to now by duty drawbacks, under which customs duties are refunded on inputs used for goods which are eventually exported. Under the US-Canada FTA and Nafta, however, drawbacks on goods shipped to the US and Mexico are due to be eliminated on January 1 1996. The US accounts for three-quarters of Canada's export trade.</p>

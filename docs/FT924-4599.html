			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Survey of Chicago - A Centre For Finance and Industry (7): Gambling for jobs - A casino? The stakes are high, the decision is near / Barbara Harrison discusses a plan that would bring a massive gambling operation to a large metropolitan US city for the first time IT IS a sign of the times and of Chicago's fiscal fortunes. The city, whose job base has dramatically shifted away from manufacturing to services, is backing a controversial proposal for a Dollars 2bn casino complex as its next best hope for economic development. The plan, if approved, would mark the first time that a massive gambling operation has been established in a major metropolitan US city. The project was proposed earlier this year by three of the gaming industry's biggest players, Circus Circus, Caesars World and Hilton Hotels, all publicly traded companies. But in order for the project to go ahead, it must win approval in the Illinois legislature. The vote, in a special session, is due in the coming week and is expected to be close. The project's promises are sweeping. It would theoretically create over 35,000 permanent jobs, provide annual tax revenues of Dollars 500m for the state and the city, and increase tourist spending by over Dollars 5bn. These estimates are enough to seduce many a city, and Mayor Richard Daley knows that if Chicago does not win approval for the project, another will gladly accept the investment. No tax incentives are involved. Gambling is being used increasingly in the US to raise tax revenues. According to Mr Owen Youngman, assistant managing editor for financial news at the Chicago Tribune: 'It is foolish to pretend that it won't come to major cities.' Moreover, if the spread of gambling cannot be contained, analysts say there is value, with tourism in mind, in being the first large city to have a casino complex. But the project has provoked spirited opposition. Its most important opponent, however, is Illinois governor Jim Edgar, a Republican. Mr Edgar, no fan of gambling, says there is enough of it in the state already, what with horse racing, river-boat casinos and a lottery. These gambling interests are against the casino as unwanted competition. Among the arguments of other opponents is that gambling tax is a regressive taxation, preying on those with the least to lose. Some also feel that the casino business is alloyed with organised crime and its unsavory trades like prostitution. Chicago, once a mob mecca, has spent years living down that reputation, and many Chicagoans do not want it revived. Yet the state's largest business organisation, the Illinois Chamber of Commerce, has backed the casino plan, as has one of Chicago's most prestigious clubs of chief executives, the civic committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago. Mr Daley has helped win Chicago business support with a pledge to phase out its onerous head tax of Dollars 5 a month on every employee. He also attempted to sweeten the deal for state legislators with the suggestion of a Dollars 1bn bond offer to improve state schools. While these ploys may win some supporters, a single fact has convinced many others: such large-scale private investments in older cities are scarce. Mr Daley said he tells casino opponents: 'If you have an alternative, I'll listen.' But he adds: 'No one has walked through my door.' If Mr Daley loses in the legislature, no other large project that would create as many permanent jobs seems to be waiting in the wings. Last summer, he lost a bid for legislative approval of the other major project for the city, a Dollars 10bn third international airport. It is conceivable that this could be revived at a future date, though the mayor is giving no hints. Job-creating investments, particularly larger-scale manufacturing, are not easily attracted to the city. They are discouraged by a 7.3 per cent corporate income tax, the city's heavy union presence and the scarcity of large land parcels. Most sites are on the small side, and many have daunting environmental liabilities. Chicago, with a population close to 3m, has been haemorrhaging manufacturing jobs for two decades. Between 1970 and 1990, the city itself lost half of its manufacturing jobs, some 219,000. The loss was nearly double that in the metropolitan area, which includes the surrounding counties and the city with a total population 6m. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago predicts that, between 1990 and 2000, metropolitan Chicago will have suffered an additional loss of 12,000 to 15,000 manufacturing jobs, with makers of electrical machinery especially hard hit. But in economic terms, there is little reason for gloom. While manufacturing jobs have evaporated, productivity gains have kept the gross product rising; and that trend, too, is expected to continue through 2012. Moreover, the decline in manufacturing jobs has been largely offset so far by increases in service jobs, and, during this decade, the Fed predicts a further substantial increase in service employment. Diane Swonk, regional economist for the First National Bank of Chicago, warns, however, that the new service jobs that are being created are not for the low-skilled. 'That's the biggest challenge for Chicago, the mismatch in jobs and skill levels,' she said. Mr Daley believes the casino project would help the city to ease unemployment among the lower skilled. He may be right, but many hope, nonetheless, that the casino is not symbolic of where the city is heading.</p>

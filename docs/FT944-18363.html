			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Observer: Hot-footed Football talent scouts must already be booking their flights for Buenos Aires. The goalkeeper of Argentine championship leaders Velez Sarsfield - Jose Luis Chilavert - is making something of a name for himself . . . as a goal-scorer. At the weekend Chilavert, an international player for Paraguay, scored a last minute goal with a 25-metre free kick, giving his team a 1-0 victory over Deportivo Espanol. Chilavert begged to be allowed to take the kick, much to the obvious grumpiness of team captain Roberto Trotta. Trotta only gave in when Chilavert refused to return to his goal. Chilavert's team-mates went wild when he scored; Trotta did not join in. Sour grapes or what?</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Tea There was good general demand, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Coloury liquoring Assams met keen competition and prices advanced 4 to 8 pence. Plainer North Indians remained about steady. Bright East Africans were irregular and closed 2 to 4 pence easier but mediums were well supported at fully firm rates. Better liquoring Ceylons held firm but poorer sorts were often eaiser. Medium Zimbabwe, Ceylon and Kenya teas sold well at last levels but plainer descriptions were lower where sold. Quotations: best available 160p/kg, good 135p/kg, good medium 125p/kg, medium 110p/kg, low medium 78p/kg. The highest price realised this week was 161p/kg for a Kenya pf. 1.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / People: Smooth transition at Tenneco When Dana Mead, Tenneco's new president and CEO, was recruited in 1991 to be second-in-command to Mike Walsh, Tenneco's chief, he jumped at the chance to work with an old friend on the challenge of restructuring a diversified industrial company, writes Laurie Morse. Barely a year later, Walsh announced he was fighting inoperable brain cancer and Mead quickly shouldered many of the CEO's responsibilities. Last month, 51-year-old Walsh took indefinite medical leave and Mead formally took over as Tenneco's head. Walsh remains Tenneco's chairman. The transition was so smooth it caused barely a ripple on Wall Street, where the silver-haired 58-year-old Mead is both well-known and respected. A West Point graduate and former US Army colonel who served in West Germany and Vietnam, Mead is widely expected to continue with the company's restructuring. In 1993 Tenneco had sales of Dollars 13.3bn and net income of Dollars 426m or Dollars 2.44 per share. Mead is already credited with a remarkable turnaround at Tenneco's largest division, the Wisconsin-based JI Case. When he arrived in 1991, Case, which manufactures heavy farm and construction machinery, logged Dollars 1bn in losses on Dollars 4bn in sales. Last year, only a year into a three-year restructuring plan directed by Mead, Case had operating profits of Dollars 82m. Before coming to Tenneco, Mead spent 14 years at International Paper, directing modernisation and expansion there. Like Walsh, Mead held an internship at the White House, and is well-connected in Washington. He holds a doctorate in political science and economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>

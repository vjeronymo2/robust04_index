			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition behind 26% advance to Pounds 1m at Bostrom BOSTROM, the vehicle seating and specialist engineering group, lifted pre-tax profits by 26 per cent to Pounds 1m in the six months to June 30 thanks to the acquisition in February of AJW Holdings and the turnround to profits of its joint venture. The improvement, from Pounds 796,000, was struck on turnover of Pounds 24.2m (Pounds 17.1m) of which AJW, a fellow automotive components maker acquired for an initial Pounds 1.79m, contributed Pounds 3.66m. Operating profits were flat, though AJW chipped in Pounds 135,000. Interest payable rose to Pounds 231,000 (Pounds 201,000) because of the Pounds 2m debt that AJW carried, but Bostrom benefited from a Pounds 160,000 profits (deficit Pounds 73,000) contribution from BFA UK, the joint venture making seating frames and components for Jaguar. Mr Colin Howell, managing director, said the group had seen higher sales to both Jaguar - 'admittedly from a very low base' - and Land Rover, where the Discovery had greatly increased volumes. Volumes were also up at Rover and Honda and, even though they fell at Ford, Bostrom lifted its market share there. Continental Europe was 'hurting the seating division, but this was compensated for by Japan, Australia and the improved UK market,' said Mr Howell. Mr Howell said that current order books were 'much stronger' than they had been a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 5.1p (4.5p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p.</p>

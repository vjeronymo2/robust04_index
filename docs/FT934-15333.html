			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: HK group issues China convertible HENDERSON Land, the Hong Kong property developer, has issued HKDollars 3.12bn (USDollars 405m) in bonds which convert into shares in its unlisted subsidiary, Henderson China. Henderson is the latest in a growing list of property companies which are capitalising on low interest rates and renewed global interest in Hong Kong shares, by issuing convertible preference shares or bonds. The bonds have a three-year life and pay a coupon of 4 per cent. They can be redeemed at par, or converted into shares in Henderson China upon its initial public offering. There is no guarantee that the company will be successfully listed. The share price of Henderson Land climbed 19 per cent yesterday with the issue apparently implying substantial value to the group's China assets. An independent audit has given an estimated net tangible assets per share for Henderson Land of HKDollars 42.69, against yesterday's closing price of HKDollars 28.70. Mr Lee Shau-kee, chairman of Henderson, said the move 'provides funds for our China property business and creates an opportunity for investors specifically interested in China'. Hong Kong investors have tended to shun companies with Chinese property interests, due to concerns over the impact of the austerity programme in China. Overseas institutions have been less concerned. New World Development, a Hong Kong property developer with substantial Chinese exposure, reacted to local fears recently, by launching a USDollars 200m Dublin-listed China investment fund. The fund has acquired a number of the group's China infrastructure and property projects and is only 50 per cent owned by the company, reducing the parent company's exposure and raising funds for China investment.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: US Prudential in reinsurance flotation THE PRUDENTIAL, the US insurer, plans to retain a majority stake in its reinsurance arm in a partial flotation that would value the unit at more than Dollars 1bn. The company, which earlier this year pursued a private sale of the whole unit, said it would sell 20m of Prudential Reinsurance's 50m shares in a public offering, 4m of them outside the US. An over-allotment provision allows for the sale of a further 3m shares. The Prudential abandoned its pursuit of a private sale in August after it was unable to raise the Dollars 1.2bn target sale price. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it would sell the shares at a maximum of Dollars 21 each, putting proceeds from the offering at Dollars 420mand the value of the unit at Dollars 1.05bn.</p>

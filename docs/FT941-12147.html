			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Arts: The virtues and vices of mime - Alastair Macaulay goes in search of enchantment at the London festival So why do I love mime? Because I love illusion. If someone can make me 'see' a door that is not there, can 'become' a different character through body language alone, he or she will have have my attention. If they can sustain that illusion, can make me feel that their behaviour has summoned up a whole imaginary world around them, then I am enchanted. The London Mime Festival, however, may not be the best place to find the kind of mime I mean. This year's 18-day festival has just drawn to a close; I caught six performances. But the best mime I saw this January occurred elsewhere - at Covent Garden, in The Nutcracker, in a performance when that great artist Stephen Jefferies played the old magician Drosselmayer, and, with miraculous economy and sincerity of movement, showed the anxiety, tenderness, solicitude, authority, and fantasy at the heart of this character. The Mime Festival performances I saw have made me suspect that professional mimes do the worst kind of mime. Why does the prospect of a mime performance make my heart sink? Because most mime is so literal, so galumphing, so repetitious, so teenage, and - oh - so audience-directed. For the average mime performer this January, it was never enough merely to enact opening a door or riding a horse. No, sir. He had to make a hefty great business out of doing so, had to do it with sound effects, had to do it again and again, and, while doing it, he had to keep turning his face to the audience, with his big eyes wide open at us, as if to say 'Get this]' I use the male preposition advisedly. Mimes tend to be male. I saw 18 mime performers this festival; only two were female. (Even Theatre de Complicite, usually an equal-opportunities employer, chose to present an all-male show this time.) Do these statistics suggest that mime would be better if more women were active in the field? Or that mime somehow brings out certain male tendencies of thought? (The latter, I fear.) The Complicite three-man show, a revival of the 1984 A Minute Too Late, was the best work I saw. Simon McBurney's impersonation of a drab, blundering, apologising, inhibited, middle-aged little man who cannot express the grief he feels about the death of his wife was a delicious performance, and the show has several great set pieces of physical comedy. Yet even these Complicite artists, alas, go in for some of the hello-audience cuteness and obvious shticks that so irritate me in lesser mime shows. One performer will make a darling effect by suddenly 'becoming' an impersonal object like a kitchen dresser - but then will turn his deadpan face to us (ie 'Isn't this too funny') and then back again. McBurney has an aghast way of saying 'Oh no' which is genuinely funny; but he does it again, and again, and again. I will pass over Moulin Theatre (French) and its wretched piece of sub-existential absurdism Alter Ego; and I have already reviewed The Right Size's heavy account of Moose. As for Ralf Ralf's account of It's Staring You Right in the Face, although it was a piece of sophisticated nonsense theatre, it was marred by the way it would flog each of its charmingly nonsensical ideas to death. (Also by its audience, which determinedly and dotingly laughed at the performers' slightest antics.) I was curious to read that Commotion and The Institute of Curiosity and Execution would be joining forces to create The Quest for Don Quixote; this impressive-sounding conglomeration turned out to be a three-person show. Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch directed and designed. I loved the way they created windmills and mountainscapes and seas and more from ordinary household implements (stepladders, a blanket, some rope). But again, cuteness kept rearing its head; and, curiously, there was less true quixoticism here than in McDermott's own performance in Richard Jones's 1990 Old Vic staging of The Illusion. The virtues and vices of mime were all evident in MTP Productions' three-man version of The Three Musketeers. I loved the way that three men managed to evoke not only the four musketeers, but also the whole dramatis personae of Dumas's novel (and Gene Kelly &amp; Co. to boot), I yawned through their more laboriously comic and gratuitous set pieces, I deplored the bright-eyed dear-audience mugging that kept cropping up, and I giggled happily through the campy Hollywood grands pas de deux for d'Artagnan and Constance. And sometimes I found myself oddly thrilled. One brief and wordless scene between Milady and Cardinal Richelieu was of course absurd; and yet . . . It was accompanied, to uncannily brilliant effect, by the Dies Irae from Mozart's Requiem, which lent it both the religious and furious tones appropriate to Richelieu. And its few gestures went straight to the core of Dumas's novel, catching its glamour, its danger, its sense of conspiracy, even its high camp - in only a few instants. How did they suggest so much so quickly? When mime is economical, and audaciously musical, as here, it is like conjuring.</p>

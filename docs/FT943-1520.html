			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Towry Law advances to Pounds 2.82m Towry Law, the independent financial advice chain which floated last November, reported pre-tax profits up 16 per cent from Pounds 2.43m to Pounds 2.82m, after listing costs of Pounds 237,000. Mr Cecil Law, chairman, said: 'this has not been an easy year. Both our UK financial planning and general insurance broking divisions are operating in what are currently difficult markets, created by such factors as an unsettled investment climate and rate softening in general insurance.' The company has plans for a 'major cost management programme', which will hit profitability in the first half of the year, and could involve some job losses. It also plans to invest more in information technology, training and compliance. However, Mr Law said encouraging signs for the company included a 13 per cent increase in new business, a 16 per cent rise to Pounds 6.2m for renewal income and fees, and 34 per cent growth in income from international financial planning. Mr Alan Wesley, chief executive, said that although Towry Law did not expect to have to pay any compensation as a result of the SIB enquiry into pension transfers, it had made a 'substantial provision' for the extra cost of temporary staff who might be needed to re-examine old files to comply with SIB rulings. Trading profits rose 26 per cent to Pounds 3.06m. Earnings per share grew 14 per cent to 11.6p (10.2p). A final dividend of 3p (1.8p) makes a total of 4.5p (3.6p) - a 25 per cent gain.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Peace hopes raised by Arafat and Peres Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, last night raised expectations they would complete a long delayed security agreement on Palestinian self-rule as they began meeting in Cairo. Both men said they had made progress in the first round of talks at the Egyptian foreign ministry and that they hoped to reach and initial a final agreement in Cairo. The two sides were to continue talking overnight and this morning. The completion of an agreement, after months of bitter argument between the two sides, would pave the way for beginning of Israeli troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho and the transfer of power to Palestinian hands. But an agreement has proved elusive and even yesterday, hours before Mr Peres was due to meet Mr Arafat, the Cairo talks were in doubt as Mr Peres met senior Israeli army officers in Jerusalem to listen to their reservations about security concessions to the PLO. Mr Arafat had threatened not to attend unless he was sure Mr Peres had the authority to conclude a draft agreement reached between the two men in Davos, Switzerland, last week. For the past week, Mr Arafat has reiterated he is ready to sign the Davos draft agreement which largely resolved the outstanding obstacles between the two sides on long-delayed implementation of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza-Jericho, including the most sensitive issues of control over border crossings and security for Jew ish settlers. But since the Peres-Arafat meeting, objections have been raised by senior officials of the Israeli army backed by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister. Mr Peres last night sought to reassure Palestinians. He said Israel saw the agreement as 'a top priority and we should try and conclude it'. He had come to Cairo with a mandate to conclude negotiations and Israel would stand by the Davos agreement. 'I am not a private person and whatever we agreed in Davos will be respected and kept to,' he said. Mr Amr Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister, said the first round of Peres-Arafat talks last night had been good and the two sides were not far apart. It had confirmed both parties were working hard towards a final agreement. Mr Moussa earlier said 90 per cent of the work had been completed but the remaining gaps would not be easy. Israeli officials cautioned that the talks might not produce a signed agreement unless there was considerable flexibility on Mr Arafat's part to meet the objections put for ward by the army, particularly over control on border cross ings and roads between Israel and the settlements in Gaza. Mr Rabin has recently insisted he will only formally sign a comprehensive agree ment with Mr Arafat to begin Israeli withdrawal from Gaza- Jericho. According to Mr Rabin, the comprehensive agreement must include all outstanding issues between the two sides, including security, the responsibility of the Pales tinian police force, and the future economic relations between the two economies. Officials said if things went well in Cairo, Mr Arafat and Mr Peres might initial an agreement on security issues, but a formal Rabin-Arafat sign ing would have to wait a fur ther two to three weeks for economic and other issues to be finalised in Paris and Taba. Israeli jets yesterday bombed south Lebanon twice in retaliation for attacks by pro-Iranian guerrillas which left three Israeli soldiers dead and four wounded. The attack on Israeli forces in Israel's self-declared security zone is the bloodiest such raid in six months.</p>

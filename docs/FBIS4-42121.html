			<p>BFN     [Text] It is necessary for Albania to understand that  Hellenism is not willing to back down on issues related to human  rights, not only of the Greeks but of every minority, said New  Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert following a meeting with  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today. Evert and Papoulias  discussed the developments in Albania and Evert's upcoming visit  to Romania, which will take place next Tuesday.    Foreign Minister Papoulias described such meetings as  helpful  and said that he plans to invite the other political party  leaders to briefings on the situation prevailing in Albania and  other national developments. Replying to a question regarding a  statement Evert made yesterday that there will be a collision  between Greece and Albania if the persecution of the Greek  minority continues, Papoulias said that there will be a conflict  situation at the political and diplomatic levels. Papoulias  also said that he will contact the UN secretary general today  and send a letter to the U.S. secretary of state. In addition,  Greece will appeal to the CSCE and Papoulias will have contacts  with Mr. van der Stoul [CSCE commissioner on minority rights],  who will be coming to Greece in the next few days. The Greek  Government, Papoulias added, will ask for the support of our  partners in the European Union [EU]. Ambassador Khristos  Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry general secretary, today briefed  the 11 ambassadors of EU countries and the ambassadors of Russia  and China, which are permanent members of the Security Council.    Finally, the New Democracy chairman said that for the time  being it is not considered necessary to hold a party leaders  conference under the chairmanship of the president.    Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today that  Greece is handling the problems with Albania, with which our  country desires improved relations, with self-restraint and  determination. However, without respect for the Greek minority's  rights, Venizelos stressed, there can be no progress in that  direction. The Albanian Government should take the Greek  positions and representations into account.    Regarding Foreign Minister Papoulias' statement that if the  Albanian provocations continue there will be conflict at the  political and diplomatic level, the Government spokesman said  that there will be an exchange of political and diplomatic  representations because, in our opinion, Albania is violating  international law. Venizelos said the Greek Government hopes  that all political forces will join together on national issues;  the meeting between Papoulias and Evert was a part of that  effort.</p>

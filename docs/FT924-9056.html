			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / International Company News: Air France warns of FFr3bn loss AIR France, the French state airline, yesterday warned that it faced a FFr3bn (Dollars 580m) net loss this year, more than four times the FFr685m deficit it made in 1991, because of the deepening recession in the air transport industry. Mr Jean-Didier Blanchet, managing director, issued the loss warning at a staff council meeting which followed the decision by all 14 Air France unions to call a 24-hour strike on Monday November 23, the date of the next board meeting. The stoppage is in protest at the 1,500 extra job losses among the group's 45,000 staff announced last month. Mr Blanchet called the strike 'irresponsible', and warned that it would worsen the losses and could irreversibly lose customers. The latest job cuts, all among ground staff, bring to 5,000 the number of employees to go in the two years to the end of 1993 and should trim FFr3bn from the group's annual operating costs, according to Mr Bernard Attali, the chairman. Unions are angered that Air France has warned that it cannot rule out redundancies, for the first time in its history. Management yesterday reminded unions that the group had no option but to shed staff at a time when most of its competitors are making heavy losses. Airlines are suffering from overcapacity, as the recession continues, worsened by the fact that many of them took delivery of substantial orders for new aircraft just when growth in air traffic ground to a halt. Air France's loss forecast is far heavier than expected, coming after a FFr1.8bn net deficit in the first nine months of this year.</p>

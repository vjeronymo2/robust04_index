			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Inspectorate sold to managers by Aida INSPECTORATE, one of the largest international inspection companies, has been sold to its managers by its parent Adia, the Swiss employment and services group. Electra, the investment management group which helped organise the buy-out, has taken a large slice of the equity. Mr Nigel McConnell, director of Electra, said Adia had requested that the price paid remained confidential, although he added that it was a 'multi-million pound deal.' An announcemnt is expected from Adia shortly about developments in its own business. Inspectorate, established in 1927, operates in more than 75 countries. The bulk of its sales come from North America, the UK, continental Europe, the Middle and Far East. Turnover last year was about Pounds 60m. Three years ago there was an MBO of most of Inspectorate's non-UK inspection business, which included its buildings and travel agencies. At the same time Brompton Holdings, the inspection group, bought the company's non-destructive testing and engineering inspection. Mr Jeff Luesley, joint managing director of Inspectorate, said the acquisition positioned the company to capitalise on opportunities.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Roy Wright: force behind RTZ - Obituary Mr Roy Wright, who with Sir Val Duncan and Sir Mark Turner formed the troika that transformed the former Rio Tinto Company into the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, has died aged 80. He joined Rio Tinto in 1952 in answer to an advertisement for an overseas manager. Over tea with the then Mr Duncan, who had recently been appointed Rio Tinto's managing director, Mr Wright pointed out that the company had no overseas business to manage. 'That's quite true,' came the reply, 'but we will have.' Mr Wright accepted the post and became a key figure in the geographical diversification of Rio Tinto and its merger in 1962 with Consolidated Zinc. One of the outstanding conceptual thinkers of his generation, Mr Wright was among the first to recognise the potential availability of government funding for big resource projects. From this he developed the concept of 'project financing' and a 'floor price' formula that facilitated the financing of big projects. An early project to benefit from this innovation was Hamersley Iron in Australia. He worked closely with Mr Duncan and described the relationship as 'almost telepathic at times'. However, the relationship became strained towards the end of his career as Mr Duncan's interests outside RTZ developed and the corporation's operations became more diversified. With characteristic good grace, Mr Wright stood down from his duties as deputy chairman and deputy chief executive in May 1975, only months before Sir Val died. When Sir Mark Turner took over, Mr Wright gave him his full support and remained a non-executive director of RTZ for another 10 years. Mr Wright was born in Chelmsford, Essex, on September 10 1914 and died on November 23. He was educated at King Edward VI School and Faraday House College. He then worked for Crompton Parkinson in the UK and for Brush Electric in South Africa. During the war he served in the South African and Royal Navies, leaving with the rank of Lt Cmdr.</p>

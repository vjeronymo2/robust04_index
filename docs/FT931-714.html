			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (12): Tough testing ground for reform - Richard Lapper shows how pension funds can help promote local capital markets THE IMMINENT prospect of a far-reaching reform of Argentine pensions law is making life easier for Mr James Riley and Mr John Williams, who both work with UK-based merchant bank, Kleinwort Benson. The two men have spent the last six months advising the Argentine government on the privatisation of the state-owned bank and insurance company, the Caja Nacional de Ahorro y Seguro. The pension fund reform will lead to the rapid development of the private pensions and life insurance market, boosting both local and overseas interest in the Caja, which will expect to have a sizeable slice of the action. That should improve the price the Argentine government should get for the sale - estimated by Mr Williams at between Dollars 60m and Dollars 100m - and provide a useful boost to the Latin American activities of Kleinwort and Coopers and Lybrand, the accountancy and management firm that is also involved. 'One of the key selling points of the Caja is its ability take advantage of the reform. It should help all round,' says Mr Williams, who expects the privatisation to go ahead in the Spring. But much broader interests hinges on the successful approval and implementation of a private funded pensions system in Argentina. At a time when virtually every Latin American government is considering the replacement of increasingly unwieldy 'save-as-you-go' pensions schemes - in which pensions are paid out of current taxation and social security revenues  -success in Argentina would be a huge fillip for the continent's pensions embryonic industry. Local and foreign investors have been encouraged by the progress in Chile, where the pension system was privatised in 1981. The more complex economic, social and political context offered by Argentina is likely to be a tougher testing ground for the idea that the development of private pension funds can contribute towards the successful modernisation and liberalisation of the continent's economies. The success of Chile's pension fund reform has been hugely influential among the continent's politicians and businessmen. Chile replaced its pay-as-you-go system in 1981, with a law that obliged workers to contribute 10 per cent of their wages to private funds. Already over a dozen pension fund administration companies or administradores de fondos de pensiones (AFPs) have built up Dollars 12.5bn in funds. These developments have been among a number designed to strengthen the local private sector. The Santiago stock market, boosted by new issues stemming from an ambitious privatisation programme, has been given stability by the AFPs, who can invest up to 30 per cent of their assets in stocks, and have begun to function as institutional investors, owning about 10 per cent of the market's Dollars 30bn capitalisation. The AFPs are also at the centre of the development of the only long-term debt market in Latin America. In 1989, Chile developed strong enough credit ratings to be able to sell bonds to the AFPs. Since then they have sold more than Dollars 5bn in bonds with maturities up to 27 years. Last year Chile's AFPs enjoyed a 48 per cent return on their assets, tempting three European groups Banco Santander of Spain, Union des Assurances de Paris and Les Mutuelles du Mans Assurance of France to invest in the sector alongside US groups such as Bankers Trust, Aetna and American Insurance Group. Talk of the Chilean experience dominated a recent conference on pension fund reform in San Diego, California. Mr Rudolf van der Bijl, an official with the International Finance Corporation, a World Bank subsidiary which promotes private sector development, told the conference: 'The demand for marketable securities generated by the accumulation of long-term savings in the hands of funded pension plans can provide a strong boost to emerging markets.' Mexico, Peru and Argentina are presently drafting legislation to replace or complement their state systems with private retirement schemes other countries may soon follow suit. Mexico has set up a new system that will co-exist with its existing social security system. The Argentine system will differ in some respects - banks and insurance companies will be allowed to own pension fund companies for example - and the government-owned Banco de la Nacion will compete with privately owned pension fund managers with its own facility. But, in other respects, Argentina's model mirrors developments on the other side of the Andes. Argentine workers are likely to be forced to contribute 11 per cent of their salaries to pension funds of their choice. The stakes are high. If successful, Argentine pension fund managers could be managing Dollars 3.5bn within a year and up to Dollars 40bn within a decade, providing a valuable source of capital for the local stock market. However, the transition could well be painful, partially because Argentina's social security is both more developed and under much more strain than those of its neighbours. The number of pensioners has roughly doubled compared to the number of workers making contributions. Employers contributions have been increased in response - 40 per cent of payroll is paid in social security taxes. Even so, heavy arrears amounting to some Dollars 10bn have been accumulated and benefits have declined in real terms, leaving thousands of pensioners on incomes well below the official poverty level. Local newspapers have reported public suicides by distressed pensioners. Advisers believe that the establishment of a fully funded scheme is the only way the problem can be tackled - 'it is an absolutely crucial step to make,' says Mr Riley. But the transition period will not be easy: he expects the move towards a new system will worsen problems in the short term, as new contributions are funnelled into investment funds rather than towards existing pensioners. 'In Chile, the system was introduced by an autocratic regime. The trick is to see whether it can be done in a democracy. It will be a real test in Argentina.'</p>

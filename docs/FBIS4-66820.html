			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, March 23 (PTI)--India would have to stand  firm to counter the growing pressure from some countries using  "human rights" as a front, as this was indirectly aiding  Pakistan in destabilising the country, the defense ministry has  said in its annual report.    Calling for a complete reassessment of threat perceptions,  to  the country's security in the context of the unipolar world and  the present unsettled international order, the report says that  India would have to stand "firm to counter the pressures which  may be sought to be placed on us."    Asserting that a new dimension to the militancy problem had  been added by the induction of foreign mercenaries with  sophisticated weapons into Jammu and Kashmir, the report said  that this had added to the terrorist depredations in the Valley.    India, the report said was facing a "dark conspiracy" as the  spurt in the level of militancy from across the border was being  timed with raising the bogey of violations of human rights in  international forums to put maximum pressure on the country.    The report has revealed that Pakistan has been using the  territory of some neighbouring countries to infiltrate trained  militants, arms and ammunition and explosives into India.    The report says that Pakistani governmental and  non-governmental agencies had extended their anti-India campaign  and were encouraging several anti-India groups within the  country to work as new channels for the clandestine inflow of  arms.    The report said these groups were also being used to  engineer  communal violence like bomb blasts and other acts of arson and  sabotage.    While, India was taking measures to decimate the threat of  militants, the country was also facing indirect international  pressure in the shape of increased restraints being imposed by  industrially advanced nations on transfer of defence technology.    This, the report said was proving to be a major constraint  on  defence self reliance and thus called for a greater outlay on  research and development in the coming years.    Taking note of the increasing defence spending of Pakistan  and its move to acquire highly sophisticated weapons which go  far beyond its legitimate needs, the report said this was  coupled with Pakistan's acquisition of the new M-11 missile  system from China and the greater defence co-operation between  the two countries.    Along with this, the report says India also needed to take  note of reported proliferation of missiles in Saudi Arabia and  Iran. It also says that China has embarked upon an ambitious  programme of modernisation of its armed forces and had purchased  state of the art fighter aircraft from Russia.    All these developments, the report said would compel India  to  adopt prudent measures to ensure its own security through a  stronger defence system.    On the Sino-Indian relations, the report says there has been  a perceptible movement, with the signing of the historic  agreement to maintain peace and tranquillity on the borders  between the two countries. Under the agreement, the report says,  the two sides would strictly respect and observe the line of  control with neither side over-stepping it.</p>

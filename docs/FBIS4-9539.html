			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, April 27 (AFP) -- NATO said Wednesday it  was satisfied with the Bosnian Serb withdrawal from Gorazde, but  remained poised to use its bombs in defence of the town and  another five "safe areas" in Bosnia-Herzegovina. A North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation spokesman said here that NATO and  UN forces were conducting a "robust reconnaissance" in the  exclusion zone around Gorazde to check for any remaining Bosnian  Serb heavy weapons there. "If any (heavy weapons) are  discovered, they must be removed immediately or they will be  subject to air strikes," he warned.    Earlier, NATO announced that the Bosnian Serbs had generally  complied with NATO's ultimatum that they withdraw all their  heavy weapons from a 20-kilometre (12.5 mile) radius around  Gorazde by 0001 GMT Wednesday.    The chairman of NATO's military committee, British  Field-Marshall Sir Richard Vincent, said: "There are no major  incidents to report." He told a press conference at NATO  headquarters here: "The freedom of movement for UN personnel  (into Gorazde) has for the most part been restored." But,  speaking after a meeting of NATO's military committee, Vincent  reiterated the alliance's determination to bomb the Bosnian  Serbs if they attacked Gorazde or any other UN-declared "safe  areas" in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    A parallel meeting of the North Atlantic Council comprising  ambassadors from NATO's 16 members called on all sides to avoid  all "provocative actions" and warned the Bosnian Serbs against  any hostile actions directed at UN personnel. But Vincent  acknowledged that NATO had no authority to stop the Bosnian  Serbs using the weapons withdrawn from Gorazde in attacks on  other Bosnian Moslem positions not defined as "safe areas".    Military strategists have warned that the Bosnian Serbs  could  turn their artillery next on Moslem and Croat positions near the  narrow "Brcko corridor" in northern Bosnia linking Serbia with  its conquests in western Bosnia. Vincent acknowledged the  danger of such a redeployment. "We need to keep track of it and  we shall do so," he said. But the field-marshal added: "It is  not NATO's business to take international law unto itself and go  stamping around in other people's territory."    NATO could do nothing outside the "safe areas" to oppose  Bosnian Serb assaults unless the UN Security Council expanded  its air strike mandate, Vincent said. The alliance said earlier  that its air strike threats aimed at underpinning current  efforts by the United States, Russia, the European Union and the  United Nations to bring the combatants in Bosnia back to the  negotiation table. "The (North Atlantic) Council welcomed in  particular the constructive engagement of Russia in the search  for a negotiated settlement," the spokesman said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "High Temps Deplete Reservoirs"] </F>   [Text] A senior expert yesterday declared that the current  18-month drought is the worst of the century.    "The capital city is rapidly reaching water scarcity and  facing limits to further economic development due to the  persistent spell of dry weather," said Teng Shutang, the  general-engineer of Beijing Municipal Water Resources Bureau.    Meanwhile, the municipal Water Saving Office urged residents  and institutions to comply with measures aimed at cutting water  consumption, which has been steadily on the rise this year.    The office pleaded that an acute water shortage will appear  in the next three months, saying the supply exceeded its  capacity of 1.04 million tons a day last week as the mercury  crept above 30 degrees Celsius.    Teng has resorted to shock-therapy in trying to get city  residents to understand the depths of the drought.    He said Beijing has been heavily relying on its only limited  water stored in its two largest reservoirs, the Miyun and  Guanting. Both are fed only by annual rainfall.    Beijing needs at least 1 billion cubic metres of water from  the two reservoirs to meet its basic consumption needs each  year, Teng said. This sole water source has been forced to  yield an extra 500 million cubic metres of water from its  reserves as rainfall has decreased sharply in recent years .    "The reserve storage of water will be used up in the next  few  years without effective water-saving measures with the prolonged  scorching weather," Teng warned.    "Beijing would be at standstill."    The reservoirs have seen their supply depleted with the  minuscule precipitation of the last three years: 490  millimeters in 1992, only 420 millimetres in 1993 and even less  predicted for this year.    Consequently, only 1.6 billion cubic metres were retained in  the reservoirs in 1993, less than 24 percent compared with  levels in the 1980s.    This year only 2.68 billion cubic metres, about half of the  Miyun Reservoir's designed storage capacity, was stored. Only  1.6 billion cubic metres of the stored water are available for  daily use by the city's more than 6 million dwellers as well as  tourists and industries.    Further, for years water quality in Guanting has been too  poor for drinking, he said.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / People: Nurdin &amp; Peacock loses David Poole David Poole, chief executive of cash and carry operator Nurdin &amp; Peacock for the past three years, is leaving the company by mutual agreement following a clash of management styles. N&amp;P insists Poole's departure after 19 years with the group does not stem from problems of strategy or its implementation, and he leaves with full appreciation of his achievements. 'There is no disagreement about the company's strategy,' N&amp;P says. 'In this case, it is purely a matter of management style.' While N&amp;P would not go into details, Poole is known within the retail trade for being a 'hands-on' manager with a direct forceful style. Richard Fulford, the chairman, says N&amp;P requires a 'new management style and increased teamwork to progress the key initiatives which were put in place earlier this year'. Those initiatives include converting N&amp;P's outlets to the TBW format, offering bigger general merchandise and office stationery ranges; the acquisition of the M6 cash and carry chain from Ireland's Fitzwilton - the first acquisition in N&amp;P's 184-year history; and the building and opening of three US-style warehouse clubs, called Cargo Club. Poole's departure will reduce the executive committee running the company from four to three. It will now be chaired by Tony Hopkins, trading director, and also includes Nigel Hall, finance director, and Alex Rentoul, commercial director. Fulford will also be increasing his involvement as chairman, and says he is 'confident that this team will take the company forward'. However, a successor to Poole is thought likely to be appointed in due course.</p>

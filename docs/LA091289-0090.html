			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOARD APPROVES AID FOR HOMELESS STUDENTS;  </P> <P> $70,000 PILOT GRANT TO PROVIDE INSTRUCTION AND SOCIAL SERVICES AT VENICE SCHOOL  </P> <P> To help deal with the growing problem of homeless children, the Los Angeles  Board of Education on Monday unanimously approved a $70,000 pilot program to  help students from homeless families succeed in school.  </P> <P> With funds provided by the Greater Los Angeles Partnership for the Homeless, a  private nonprofit agency, the Coeur D'Alene Elementary School in Venice will  offer homeless students additional counseling, social services and  individualized instruction. Their parents will be given training to teach them  how to help their children with schoolwork.  </P> <P> Of the 280 students Coeur D'Alene expects to enroll this fall, as many as  one-third will come from homeless families in nearby shelters, according to  Principal Beth Ojena.  </P> <P> School officials said they have no firm figures on the number of homeless  children throughout the district, but the Greater Los Angeles Partnership  estimates that there are at least 10,000 in the area, most of whom are not  attending school regularly.  </P> <P> "The ones that are (attending school) have special needs," said Susan Imai,  housing director of the Partnership. "They are traumatized. They are not used  to having a stable environment."  </P> <P> As a result, Ojena said, many of the children tend to be overly aggressive and  argumentative. They fight with other children and generally have more problems  adjusting to school routines. In addition, because they attend school  irregularly, the majority of the homeless students are two to three grade  levels behind their peers, she added. Because many families move frequently  from shelter to shelter, some students leave and re-enter school three or four  times a year.  </P> <P> The grant will enable the school to provide extra nursing and psychological  services, as well as to hire a special counselor who will work primarily with  parents to help them obtain social services. The program will also feature  computer-assisted instruction in reading and writing.  </P> <P> Imai said the Partnership hopes the Coeur D'Alene program will become a model  for other schools that serve homeless children. The need for such programs is  great because families are the fastest growing segment of the homeless  population, she said, making up 28% of the homeless in the greater Los Angeles  area.  </P> <P> The seven-member board later voted 5 to 2 to approve the concept of "agency  fees" for non-union teachers.  </P> <P> The action means an election this fall among the district's 32,000 credentialed  employees, which include teachers, counselors and librarians, to decide the fee  issue. A majority of the credentialed employees must approve the fees before  they can be collected.  </P> <P> Union officials said the fees are aimed at preventing non-members from enjoying  all the benefits of union representation without paying for them.  </P> <P> About 10,000 of the district's teachers, librarians and counselors are not  union members.  </P> <P> The fees would amount to about $350 a year per teacher, or 90% of full  membership dues. Non-union teachers have objected to the fees on the grounds  that they would lead to involuntary union membership. Some also say they fear  the fees would be used to support political objectives with which they  disagree.  </P> <P> A recent state Supreme Court ruling, however, barred teachers unions from using  the fees over teachers' objections for political activities. UTLA officials  said the fees will only be used to pay for the cost of negotiations and other  services.  </P></p>

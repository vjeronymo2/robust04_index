			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE POLARIZES EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> As a former chief of the political section of our embassy in San Salvador, I  fully share the views of George Black and Anne Nelson on the outrageous torture  and murder of the Jesuit priests ("Why the Right Would Slay Priests in El  Salvador," Opinion, Nov. 26). The circumstances of the slaughter and subsequent  developments make it a safe bet that the national record of never trying a  military officer for human rights violations will remain unblemished.  </P> <P> Let us not forget that, in the brief period between Ronald Reagan's election  and inauguration, the Salvadoran hard-liners celebrated the political demise of  Jimmy Carter and his human rights policy by assassinating six leaders of the  legal opposition, four American religious women and two American land reform  advisers. Now they are sending another clear message of their determination  never to share power -- least of all to let themselves be ousted like the  Somozas of Nicaragua.  </P> <P> In a country that has become increasingly polarized in violence since the  wholesale massacres of 1932, the issue is not whether President Alfredo  Cristiani was democratically elected. It is whether he or any other civilian  leader can avert or punish such acts of terrorism while seriously negotiating  with the rebel forces.  </P> <P> MARSHALL PHILLIPS  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN, 85, WHO KILLED SISTER, 86, PLACED ON THREE YEARS' PROBATION  </P> <P> An 85-year-old woman who beat her older sister to death with a mop received  three years' probation Friday and was ordered to remain at her retirement home  under virtual house arrest.  </P> <P> Edna Lamont was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the March 12  bludgeoning death of her sister, Mary McBride, 86.  </P> <P> Lamont told authorities the victim suffered from Alzheimer's disease, a  degenerative ailment that robs individuals of their mental faculties.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. T. K. Herman called the sentence appropriate.  </P> <P> "There was strong evidence that (Lamont) was suffering from the same kind of  mental dementia that the deceased suffered," Herman said.  </P> <P> Lamont was not present at her sentencing because of deteriorating health, he  said, adding that she had completely blocked the slaying from her mind.  </P> <P> Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas convicted Lamont of involuntary  manslaughter, based on preliminary hearing transcripts, after a Municipal Court  judge changed her murder charge to the lesser offense.  </P> <P> Lamont was ordered not to leave her retirement home without a judge's approval,  and then only when supervised by a probation officer.  </P></p>

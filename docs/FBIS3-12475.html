This, at a time when the Palestinian  people, inside and outside, are unanimous on suspending those  talks until international protection is provided to them against  the massacres to which they are being subjected by the settlers  and the Israeli Army and for which the Israeli Government is  totally responsible, and until the settlements are dismantled  and the settlers are disarmed.    Al-Najjab stressed that 'Arafat's acceptance of this  invitation turns the Executive Committee meeting into a mere  formality and a cover for a decision which he made alone and for  which only he is responsible.    Al-Najjab called on his colleagues in the Executive  Committee  to listen to the people's voice and adhere to their calls for  protection and liberation from the settlers' belligerence.    Al-Najjab pointed out that the U.S. position in the Security  Council seeks to foil any serious resolution by the Council to  condemn the crime, provide international protection, and  implement its resolutions relating to the settlements, which it  considers to be illegal and must be removed. Thus, it is clear  that the aim of President Clinton's invitation is in harmony  with the U.S. position in the Security Council and seeks to  deflect the international campaign of condemnation against the  Israeli Government. This position must be exposed instead of  giving it credibility by quickly agreeing to go to Washington.    The Israeli Government has declared its rejection of the  Palestinian demands regarding international protection and  disarming of the settlers. This proves that the expressions of  condemnation uttered by Israeli officials are just words of  consolation, whereas what is required is the adoption of  practical measures that prevent the recurrence of such crimes.  This increases our doubt about the Israeli Government's  intentions to adhere to serious negotiations that really seek to  implement the resolutions of international legitimacy and end  the Israeli occupation.    All this requires the Palestinian leadership to undertake a  comprehensive reassessment rather than hastily agree to the  resumption of the talks and to shifting them to Washington,  while no shift has been made either in Israel's or Washington's  position despite the gravity of all that has happened.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanchang, June 17 (XINHUA) -- China now has more  than 40,000 private schools including 16,990 kindergartens,  4,030 primary schools, 851 middle schools and 800 colleges and  universities.    Of the higher learning institutes, 15 have been authorized  by  the State Education Commission to confer diplomas and the rest  are supervised by provincial, regional or municipal educational  and administrative departments. Apart from that, there are  still around 30,000 private schools engaged in short-term staff  training, vocational education and other social and cultural  education.    The private schools are well in compliance with the market  economy in how they are run, from interior management to their  hiring of teachers. These schools have extended their range  from adult education to primary, technical and higher education.    Private school students generally pay for their education  themselves and find their own jobs after graduation.    In Shanghai, private schools have now turned to training  urgently needed personnel in the fields of financial insurance,  real estate development, and foreign-related trade and law.    In 1987 the agricultural province of Jiangxi set up a  correspondence college to help rural areas to prosper. Already  132,000 students have graduated from the college. Now the  correspondence college has set up branches, tutoring stations  and classes all over the province. They all focus on one or  more special skills and have greatly helped to promote the  development of local agriculture.    With the boom in private education, China is enhancing  law-making and management to guide it.    According to an official from the State Education  Commission,  a regulation on private education is to be published by the  State Council soon and the Education Commission will also make  detailed rules for practice.</p>

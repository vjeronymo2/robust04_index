			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Szilagyi Terezia Csaszar, deputy chairman of </F> the Christian Democratic People's Party, by Jezso; place and  date not given]    [Text] With the approach of the local government  elections, an increasing number of right-wing parties realize  the need for a common political stand. However, the extent to  which this process of alliance can go is still questionable. In  certain circumstances, Bela Csepe, former head of the  parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic People's Party  [KDNP], can envisage a fusion with the Hungarian Democratic  Forum [MDF]. However, KDNP Deputy Chairman Laszlo Varga opposes  the idea. We asked KDNP Deputy Chairman Szilagyi Terezia  Csaszar first about this controversy.    [Szilagyi] The national, Christian-conservative parties will  find it extremely difficult to obtain results in the local  government elections separately. These parties should therefore  seriously consider the possibility of having common candidates  or dividing up the mandates among themselves, as the KDNP and  the MDF did in 1990. I do not yet regard fusion as a current  issue. In the long run, however, the right wing should also  create a people's party-grouping which, in my opinion, starting  from the integrating force of the KDNP, will also be able to  bring the other three similar parties into a close alliance or  even a political union.    [Jezso] You mentioned three parties.    [Szilagyi] In addition to the MDF and the Independent  Smallholders Party [FKGP], I also mean here the United  Smallholders Party.    [Jezso] You are the KDNP deputy chairman in charge of  organizational matters. In your view, what should the  organizational setup of the new KDNP be like?    [Szilagyi] We must renew the party's statute, as well as its  organizational and operational rules. The party members'  obligations, sphere of authority, and their calling to account  are not yet clearly outlined. This is why there was no  discipline in the party. I think it is useless to renew the  ideological debates, because the KDNP has firm and deep  spiritual and moral roots. I would like our party to become a  well-organized, modern, European people's party, a party open to  social issues.    [Jezso] In a recent television program, Laszlo Kover, the  acting parliamentary group head of the Federation of Young  Democrats, said regarding the possibility of a common stand of  the four opposition parties that this should be limited to a  common solution of technical issues. In his view, an opposition  coalition would curtail precisely the variety of opposition  possibilities and, therefore, he does not think this is a  desirable way. What is your opinion?    [Szilagyi] Our party has repeatedly declared that it would  like to work as a constructive opposition party. I see  opportunities for the four opposition parties to create a  uniform stand on specific issues. Otherwise, the opposition  will have a very tough time alongside a two-thirds coalition  majority.</p>

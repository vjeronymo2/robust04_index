Expression that must be modern and democratic. Abdelhamid  Benzine, a militant from the beginning and now editor of ALGER  REPUBLICAIN, was kind enough to give us his impressions  regarding that established fact.    [Oukazi] Could you talk to us about the current situation in  the national press?    [Benzine] The media landscape has become very diversified in  recent years. And what amazes me today is the publications that  have recently come into being while others that were already in  existence are suffering from a lack of funds and experiencing  big problems with the printing and distribution companies. As  far as ethics are concerned, things have progressed  considerably. I would like to take this opportunity to pay  tribute to all the martyrs: all the colleagues who have been  killed and those struggling against death.    As far as we are concerned, I would like to point out that  we  still have not heard from our reporter who was kidnapped several  days ago. That being said, the press, generally speaking, is the  prime expression of democracy. Terrorist harassment is engaged  in precisely in order to halt that expression. We should point  out that today's press is playing a prime role beyond the limits  of its true role because of the political vacuum elsewhere.  Party activity has recently been reduced to faxes published by  the press.    [Oukazi] Today's press is caught in the cross fire between a  government that is watching for it to make the slightest false  move and the criminal assaults by barbaric terrorism. How do you  see the situation in those terms?    [Benzine] The state is decaying, and the government is not  homogeneous.    As regards journalists, they have practically ceased to be  what used to be called the fourth estate. They are playing the  prime role in self-defense; they are in the vanguard.    That being said, we must not generalize. There are  journalists who are democratic republicans and bearers of  modernity, and they are fighting for a democratic people's  republic of Algeria--for respect for every individual and  collective freedom--and then there are opportunistic journalists  who are marketing men much more than they are fighters. One  cannot cheat and say that information is neutral and objective.  We all engage in ideology whether we realize it or not.    [Oukazi] How do you see the struggle that journalists must  engage in today?    [Benzine] First of all, they must organize themselves. It  will also be necessary to combat elitism. It is necessary to  improve information and training. I am against corporatism. For  example, I would not be in an organization that had  fundamentalist journalists. I am in favor of an organization  that respects the Constitution, the republic, and democracy and  does not work for the implementation of shari'ah and then "an  Islamic regime." Things must be clear.    Moreover, I am in favor of dialogue among the democratic  forces and not with fascism. Fundamentalism is nothing but a  variation on archaic fascism, because fascism under Mussolini or  Hitler was modern. For its part, fundamentalism is worse than  that.    So journalists must organize among themselves to improve  their profession, information, and its guiding principles. At  the same time, they must become integrated with a much more vast  movement that must be republican, democratic, and oriented  toward social progress.    It is also necessary that there be solidarity among them. In  all modesty, and also without false modesty, journalists must  take their place in the fight to safeguard the country. I also  believe that what has been done so far is better than nothing  but that we are far from hitting the mark. Above all, it will be  necessary for young people, who are more in tune with the times  and more dynamic, to become imbued with this fight.    [Oukazi] How do you see the country's future?    [Benzine] There are two ways of looking at the future. One  is  a little narrow and, I would say, selfish, since it consists of  seeing things from the standpoint of one's own life. Obviously,  things are disturbing.    The future two, three, or four years from now will be very  hard. It is up to all patriots to fight to overcome the crisis.  Since that is a matter of individual conscience, we must have no  illusions, but we are still going to have a rough time of it.  But from the longer perspective of history, I am optimistic. You  know, just before the outbreak of the revolution in 1954,  circumstances were different, but the crisis was just as  serious. There were 22 people who had no support in society but  who were aware that underneath the ashes were the embers that  would burst into flame.    Today I am convinced that the martyrs for freedom will not  have died in vain. I am totally confident of that even though I  know that nothing is inevitable in history. This is not  optimism, but I am convinced that Algeria will emerge from this  crisis and be stronger because of this experience.    It is a matter of building a better world. We must be  realistic, look at things calmly, and struggle.    We must not give in to fascism. Sometimes we win and  sometimes we lose because the struggle does not proceed in a  straight line.    But we must lead people to the certainty that the future  belongs to the forces of progress.</p>

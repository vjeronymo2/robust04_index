			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Last night, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  held a telephone conversation with the U.S. secretary of state  during which the two men discussed the problem of a Bosnian  settlement. Galina Sidorova, adviser to the Russian foreign  minister, said that air strikes against any of the warring sides  in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be justified if they prompted these  sides to accept a compromise. However, she feels that in  present circumstances, such strikes would only lead to a further  brutalization of the conflict.</p>

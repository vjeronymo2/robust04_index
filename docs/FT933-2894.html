			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Knocked off the published timetable - National Express has been forced to rethink its business strategy THE LINGERING recession has delayed the arrival of National Express at the destination for which it set out when it was floated last December. When it came to the market, the coach group mapped out a route to a more efficient and modern structure with plans to refurbish ageing bus stations, upgrade its express coach fleet and to invest in a new reservation system. National Express assumed it could justify the modernisation programme, necessary if the group was to squeeze greater margins from its low budget customers, because it expected passenger volumes to grow as the recession came to an end. Its plans, however, have been frustrated by British Rail, which has lured away coach travellers with fare discounts of up to 80 per cent. The coach company has complained that InterCity, the express division of BR, has used cross-subsidies from other parts of the rail network to offer fares which it finds hard to match. 'We thought that the recession was over and that people would be spending more money. We were ready to put emphasis on better quality. But BR is competing on price only, not on quality,' says Mr Adam Mills, deputy chief executive at National Express. Recession and the cost of cutting its workforce by 10 per cent took their toll on the interim results reported earlier this week. Pre-tax profits fell 46 per cent to Pounds 585,000 after Pounds 427,000 of redundancy charges in its express coach division. Turnover slipped from Pounds 59m to Pounds 57.7m. The shares however, which dipped slightly on the results, closed down 12p to 256p yesterday, well ahead of their 165p flotation price. Wary of the continuing impact of the recession and uncertain how long BR will maintain aggressive price competition, the group has decided to slow the pace of new investment in its core express coach business. Moves to computerise reservations and ticket inquiries are more likely to involve expansion of the existing system to include mechanised ticketing rather than a completely new system. Meanwhile, coach station refurbishment is proceeding on a piecemeal basis: the Liverpool hub is being upgraded with the aid of local authority and EC grant aid, for example, but plans to redevelop the Birmingham station have been postponed. The relaunch of its fleet of Rapide coaches has also been delayed until next year because of new technical modifications to meet new EC and Department of Transport regulations. Mr Mills says the delays have not been forced on the company by cash constraints. It is being cautious with its strategy rather than expanding rapidly, he says. 'We've slowed the pace of investment in National Express Coaches to ensure we get a payback on our spending.' Hampered by the difficult trading conditions in its inter-city coach business, the company has embarked recently on alternative routes to reach the goal of steady profits. National Express is offsetting declining demand for its domestic services by developing its participation in Eurolines, the inter-European coach service comprising 40 different companies, in which the UK group now claims to be one of the leading players. Traffic volumes to western European cities have grown by 18 per cent since flotation, and passenger demand on routes to the east have exceeded expectations. 'Services to Warsaw and Prague have grown rapidly from a standing start; we're running 18 full coaches a week to Poland,' says Mr Mills. By the end of the decade National Express expects passenger volume on services in Europe, where it enjoys a greater price differential against airlines, to match its domestic network. Yet competition with airlines on some European routes has not deterred the company from forging alliances with the aviation industry at home. National Express's exposure to airports, which first began through inter-airport coach services such as between Heathrow and Gatwick, has given the group an appetite for more. The company already has passenger transfer contracts with British Airways and is now discussing links with other airlines. The scope is enormous - the group's Birmingham-based management team has examined services as diverse as baggage handling services, aircraft tugs and even limousines for first class travellers. Earlier this year, the company emphasised its move away from coach operations with the Pounds 27.1m acquisition of East Midlands International Airport in Leicestershire. Mr Mills says the airport is a fairly small business, but its profits - Pounds 3.36m in the year to last March - will be a welcome injection for the group. The acquisition - funded by a Pounds 3.75m rights issue, cash and Pounds 17.5m of medium-term bank debt - is part of a wider strategy to forge links with tour operators and expand airport operations. Mr Mills admits that the company is looking at other airports, but says it is not about to make imminent acquisitions. Instead, it is opting for a measured expansion of non-core activities while trying to enhance the margins on its domestic coach business. National Express, he claims, is negotiating its way slowly around the obstacles of weak UK passenger demand while making strategic decisions to reduce its reliance on coach services. 'We like high volume, low cost transport. That means not bidding for assets which are overvalued; we will specialise instead on turning round former state-owned enterprises.'</p>

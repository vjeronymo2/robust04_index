			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Smith calls for reformed party leadership race MR JOHN SMITH last night called for reform of Labour's electoral college for choosing the party leader, as he and Mr Bryan Gould, the main contenders in the battle to replace Mr Neil Kinnock, made conciliatory speeches. In a wide-ranging address to the general council of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, Mr Smith, the favourite for the leadership, advocated opening up membership of Labour's Plant Committee on electoral reform to other political parties and called for a new bill of rights. Mr Smith, who is backed by 14 of the 18 members of the shadow cabinet, reiterated his invitation to 'all our affiliated organisations' to ballot members before deciding who to support. That followed a request by Ms Ann Clwyd - one of the shadow cabinet members supporting Mr Smith who is herself contesting the deputy leadership - for union leaders not to vote in the contest without balloting their members. The executive of the AEU engineering union has said it will not hold a ballot, because of the cost and the difficulty of carrying out a ballot in time. Mr Smith said he did not believe Labour would wish to maintain the present electoral college for choosing the leader. He said: 'My own view is that a college comprised of all the individual members of the party and the elected members of parliament would be the most legitimate and representative method of democratic choice.' Mr Smith's remarks came as Mr Gould was defending his candidacy partly on the grounds that it had ensured the demise of the system of 'block votes substituting for the participation of individual trade unionists and party members'. Speaking in his Dagenham constituency, he added: 'If I were to be run over by a newly deregulated London bus tomorrow, my intervention would have been justified by that alone.' In an address with few new policy pronouncements, Mr Gould made a number of comments calculated to appeal to supporters of his rivals for the deputy's post, particularly Ms Clwyd and Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary. 'We neglect the grass roots of our party at our peril,' he said, highlighting the main theme of Mr Prescott's campaign. He echoed Ms Clwyd's call for Labour to broaden its appeal to women.</p>

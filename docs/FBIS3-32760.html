According to the earliest evidence  uncovered in the inquiry being conducted by the mission, a group  of unidentified, heavily armed individuals, at around 0100,  invaded a house that sheltered at least 10 people. It seems that  after they had blocked the access roads, the attackers launched  teargas and grenades into the building, thus forcing the  occupants to leave the place. Armed individuals then began  shooting, fatally injuring at least six persons. Several  occupants who were present at the time managed to escape.    The police authorities of Delmas 33 told the mission that  the  victims were part of a subversive terrorist organization and  that the slaughter occurred following a violent quarrel among  members of this group over a money split. However, according to  credible testimony communicated to the mission, the victims,  ranging in age from 20 to 30 years, were activists in political  organizations in Cite Soleil who, during the month of January,  were compelled to leave their neighborhood following intensified  repression.    The OAS/UN civilian mission vigorously condemns these  violations of the right to life and enjoins competent  authorities to conduct an inquiry so the authors of these crimes  can be brought to justice.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RALPHS ASSERTS INDEPENDENCE, SAYS IT'S FINANCIALLY FIT DESPITE PARENT'S WOES  </P> <P> Ralphs Grocery Co. Chairman Byron Allumbaugh spent much of Thursday trying to  put distance between the supermarket chain and its financially troubled owner  Campeau Corp.  </P> <P> "We are a totally separate corporation with our own bonds, with our own banks,"  said Allumbaugh on Thursday, a few hours before he made the same point before a  room of 400 concerned suppliers. "We are about as bulletproof and stand alone  as you can be."  </P> <P> Along with Ralphs' bullish executive, industry analysts say the Southern  California supermarket chain is financially fit and insulated from Campeau's  woes. But some speculate that Ralphs might be sold off if Campeau deteriorates  and that the grocery chain will face even stiffer local competition down the  road.  </P> <P> Ralphs, which became part of the Campeau retailing empire as part of the  takeover of Federated Stores in 1988, estimates that it will cut net losses to  $31.7 million in 1989 from $72.6 million in 1988. And the Compton-based chain  said it expects sales to grow to $4.5 billion by 1994 from an estimated $2.6  billion last year.  </P> <P> Analysts say Ralphs generates enough cash to make payments on its nearly $1  billion of debt and to remodel and open new stores in the never-ending race to  capture a share of the $23 billion that Southern Californians spend annually on  groceries.  </P> <P> For example, Ralphs has $40 million on hand to pay off $11.3 million in debt  due at the end of this month, says Andrew Leinoff, a senior securities analyst  at McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei in Montpelier, Vt.  </P> <P> "Ralphs has been doing everything that it needs to do to be successful," said  Leinoff, who noted that the chain also plans to spend $100 million on  remodeling and building new stores. "It's more than enough to fund their  expansion and competitive position."  </P> <P> Ralphs might have also gained some breathing room thanks to a recent round of  supermarket industry restructuring that has left some of its competitors, such  as Vons, with a lot of debt. Furthermore, the merger of Alpha Beta, which is  owned by American Stores Corp, and Lucky Stores has been delayed after the  state attorney general opposed the combination on anti-competitive grounds. The  case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court.  </P> <P> "The whole industry is moving ahead more cautiously than they have been because  of all the debt," said one supermarket industry executive.  </P> <P> But Ralphs relationship with financially troubled Campeau has tainted its image  and worried suppliers. Allumbaugh, who sits on the Campeau board, has  continually denied rumors that Ralphs will file for bankruptcy and that Campeau  will siphon off cash from the chain.  </P> <P> "We will not be dragged into it," said Allumbaugh of Campeau's financial  predicament. "It's important that our suppliers and our customers understand  that."  </P> <P> Ralphs officials say the company is structured so the bankruptcy of sister  companies Allied and Federated stores, both owned by Campeau, would not include  the supermarket chain. Campeau itself has stated that Ralphs is not included in  any potential bankruptcy filing plans, executives say.  </P> <P> Allumbaugh also disputed speculation that Ralphs would be sold if Campeau filed  for bankruptcy. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late  Wednesday, Campeau's advisers said Ralphs could fetch up to $1.6 billion in a  sale.  </P> <P> "They have no intention of selling Ralphs because we are such a major asset to  them," Allumbaugh said. "Selling Ralphs would also trigger a huge tax liability  to Campeau."  </P> <P> Analysts say whatever happens with Campeau the chain will have to tangle with  bolder competitors who will have digested acquisitions and paid off debt within  a few years.  </P> <P> "In three years, they might have to spend more to remain competitive with Vons  and American Stores," said Leinoff.  </P> <P> Sarah A. Stack, retailing analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, said,  "Vons has gained market share in the past two years because of its success in  remodeling stores and opening new types of units," such as Pavilions and  Tianguis.  </P> <P> "But Ralphs and Lucky have not demonstrated that they can garner market share  by diversification in format," Stack said.  </P> <P> However, industry officials say Ralphs will remain a major industry player.  </P> <P> "They are one of the most experienced food retailers in America," said Jack  Brown, chairman of Stater Bros. supermarkets. "We have not seen any weakness."  </P></p>

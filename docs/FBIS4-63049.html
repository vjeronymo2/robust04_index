			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry has worked out  guidelines of the draft program of support for Russians living  in neighboring states and coordinated it with other ministries,  departments and public organizations. This was announced by  Chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Information and Press  Department Grigoriy Karasin at a briefing in Moscow today.    He said this document would contribute to the integration of  Russians with the political, social and economic life of the  newly independent states (the ex-Soviet republics) and their  adaptation to local culture preserving at the same time their  appropriate cultural particularity.    Karasin announced that a draft of the register of urgent  measures for 1994 which must contribute to the settlement of  issues concerning the situation with Russians living abroad had  been also worked out. He stressed that the discussion had  revealed the necessity for a special body which would solve  problems of Russians and coordinate activities of different  organizations in this sphere.    The best way will be to set up a governmental commission  composed from representatives of the respected departments and  the appropriate parliamentary committees. Public organizations  working on problems of Russians would be represented in the  expert council under the commission, Karasin suggested. He  recommended that the commission primarily should work out a  long-term program on support of Russians living abroad and  ensure its implementation.</p>

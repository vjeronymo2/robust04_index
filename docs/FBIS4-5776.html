			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kyoto, April 14 KYODO -- The world's energy  policy experts jointly called for stronger global cooperation  for stable economic growth and energy policies at a seminar  under sponsorship of the International Energy Agency (IEA) in  Kyoto on Thursday [14 April].    The seminar, hosted by Japan to commemorate the 20th  anniversary of the agency's establishment, gathered some 300  participants from 26 countries around the world, including four  nonmember nations of the agency such as Russia. The guests,  including Bob Hawke, former Australian prime minister, and Brent  Scowcroft, former U.S. presidential assistant, discussed  current problems in global security policies in relation to  energy in the post-Cold War era.    They stressed it is important for all countries in the world  to strengthen cooperation through international organizations  like the IEA to maintain stable economic growth and energy  policies.    Otto Lambsdorff, former German economic minister, discussed  the global warming problem stemming from increasing energy use.  He suggested creation of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions and  said countries capable of introducing such a tax should do so as  soon as possible. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 12 (XINHUA) -- A recent investigation  has shown that Beijing's audio-video market is well in order  after years of improvement and rectification.    The overall investigation into the market was jointly  sponsored by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Radio, Film and  Television, the Press and Publications Bureau, the Copyright  Bureau, the Industry and Commercial Bureau, the Taxation Bureau  and the Public Security Bureau.    Most sales departments dealing in audio-video products,  especially XINHUA bookstores and foreign language bookstores,  which are the main channels for publishing and selling  audio-video products, are engaged in lawful business.    At present, Beijing has nearly one thousand sales outlets  for  audio products and seven hundred for visual products. There are  80 professional audio-video presses and over 40 other book  presses with the right to produce audio-video publications. In  recent years, more than 400 video projection venues and over 500  karaoke bars have been set up. Beijing's audio-video market is  booming.    The reason for the healthy operation of Beijing's  audio-video  market is the close supervision by all government departments  and the popularization of copyright knowledge.    A recent rush check on the sale of audio-video products was  carried out by relevant government departments along the main  commercial streets of Beijing. A number of tapes and compact  discs in violation of copyrights were confiscated.</p>

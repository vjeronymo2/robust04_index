Speaker Ivan Rybkin told  lawmakers the committee for organization of the Duma's  activities discovered during the lunch-break that many of the  amendments moved by people's deputies before discussing the  working procedure in the second reading were not taken into  account.    Meanwhile, the first half of today's plenary meeting of the  State Duma was focused on this issue. Ultranationalist leader  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  made another attempt to talk lawmakers into approving the  amendment moved by his party about the so-called "imperative  mandate". Under this amendment, a deputy quitting a  parliamentary faction is to be stripped of his credentials and  replaced by the next member on the party list. To push this  amendment through parliament, Zhirinovskiy promised to the  deputies' groups "December 12 Union" and "Russian Path", which  were denied registration because of insufficient numerical  strength, that the Liberal Democratic faction would vote for an  amendment reducing the number of deputies required for  registration. The Liberal Democrat leader suggested that the  two amendments be voted as a "package", but lawmakers rejected  the suggestion.</p>

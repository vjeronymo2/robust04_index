			<p>BFN     [Text] The Phnom Penh government should end confusion and  announce which Cambodian factions are officially outlawed, Army  Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit said yesterday.    "An announcement would make it clear who is who in the  country, as different people have different understandings.  Some may have incorrect assumptions," Gen Wimon said.    He also reiterated his belief that supplying weapons to the  Cambodian government would only prolong the civil war there and  warned that Thailand would be seriously affected.    The general was responding to reports that Australia and  United States are considering a request by King Norodom Sihanouk  for fresh military aid to save his war-ravaged country "from the  yoke of the Khmer Rouge".    Australian officials said last week that Canberra,  Washington, Paris and some Asian countries were discussing how  to bolster Phnom Penh's ill-disciplined and poorly-equipped  military, but no decision had been made.    France is co-chairman of the Paris Peace Conference, which  set up the peace accords. Indonesia is the other chairman.    "Thailand would be seriously affected as the weapons  supplied  to Cambodia would be put on sale along the Thai border by ill-  disciplined Cambodian government troops in need of money because  their pay is so low," Wimon said.    He warned that his patience with Cambodia was running out.    "Thailand has never intervened in Cambodia's domestic  affairs  and will not do so. It is their own business if they want to  kill one another. But I will not continue to be patient if  Thais are affected, as I am also Thai.    "What Cambodia needs is humanitarian assistance for its  people, which would help bring lasting peace to the country and  the region."    Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri has also warned that  providing weapons would only prolong the fighting in Cambodia,  not bring about a peaceful settlement.    Other senior Thai officials are also clearly opposed to any  military assistance for Phnom Penh's forces.    Deputy Defence Minister Maj Gen Sombat Rotphothong and First  Army Region Commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo said in separate  interviews that Australia had a right to provide weapons if  requested by the Cambodian government, but that Canberra should  consult Thailand before making a decision.    "Canberra should ask for Thailand's opinions on the  provision  of weapons to Phnom Penh," Sombat said without further  elaboration. Chettha said consultation was necessary because  Thailand was Cambodia's immediate neighbour.    Gen Wimon said: "If some kind of assistance can bring  lasting  peace to Cambodia it would be really appreciated by other  countries, as a peaceful situation attracts investment."    However, if Australia gave military assistance to Cambodia  it  would destroy the existing "peace". The peace-building process  there could not be achieved through military support.</p>

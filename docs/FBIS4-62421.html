			<p>BFN     [Text] A statement by the parliamentary majority:    On 13 May, 88 deputies unanimously passed a protocol  resolution in the absence of quorum at a closed session of the  parliament. This resolution demanded that the delegation  authorized to hold meetings on the Abkhazian issue in Moscow not  sign any agreement or memoranda without the parliament's  consent. Another 39 deputies associated themselves with the  resolution later.    According to legislation currently in force in Georgia, a  protocol resolution has no juridical power. Namely, it is not  recognized by the Law on State Authorities. It can neither be  called an official resolution because a required procedure has  not been accomplished. However, this decision has a political  significance because it demonstrates the attitude of members of  parliament towards the document, some articles of which are  painful for the Georgian party.    Meanwhile, a considerable part of deputies regards an  overall  wreck of the talks as impossible. Two days of debates have  demonstrated that the parliament failed to take responsibility  for the process of talks. Besides, we take into consideration  that the head of state received important guarantees, which give  hope for the favorable development of the process for us.    We believe the only correct way out in the present critical  circumstances is the head of state's action on the authority  conferred to him by law.    We believe today a real way to secure a dignified return of  refugees to Abkhazia and a final restoration of Georgia's  territorial integrity is through cooperation with Russia, which  will become a basis for the levers of the collective security of  the CIS countries.    We believe the United Nations, which has been actively  involved in the settlement of the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict since  the very beginning, will not spare efforts to ensure the  implementation of its peacekeeping mission in Abkhazia is in  full accordance with paragraphs of the UN Charter and the  interest of the Georgian statehood. We also pin hopes on the  CSCE participation in the peaceful settlement of this conflict.    The process has started and its cessation could only bring  our state to a chaos and territorial disintegration.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Business failures continue to rise The number of business failures has risen for the second month running, reversing the trend of the past two years, says accountancy firm Touche Ross. Mr Ralph Preece, a Touche Ross corporate recovery specialist, said: 'We are unlikely to see the widely expected fall in receiverships unless there is a resurgence in economic confidence.' The analysis of figures from the London and Edinburgh Gazettes shows there were 262 receivership and administration appointments last month, a 5 per cent increase on February's 248. The January figure was 163. However, the year-on-year comparison still showed a fall from the 407 appointments in March last year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kokorin, economist with an automated </F> production line plant, under the "A Viewpoint" rubric: "The War  on Inflation: It Will Be Unsuccessful Until We Begin To Restore  Production and Create a New Economic System With a Mechanism for  Stabilizing Prices"]    [Text] Moscow--The cause of the economic collapse  undoubtedly is in miscalculations of a conceptual nature: in an  extremely simplistic, superficial, and one-sided understanding  of economic processes and practical actions stemming from it.  They are aimed at improving the financial system in the  environment of falling production.    Inflation has been declared the number-one enemy. Of course,  it is dangerous for the economy. However, it can only be a  number-one problem in two circumstances.    First, when it is the only problem. When, for instance, the  economic organism is already healing and all that is needed is  to bring the temperature down. Second, when it represents the  main cause of production decline. Obviously, the former is not  the case. But neither is the latter.    Inflation becomes the main cause of a decline only when  devaluation of money is happening so swiftly that money ceases  fulfilling the function of an equivalent of goods; when barter  develops or other countries' currencies take the place of the  national currency. Thank goodness, we have not yet reached this  point, although it is still possible.    Currently, however, the main cause of the production decline  is not inflation, but rather fighting it by the method that the  government is using. It tries in every way possible to restrict  the money supply, to deprive the fire of inflation of  combustible material, but forgetting that this material (money)  is the prerequisite for commodity turnover and production. Hence  the nonpayments crisis, or a crisis of commodity turnover, which  gradually grows into a production decline.    Next. We are witnessing a transition from a state monopoly  to  a monopoly of private individuals and groups. But while the  state as a public institution cannot pursue only the goals of  financial gain, this is precisely the goal of individual- and  group-based monopoly. Hence a sharp decline in income and demand  on the part of the majority. Which also begets a nonpayments  crisis, turning the latter into a classic crisis of  overproduction and distribution. The government nevertheless  refuses to restore the income and demand of the majority through  indexing.    The main factor of the decline, and hence the number-one  enemy, in our situation is not inflation--it is that the  instruments that are used in fighting this ill are impermissible  in a civilized economy. It is assumed that as soon as financial  policy is truly tightened and subsidies dropped--in short,  production is taken to the so-called "bottom" of solvent  demand--inflation will immediately stop, and the long-awaited  structural restructuring will begin.    These assumptions are far removed from reality, which  actually has been confirmed by the practice of radical reforms.  The point is that this so-called "bottom" of solvent demand is  in itself not stationary, and is moving downward in the process  of implementation of reforms. Or we may use this metaphor: as it  goes down, the sinking ship of the Russian economy encounters an  underwater current that pulls it into a deeper spot.    Of course, there is a limit. It will be reached when the  surviving enterprises are able to reach an agreement among  themselves on prices and salaries, but meanwhile the decline may  be catastrophic.    The number-one problem now is to restore production and  create a foundation of an economic system that will contain in  it a mechanism of stabilizing prices.    We have to do everything to enable producers to reach an  agreement on prices among themselves. We have to stop this very  dangerous process of disintegration of large production  associations, which form the foundation of the contract system  that allows to stabilize prices.    Without cardinal changes in the economic mechanism, without  solid and long-term agreements among producers, it is impossible  to win a victory over inflation, and the "bottom" itself may  turn out to be so deep that reaching it will exhaust even that  great patience that our long-suffering people have been  demonstrating to the entire world for almost two years.</p>

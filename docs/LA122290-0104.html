			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: 'GOOSEBUMPS': AN ENDLESS LINE OF CLICHES  </P> <P> If only "Trust Your Goosebumps, Cornelius Puck!" at the Matrix, elicited a  single goosebump, we might trust it. But this show is likelier to produce  yawns.  </P> <P> It's a mindless musical examination of a wealthy 35-year-old man (Gary Imhoff)  searching for his true self. He had followed his parents' (Greg Mullavey and  Kelly Britt) advice to get rich, marrying a tawdry mercenary (Lindy Robbins)  along the way instead of his childhood friend (Stacey Shaffer) who urged him to  write music instead. But now he wants out.  </P> <P> So do we -- from this show.  </P> <P> How does he escape? By running for President, of course. Guided by a chubby but  remarkably elastic angel (Avery Saltzman), he recruits a black running mate  (Wren T. Brown) and tries to win by losing. Or is it lose by winning?  </P> <P> Writer Allan Jay Friedman's cliches -- musical, lyrical and dramaturgical --  are endless. That childhood friend, for example, grows up to become -- yes --  an artist in Paris. Spare us.  </P> <P> David Galligan's cast is professional enough, but it's hard to imagine that  anyone outside Friedman's family and friends really believes in this project.  </P> <P> "Trust Your Goosebumps, Cornelius Puck!" Matrix Theatre, 7657 Melrose Ave.,  Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; matinees Saturdays, Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends Jan. 20.  $14.50; (213) 852-1445. Running time: 2 hours, 20 minutes.  </P> <P> DON SHIRLEY  </P></p>

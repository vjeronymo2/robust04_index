			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / FT Interview: The art of a political warrior - Ichiro Ozawa, Japan's leading political reformer, speaks to Robert Thomson Ichiro Ozawa carries into a room a tangible sense of certainty about his destiny. The chosen son of past elders of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party, he now runs a breakaway faction and portrays himself as anointed by history to change the unchangeable: Japanese politics. Cultivated carefully by the US government, which also sees him as the man most likely to lead Japan into the next century, Mr Ozawa, 51, is hampered by scandal. He is awaiting his moment to return triumphantly to a debate about 'political reform' which is animating the country. Mr Ozawa was to have travelled to London this week to become more fully acquainted with British-style democracy. Difficulty in arranging meetings with perceived equals, including Mr John Major, the prime minister, and rumours of a snap election in Japan prompted him to cancel the visit, however. For most Japanese, the recent conversion of Ozawa the Manipulator, who controlled the LDP from a backroom, into Ozawa the Reformer, pushing for openness and renovation, is one of the small miracles of the recent political instability. Apart from Mr Ozawa's recently created LDP faction, a new party has surfaced. It is called, quite aptly, the Japan New party. There also exists a thriving crop of reform groups and a Tokyo-style 'electronic town hall', as patented by Ross Perot in the US. Parliament is trying to redraw electoral boundaries and is debating tougher controls on political funding, while rumours emerge daily of fresh scandals and unholy alliances. Among the most tantalising of the reports is that Mr Ozawa and Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister, are planning a new, mainstream party, slightly left-of-centre, a party which would draw members from the Japan Socialist party and from other opposition parties. The aim is to provide an electable alternative to the LDP, which has held power for the past four decades and which, according to reformers, has outlived its usefulness. 'Everybody is asking about the idea of a new party, but we can't see clearly yet what will happen. The first thing we must do is change the system of constituencies,' he said. As a card-carrying LDP member, his talk of a new party must necessarily be guarded, but the implication is that the time is coming when a new party will emerge, one in which he might well have played a formative role. One obstacle to launching a new party is the recession, which has slowed the flow of corporate donations into politics, as has the recent round of corruption scandals. Mr Ozawa's alleged but denied links to those scandals - involving illegal payments by the construction industry to politicians in the hope of buying influence and winning contracts - have made it difficult for him to collect funds. It remains true that an overhaul of the electoral system would make politics a cheaper business, less prone to corruption and more open to new parties. Reform has been deftly derailed in the past. The Recruit stocks-for-favours scandal of four years ago was widely supposed to have provoked fundamental change. At that time, there were suggestions that Ms Takako Doi, the Iron Butterfly, could lead the socialists to power. Instead, the strongly ideological party retreated into a self-defeating theoretical debate about its policies and Japanese voters appeared to forgive the LDP its excesses. This time, Mr Ozawa says, will be different: 'There is such strong feeling now because change has been building up in the system. Each of the scandals, Lockheed, Recruit, and so on, have added a momentum to the debate. I believe reform has a good chance of success.' Portents of change were broadcast on Japanese television last month, according to Mr Ozawa, referring to images of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, in the company of US President Clinton in Washington. Mr Ozawa argues Japan should no longer be represented by Miyazawa-like politicians. 'As I was watching these two leaders, standing side by side, my deepest fears were realised. Everything about them - their expressions, their stature - told you that these two men were from different eras. Mr Miyazawa is the personification of the cold war era. It is not a matter of age; it is a way of thinking.' Part of Mr Ozawa's platform, and one reason for US belief that he represents a new era in Japanese politics, is his argument that Tokyo cannot play a full role in international affairs without domestic political reforms that would make the government quicker to respond to outside challenges. Mr Ozawa supports constitutional changes which would allow the military greater freedom in international peacekeeping operations and which would develop a foreign policy more independent of the US. 'For the first time in half a century, we can see that the Clinton administration has a different attitude to relations with Japan. We can debate whether there is a consciousness change among the people of Japan, but there does need to be, at the least, a change in the consciousness of the people's leaders.' The unusual public criticism of Mr Miyazawa partly reflects Mr Ozawa's anger at his faction's isolation from the five other LDP factions. Meanwhile, the prime minister has not forgiven Mr Ozawa's alleged 'arrogance' two years ago, when Mr Miyazawa was forced to make a humiliating visit to the office of Mr Ozawa, then party power broker, to have his appointment confirmed. Other LDP faction heads also thought Mr Ozawa was rising too quickly from behind Mr Shin Kanemaru, the 'godfather' of Japanese politics, now awaiting trial on tax evasion charges. These LDP officials were delighted that Mr Ozawa was hauled before parliament to testify on his links to Mr Kanemaru, among the politicians who received kickbacks from construction companies. With the Kanemaru crisis itself an inspiration for reform and Mr Ozawa very close to the 'godfather', the Japanese public has yet to be convinced that he is clean. And, like Mr Miyazawa, many Japanese perceive that Mr Ozawa, an MP since the age of 27, is a little too confident of his political prowess. Personality reform, however, forms no part of the Ozawa agenda. 'In terms of actions and awareness, I am not typically Japanese. It is very comfortable to be an ordinary Japanese, but I can't allow myself to become complacent. It is my duty to keep sounding the bell and to make people more aware. I know some people describe me as arrogant, but I have no intention of changing to suit them.' Mr Ozawa makes an important distinction between 'tactics' and 'strategy'. For tactics, the day-to-day manoeuvring against political opponents, he finds The Art of War, the Chinese classic military manual by Sun Tzu, a useful text. The Art of War advises generals not to camp on low-lying ground and states that the ultimate satisfaction in a battle is to win without shots being fired. For strategy, the longer-term political outlook, he finds inspiration in another Chinese text called Shiji, which traces the rise and fall of dynasties. His interest in history is reflected in his own comparison of 1990s Japan with 1860s Japan, the time of the Meiji Restoration, when reformers were struggling against state-controlled feudalism. Mr Ozawa is drawing on these lessons of history to make sense of a political battleground on which only the initial skirmishes have begun. Like most Japanese, he is uncertain about the future course of a sometimes opaque debate about control - a debate made more complex by shifting relationships  -but he is confident that he will recognise the moment for action and will triumph in the end. 'In Japanese history, during the Meiji Restoration period, there were many foot soldiers of reform who withered away without leaving any footprints, any sign of their contribution. I don't mind sacrificing myself for reform, as long as that sacrifice is not in vain.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1942 Born in Iwate, Japan.

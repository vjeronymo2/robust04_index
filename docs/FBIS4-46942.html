			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Voskresenskiy, deputy director of the </F> Russia-China Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute  of the Far East, under the rubric "Geopolitics": "A Change in  China's Status in Russian Diplomacy"]    [Text] After the  geopolitical crisis of the early 1990s, Russia changed in a  fundamental way. Although it preserved more than four-fifths of  the territory of the USSR, even so it has slightly more than  half the population of the former USSR and controls no more than  half the gross national product of the USSR in 1990. If we are  speaking of society as a whole, Russia has certainly not  achieved political accord yet and its strategic economic future  is not clear yet either. The important conclusion follows from  this that at least for a time, in terms of most parameters  (other than the size of territory and military potential),  Russia has moved to the category of medium-sized (regional)  powers.    China is undergoing fundamental changes too. The phenomenal  rate of development achieved in recent years is making this  state one of the leaders in terms of overall might and prospects  for development no longer only among the "third world"  countries. However, China, which is now second in the world  after the United States in terms of total production of goods  and services (gross domestic product), continues to enjoy all  the advantages of a "developing country." Remember that Russia  is in 10th place for this indicator, behind not only the United  States and China but even Japan, Germany, India, France, Italy,  Great Britain, and Brazil. Today China is third in the world in  terms of industrial production, behind only the United States  and Japan, while Russia is in fifth place. It is no secret that  today people in the PRC [People's Republic of China] are  extremely disturbed by the changes in the geopolitical situation  along the perimeter of China's borders and the especially  destabilizing influence on Chinese society of sociopolitical  processes in the CIS republics, which theoretically might bring  to China processes similar to those which caused the dissolution  of the USSR, given the separatist trends in Tibet, Xinjiang, and  Guangdong. Despite the obvious success of the reforms, there  are difficulties of a political and economic nature in China  just as in Russia, and the future appearance of this country is  not perfectly clear, which obviously worries not only its  closest neighbors.    Russia is a Eurasian power, and its interests in connection  with this are objectively grouped in both the West and the East.  Russia's role in Asia is gradually beginning to change. The  country's national interests were wrongly assessed by USSR  foreign policy strategists. The struggle against imperialism and  then against the PRC for a long time had a prominent place in  our country's foreign policy course in Asia, while other  countries for the most part concentrated on maintaining or  achieving the needed growth in labor productivity per capita,  which should finally be regarded of paramount importance in  Russia's strategy. But at the same time Russia must now also  decide which components of its national interests are to be  realized and in what direction. And the approach to this  question should be as pragmatic as possible. That does not mean  Russia's assuming a one-sided orientation to the West or to the  East, which still occurs depending on the domestic policy  situation in the country, but rather it means achieving a  consensus among the political elite in terms of what direction  the "strategic partnership" needed for peaceful existence and to  attract new technologies and investments to modernize the  economy should take; and where we can find mutually advantageous  cooperation in relations and the balance of economic interests  needed for Russia's geopolitical stability.    It is perfectly clear that today large-scale investments and  new technologies can only come to Russia from the West; that is  the objective reality. Regardless of our likes and dislikes, the  United States' role here is a crucial one in all senses. That is  why access to U.S. markets is so important to Russia. True,  behind the talk of a "strategic partnership" of democratic  Russia with the United States, we somehow do not hear of  successes of Russian diplomacy in achieving most-favored nation  status in trade with this country, while communist China easily  extends this status from year to year. At the same time,  however, China is not only our largest Asian neighbor with a  dynamic rate of development (the ratio of the yearly volume of  production of GNP between Russia and China dropped from 2:1 in  1990 to 1.25:1 in 1992 and may change to 0.75:1 by the year  2000) and a population of almost 1.5 billion people opposite the  sparsely populated territories of Siberia and the Far East. It  is now the second most important trade partner with the Russian  Federation after the FRG. The PRC is apparently the only country  upon which Russia can realistically depend in strengthening its  positions in northern Asia, this most dynamically developing  region of the world. The extraordinary importance of a Chinese  orientation for Russian foreign policy stems from that. Indeed,  neither the United States nor especially Japan is inclined to  automatically help raise Russia's role in the Asian-Pacific  Ocean region, since this would objectively result in their  narrowed influence in the system of foreign policy and economic  ties which have already become established. For this reason, the  hopes of certain analysts that the resolution of the territorial  question with Japan will open an era of large-scale cooperation  with this country are very problematical. But for China  cooperation with Russia may to a significant degree act as a  factor for maintaining the balance of forces in northern Asia in  counterbalance to the one-sided rise in influence of the United  States and Japan, which is not to China's advantage. And  although on the strategic level China may consider Russia a  source of instability, at the same time there is no doubt that a  threat to China from the north disappeared along with the  disintegration of the USSR.    Russia's entry into the Asian economic space is  predetermined  by the fact that the USSR, whose successor Russia is, in the  past built up only its military-political presence and in  practice did not participate in the process of forming the  structure of regional economic cooperation. After the USSR's  disappearance from the international arena and in light of the  economic difficulties, Russia's future presence in the region  depends only on its ability to incorporate itself into the  process of economic integration. In present conditions Russia  will not be able to decide any issue by military means. It is  obvious that the situation that has now taken shape is  characterized by Russia's low level of realization of its  interests in Asia, which is linked above all to the lack of a  clearcut strategic course of development of the country.    At the same time, however, Russia's transfer of focus from  the military-political sphere to the area of economic contacts,  that is to say the change in status from a military superpower  to the status of an economic partner, is undoubtedly in China's  interests. China is interested in multipolarization of the  economic structure in the region to counterbalance the one-sided  rise in Japan's role in order to prevent China from experiencing  a growing relative economic lag. Fairly strong economic ties of  the northern and northwestern provinces of the PRC with the  Russian Far East and its Central Asian part would also be in the  PRC's interests in order to prevent the growing imbalance in the  economic development of the country's north and south, which is  fraught with the potential danger of increased separatist  tendencies within the Chinese state.    For Russia friendly relations with China guarantee a  reliable  rear area for relations with the West, no matter what these  relations are in the future, in exactly the same way that Russia  provides this rear area for China. As its positions in the world  are reinforced, the new Russia could help raise China's role on  the world level just as China could provide support to Russia on  the regional level, and accordingly both countries could  continue to progress along the path of reform and structural  reorganization of their economies.    However, we must not shut our eyes to the fact that a  breeding ground for rivalry between Russia and China within the  framework of the international system of relations continues to  exist. Today it is defined not only by traditional geopolitical  considerations as in the past, but also by the following two  features. First, both Russia and China now occupy a similar  position in the world system of relations, that is to say, in  the eyes of the world they are major regional powers which are  either on the threshold or in the process of transforming their  political systems and reforming their economies, that is to say,  essentially they are developing countries called upon in  principle to play a world role based on their objective  conditions. Moreover, the medium for rivalry is determined by  the differences in the initial parameters, general strategy, and  context of socioeconomic transformations in these countries.  Without dwelling on comparing the Chinese and Russian reforms,  one can assert that in terms of such criteria as the state's  economic role and the correlation of forms of ownership, the  interdependence of transformations in economics and politics,  and others, they are developing in different ways. Thus, the  degree of Russia and China's compatibility with international  economic structures and the degree to which the countries fit  into the world economy differ. On the other hand, the Russian  domestic policy situation determines the complexities of  economic interaction at the given stage, in particular the  clearly unequal character of trade between our countries.    The similarity of the tasks which our countries are  performing and at the same time the differences in the nature of  the reforms and their rates allow Russia and China in the very  near future and with definite focused efforts to occupy  different niches in the world division of labor and in  attracting international investments; that is to say to avoid a  direct collision of interests, which when the complementary  nature of the economies is taken into account may ensure  perfectly harmonious development of both interstate relations  and economic ties. The main components of the national interests  of Russia and China are by no means mutually exclusive in  principle. Although periods of acute confrontation between our  countries were observed more than once throughout the 400 years  of history of interrelations, this was above all the result of  major foreign policy miscalculations or considerations of an  ideological nature. So the difficulties which exist in relations  are certainly surmountable today, and both countries may at  least in the short-term utilize one another's potential to  modernize and reform their own economies.</p>

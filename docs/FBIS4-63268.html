			<p>BFN     [Text] "We must gain access to the world arms market,"  Chief of the [Ukrainian] Armaments Staff Lieutenant General Lev  Gnatenko [Ihnatenko] stated ruing a briefing in Kiev on  Wednesday [18 May]. He said that Ukraine might sell air to air  missiles, radars, guidance and automatic fire control systems  and armored equipment.    Gnatenko also said that six months ago, the Ukrainian  Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations established an agency  (Ukroboronservis) dealing with the arms issues. It has  established contacts with a similar agency in Russia  (Rosvooruzheniye) and is currently coordinating prices on  military equipment manufactured in both countries.    To quote Gnatenko, there is a state arms development program  to last until the year 2010 providing for the creation of a  network of research centers. He said that whereas the former  Soviet Union had about 40 research institutes working on arms  projects, Russia has 37 now and Ukraine none, although research  centers are attached to many of the former defense enterprises.    He told journalists that in 1995-96, Ukraine would put on  orbit a satellite of its own.    Speaking about arms production Gnatenko said that Ukraine  has  built or nearly built 10 warships.    He also announced that a program was being developed for the  production of firearms at five Ukrainian factories, including  the Kiev Machine-Building Plant and the Dnepropetrovsk Yuzhnyy  Machine- Building Plant, the latter will manufacture firearms on  the basis of the Kalashnikov sub-machine-gun and the former  firearms of its own design.    He complained that the budget spending on armaments and  components was insufficient. In 1994, only 8 percent of the  required money was allocated for this purpose.    He said in this connection that Ukraine had had talks with  Russia on selling about 40 strategic bombers in exchange for  space parts for individual types of armaments and maintenance  services.</p>

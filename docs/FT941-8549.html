			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Polish bank loses broking licence Bank Slaski, one of Poland's biggest banks, yesterday had its stockbroking licence revoked by the Securities Commission following charges that the bank had mismanaged its own privatisation. The Commission said the bank, also one of Poland's largest brokers, had penalised virtually all of the 800,000 new shareholders because it had not delayed the listing until shareholders had been able to register their shares. The Securities Commission also asked the State Prosecutors Office to initiate proceeding against the Bank Slaski board. The bank has been given six months to wind down its operation and the Commission has asked Poland's 37 remaining brokers, who are already struggling to service their existing clients, to take over the Slaski accounts. ING, the Dutch bank, bought a 25.9 per cent share of the Bank Slaski as part of the privatisation. The shares, first quoted on January 25, immediately rose to 13.5 times their public offer price of Zl 500,000 (Dollars 23) but most shareholders were unable to trade until they had registered their shares, a process which had been held up by a shortage of brokers. Registration normally takes two weeks but in some cases it has still not been completed.</p>

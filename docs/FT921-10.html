			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sterling and gilts override poll fears THE THREAT of a steep opinion poll-driven slide in London's equity market proved no more than a gentle early morning mark-down and was followed by a confident rally which left share prices with widespread, albeit modest, gains yesterday. Backing up the overall stability in London was a relatively steady performance by sterling. Gilt-edged stocks delivered the best performance of the day and posted rises of a half-point and sometimes more at the long end. The general election obviously remained the big story in the market but, after the initial mark-down, which was accompanied by pockets of small selling pressure, it failed to trigger any substantial swings in sentiment as the day progressed. Helping the stock market shrug off the poll worries was a surprisingly strong showing by the March Footsie future, which traded at a premium or parity to the cash market throughout the session ahead of its expiry today. There was determined buying of the March future, which was said to have sustained the primary market. One of the big integrated houses was said to have played a big part in keeping the future at a premium. The traded options market, on the other hand, was subdued. Share prices began the day on the retreat, with traders wary of the market's reaction to the weekend opinion polls, and continuing unease over the debt burdens being carried by the Olympia &amp; York property development group and Heron Corporation, among the UK's biggest privately owned companies. Very little selling ensued, however, and marketmakers quickly altered tack, hoisting prices to accommodate small institutional buying orders. Wall Street gave no real cause for concern, opening marginally firmer and maintaining a positive stance during London trading hours. Down just over 11 points within minutes of the official opening of business, the FT-SE 100 Index gradually crept up to end the day a net 5 points higher at 2,452.9, having reached a session peak of 2,453.5. Official statistics revealed how thin the day's business had been, however. Turnover was recorded as 402.7m shares, substantially down on Friday's 500m-plus figure. Seasoned traders see little hope of any big expansion in genuine customer business ahead of the election. 'Volumes are dreadful and still shrinking and you can't blame the institutions; they can't get big sizes done with the marketmakers keeping their heads down,' said one trader. Among the big movers in the market, Midland Bank was prominent on the upside as more commentators took the view that a price of 400p-plus would be needed to ensure control of the bank. Barclays shares declined as analysts pondered the bank's exposure to the troubled Heron group. The big overseas-earning groups were among the Footsie's best performers, notably RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, ICI and Inchcape. Eurotunnel shares endured another painful session, after confirmation of increased payments to TML, the consortium building the Channel tunnel.</p>

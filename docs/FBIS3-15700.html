Meanwhile your IZVESTIYA correspondent has been able  to elucidate that a compromise regarding future cooperation  between the branches of power has nevertheless been reached at  recent meetings with the leaders of the two Federal Assembly  chambers, I. Rybkin and V. Shumeyko. Consequently two groups  comprising deputies and experts from the presidential apparatus  are currently working on a draft new State Duma decree.  Presidential aide G. Satarov described the significance of the  forthcoming document (there may actually be two) and the  objectives of the work.    [Kononenko] Georgiy Aleksandrovich, whose initiative was it  to adopt yet another decree in pursuit of the end which enabled  the organizers of the revolt to leave Lefortovo?    [Satarov] The president's, of course. He mentioned this in  his letter to the State Duma dated 26 February, i.e. the letter  he sent on that sad Saturday. In that letter the president  expressed his regret at the form in which the amnesty decree had  been adopted, and also set out two proposals. The first  suggested additional work on the amnesty decree with a view to  making it conform fully with the Russian Federation Constitution  and legislation. The second proposed adopting a memorandum on a  system of forms, criteria, and a mechanism designed to make  politicians liable for ensuring civil peace and harmony. At the  present time the outline of a joint memorandum envisaging the  liability of individual parties and all branches of power for  their actions and the situation in the country is being sketched  out.    [Kononenko] Did the president's 28 February meeting with the  parliamentary chamber leaders provide the impetus for this  cooperation?    [Satarov] You could say that, since the preliminary  agreements were finally coordinated at these meetings. First of  all it was decided to set up working groups comprising  representatives of the president, the lower chamber, and the  Prosecutor's Office to formulate a supplementary State Duma  decree. Second, agreement was reached on future working  arrangements with the aim of insuring against a repetition of  similar explosive situations; specifically, such situations  should be discussed beforehand at the level of working groups  when formulating extremely important decisions and draft laws.  Third, they agreed on the need to minimize the damage to the  sociopolitical situation caused by the amnesty decree.    [Kononenko] By what means?    [Satarov] Political and juridical. It was decided to  explain to those who have benefited from the amnesty that they  should not view the State Duma decree as some sort of political  victory and that their earlier forms of activity are currently  not needed by society. At I. Rybkin's suggestion, this task  should be carried out by the factions of the lower chamber.  Moreover, the General Prosecutor's Office is obliged to warn  those who have benefited from the amnesty that they could be  penalized if they break the amnesty terms. Finally, they should  be notified that the appropriate services will be carefully  following their every move. In the event of the slightest  infringement of the law, both the president and the State Duma  intend to clamp down on them in an extremely resolute fashion.  We will not allow anything to get out of hand, and we will not  tolerate any lawlessness that could lead to an explosive  situation.    [Kononenko] So are tabs currently being kept on the  released prisoners?    [Satarov] We have been watching them ever since they left  jail.    [Kononenko] During consultations over the last few days you  have met with rank-and-file deputies and senior office-holders  in the State Duma. Do you not get the feeling that those who  voted for the amnesty are now rethinking certain points?    [Satarov] One can note a certain alarm, a realization of the  fact that they have made themselves hostages to the released  prisoners' behavior.    [Kononenko] At a 28 February briefing you announced that the  president has a short-term action plan. A television address  has not been ruled out. But for the time being he has taken no  steps.    [Satarov] We are talking about planned rather than  extraordinary actions. For example, a list of priority  legislative initiatives has already been sent to parliament  along with a timetable for their submission. A plan of measures  designed to resolve urgent social and economic problems has also  been prepared, and so forth.    [Kononenko] Ye. Gaydar has called on democrats to rally  round in the face of the threat to civil peace in Russia. Do  you share his view?    [Satarov] Absolutely. The fact is that the establishment of  a democratic state is far from completed, and in the current  situation revanchists will always be tempted to exploit this  fact. We need to consolidate the state -- as the president said  in his message -- and ensure a democratic basis for the reforms.</p>

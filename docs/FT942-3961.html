			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Unisor to raise Ilva steels bid Usinor Sacilor, the French steelmaker, said at the weekend it would table a new increased bid for 100 per cent of the special steels division of Ilva, Italy's state-owned steelmaker, Andrew Hill reports from Milan. The French company also threatened to complain to the European Commission if Iri, Italy's state holding company, sold the division to a competing Italo-German consortium, on the grounds of the dominant position that would be achieved. The privatisation of Ilva was a central plank of the Commission's steel plan, aimed at reducing capacity and state subsidies. Ugine, the special steels subsidiary of Usinor, said it would probably submit its new bid for an unspecified sum today. Iri favours the rival bid from a consortium led by Krupp and Thyssen of Germany, and including Riva and Falck of Italy. Usinor said the Italo-German bid 'poses problems regarding European competition law'.</p>

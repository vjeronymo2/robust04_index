			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Mentor creditors pass scheme of arrangement CREDITORS OF Mentor, the Bermuda-based reinsurer which collapsed in 1985 with gross liabilities in excess of Dollars 790m, have approved a scheme of arrangement, which should allow them to receive payment equivalent to at least 40 cents on the dollar. There are almost 800 UK and US creditors of Mentor. Under the provisions of the scheme all known and potential creditors will have until June 30 1993 to file any and all remaining claims, with the adjudication of these claims expected to take an additional 18 months. Mr Charles Kempe, partner of Ernst &amp; Young, said that the scheme would require creditors to value any remaining unreported claims on an actuarial basis which would then be adjudicated upon by Mr Kempe and Mr Nigel Hamilton, the joint liquidators. 'The scheme represents a pioneering attempt to finalise the liquidation through the usage of actuarial techniques,' said Mr Kempe. Since their appointment in 1985 the joint liquidators have increased the available assets of the estate by some Dollars 158m, including reinsurance recoveries of Dollars 54m and Dollars 40m in cash settlements related to litigation against the company's shareholders, directors and auditors.</p>

			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Pounds 50m revamp for Selfridges store Sears, the retailing group, is planning to spend Pounds 50m over three years on its Selfridges department store in London's Oxford Street. The investment is on top of Pounds 12.6m spent last year on creating a new escalator well from the basement to the fourth floor at the store's eastern end, and Pounds 2.5m on new electronic sales terminals. That means total investment will be Pounds 65m in four years. Mr Liam Strong, Sears' chief executive, said the programme was an investment in the Selfridges brand. He is confident of earning a return. The 450,000 sq ft store has some of the highest sales densities in Europe in its ground floor cosmetics departments. But average sales per sq ft, at between Pounds 400 and Pounds 500 a year, are low compared to other Oxford Street stores. One problem is that behind the grandiose front is an irregularly shaped building with a mass of columns obscuring eyelines. Customers do not circulate properly. Mr Tim Daniels, Selfridges' managing director, says research found that only 4 per cent to 5 per cent of shoppers ever visited the fourth floor. To improve customer flows, more than half of the Pounds 50m will be spent on structural changes. In addition the haphazard layout, with related products often scattered around six selling floors, will be rationalised.</p>

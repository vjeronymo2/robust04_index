			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] More expensive uranium imports are  expected to cost the Swedish nuclear energy industry an  additional 200-300 million kronor a year if the country joins  the EU [European Union], according to a report by Ingrid  Jagerhorn on page C1 of the 15 January Stockholm daily DAGENS  NYHETER in Swedish. Since 1989, Sweden has imported about 45  percent of its uranium from Russia at below market prices.  According to EU quotas, however, each member may only purchase  20 percent of its annual uranium supply from Russia. Because its  use of nuclear energy fluctuates depending on the supply of  hydropower, Sweden has been granted concessions allowing it  flexibility in determining its annual uranium supply.</p>

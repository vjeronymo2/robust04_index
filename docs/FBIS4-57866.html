			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Darcey Quinn from the "24 Horas" newscast] </F>   [Text] Judicial branch leaders expressed their solidarity  with the Constitutional Court on 25 May. Prosecutor General  Gustavo de Greiff, Supreme Court President Ricardo Calvete,  State Council President Amado Gutierrez, and High Council of the  Judiciary President Jose Alejandro Bonivento met for a luncheon  that lasted more than five hours at the apartment of  Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango Mejia.    [Begin recording] [Gutierrez, in progress] ...the court  presidents and the nation's prosecutor general. We discussed a  statement that will probably be issued on the afternoon of 26  May.    [Reporter] Against President Gaviria?    [Gutierrez] No, no, no. A statement simply reaffirming  constitutional principles. [end recording]    We learned, however, that the purpose of this inopportune  meeting was to draft a communique in which the entire judicial  branch protests the meddling of President Gaviria and the  executive branch in the judicial branch's rulings.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] Do you think the government is  meddling too much in judicial branch affairs?    [Gutierrez] No, I cannot tell you anything, because that is  what the statement will deal with, and the statement will be  issued on 26 May. [end recording]</p>

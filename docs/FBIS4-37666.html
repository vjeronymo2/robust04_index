			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gabonese President Omar Bongo by Stephen </F> Smith in Tunis; date not given: "We Need a Peacekeeping Force"  -- first paragraph is LIBERATION introduction]    [Text] Together with General Eyadema (Togo) and Marshal  Mobutu (Zaire), the Gabonese president is one of Africa's "elder  statesmen." In his opinion, the Rwandan agreement is a "botched  job." Explanations.    [Smith] Everyone is expressing satisfaction with the  cease-fire proclaimed in Rwanda. Is it not a success for Africa?    [Bongo] Frankly, I say no. Because the resolution which has  been adopted is void of meaning. It does not say when the  cease-fire will come into effect, nor when the extra Blue  Helmets will arrive in Kigali. Nor does it specify when  political negotiations will begin and, finally, it says nothing  concrete about picking up the Arusha accords again, signed by  the late President Habyarimana and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic  Front] rebels. In fact, it contains nothing more than  recommendations. It is not enough. Africa should have stated,  very explicitly, what it was demanding and should have given  itself the resources to impose this on the warring parties.    [Smith] So you did not vote for the resolution?    [Bongo] No, it was adopted without my vote and in my  absence.  With the support of other heads of state, I then made a  counterproposal. But apparently it was to late.    [Smith] A year ago, at the previous African summit, a  "mechanism to prevent, manage, and settle regional conflicts"  was set up. What has become of it?    [Bongo] In practice, alas, this settlement instrument does  not intervene. Perhaps if our new acting chairman (Tunisian  President Ben Ali) goes at it with his customary determination,  it will become operational. But if not, it will be yet  something else which will not work.    [Smith] Is there not a problem of the changing of the guard  in French-speaking Africa? Whenever there is a serious crisis,  there are only the old hands, like you, General Eyadema, or  Marshal Mobutu, who are present? What about the "La Baule  generation" of new African leaders?    [Bongo] They are only just coming on board. They have to  learn. One cannot intervene, here or there, without knowing  how. Give them time. I am sure that, in two or three years'  time, they will know. Then it is going to be very tough for...    [Smith] ...The West?    [Bongo] ...For our interlocutors. There is not just the  West.    [Smith] South Africa, the big hope, on the one hand, and  Rwanda, the drama, on the other. Between these two poles, where  is Africa going?    [Bongo] I believe that Africa will move toward the South  African model. Because what we have there -- from Mandela's  freeing by De Klerk to the election of a former prisoner as  president -- is a democratic lesson which many of us ought to  have applied a long time ago, in particular in the way we treat  our opposition. In Rwanda, the logic of coup d'etats still  reigns. It is always "Get out of there, so I take your  place..." President Habyarimana did not die in an accident. He  was assassinated. But if the cease-fire holds, we must deploy a  peacekeeping force, evacuate the children, and begin  negotiations for an interim government, until elections can be  held.</p>

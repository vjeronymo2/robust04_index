			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / The Irish Referendum: Kohl to press on despite public misgivings - Bonn THE result of the Irish referendum was greeted with delight and relief in the German government yesterday. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said: 'The people of Ireland have read the signs of the times correctly. Now we must press ahead to European union swiftly and with determination.' Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, said at a meeting of Western European Union foreign and defence ministers in Bonn that the result showed that 'Europe indeed lives and the European train is gathering steam. There is no alternative to European union.' Nevertheless public opinion in Germany is increasingly sceptical about the advantages of European integration, and above all about the replacement of the D-Mark with a single European currency. Mr Kohl has admitted that the treaty is far from perfect, but he is determined to press ahead with ratification in Germany in spite of the public misgivings. He faces a key meeting next week with the prime ministers of the 16 German states to resolve differences over the future control of EC policy between the central government and the states. Western Germans would narrowly reject the Maastricht treaty if it were put to a referendum, an opinion poll found yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn. Only 42 per cent would support a political union with a common currency, said the Emnid Institute poll due to be published by the weekly Der Spiegel. The poll was conducted after Denmark rejected the treaty but before the Irish referendum result. Emnid said it would conduct another poll next week with the same question, adding: 'The result of the referendum in Ireland will certainly influence opinions.' The poll was conducted only in western Germany, the politically dominant four-fifths of the reunited nation.</p>

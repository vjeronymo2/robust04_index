			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE REPARATIONS  </P> <P> Enough is enough! Our government should keep its promise and immediately pay up  and send a letter of apology to all Americans of Japanese extraction interned  during World War II. They have suffered greatly, psychologically and  financially.  </P> <P> No other group of American citizens whose national extraction was that of our  Axis enemies during World War II were subjected to the humiliation that our  fellow Japanese-American citizens endured.  </P> <P> Justice delayed is justice denied. Let's do the right thing now and work to put  the shameful episode behind us. We are four U.S. veteran brothers who all  served overseas (three in the Pacific battle zone) during World War II.  </P> <P> EDMUND J. WIANECKI  </P> <P> Venice  </P> <P> STANLEY A.

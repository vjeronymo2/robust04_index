			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Saudi Regime's Record Is Replete With </F> Conspiracy Against Yemen and its Unity"]    [Text] Agent Fahd's regime moves anew to strike at Yemen's  unity, which has been the source of hope for the sons of Yemen  generation after generation and also the desired objective of  all the Arab masses that view Yemen's unity as a historic  pan-Arab step toward a greater unity. As part of its  conspiratorial and treacherous policy, the Fahd regime has  adopted a disgraceful position by supporting the agent and  renegade secessionists and trying to polish their image and  present them to the international community as a party that is  equal to the legitimate Yemeni authority. Thus, the Saudi  regime made feverish moves in the Security Council through  Fahd's ambassador in Washington Bandar Bin- Sultan, who is known  for his cheap and exposed contacts with U.S. and Zionist  intelligence organs before and after the 30-state aggression  against Iraq. By its recent move in the Security Council, the  Saudi regime, which has a disgraceful record of conspiracies  against every Arab unionist project and every national  authority, is adding a new act of treason to its innumerable  acts of treason against the Arab nation's higher interests and  is flagrantly revealing its plot to bring foreign forces to  Yemen, just as it did in Hafar al-Batin before the aggression  against Iraq. Saudi Arabia has been the principal enemy of  every Arab unionist project. The Arabs will never forget how  the ruling Saudi family plotted against Egyptian-Syrian unity  and how it paid millions of dollars to mercenaries and traitors  to undermine that unity and cancel the United Arab Republic.    Today, the recent past is repeating itself, and in the same  way and through more wicked means, the agent regime in Riyadh is  moving to destroy Yemeni unity, fragment Yemen, create  differences, and ignite war among the sons of Yemen in order to  satisfy its U.S., British, and Zionist masters.    The Yemeni people suffered greatly from the Saudi rulers'  plots against the Yemeni revolution in 1962. That family fears  that the Yemeni revolution may encourage masses in the Arabian  peninsula to mobilize their energies, wipe out the agent regime,  and end its hateful role in conspiring against the fateful Arab  causes, including the Palestine question and a series of  revolutions and uprisings in many arenas of the Arab East and  Arab Maghreb.    After the revolution succeeded, despite the Saudi  conspiracy,  and the Yemeni people were able to preserve the republican  system by offering many sacrifices in lives and money, the agent  rulers in Riyadh went crazy and backed every plot to upset  stability in Yemen and disrupt its people's unity.    Fahd, a cheap agent and offspring of a family with a long  history of treason, will win nothing from his conspiratorial  step and his treasonous moves except curses and eternal  disgrace, and the Arab masses will continue to believe that the  Yemeni unity and every other similar step will remain too strong  to be harmed by the cowards, who have lost their pan-Arab  identity and their national zeal and who have turned into mere  dolls in the hands of the arch enemies of the Arab and Islamic  nations.    Yemeni unity will remain an eternal reality amid the clamor  caused by agents in the Security Council and their dirty games.  Yemeni unity was established to last. This is the course of  history despite agents like Fahd and his page, Bandar.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Fashion: Why design is not simply black and white . . . - Working clothes arouse some trenchant opinions, as Paul Keers discovers / Dressing for the Professions: The Architect PROFESSIONS can reflect their professional concerns in their clothes quite as much as architects. Form, materials, colour, style - all are criteria by which you would judge an architect's work. And all may be displayed in an architect's dress. As a client, you may be hiring an architect for a multi-million pound construction project. That will lead you to seek the kind of traditional professional values, such as financial responsibility, normally associated with suits and ties. But you are also looking for someone with creative vision and the originality that often goes along with flamboyant, unconventional dress. The ideal architect strikes a balance between the images of professional responsibility and creative flair. And, according to architect, designer and lecturer Eva Jiricna, that is exactly what architects traditionally reflected in their dress. 'At the beginning of the century,' she explains, 'all architects dressed up formally, but usually with a flamboyant gesture to it. There was always a hat, a bow-tie or a handkerchief to make their appearance a little bit artistic. After the first world war, American architects remained very formal. And they still dress almost like bankers, in order to impress people, because architecture in America is very much a business.' The grandest masters of post-war architecture can indeed be mistaken for bankers. International figures such as the American Philip Johnson, and the Oriental American I M Pei, are debonair, distinguished dressers. Both are traditionally formal, in dark suits with pocket handkerchiefs, white shirts with discreet cufflinks, and sombre ties. And both wear perfectly round spectacles, echoing the modernist hero Le Corbusier. To an architect, visual details like this must have a philosophy. 'I had my glasses custom-made 40 years ago,' Johnson once explained, 'because to me, glasses are round. It came from the Machine Aesthetic.' American architects remain essentially formal dressers, with the colourful quirks of the post-modernists reflected in details, like a pink bow-tie or a coloured shirt. 'But in Europe, Jiricna explains, 'architects abandoned this distinguished approach, and started dressing down almost.' This dressing down takes two forms. One reflects the intellectual's disdain for dress. This is the deliberate shabby chic, the crumpled cords and battered jackets of academic style, as displayed by the late James Stirling. The other is a deliberate rejection of tradition in favour of modernity, comfort and function. That style is epitomised by high-tech architects such as Norman Foster and Richard Rogers. Foster is frequently seen as a representative of the new relaxed style of professional dressing. He often works in a crewneck sweater, or a polo shirt; but a stainless steel Rolex still suggests both his professional status and his respect for engineering excellence. Eva Jiricna's dress similarly reflects her designs. It is deliberately functional and, coincidentally, a colour match for her most famous work. 'My wardrobe tends to revolve around black and white, and people think that was the Joseph influence,' she says. (Eva Jiricna designed the monochrome high-tech interiors for designer Joseph's various fashion stores and restaurants). 'But in fact, it is a question of time. 'When I was working for other people, if I bought a blue bag, I had the time to find a pair of matching blue shoes. But when I set up my own practice, I simply did not have the time, and my black and white wardrobe was a personal excuse to avoid shopping. I could just stretch out my arm and grab another black jacket. 'It makes dressing so easy. I have black jackets, white T-shirts and shirts, and black trousers, leggings and skirts, in different textures and weights. Then I might add socks or a handkerchief in pink, blue or orange, to make it more cheerful if appropriate.' John Pawson is another architect whose dress reflects his professional concerns. He is famous for his bare, almost furniture-less, flats and cool Japanese restaurants. His work pushes the architectural dictum 'less is more' to the extreme. Pawson favours plain, dark suits and shirts without ties, with clean, uncluttered lines and no decorations. It is a contemporary look associated with Japanese labels such as Comme des Garcons. But Pawson is reluctant to adopt the minimalist tag usually applied to his work for his personal style. 'How about restrained? Simple? Calm?' he suggests. With architects such as Pawson and Jiricna, it seems that stylistically, what you see is what you get. Jiricna agrees. 'It's inevitable that when you are constantly surrounded by problems of an aesthetic nature, then everything becomes based on your attitudes to the aesthetic. Subconsciously, you are bound to look at things from that same angle, which is going to be reflected in what you wear.' But that is not always the case. The radical glass pyramid in front of the Louvre was designed by the traditionally dressed I M Pei. And the biography of Richard Rogers recalls how, in 1977, he was invited to the initial briefings by Lloyd's for its new building. 'Rogers - aware not only that the client was rather different from the experimentally inclined French government of 1971 but also that times had changed - bought a grey Yves St Laurent suit for the occasion and borrowed a tie.' That is the kind of compromise which is unacceptable to Ian Pollard. This year, Pollard was the only architect among Esquire magazine's ten best-dressed men for 1993. Photographed in his habitual straight leather riding boots from Manolo Blahnik, and the shoulder-length hair which has not been cut for more than 20 years, he declared: 'I dress the way I want to dress. If that doesn't conform to accepted codes, that's too bad.' His dress signals his uncompromising approach. This, after all, is a man whose professional wardrobe has featured a wolfskin coat, bootlace ties, decorated Kansai jackets and black jodhpurs. He said in one interview: 'If I was very straight in a grey suit, presenting a grey personality, it would be cheating myself. A grey suit would mean I was prepared to fit in with anything they wanted. They can forget it.' Clearly, Pollard's dress gives an indication of both his professional attitude and his architectural style 'Eclectic, I suppose]' he laughs. And Pollard is scathing about the dress of colleagues today. 'It's really a profession in which a bow-tie is considered racy. Architects want to look like the clients they want to get. Invariably, that client, as far as big projects are concerned, is a corporate client. To a corporate client, anyone who doesn't dress like another corporate man is persona non grata, and his thought processes are considered questionable. 'A corporate client cannot identify with anyone who does not fit the categories with which he is familiar. So the architect tries to present himself as the corporate man the client is looking for. It's a sad reflection, the kind of architect's compromise which means we also end up with bland, compromised buildings.' That is a view which Eva Jiricna rejects. 'I do believe in the word 'appropriate',' she explains. 'Part of my work involves producing modern designs which fit the limits of acceptance of traditional clients, and I would reflect that by wearing a skirt rather than trousers if it was appropriate.' To many observers, architects are the best-dressed of all professionals, combining individual freedom with an inherent sense of style. Eva Jiricna says she is struck by the style of the architectural students. 'The girls in particular are tremendously inventive and smart, as opposed to student chemists, who are remarkably uninteresting.' Ian Pollard remains unconvinced. 'Of course, if you're concerned about the design of buildings, you should be concerned about the design of everything else. But if you measure architects' dress on a scale of 0 to 100, they only manage to get it up to 7 or 8. 'You'll find as many grey suits in architecture as in any other profession.'</p>

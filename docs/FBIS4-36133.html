			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein] </F>   [Text] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, who heads the Palestinian  committee preparing the general elections in the territories and  who was recently appointed minister of local government in the  Palestinian Authority, stated on Friday [3 June] that the  general elections for the establishment of a 100-member council  would be held on 15 October and that the basic regulations of  the elections would be completed by the end of this month.  'Urayqat made these remarks in a conference of Palestinian and  foreign journalists about Palestinian media and democracy in the  new reality in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.    He added that the formulation of the Palestinian local  government law would be completed by 15 July and that the  establishment of municipality committees and village councils  would be completed within less than a month, in time for the  municipal elections. The Palestinian Authority will divide the  territories into nine districts, he said, and the city of Gaza  will be declared a district and will be split into four boroughs.    The conference held at the al-Watani Hotel in East Jerusalem  is scheduled to end today. It was organized by the Palestinian  Journalists Association and the International Journalists  Association. The security forces banned 22 journalists -- who  were supposed to participate -- from leaving the Gaza Strip, and  the organizers lodged a protest with the authorities.    The issue of democratic structures under Palestinian  self-rule was the key topic in the conference. Many  participants expressed apprehension about the curtailment of the  freedom of expression of Palestinian journalists in the  territories and about government control of the media.    A letter sent by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, in which he  promised to uphold democratic values and the peace process, was  read at the beginning of the conference. "The Palestinian  National Authority, which will run the affairs of our people  until clean and general elections are held, will respect  individual liberties, the freedom of thought, and the freedom of  the press," 'Arafat stated.    Addressing the conference, Dr. 'Urayqat said that the  Palestinian Authority does not plan to set up defense systems  made up of aircraft, tanks, or missiles and that "the only way  for the Palestinian people to survive the next 50 years is to  embrace genuine democracy."    Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, head of the Palestinian Broadcasting  Authority [PBA], said the PBA's operations would be based on the  principles of freedom of expression and political pluralism and  that contrary to the situation in sister countries in the Arab  world, it would not be "a partisan apparatus or a government  mouthpiece."    Abu-'Ayyash criticized the European Union for withholding  the  money it promised the PBA. He also accused Israel of holding up  the release of technical equipment from customs and for holding  up the allocation of broadcasting channels.</p>

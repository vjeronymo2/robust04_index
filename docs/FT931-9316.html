RESULTS DUE BRITISH AIRWAYS, still struggling to restore its dignity in the wake of the Virgin Atlantic 'dirty tricks' affair, will report its third quarter results tomorrow. An Pounds 30m exceptional charge for reorganisation at Gatwick after the Dan-Air acquisition will knock the quarter's profits back to about Pounds 10m (Pounds 100m). Profits for the nine-month period to the end of December are likely to be about Pounds 237m (Pounds 285m). Glaxo, the UK's largest pharmaceuticals company and rather mauled by the market of late, is expected to report on Thursday that profits in the six months to December 31 will rise from Pounds 709m to about Pounds 775m. Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug which accounts for 40 per cent of group's sales, has seen its sales growth slow as rivals prepare to enter the market. Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, will report tomorrow its first quarter results, covering the period to end December. A small improvement is expected on the Pounds 226m pre-tax recorded a year ago - possibly up to Pounds 240m, excluding profits on disposals. Much of the increase, though, will come from the translation of dollar profits at a more favourable rate. Analysts expect further elucidation of Lord Hanson's comments at the recent annual meeting that UK margins were likely to be tighter this year. Dalgety, the food group, is reporting interim results today for the six months to end December. These are expected to show a small increase from pre-tax profits of Pounds 53.8m last time to Pounds 56m. UK trading is dull, though there will be the benefit of Sooner Snacks acquired in February. A good performance is expected from the US operation.</p>

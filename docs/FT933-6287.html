			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bonds help FT-SE to closing peak A STRONG bond market and buoyant stock index futures trading provided the platform for a renewed advance in the UK stock market yesterday, driving the FT-SE Index through the 3,100 barrier to a new closing peak of 3,100.6. With sterling very firm and confidence in economic recovery in the UK strengthened by a bullish survey of business opinion by the Confederation of British Industries, the London market brushed off a less encouraging performance from New York. Investors' belief that inflation will remain low and that European interest rates are on the way down, despite the Bundesbank's refusal to cut key rates this week, brought powerful gains in UK government bonds. At the long end, bond prices gained around 1 7/32 , bringing yields down to around 7.2 per cent. Short-dated stocks held steady but a gain of  3/4 in Index-linked gilts implied inflation concerns have not disappeared. The bond sector appeared little affected by the bank of England's decision to issue a further Pounds 800m of existing bonds for dealing next week. Equities opened higher and were quickly spurred further ahead by gains in the September contract on the Index which encouraged arbitraging between futures and underlying equities. Excitement, and share gains, were fuelled by a shortage of stock now imposing severe problems on marketmakers and would-be arbitrageurs alike. A new intra day trading peak of 3,103.0, plus 23.8 on overnight, was established just ahead of the Wall Street's opening. When the Dow Industrial Average came in with a fall of 16 points in UK hours, London softened very slightly to end the session a net 21.4 up. This week, the second leg of an equity account extended to cover Monday's Bank Holiday in the UK, has seen the Footsie rise by 43 points of 1.4 per cent. But the US buyers, who have been driving UK equities ahead this week, played a quieter role yesterday. Also at a new peak was the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, 18.6 higher at 3,513.3. Trading in non-Footsie stocks, the favourites of UK private investors, made up around 60 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 529.2m shares; Thursday's 670.9m Seaq-traded shares represented Pounds 1.42bn in retail business, a very profitable level for the UK securities industry albeit below Wednesday's record Pounds 2.3bn.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Burford Holdings more than doubles to Pounds 5.12m Burford Holdings, the acquisitive property group, yesterday reported interim pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 1.93m to Pounds 5.12m. The company also announced the issue of a Pounds 100m mortgage debenture, primarily to pay for the Trocadero Centre in London's West End, which was purchased over the summer. Turnover showed a similar increase, rising from Pounds 5.11m in the same period last year to Pounds 11.5m. Earnings per share advanced by a more modest 34 per cent to 1.6p (1.19p), reflecting February's Pounds 100m rights issue. Besides the Trocadero deal, which cost Pounds 94m, Burford spent Pounds 103m on a commercial property portfolio from Ladbroke during the first half. Together with some smaller deals, Burford estimates that its annualised rental roll will be Pounds 35m at the end of the financial year, double its expectation a year ago. Rental income at the interim stage had increased from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 10.8m. Mr Nigel Wray, chairman, said the refurbishment of the Trocadero, on one of Europe's busiest thoroughfares at Piccadilly Circus, would begin as soon as the company took possession later this month. The company intended to strengthen the centre's entertainment facilities, taking advantage of its vacant 120,000 sq ft of office space. He estimated the refurbishment cost at about Pounds 7m. The debenture would allow the company to continue its strategy of pursuing moderately large investment opportunities, he added. An interim dividend of 0.75p, against 0.65p, was declared.</p>

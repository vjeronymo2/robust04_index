			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / More staff vital, say German customs GERMAN customs officers yesterday demanded more staff to round up 'cattle by the herd and cigarettes by the tonne' smuggled yearly across the frontiers with Poland and Czechoslovakia. The European Community would become 'a playground for international bandits' if border security to the east and the south were not tightened, Mr Richard Muller, chairman of the BDZ customs officials association, said yesterday. The Polish border was a particular problem in the east, but there was also a 'security deficit' in the south, where Spain and Portugal were unable to police their external borders effectively. He was astonished that in laying plans for internal police co-operation through Europol, member states had excluded customs authorities. Mr Muller said his members were currently seizing about 20m cigarettes a month, and estimated that the volume of smuggling was closer to 100m. Experience had shown that gangs involved in tobacco smuggling typically graduated to running hard drugs once their networks were established. Seizures of heroin, shipped into Germany from the Middle East via the Balkans rose 90 per cent last year and the number of drug-related deaths in the country exceeded 2,000.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 8 (AFP) -- China's crackdown on  political dissidents continued Tuesday, as public security  officials picked up 1989 student pro-democracy leader Wang Dan  for the second time in a week. Wang was pulled in for  questioning at 7:00 p.m. (1100 GMT), friends said, adding that  he was released several hours later.    His interrogation followed the broadcast Monday of an  interview Wang gave to the American ABC television network  regarding last week's police sweep of dissidents in Beijing and  Shanghai. "If the government continues their widespread arrests  then we will at least have to engage in collective protest,"  Wang said in the interview.    Wang had been picked up last Wednesday and held for 24  hours,  during which time he was told to leave Beijing ahead of the  annual session of the Chinese parliament which opens Thursday.  Wang was released from prison on parole in February last year  after serving two years of a four-year jail term for his leading  role in the 1989 pro-democracy movement.    His latest interrogation came as tension between Washington  and Beijing over the dissident crackdown intensified, with harsh  words flying between the two governments just days before the  visit here of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. China  indicated once again that it would not tolerate external  pressure on the issue of human rights, slamming U.S.  condemnation of its ongoing police sweep and accusing Washington  of interference in its internal affairs.    China has detained at least eight activists in the past  week,  including the country's most celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng.  Some dissidents, including Wei, have been released while others  are thought to have been escorted from the capital to their  hometowns.</p>

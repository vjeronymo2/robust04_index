			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yegor Gaydar by Oleg Bondarenko at the </F> Institute of Economic Problems of the Transitional Period, under  "Reform" rubric; date not given: "The Three Faces of Gaydar:  the Economist, the Politician, and the Entrepreneur" -- first  paragraph is introduction]    [Text] I met with Yegor Gaydar at the Institute of the  Economic Problems of the Transitional Period, which he headed  prior to his return to the government. Now he has returned to  the director's chair.    [Bondarenko] Did you not quit the institute during your time  in the government?    [Gaydar] No, I left these walls temporarily, although I  maintained many links with the institute.    [Bondarenko] Clearly it is dear to you personally.    [Gaydar] Of course, because the institute represents a  community of skilled specialists. Many of them think as I do.  On the whole this is a viable scientific collective.    [Bondarenko] Would you say that this is your scientific  school?    [Gaydar] I would not put it that way. It is more a question  of a group of economists who came with me to carry out reforms.    [Bondarenko] As I understand it, whatever the situation, you  intend to use the institute to advance the reforms which have  begun?    [Gaydar] In any event we shall try to do everything in our  power to give a precise analysis of what is going on, to express  our views on what is being done right and what is being done  wrongly, and to submit our own proposals.    [Bondarenko] On the matter of analyses, incidentally, what  is your assessment of the country's socioeconomic situation at  the present time?    [Gaydar] It is characterized by a considerable instability.  The most serious problem, in my view, is the lack of  determination on the part of the organs of power to continue to  implement the economic course adopted. We have already seen how  in the period between 1989 and 1991 an ominous situation  developed in which the old system of economic management had  already outlived itself but the union authorities could not make  up their minds to embark on a new one. Consequently the most  urgent question today remains that of stepping up the dynamic  transformations so as to more quickly organize the kind of  integrated life-support system for the country which would be  based on market relationships, private ownership, and civil law.    In my view, things began to go wrong at the start of 1993,  when the rate at which outmoded economic structures were being  dismantled slowed considerably. That is why the former sources  of financial receipts rapidly ran dry, while the proper  preconditions for new sources were simply not created.    [Bondarenko] How long can this uncertainty go on?    [Gaydar] World experience suggests, unfortunately, that  there is certainly no definite time limit. For example, there  is a whole series of states which, like Russia, have moved away  from socialist methods of economic management but have not been  able to find within themselves the strength to carry the reforms  they have begun through to their logical conclusion. Although,  it is true, some countries can already boast of successes.    [Bondarenko] In your opinion, which countries have been  successful?    [Gaydar] Well, first of all I would name Poland. You will  recall how back in the late eighties it had far more appalling  indicators of declining output volume than, for instance,  Romania, which was not very prosperous at that time either. But  whereas Bucharest is still unable to cope with such a decline,  Warsaw has managed to improve the situation for three years now  and has recently achieved tangible and stable growth of the  national economy.    [Bondarenko] Nevertheless, in Poland they also change the  composition of the government quite often, the country is  periodically shaken by strikes, and there are demonstrations of  discontent.    [Gaydar] All of this merely demonstrates one thing: The  process of the transition to the market is bound to have  problems by virtue of its complexity and extraordinary nature.  Thus even when its implementation is generally successful, a  temporary socioeconomic tension is always bound to occur. In  addition to Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary have also  been coping with the reforms quite well.    [Bondarenko] How, then, do you explain the undoubted  economic successes of such recently poor countries as China and  Vietnam, even though the regimes there are still authoritarian  and they still have party general secretaries as leaders?    [Gaydar] It is simply that in those countries we see an  example of economies which are only just becoming  industrialized. In that sense the states you mention are  comparable more with the Russia of the NEP period and the  subsequent industrialization. In China and Vietnam a large part  of the population is still employed in the agrarian sector.  Thus the potential for the redistribution of labor resources to  industry is still huge there. So comparing their situation with  the present situation in Russia is unacceptable, in my view.  Especially since the level of poverty in those countries and in  ours still does not favor them.    The question here is more one of whether it is possible in  industrialized postsocialist countries to make the transition  from the plan to the civilized market gently and painlessly. At  the present time we have approximately 23 states, including the  former republics of the USSR, which made the transition between  systems between 1989 and 1994. Their experience suggests that  the attempts to implement the reform slowly and in small steps,  with one eye on the past, without counting the cost, and  retaining state monopoly of the management of the economy  entails the most catastrophic failures. The closest example of  that is provided by Ukraine, with its policy of rock-bottom  prices. Nevertheless, that is effectively what the leaders of  Civic Union, the communists, and the agrarian-industrial  factions in parliament are urging us to do.    For my own part I drew the conclusion long ago that  indecision during the transition to fundamentally different  forms of economic management is the worst sin.    [Bondarenko] Are there significant differences between  Zhirinovskiy's econonmic program and what is offered by, say,  the communists and agrarians?    [Gaydar] Zhirinovskiy has no economic program at all. How  can you describe a great mass of empty promises as an economic  program?    [Bondarenko] Yegor Timurovich, is there anything for you to  criticize yourself for during your tenure as head of the  government?    [Gaydar] That is inevitable. First, for not doing enough to  explain our work. Furthermore, we did not do enough to create a  theoretical base to ensure the irreversibility of the reforms.    [Bondarenko] I can somehow understand the rejection of your  program by the venerable academics whom Konstantin Borovoy  called, aptly I think, the pensioners of perestroyka. However,  how do you explain the fact that you were and still are sharply  criticized by those who would seem to be your potential  supporters, people of undoubted democratic convictions and,  furthermore, your coevals. I have in mind Grigoriy Yavlinskiy  and Larisa Piyasheva. Would it not be better to win them over  to your side and include them in the government rather than  simply leaving them among your opponents? Because, it seems to  me, many people are confused and cannot make up their minds  which of you they ought to trust.    [Gaydar] I would gladly take Grigoriy Alekseyevich into my  team, but I fear he would not accept.    [Bondarenko] Did you sit down with them at the same table,  counter their objections, and come to some kind of consensus?    [Gaydar] I have spoken with Yavlinskiy many times. And I  was convinced that we do not have as many substantial  differences of opinion as we may seem to have to outsiders. The  only problem is that our views do not coincide on certain  practical steps in the implementation of the reforms.    [Bondarenko] What about Larisa Ivanovna?    [Gaydar] To be honest I have not had the occasion to meet  with her. I do know, however, that Anatoliy Chubays has had a  thorough discussion with her on the problems of privatization.  As is well known, Piyasheva was the initiator of the so-called  wholesale privatization carried out in Moscow. As a result the  majority of the capital's stores passed virtually for nothing  into the hands of the sales staff alone, which had dire  consequences for the efficiency of the trade sector.    [Bondarenko] You will remember that when you were premier  many business people explained their exclusively commercial  activities by saying that excessive taxation simply does not  allow them to invest resources in production.    [Gaydar] On the whole I agree with such assertions. Taxes  in our country are indeed high. Thus their gradual reduction  is, generally speaking, our state's strategic task.    [Bondarenko] But was it impossible to act differently  before?    [Gaydar] Bear in mind that taxes are set in such a way as to  cover state expenditure. At present state expenditure is so  high that it does not allow enterprise to develop normally in  this country. We in the government sought to create the  preconditions for the gradual lowering of expenditure, to which  end it was proposed to reduce appropriations for defense, cut  subsidies on imports and in the national economy in general, and  abandon preferential credit issue and everything else which has  an adverse effect on the level of taxation. But strange as it  may seem, it was for steps such as those that we were criticized  most.    [Bondarenko] After the collapse of the USSR, the great many  union departments, ministries, and party committees at various  levels were scrapped, of course. As a result, in Moscow alone a  mass of official buildings were due to be vacated. But what has  happened in practice is that there is a chronic shortage of  them. Does this mean that the administrative apparatus has not  only not been reduced since then, which could logically have  been expected, but on the contrary has grown even larger?    [Gaydar] I must object straight away that a considerable  part of the premises are actually not now occupied by  administrative organs but are leased by commercial structures.  As for the former union sectoral ministries, they have  virtually all been transformed into concerns without changing  addresses. Nevertheless, I do not deny that the old managers  were able to adapt very quickly to the present economic  conditions. Both because of the inconsistency of the reforms  and the fact that the most important levers of individual  control held by functionaries were not dismantled, with the  latter managing to a considerable extent to seize real power at  a new level. You have deprived us of the opportunity of  allocating funds and setting limits, they say, so we will  distribute quotas and preferential credits just as successfully.    [Bondarenko] Your opponents claim that relative financial  stabilization has largely been secured by artificial means.  They cite the chronic holdups with wage payments, the state's  tremendous internal debts, irritating problems with mutual  nonpayments, and much else besides. They even predict that one  fine day it may all burst like a soap bubble and total collapse  will, they say, hit the economy.    [Gaydar] I agree with one point you made. The excessive  financial promises made a year ago have caused a very severe  financial crisis which is still having a very painful effect on  the Russian economy. Because nonpayments and underfunding of  state spending have regrettably become a regular phenomenon.  Hence the endless complaints from all quarters.    Thus, the gap between financial commitments and real  potential has proved an extremely unpleasant fact of life, the  result of ill-conceived government decisions. This must of  course be taken into consideration and our work must be geared  to this. Nevertheless, amid these unfavorable conditions we have  nonetheless been able to drive the rate of inflation down from  26 percent last August to 21 percent in September, 16 percent in  November, and end the year on 13 percent. We brought about the  marked improvement in the picture not by reducing current state  funding but by cutting back excessive state commitments.    [Bondarenko] Do you not think that the dictatorship of the  proletariat which the Bolsheviks discussed at such length is  today manifesting itself more perceptibly than ever? You only  have to compare the wages of a professor at a higher educational  establishment and a miner.    [Gaydar] As for miners' wages they are by and large not as  high as they were in the former Soviet Union, say. At the same  time there are many industrial sectors where the pay is  extremely miserly. However, I do agree with you on another  point. The income of representatives of fundamental science,  culture, and education has of course suffered the most. This  abnormal situation has arisen in my view because the above  spheres of intellectual labor had the least protection in the  face of the powerful lobbying done by various sectors of the  economy. People must clearly realize that every extra ruble  they get for themselves ultimately means one ruble less to fund  the social sphere.    [Bondarenko] It is no secret that the government did not pay  peasants on time for last year's harvest. It is only now that  the agrarian sector is being allocated a sum running into  trillions. Fears are being voiced that this money will once  again go down the drain. Yet at the same time, something must  be done about the debts. What do you see as the best solution?    [Gaydar] This question must be divided into two parts. The  ordered grain must of course be paid for. But at the same time  we must also see the root of the current nonpayments crisis. I  repeat, the government has taken on a financial burden that is  totally beyond its capabilities. In 1993 decisions were  promulgated regarding the retention of the state order for food,  major federal investment programs, and high -- and, what is  more, indexed -- purchase prices for the harvest, whereby the  government drove itself into a corner.    [Bondarenko] Shouldn't the unfavorable consequences of these  measures have been foreseen straightaway?    [Gaydar] They were quite obvious even then. A very serious  mistake was made, let me tell you.    [Bondarenko] But why?    [Gaydar] Because there is a tremendous temptation not to  take money seriously. Especially if you can avoid paying today  and leave it until a few months later. Because current funds  and what are still only proposed funds are quite different  things: You are very conscious of the former, but the latter  are just a hope of better things to come. Especially when you  are coming under pressure from all sides, beset by demands or  even threats. Take the agrarians. They simply implored us:  Just make us a promise and it will all work out all right.  Nevertheless everything ultimately has to be paid for and,  regrettably, at a very high price.    What do I see as a reasonable solution? Once you make  promises, you must carry them out like it or not. But you must  think twice before venturing to make any promises. And  agriculture is by no means the exception here.    [Bondarenko] In the light of what we have said, how do you  see the country's economy developing by the end of the year?    [Gaydar] Two scenarios are likely. One presupposes that the  government will nonetheless be able to keep some control of the  situation and not take the stupid actions that it is vigorously  being pressed to take. Let us hope the authorities will not  fling credit around all over the place. Although even in that  situation the Cabinet of Ministers will be forced to work under  serious pressure. Because in my view inflation will remain  fairly high until the end of the year, fluctuating between 15-20  percent a month. In any case, I do not see any real chance of  an appreciable fall in this indicator. This means that we  should not expect major private capital investment, nor will the  preconditions for economic growth emerge. But at the same time  this does not mean inevitable collapse.    The second scenario is far less favorable. If the government  succumbs to the lobbyists' demands, it will have to considerably  increase the growth of the money supply. And, faced with the  subsequent rapid price rise, the authorities will end up having  to introduce a fixed ruble rate of exchange and establish tough  price controls. As a result we will once again be faced with  commodity shortages, loss of ruble convertibility, and,  ultimately, the end of the reforms.    [Bondarenko] In your view, what should the center's regional  policy be?    [Gaydar] It should of course be based on the principles of  normal federalism, which presuppose the clear-cut distribution  of sources of income for the federal and local budgets. The  republics, krays, and oblasts must be able to use their own  financial resources independently. They must be given extensive  powers in the field of economic activity on the territory under  their jurisdiction. Nevertheless, federal bodies must  effectively monitor the unity of the Russia-wide market and  regulate foreign economic ties.    [Bondarenko] We are coming up to new elections to local  bodies of power. Not-unfounded fears are being voiced that the  communists and similar forces may quite easily take their  revenge during these elections. And once they have consolidated  their position at the helm in the regions, they would wage a  more decisive offensive on the center. I would like to know  what you think about this.    [Gaydar] The situation is indeed a difficult one. That is  why we have tried to create more organized and competent  managerial organs in the regions that would not subsequently  repeat the vexing mistakes of the past. I believe the results  of the coming elections will be like the previous ones,  extremely differentiated. We do know, after all, that the  December elections to the Moscow Duma brought success for the  democrats. I am hoping for a similar result in other major  centers. Nevertheless it is too early to predict the outcome of  the campaign in many regions.    [Bondarenko] I realize that both the "Russia's Choice"  movement you lead and the president need one another's support.  Nevertheless, a perceptible distance between them has been felt  just recently. Is that due to tactical considerations, or is  the problem more serious?    [Gaydar] I must state unequivocally that we still support  Boris Nikolayevich and he us. The fact that, as head of state  elected by the whole people, B.N. Yeltsin must consider various  factors and cooperate with a broad spectrum of political forces,  is another matter. It is no secret, however, that we by no  means always agree with the decisions taken within the  president's entourage.    [Bondarenko] Can "Russia's Choice," in view of the size of  its deputy faction, use the State Duma not only as a platform to  propagandize its ideas but also to put them into effect?    [Gaydar] I admit this is difficult. We do not after all  have a parliamentary majority, but nonetheless we are not  abandoning our attempts to achieve our aims. For instance, we  have just been able to make substantial amendments to the new  Criminal Code. There are also other draft legislative acts that  we intend to promote with the support of other factions.    [Bondarenko] How strict is internal discipline within your  faction? Are deserters threatened with exclusion from the list  of deputies?    [Gaydar] We give our deputies fairly broad autonomy. We  even agreed to two of them switching to other factions, although  that was indeed only their own wish. I am very surprised by the  press speculation regarding the alleged crisis or even split in  our bloc. On the contrary, "Russia's Choice" now seems to me to  be the most disciplined faction -- and the most solid faction in  light of the results of voting in the Duma, since the other  democratic factions cannot compete with it. Nevertheless I do  not rule out the idea that in time one or two people may break  away from us. However, the express desire of representatives of  other parties and independent deputies to cooperate with  "Russia's Choice" easily makes up for these losses.    [Bondarenko] How did parliamentarians react to your  intention of creating a party of the same name on the basis of  the election campaign movement?    [Gaydar] You know, to my amazement this idea met with  extremely broad support from democratic factions. Even those  colleagues who were previously seen to waver are vigorously  joining in the work of organizing the new political party, whose  task is to act as a stable base for implementing socioeconomic  transformations.    [Bondarenko] Which factions do you rank among your closest  allies in the Duma?    [Gaydar] Based on the results of the voting, the "12  December" deputy group is very close to us. They are followed  by the Party of Russian Union and Accord and the  "Boldyrev-Yavlinskiy-Lukin" faction.    [Bondarenko] How likely is the possibility of a broad union  of democratic forces in the near future?    [Gaydar] We have always been and will remain in favor of  that. So, it is up to the other members of the democratic  movement.</p>

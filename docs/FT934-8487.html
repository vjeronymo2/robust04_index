			<p>931115 FT  15 NOV 93 / Alfonsin backs Menem reform PRESIDENT Carlos Menem of Argentina and former president Raul Alfonsn, new leader of the main opposition Radical party, last night signed an agreement opening the way for constitutional reform allowing Mr Menem to stand for re-election, John Barham reports from Bunos Aires. In the agreement between two bitter enemies, Mr Menem agreed to opposition demands to call off a planned plebiscite on constitutional reform scheduled for next Sunday. In return, Mr Alfonsn promised Radical backing for the ruling Peronist party in a forthcoming congressional vote to amend the 1853 constitution.</p>

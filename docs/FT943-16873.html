			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telegraph blow The Telegraph, whose share price has plunged following its decision to cut its newspaper cover price, suffered a fur-ther blow yesterday when it announced that it had lost one of its brokers. Cazenove, generally considered the most blue-blooded of the City's stockbroking firms, resigned The Telegraph brokership, leaving Panmure Gordon, formerly joint broker with Cazenove, as sole broker to the newspaper group. Cazenove stuck to its custom of making no public comment, but rival brokers said the move could only cause further damage to The Telegraph's standing. The perception is that institutional investors have been incensed at the way Hollinger, the Canadian publishing group run by Telegraph owner Mr Conrad Black, sold 12.5m Telegraph shares just over a month before the newspaper cut its cover price to 30p, and have been venting their displeasure on the company's broker. 'It was an extraordinary sequence of events and any attempt to make it look respectable has been severely damaged by the Cazenove resignation,' said one disgruntled analyst. Telegraph shares ended the day 15 lower at 364p</p>

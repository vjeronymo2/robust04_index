			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Unpopular counties killed off Avon and Humberside county councils, two creations of the 1974 reorganisation, will be abolished in 1996 as part of the local government review. The announcement, made yesterday by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, had been widely predicted, as the 1974 counties were thought to be unpopular. Unitary authorities, combining the powers now held by county and district councils, will be formed in their place. In Avon, Bristol will become a unitary council, while Bath will merge with the surrounding Wandsdyke district, and Northavon with Kingswood, to form new merged unitaries. Woodspring district, centred on Weston-super-Mare, will become a unitary on its current boundaries. In Humberside Mr Gummer has slightly altered the proposals made by the Local Government Commission. Hull will become a unitary council, as seems likely to happen with most of England's provincial cities, but Mr Gummer suggests that its present boundaries should be extended, a provision not made by the commission. The remainder of Humberside north of the Humber will become one large unitary, to be known as East Yorkshire. South of the Humber the towns of Scunthorpe and Grimsby will merge with the more rural district councils that surround them to form two new unitaries. In North Yorkshire Mr Gummer has made significant changes to the blueprint presented to him by the commission. York will be given extended boundaries and become a unitary, in line with the commission's propo-sals. But the proposal to amalgamate all the other districts of North Yorkshire into two unitary 'ridings' has been dropped, after fierce opposition from local MPs. Instead, North Yorkshire outside York will continue with two tiers as at present. Proposals to merge Goole with Yorkshire have also been dropped. In Somerset the commission's proposal to create three unitary authorities has been abandoned, while Mr Gummer did not to ask the commission to reconsider its proposal that Lincolnshire should remain untouched, with two tiers of local government. Nine unitary authorities will be created, with a total population of slightly more than 1.9m. The commission said that the counties of Avon and Humberside had 'never been supported generally by local residents, who clearly wanted change'. Mr Gummer defended the decision to create unitaries in some areas but to leave two tiers intact elsewhere. Compulsory competitive tendering of English local authorities' information technology services has been postponed by a year and will not now start until October 1997, the Department of the Environment announced yesterday. At that point metropolitan authorities and councils which avoid reorganisation in the local government review must expose 70 per cent by value of their information technology work to competition.</p>

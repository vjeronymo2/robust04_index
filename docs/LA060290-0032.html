			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFRESHING MEMORIES ABOUT CLAY-LISTON II  </P> <P> Earl Gustkey's recollection of Clay-Liston II is a tad time-warped. When the  facts are more interesting than the legends, print the facts.  </P> <P> Liston was in the best shape of his career for the rematch, then the fight was  postponed six months when Ali went under the knife for hernia surgery. By fight  night, Liston had lost his physical and mental edge and had gained six pounds.  </P> <P> Liston lost by KO on his feet, and I lost $28.  </P> <P> MARSHALL HUTCHASON, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Khalil Makkawi, Lebanon's </F> Ambassador to the United Nations, in New York, by Sayyid  al-Miliji, in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue from  Afar" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Miliji] What steps has the Lebanese Government  taken to make the Security Council discuss the kidnapping of  Mustafa al-Dirani?    [Makkawi] We asked for an urgent Security Council session to  discuss the blatant Israeli aggression against Lebanon's  territorial sanctity and the kidnapping of Lebanese citizen  Mustafa al-Dirani as soon as we received the Lebanese  Government's instructions last Saturday. That act was a  violation of human rights, the UN Charter, and the principles of  international law. I met with the Security Council chairman for  that purpose. The issue is now in the hands of the Council and  consultations are underway to set the date for the session.    [Al-Miliji] You have undoubtedly discerned the prevailing  attitudes of the Security Council members on this issue during  these consultations. Can you tell us about them?    [Makkawi] We immediately started contacting the permanent  members. The majority of them showed an understanding of  Lebanon's stance because, as I said, that action was a clear,  blatant, and unambiguous aggression. We will contact the  Nonaligned Movement's members in the Security Council to  undertake the task of supporting and backing this complaint.  There is an overall understanding within the United Nations of  Lebanon's stance and demand.    [Al-Miliji] Let us take the Security Council's permanent  five  members. What exactly is their stance?    [Makkawi] With the exception of the United States, which  does  not yet have clear instructions, the other countries that we  have met with--Russia, China, France, and Britain--have shown  understanding and are ready to respond to the Lebanese demand  for a session and to let the Security Council make some decision.    [Al-Miliji] Haven't you held consultations with the U.S.  Administration?    [Makkawi] I am in touch with the U.S. representative to the  United Nations. The Lebanese Government is undoubtedly holding  consultations through our embassy in Washington.    [Al-Miliji] Has the U.S. representative told you anything?    [Makkawi] They are still studying the issue. We have not  been informed so far of the final U.S. stance.    [Al-Miliji] Going back to the issue of Mustafa al-Dirani and  its repercussions, what is your opinion of the situation?    [Makkawi] Israeli planes staged raids yesterday morning,  killing dozens of people in the al-Biqa' Valley. We will inform  the Security Council of this issue.    [Al-Miliji] Isn't Mustafa al-Dirani's issue linked to the  Lebanese resistance activities in south Lebanon, specifically to  Hizballah's activities?    [Makkawi] Al-Dirani is a Lebanese citizen. He was in bed  when he was kidnapped. The Israeli raid targeted a site in the  al-Biqa' Valley. As I said, dozens were killed and wounded.  Hizballah in Lebanon is Lebanese resistance against the Israeli  occupation. This resistance remains legitimate and recognized  by the UN charter and international law as long as this  occupation continues. All the problems in south Lebanon are  caused by Israel's continued occupation of parts of south  Lebanon and western al-Biqa'. These actions will continue as  long as there is an occupation. The only solution lies in  Israel's commitment to implement Security Council Resolution  425, which demands that it withdraw immediately from south  Lebanon. Israel still refuses to comply with this resolution.    [Al-Miliji] From what you are saying, there appears to be  coordination between the Lebanese Government and the national  resistance in the south. Is that true?    [Makkawi] Every country has the right to resist occupation.  Resistance is legitimate as long as there is occupation. This  is not restricted to Lebanon. All countries in the world have  fought occupation and colonialism. This is what the Lebanese  people are doing.    [Al-Miliji] This raises the question about the security  situation in Lebanon. Doesn't this Israeli operation and the  ease with which it was done raise this question?    [Makkawi] Israel has gotten into the habit of undertaking  such operations, not only in Lebanon but also in various parts  of the world. I remind you of the Tunis operation in which a  Palestinian official was killed. Israel is militarily developed  and can carry out such operations regardless of the military  situation in Lebanon.    [Al-Miliji] What does Lebanon plan to do in the next stage?    [Makkawi] The Security Council should ask Israel first to  stop its aggression against Lebanon and second to release this  Lebanese citizen immediately. These are Lebanon's main demands.    [Al-Miliji] Will this take the form of a resolution?    [Makkawi] We are holding contacts. I do not know yet what  the Security Council's reaction will be. It might issue a  resolution or a statement. How the Security Council will act is  not clear yet.</p>

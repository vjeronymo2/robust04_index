			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Satellite channels lose viewing share SATELLITE television channels have lost viewing share to the traditional broadcasters in homes with satellite dishes. The surprising finding comes from the latest analysis by BARB, the official body that measures television ratings. BARB found that over the year to May average weekly viewing in satellite homes increased by 73 minutes to a total of 25 hours 11 minutes. Nearly all the increase - 66 minutes - was accounted for by viewing channels such as ITV or BBC 1. Total viewing on BSkyB - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake - fell by 8 minutes over the year to 5 hours 13 minutes. The BSkyB audience share fell by 1.5 per cent.</p>

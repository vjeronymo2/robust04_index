			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BMA links up with Air Canada British Midland Airways yesterday announced a commercial link-up with Air Canada, which will allow the airlines to offer seats on each others' services. The code-sharing arrangement, which will require government approval in Canada and the UK, is due to start on June 1. BMA's announcement follows the deal last month between Virgin Atlantic Airways and Delta Air Lines, the third-largest US carrier, based on a similar code-sharing agreement. However, Virgin and Delta also announced their intention to take up block bookings of each others' seats, which BMA and Air Canada will not be doing. The link will allow Air Canada to connect with BMA from Heathrow to Glasgow, Belfast, Edinburgh, Leeds, Bradford and Teesside. Passengers will be able to collect their connecting flight board passes and select seats at the point of departure. BMA began similar code-sharing arrangements with United Airlines of the US in April 1992, and with American Airlines in November 1993, and yesterday said it would be pursuing further such deals. Meanwhile, Mr John MacGregor,the transport secretary, yesterday confirmed to the Commons that he had recently put new proposals to the US in an attempt to break the deadlock in talks over the liberalisation of air services.</p>

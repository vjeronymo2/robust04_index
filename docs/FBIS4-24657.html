			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Make Persistent Efforts To </F> Accomplish Plan To Sell State Treasury Bonds"]    [Text] This year's work of issuing state treasury bonds is  proceeding smoothly, the plan to issue two-year state treasury  bonds has been accomplished ahead of schedule, and the process  of issuing three-year state treasury bonds has come close to 70  percent fulfillment.    The scale of issuing state treasury bonds this year is  markedly larger than last year, while the period arranged for  their issuance is markedly shorter than last year. In the past  two months, with the support from the broad masses of the  people, issuance of state treasury bonds made satisfactory  progress, and many localities saw people competing to buy state  treasury bonds.    The issuance of state treasury bonds is a good thing which  benefits the country and the people, and the issuance of state  treasury bonds this year is a big issue which has a bearing on  reform, development, and overall stability. In particular, it  is of great significance to strengthening macroregulation and  control, checking inflation, and ensuring the construction of  key projects. Apart from using market methods to strengthen  sales, the relevant departments have also adopted many  preferential policies and conditions toward the issuance of  state treasury bonds to enable investors enjoy benefits; as a  result, state treasury bonds have become an important means for  the masses to preserve and increase the value of the money in  their hands. Therefore, this year's issuance of state treasury  bonds has won the enthusiastic support and response of various  social quarters in the whole country. Judged from the issuance  situation in the last two months, most buyers of state treasury  bonds are individuals from the masses, and this shows that the  real foundation of the national debt market rests on the broad  masses of people.    Since this year, the national economy has continued to  maintain a good development trend, various reforms have  proceeded normally, and the financial and revenue situations are  very good, and this has provided a relatively good macro  environment for the work of issuing state treasury bonds. This  year, governments of various levels have attached great  importance to the work of issuing state treasury bonds, and they  have organized efforts and exercised leadership effectively; the  financial departments of various levels, banks, and relevant  organs established the concept of the overall situation,  coordinated efforts among themselves, and earnestly organized  propaganda and provided many convenient services to the people  as they promoted state treasury bonds; and propaganda  departments gave active support by launching propaganda, and  this was also an important factor contributing to our success.    At present, there are only a few days left to the deadline  for the issuance of two-year state treasury bonds, and it is  only one month to the deadline for the issuance of the  three-year bonds. Relevant departments in various localities  must make persistent efforts and continue to do solid work in  sales and service. Although the plan to issue two-year state  treasury bonds has been accomplished ahead of schedule, relevant  departments in various localities must continue to meet the  needs of units and the masses who want to buy state treasury  bonds and continue to run the business of "using the old to  change for the new." Because the work of issuing two-year bonds  will soon end, purchasing power will change course to the  three-year state treasury bonds, therefore, the relevant banks  must still adopt effective measures and do a good job in  propaganda and service to allow units and the masses to further  understand the preferential conditions of the three-year bonds,  as well as the function of buying state treasury bonds as a  means to preserve and increase the value of their savings.  Financial departments at various levels and securities agencies  should create conditions for active participation in and  assistance to the work of promoting the three-year state  treasury bonds, and, through flexible and convenient sales  service, meet the need of various social quarters who want to  buy state treasury bonds. Through common efforts, this year's  plan for the issuance of state treasury bonds will surely be  accomplished on schedule.</p>

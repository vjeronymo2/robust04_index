			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Oils improve as Germany stimulates general activity THE latest German news was a stimulus for most bourses, and some oils also made ground on the Opec ministers' meeting in Vienna, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT rejoiced in the April M3 money supply figures and, after a 2.74 rise to 722.03 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX closed 17.48 better at 1,802.96, its highest since the Gulf crisis began in August, 1990. Gains on the week were 3.1 and 4.6 per cent respectively. Turnover rose from DM9bn to DM9.2bn. Among carmakers, attention turned to BMW which rose DM21.70 to DM614.506; Volkswagen and Daimler both outpaced the market, too, VW in spite of worries about short-term operating profits, and guarantees to finance subsidiaries in mid-week. In steels, Mannesmann rose DM9.60 to DM306. This was chart-inspired, a broker said, since DM300 had been seen as a strong resistance level. MILAN surmounted a bout of profit-taking to close higher again, the Comit index ending 5.37 higher at 493.78 on the day, up 4.5 per cent on the week. Fiat led again on speculation about further international alliances following its Dollars 2bn accord with FSM of Poland, closing at L5,380 against L5,285 in the kerb on Thursday. PARIS made a positive start to the June account, helped by the firm performance of oils, and by stronger bonds. The CAC-40 index advanced 28.29 to 2,045.12 for a gain of 1 per cent over the week. Turnover was some FFr2.53bn. Total and Elf both had good days as the Opec meeting appeared to be nearing an agreement on output. Total, which rose FFr9.30 to FFr260, also announced that it had signed an agreement with Russia to bring a new oil field on line. Elf was FFr12.50 better at FFr394. Alcatel Alsthom rose FFr9 to FFr652. Dealers noted that this was a rebound after declines earlier this week, following Alcatel's placement of 10m ADSs in the US. AMSTERDAM was firmer with the CBS Tendency index up 0.4 at 130.4 for a rise of 1.8 per cent on the week. Buehrmann-Tetterode, a good performer this week, rose Fl 2.50 to Fl 52.50. The paper and packaging group pleased the market last week with first quarter results which suggested that it was well-placed for recovery. A number of buy recommendations have been issued and foreign buying has been active. Royal Dutch closed Fl 1.10 firmer at Fl 152.50 on expectations of a conclusion to the Opec ministers' meeting in Vienna. Grolsch, the brewer, seemed to be benefiting from the hot weather as Heineken had done earlier in the week, rising Fl 2.80 to Fl 207.80. Fokker had another active day but closed unchanged at Fl 35.10 after seeing an intraday high of Fl 35.80. ZURICH followed Frankfurt up, encouraged additionally by the fall from 5.0 to 4.3 per cent in the latest annual monthly consumer price inflation figures from the city of Basle. The SMI index closed 7.0 higher at 1,931.7, a gain of 0.6 per cent on the week. STOCKHOLM saw foreign interest in Asea and Electrolux help to enliven an otherwise dull day. The Affarsvarlden index finished up 0.3 to 1,001.4 for a gain of 1.6 per cent on the week. Turnover was a moderate SKr518m from SKr731m on Thursday. Asea and Electrolux B shares both gained SKr4, to SKr385 and SKr286 respectively. BRUSSELS was firmer in fairly active trade. The Bel-20 index gained 1.92 to 1,215.78, for a 0.8 per cent rise on the week. Kredietbank was up BFr25 to BFr4,995 after reporting better-than-expected net profits for 1991/92. OSLO recovered on higher oil prices. The all-share index advanced 3.37 to 451.93 in turnover of NKr235.3m.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAY 22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1195.97  1195.89  1195.53  1197.38  1198.04  1197.83  1197.25  1197.48  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             Day's High  1199.11    Day's Low  1195.04  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        May 21    May 20    May 19    May 18    May 15       1187.57   1187.62   1180.66   1184.41   1171.24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

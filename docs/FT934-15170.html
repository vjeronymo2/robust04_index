			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Murdoch plans bonus issue of 'super' shares MR RUPERT MURDOCH's News Corporation, the Australian-based media, film and publishing group, yesterday announced plans to create a new class of shares with 'super' voting rights, which would be issued on a one for one basis to existing shareholders. The proposals, announced at News Corp's annual meeting in Adelaide, could allow the company to issue further ordinary shares in pursuit of expansion or debt reduction without diluting control. The level of equity controlled by Mr Murdoch - either directly or through his family company, Cruden Investments - has fallen from 45 per cent to 32.7 per cent since 1990 as a result of equity-related issues. Yesterday's announcement seemed to surprise the Australian Stock Exchange. Shares with 'super' voting rights have never featured in Australia. One official said the proposal raised fundamental investment issues and the ASX would need to canvass the financial community's opinion. As the plan would tend to lock in the existing voting interests at News Corp, it would also leave the group well defended against potential predators. Mr Murdoch told shareholders: 'We believe that, if we are successful in increasing News Corporation's capital base through the issue of equity, it must be done in a manner that continues current management. 'If we are to continue to grow and prosper and meet the demand of the technological age in which we live, it is important to ensure that the management that brought News Corporation to this point, be available to lead it in the future,' he added. At the meeting, Mr Murdoch forecast a profit increase of about 20 per cent for the first quarter of the current financial year. He defended News Corp's decision to slash the price of its two UK daily newspapers, The Times and The Sun. 'The pricing of all newspapers in Britain over the last five to 10 years has been well ahead of inflation. We were pricing ourselves out of the market.' He predicted that BSkyB, of which News Corp owns half and in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, also has a stake, should make at least Pounds 180m operating profit this year. But the recent acquisition of the New York Post - the tabloid daily previously in bankruptcy - would do nothing to help the bottom line. 'We will probably lose in the range of USDollars 5m a year, maybe as high as USDollars 10m.' News Corp was still interested in magazine publishing in the US, despite the sale of titles two years ago. It was also 'on the lookout' to buy more television stations, adding to the eight already owned. 'We will be able to buy, within the law, two more stations and then be covering about 25 per cent of the US.' Lex, Page 18</p>

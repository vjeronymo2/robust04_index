			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Anyone for tennis? - A licensing deal to use the name of a prestigious event like Wimbledon or a popular cartoon character can give a big boost to sales A small west London company, G Ettinger, has spent 60 years establishing a name for itself as a designer and manufacturer of high quality leather goods and fashion accessories. Until a year ago, growth was steady rather than spectacular but it has since taken off on the back of a licensing agreement with the All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club, home of the Wimbledon championship. Ettinger's use of the Wimbledon logos - crossed tennis rackets and a stylised letter W, both in the club's distinctive purple and green colours - has given a significant boost to the company. Sales of bags, belts and wallets with the Wimbledon logo are expected to account for up to Pounds 100,000 of Ettinger's Pounds 1.5m turnover this year, estimates Robert Ettinger, marketing director. The Wimbledon line is now on sale in two shops at the championship site, at upmarket outlets such as Harrods and in leather goods shops around the country. 'We have opened up dozens of large new accounts,' says Ettinger. 'Having products with a famous name attached makes selling so much easier.' Ettinger acknowledges that although he initiated the link with Wimbledon, he was concerned that licensing would not be appropriate for a small company. He feared it would require enormous financial resources and an army of sales reps. In fact, small firms may be better placed to win licensing deals than large companies, says Tony Gadsby Peet, vice-president in charge of licensing at International Management Group (IMG), which arranges sporting promotions. 'Bigger companies tend to have a well established reputation and most of their activity is designed to promote their own name,' he comments. 'A small company will pay more attention to detail and will devote more attention to a licence because it is worth more to it in terms of its overall business,' adds Rob McCowen, marketing director for the All England Club. The licensor will, however, be looking for a well-run small business which will not damage the 'property' it wants to license. 'We have to make sure the company is not so small that it is not financially viable,' says McCowen. 'It would depend on the product. If the company made clothing, you would expect a high level of sales and the company would have to make a significant investment.' 'You want a company with an established reputation and established distribution networks,' notes Gadsby Peet. There is no point licensing a brand name to a company which is too small to exploit the opportunity. Eros Products, a north London company, established itself as a distributor of plastic housewares and children's lunchboxes and drinking flasks before signing up its first Disney licence in November 1989. 'We had a customer base among the multiple stores; a broad range of products; and a good position in the low to medium price range,' says Joseph Yeung, financial director. Eros now has no fewer than 15 licences from companies such as Disney, Mattel and Warner Brothers for 'characters' including Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Postman Pat, Barbie and Batman. Character merchandising accounts for 65 per cent of turnover, projected to be Pounds 6m this year. The company now has such a well established position in the field of character merchandising that it can afford to turn away propositions which do not meet its own requirements. It turned down approaches to license the Gazza name, because the former Tottenham footballer Paul Gascoigne would not attract a broad enough public. 'We are not interested in short-run licences or characters who are too obscure,' says Yeung. Copywrite Stationery, a Duxford-based company which makes 90 per cent of its Pounds 15m sales from folders, pencils and rucksacks bearing licensed characters, checks whether characters have been successful on other products and that they appeal to retailers. Copywrite discusses 'properties' and market trends at regular meetings with other distributors of character merchandise (none of them in the stationery area), says Mike Redfern, managing director and joint founder. 'We also try to get some customer reaction,' he adds. 'We mock something up and ask Woolworths if they like it. The licensors hate you doing that but I would advise it.' Copywrite is very dependent on its licensors but makes sure it has a wide spread of characters across its three main ranges: children, students and fashion. Redfern says he makes sure that the characters he picks get good television exposure. He looks for guaranteed repeats as well as the initial 13-week run of a TV series. Gadsby Peet advises licensees to ensure that associated TV programmes are actually being made and are not just being discussed. A company which is looking for licences can either approach a licensor direct or use a licence agent. The agents who handle characters or brands are a different breed to those who deal with technical product licences, notes Gadsby Peet. When drawing up a contract there are four main areas to be considered: DURATION The typical contract is for between one and three years though one year contracts do not really allow the licensee to obtain the maximum benefit so they should negotiate for an option on renewal where possible. A company will not want to commit itself to developing new products for a very short-term arrangement. ROYALTIES The level will depend on the products covered by the contract. Wimbledon normally agrees 'single figure' royalties with its licensees because it is selling what it believes is a durable brand image and not a character which may only have a short shelf-life. Royalties have risen over the past decade from a normal 5 to 6 per cent to around 10 per cent, says Gadsby Peet. But this is an average figure and low-margin items such as confectionery and food would carry a lower royalty than jewellery. Copywrite spends nearly Pounds 1.5m a year on royalties on turnover of Pounds 15m, says Redfern. MINIMUM FEES Licensors will usually set a minimum royalty figure to ensure that the licensee works hard to exploit the character or the brand. A licensee who agrees to a 10 per cent royalty with a minimum fee of Pounds 5,000 must expect to sell at least Pounds 50,000 worth of goods to cover his royalty payment. TERRITORY Licensees would normally expect to have exclusive rights for a particular character or name and an agreed range of products in a set geographical area. Ettinger started with European rights and recently negotiated the right to sell to duty-free shops around the world except for Japan. US licensors are normally only interested in selling Europe-wide rights, rather than single-country territories. Signing the rights to a character or brand is only the start of the relationship, the experts warn. The characters and the products must be kept 'fresh'. Eros arranges for regular redesigns of the illustrations which appear on its lunchboxes and flasks (the licensor must approve the drawings and the colours used) and constantly improves on the products themselves. But if the relationship is properly managed, it can bring many benefits to the licensee. As well as increased sales, the branded products often carry higher margins than their unbranded rivals. A successful licence can also improve the licensee's negotiating power with suppliers or with customers. One potential customer offered Eros unattractive credit terms when it was initially approached. After several months the company came back with an improved offer when it saw how well Eros's products were selling through rival outlets.</p>

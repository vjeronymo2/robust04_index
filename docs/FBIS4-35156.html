			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Annerys Gonzalez; from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Regarding the suspension of constitutional  guarantees, Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom explained that  the right to stage peaceful demonstrations has not been  suspended.    [Begin Escovar recording] I have told people that the fact  that the guarantees have been suspended does not mean that the  government is going to become a dictatorship, nor does it mean  that the government is going to suppress the rights of citizens.  I have asked them to expect a prudent attitude, a discreet, but  at the same time stern attitude on the part of the government.  [end recording]    The interior minister will meet in his office today with the  governor of the federal district and the chiefs of the various  security corps of the state to discuss the security situation in  the country. The objective of the meeting is to define the  security strategies to be followed during the time that certain  constitutional guarantees are suspended.</p>

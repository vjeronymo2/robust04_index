			<p>BFN     [Text] The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] president, Mr. L.K.  Advani, says India should exercise the nuclear option for  national security and to prevent any attempt of intimidation of  neighbors and superpowers. Addressing the three-day national  council meeting of the party in Wadodara this morning, he warned  of dangers to the country arising out of, what he termed, the  U.S. tilt toward Pakistan. Mr. Advani also alleged that the  policies of the Narasimha Rao government will affect both the  economic and security interest of the nation. The BJP president  said behind the nonproliferation initiative of the United States  is the assumption that India must subcontract its national  security to Washington. He said western influences, particularly  American interests, shape the debate on nuclear arms and missile  system. Mr. Advani said his party is opposed to the  globalization policies of the government. He called for a  reversal of the priorities and said that foreign trade and  investment should only be useful supplements to national effort.    More than 300 delegates are attending the national council  session which began this morning. Prominent leaders attending  the meeting include Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee and Mr. Murli  Manohar Joshi.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Coopers sheds 49 partners COOPERS &amp; LYBRAND, the accountancy firm, has shed 49 partners in the last year, figures released yesterday show. The firm announced the admission of 36 new partners, bringing the total to 702 in May compared with 715 at this time last year. The firm said a disproportionate number of partners had decided to retire, partly reflecting those taken on when Coopers merged with Deloitte in 1990.</p>

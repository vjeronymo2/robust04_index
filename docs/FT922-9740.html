			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (7): UK export success THE high-accuracy probe, pictured above, can achieve measurements within two-hundredths of the width of a human hair. The TP7 probe provides a large measuring machine with a sense of touch by sending signals to a computer. The probe, developed by Renishaw Metrology of Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, has attracted significant export orders. It has applications in many aspects of engineering and quality control - ranging from the measurement of engine blocks for Concorde aircraft and Jaguar cars to the inspection of moulds for ice-cream lolly-makers. The original concept was developed in 1973 by David McMurty, Renishaw's group chairman. Since then, the group has won seven Queen's Awards, mainly for probe-related products - five for export achievement and two for technology.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMELESS AGAIN AFTER FIRE GUTS A HOMEY HOTEL  </P> <P> The holiday season at the Mayfair Hotel started with a bountiful Thanksgiving  feast, but now the low-income residents are facing a bleak Christmas in the  aftermath of a fire that left them homeless.  </P> <P> The downtown Pomona hotel -- the only one in the area that accepts emergency  housing vouchers from the county -- has been closed indefinitely after a fire  in the hotel basement Friday night sent residents fleeing into the street.  </P> <P> Since then, more than 30 residents of the 60-room hotel have been unable to  find another affordable place to stay and have been sleeping every night in an  emergency shelter set up by the Pomona Valley Chapter of the American Red  Cross.  </P> <P> "I don't know what we're going to do," said Rose Johnson, who had moved into  the hotel a few weeks ago with her husband, Kermith, and 10-year-old daughter  Shadona. "The whole thing is, we need a place to live. Without a place to live,  you can't do anything."  </P> <P> Kermith, 38, an appliance technician who has been unable to find steady  employment, said he thought things were looking up when he moved into the  Mayfair with his wife and daughter.  </P> <P> At $100 a week, the room was affordable, he said, and the atmosphere was  friendly. Sylvia Hernandez, who managed the hotel and lived there with her six  children, cooked a Thanksgiving feast that included six turkeys and invited  everyone to dinner in the lobby.  </P> <P> Johnson said: "I enjoyed this Thanksgiving more than I enjoyed any Thanksgiving  in the last five or six years."  </P> <P> But about 11:45 the next night, hotel employees saw smoke curling up from the  basement, called the Fire Department and ran through the halls, pounding on  doors. Everyone managed to get out safely.  </P> <P> Owner Ed Uehling said the fire, which caused an estimated $400,000 damage,  apparently started because of an electrical malfunction and spread from the  basement to a restaurant on the first floor. In the hotel, which occupies the  second through fifth floors, firefighters knocked in doors, ceilings and walls  while battling the blaze, and there was extensive smoke damage.  </P> <P> Uehling said he hopes to repair and reopen the hotel, but is waiting for the  city to assess the structure and tell him what he is legally permitted to do.  </P> <P> The building also housed a cocktail lounge, dentist's office and barbershop,  all closed because of the fire.  </P> <P> The Mayfair was "state of the art" when it opened, Uehling said, but that was  in 1915. The building was constructed by a former Pomona postmaster, Walter  Moore Avis, and opened as the Avis Hotel.  </P> <P> The hotel declined over the years, but was remodeled at least twice and was  providing low-cost housing for the working poor and those on government  assistance. About half the rooms, Uehling said, were occupied by residents  placed there by a county program to help the homeless.  </P> <P> Nick Hernandez, director of the Pomona office of the county Public Social  Services Department, said the Mayfair was the only hotel in the Pomona area  participating in the county voucher program, which provides shelter, a week at  a time, for homeless persons while they try to obtain permanent residences and  seek other assistance or jobs. The Mayfair rented rooms to the county for $16 a  day.  </P> <P> Hernandez said that since there is no other hotel available in the Pomona area,  residents who were living at the Mayfair at county expense will be offered  rooms at hotels in downtown Los Angeles that have rates of $13.50 and $14 a  night. "We'll also provide transportation there," Hernandez said.  </P> <P> But, Hernandez conceded, that may not be an attractive offer for those who have  ties to the Pomona area.  </P> <P> Tom Kirven, Red Cross disaster chairman, said many of those displaced by the  fire are trying to find nearby accommodations on their own. A number of them  have jobs, but not many can afford the first and last month's rent needed to  move into even the cheapest apartments, he said.  </P> <P> The Red Cross opened an emergency shelter at the Pomona Valley YMCA on the  night of the fire. The next day, the shelter was moved to the gymnasium at the  Pomona First Baptist Church to take advantage of kitchen facilities. The Red  Cross has been providing breakfast and dinner.  </P> <P> Kirven said the Red Cross intends to keep the shelter open until residents find  other accommodations, and is trying to provide additional assistance with the  initial rent to help people get re-established. But, he said, the expense is  draining the Pomona Valley chapter's budget for disaster services, and money  donations are being solicited.  </P> <P> Mary Gonzalez, 29, a cosmetology student, said she and a roommate had been at  the Mayfair for four months, ever since they lost $1,500 to a man they say  posed as the owner of a rental house in Fontana. They moved into the house and  then were evicted by the real owner, they said, leaving them without the money  to rent an apartment. So they came to the Mayfair.  </P> <P> Gonzalez said they found residents of the Mayfair eager to help each other.  "You'd walk up the stairs, and neighbors' doors would be open. You'd talk to  each other. It was like a family."  </P> <P> Judi Jones, a retired teacher who had lived at the Mayfair for five years, said  she always kept a pot of chili in her room to feed anyone in need of a meal.  </P> <P> "I have a very bad back and emphysema," she said, "and six or seven people  would go to the market for me. They all helped me, but I helped them too. . . .  It just breaks my heart to lose my home. I just don't know what I'm going to  do."  </P> <P> Bobby (Bean) Hardin, 43, said, "It's kind of like breaking up with the family.  We're not related, but we're related in friendship."  </P> <P> Ten-year-old Shadona Johnson said she is grateful for the emergency help her  family has received but she's worried about the future. "I want to thank all  the Red Crosses," she said. "They did good for us when we was down. They fed  us. They put a roof over our heads. (But) the biggest Christmas present I could  have right now is a home."  </P> <P> HOW TO HELP The Pomona Valley Chapter of the American Red Cross is soliciting  financial donations to help replenish its disaster services fund, which has  been depleted by its assistance to residents displaced by the Mayfair Hotel  fire. The chapter's address is 675 N. Park Ave., Pomona 91766. The phone number  is (714) 622-1348.  </P></p>

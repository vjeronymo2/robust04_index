			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Overconfident GPA wanted advisers to increase share offer GPA GROUP, the aircraft lessor, was so confident that its aborted flotation would be oversubscribed that it pressed its advisers to announce an increase in the size of its global offer from 80m to 95m shares just 10 days before they were due to be traded. Nomura International, which acted as global co-ordinator, yesterday confirmed that the company wanted the advisers to announce that 15m more shares had been issued. But the advisers refused, arguing that demand would not justify such an increase. Instead, they agreed to fix the maximum amount of shares on offer at 85m which was published with the listing particulars on June 8. The increase was cited at the time by GPA as evidence of strong demand for its stock. Mr Tim Pettee, vice-president of Alliance Capital, which manages about Dollars 60bn (Pounds 32.4bn) of pension and mutual fund assets in the US, said: 'When I read that the issue had been increased to 85m shares I could not believe it. It was simply not going that well to justify any increase.' The issue was aborted on Thursday after tenders for only 50m shares, predominantly from retail investors, were received. Two of GPA's advisers yesterday said they felt the hype surrounding the announcement was 'totally unjustified' and gave a 'misleading impression that demand was stronger that it was. Another explained that the group was obliged by the London Stock Exchange to say what the maximum amount of shares was on offer. While the prospectus, issued on May 14, said the group planned to issue up to 80m, the figure was never binding. 'When we agreed that the maximum amount of shares on offer would be 85m it should never have been interpreted as evidence that demand was strong', said one GPA investment banker. 'The company had always said at the time of the prospectus the final amount of shares on offer maybe more than 80m.' A spokesman for GPA said: 'The advisers advised us on how many shares should be on offer and they should stand by their advice.' GPA's advisers, which also include Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch in the US and Schroders and BZW in the UK, have forfeited their 4 per cent success fee worth around Dollars 32m. The advisers only received their expenses, totalling Dollars 16m.</p>

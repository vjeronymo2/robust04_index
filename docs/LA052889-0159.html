			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> YOUNG TURKS GIVE BOOST TO OLD RACEWAY;  </P> <P> NEWCOMERS ARE BIG REASON WHY FADING ASCOT TRACK IS EXPERIENCING A REVIVAL AS IT  HEADS FOR FINAL FINISH  </P> <P> The roar from stock cars careening around the quarter mile at Ascot Raceway  last Sunday did little for Mike Kirby's headache.  </P> <P> Kirby, a native of Carson, has been one of the hottest newcomers on the  California Racing Assn. sprint-car circuit the past year and a half. He has  also shown a propensity for racing pro stocks, bomber ovals and figure-8s in a  career that is nearly a decade old. But as he sat on a bale of straw in the  windy infield here, he wasn't sure he wanted to race anything again except  figure-8s.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to race today. No way," he said about that night's stock car  card. He was still reeling from the previous night, when problems with his  sprint car forced him out of that night's main event.  </P> <P> Still, Kirby wanted it known that he is capable of driving just about anything,  and he changed his tune about driving last Sunday several times.  </P> <P> "If I want to drive (stocks) I will," he asserted. "I can race those things if  I have to."  </P> <P> As versatile as he is, Kirby, 26, is just one of Ascot's promising young South  Bay home boys. The group, which includes P. J. Jones of Rolling Hills Estates  (full midgets), Frank Pedregon of Gardena and Sean Birmingham of Torrance  (three-quarter midgets), and Chris Laney of Gardena (stocks, bomber ovals and  figure-8s), is part of the reason the tired, old Gardena track is experiencing  a revitalization less than 18 months from its final event.  </P> <P> Racing continues tonight and Monday at the annual Salute to Indy, but  eventually the track is scheduled to close. The land it sits on, roughly a  triangular lot where the Harbor, San Diego and Artesia freeways meet, is slated  for development once the lease with the raceway's owner, Agajanian Enterprises,  expires in 1990.  </P> <P> Ironically, the number of competitors at the track has increased over the past  two years after about a decade of decline, according to Executive Vice  President Ben Foote. About 117 cars of various types run there on any given  Saturday.  </P> <P> "In the sprints alone, it was not uncommon 10 years ago to have at least 50  cars running," Foote said. "In the mid-'80s we had 30 to 32 cars. Now on most  nights we have 40 to 45, about the most of any association in the country."  </P> <P> Foote attributes the rise in new, young drivers to a variety of factors. In the  midget class, he said, the allure of racing under the national banner of the  United States Auto Club is important to younger drivers. USAC became involved  with Ascot a few years ago.  </P> <P> "For the young guys, I think there is enthusiasm for running with a national  organization," he said.  </P> <P> Foote also said that the type of events offered at Ascot, like Enduro racing,  attract a lot of drivers who just want to race for fun and then later take up  the sport seriously. Laney began his career in Enduro, which features street  cars modified only with a roll bar for the driver's protection.  </P> <P> "I think racing for fun appeals to the younger guys," Foote said.  </P> <P> Ascot's demise isn't news around the track, but it certainly doesn't set well  with the youth invasion. "We just want to race," Pedregon said.  </P> <P> As for Kirby, he had good reason not to run in the pro stocks last Sunday. A  fiery crash the night before at Ascot took the life of fellow sprint-car racer  Jeff Bagley, the 1988 Rookie of the Year. And, because of Kirby's misfortune in  the main, there was speculation that his sprint sponsor was considering  canceling the remainder of its season if problems with the car aren't corrected  quickly.  </P> <P> There is little doubt, however, among Ascot officials that Kirby would hook up  with another racing team.  </P> <P> "He's such a good driver," said Ascot spokeswoman Carol McEvoy Richardson.  </P> <P> A slow starter, Kirby is the oldest of the younger drivers. He did not qualify  for a sprint main until his ninth time out last season. But since then he has  recorded some impressive finishes, including third in a major national event  two weeks ago in Knoxville, Tenn. He won Ascot's novice figure-8 title in 1981  and the overall figure-8 crown in 1987. He was Most Improved Driver last year  in quarter mile sprint-car racing.  </P> <P> Jones, 20, is among the youngest successful drivers at the track. He began his  career in go-carts and won more than a third of all his races. He began racing  midget cars late in 1986 but was still voted USAC Rookie of the Year. In 1987  he finished fifth in overall points in USAC midgets. He is the eldest son of  1963 Indy 500 winner Parnelli Jones.  </P> <P> Pedregon, 25, spent most of his youth in the pits for his father, Frank, a  top-fuel drag racer, at famed Lions Drag Strip in Wilmington. In 1980 he raced  diesel trucks, then moved onto dirt carts in 1983. A year later he won the  Grand National title on pavement. He set a record of eight consecutive main  event victories in 1986, then moved up to three-quarter midgets. He has been  seen on ESPN's Thunder Series from Ascot and on May 4 finished third in the  full midget main.  </P> <P> Birmingham, 21, was the USAC three-quarter Rookie of the Year in 1988 after  five top-10 finishes. An auto mechanic by trade, he began racing motocross when  he was 6. In his late teens he was on the pit crew for the late driver Roger  Newell. Newell was involved in a fatal accident at Ascot and that convinced  Birmingham to start out in the three-quarters. He says he plans to return to  sprint cars in a couple of years.  </P> <P> Laney, 20, is perhaps the hottest driver of the youth movement right now,  despite opening the year with three blown engines in his first three events. A  first-place finish April 30 in the pro stocks "hiked his chances for Rookie of  the Year honors," according to the Winston Racing Series News.  </P> <P> Laney is running about even in points with another talented racer, Tony Zaffino  of Carson. Zaffino was last year's Rookie of the Year. Laney's efforts are a  family affair. Brother Paul owns the race car, his fiancee, Karla Kirby (Mike  Kirby's sister), helped pay for the motor and brothers Mark and Brett serve as  his pit crew. "All the money I've got is in this car," Laney said. On the night  Kirby chose not to race, Laney finished fourth in the pro stocks, fifth in the  bomber oval and first in the figure-8.  </P> <P> All of the young turks of the track appear to have futures, no matter where  they race when Ascot is closed.  </P> <P> "Almost all drivers would race anything just to get a ride," Birmingham said.  </P> <P> They won't have to beg, it appears. Ascot as their home track is expected to  keep them racing when it shuts down.  </P> <P> "We think Ascot is one of the premier leaders in racing, particularly in the  area of promotion," said Chris Boals, national field representative for the  National Assn. of Stock Car Racing, during a visit to the track last Sunday.  </P> <P> Ascot has been a proving ground for many top auto racers. Ten of the 33 racers  in today's Indianapolis 500 have raced here. In 1988, 14 of the drivers at Indy  had performed at Ascot in their careers.  </P> <P> Of the home boys, Jones probably has the greatest chance at moving on to Indy  cars. In fact, he says that following in his dad's footsteps is a goal. "This  is a steppingstone where you learn the basics," he said of the dirt track at  Ascot. "You make a mistake here, it's not going to hurt you."  </P> <P> Pedregon likens Ascot to his home. It is a unique place, he said, right down to  the damp odor of the slick track and the brown adobe mud that clings to shoes.  </P> <P> "When you are at Ascot, you know it," he said.  </P> <P> Jones agrees.  </P> <P> "Ask anyone in the United States (who knows racing) about Ascot and they will  tell you that this is one of the premier dirt tracks in the nation."  </P> <P> Laney calls the Ascot oval "a driver's track," and says racers who compete here  often fare better in out-of-town races.  </P> <P> But even with this year's ESPN coverage, which concludes Thursday at 5:30 p.m.,  Ascot has suffered from a lack of exposure, and the youthful drivers say that  has hurt their image.  </P> <P> Said Jones: "The crowd factor has hurt. We just can't get L.A. people to go to  the races. There are so many other things to do here."  </P> <P> Boals says there's no doubt each of the young drivers would receive more  attention in areas like the Midwest and South, where all forms of racing are  highly popular.  </P> <P> "These guys would be heroes in small towns," he said.  </P> <P> Late afternoon rays from an orange sun cast shadows onto the mud-stained  billboards around the track as Kirby remained in the infield. No, he would not  race today, he said once again. Maybe he'd work in the pits. He could race. He  just didn't want to.  </P> <P> When all the cars were off the track, he negotiated the muddy surface and  jumped over the retaining wall, disappearing into the pits. He wouldn't race  tonight, but there would be other times, just as there had been before.  </P></p>

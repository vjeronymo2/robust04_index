			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Gilts gain favour, but be cautious - Bonds / What makes sense for institutions may not hold good for investors SOME OF the UK's largest investment institutions have been building up their holdings of bonds in recent months. They have been switching cash out of equities in favour of fixed-interest investments. For example, Norwich Union announced recently that it now has 16 per cent of its main fund invested in bonds, against nothing at the start of 1991. The rationale is simple: Equities are most attractive at a time of high growth and inflation. Growth boosts company profits and increases dividend payments, while capital gain from rising share prices is a hedge against inflation. In contrast, bonds pay a fixed rate of interest, not linked to company profits, which makes them attractive in times of uncertainty about future the profitability of companies. Moreover, investors' initial capital outlay is simply returned at the end of the life of the bond with no capital gain. This makes bonds more attractive when inflation is low. Many institutional investors, including Norwich Union, are now predicting that the UK and most other economies are heading for a period of relatively low economic growth and low inflation. These are precisely the conditions which favour investment in bonds. So ought private investors to follow suit and immediately switch into the bond markets? One argument against doing so is that UK government bonds, the easiest and safest fixed-interest investment for a private investor to make, look set for a hard time over the first part of ths year. During 1991 as a whole, investment in gilts paid a handsome reward. As UK interest rates came down, bond yields fell to match, with bond prices rising as a result. The yield on 10-year UK government bonds fell from 11.2 per cent in January 1991 to 9.83 per cent by the end of the first week in January. But the best of the gains came in the early part of the year. From the middle of September onwards, the gilts market was treading water. Coming into 1992, there is no reason to expect a fast buck from holdings of gilts. First, there is a real possibility that UK interest rates may have to go up again, to support stering within the European exchange rate mechanism. If interest rates go up, so will bond yields - hence bond prices will fall. Second, the prospect of a general election is unsettling the market. During the last quarter of 1991, bond prices tended to swing with the fortunes of the government in the opinion polls. This pattern is likely to continue until the election is out of the way - which may not be until the summer. While the UK government bond market enters the new year under a cloud, the outlook for many overseas markets is more encouraging. The best performing bond market last year was that of Australia. A balanced portfolio of Australian government bonds offered a total return of over 25 per cent over the year. Several other markets also turned in a better performance than gilts, and there is a strong probability that many more will do so in 1992. However, the risks for a private investor in holding overseas government bonds are substantial. Foreign exchange movements can easily wipe-out any gains made from falling interest rates and rising bond prices. The safest route into foreign bond markets is through one of the growing number of international bond funds set up with private investors in mind. The sector has boomed in recent years, with 25 authorised funds now listed by Micropal, up from just three in 1982. The big international bond funds can spread investments over a number of overseas markets. This spreads the risk of any adverse currency movements wrecking investment returns. Over last year, the best performer in the sector was the Norwich International Bond fund. Taking account of dealing costs, Pounds 100 invested at the start of 1991 was worth Pounds 117.70 by the year end, according to Micropal figures. In fact, this level of return was easily matched by the top performing UK-only bond fund, the Whittingdale Gilt Growth fund. Other gilt funds also matched their international rivals lower down the league table. But with the gilts market now facing an uncertain period, the international funds might be expected to outstrip their UK-only rivals. However, a fund is only as good as its fund manager. And fund managers are divided over which international markets are the best bets for 1992. Many now favour the German government bond market, on the grounds that German interest rates are so high now that there is only one way for them to go: down. Other investment managers favour smaller European markets such as Spain and Portugal, where interest rates are also expected to fall over the next year.</p>

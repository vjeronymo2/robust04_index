Cost analysis should be included in the plans, where appropriate, to evaluate an intervention(s) that addresses one of the three priority areas of violence-related injury research previously outlined, (i.e., youth suicide, firearm injuries, and interpersonal youth violence). A more complete discussion of methodologies for assessing cost analysis is presented in, A Framework for Assessing the Effectiveness of Disease and Injury Prevention, (CDC, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, March 27, 1992, Volume 41, Number RR&hyph;3, pages 5&hyph;11). (To receive information on these reports see the section  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon receipt, applications will be screened by CDC staff for completeness and responsiveness as outlined under the previous heading, Program Requirements (A&hyph;F). Incomplete applications and applications that are not responsive will be returned to the applicant without further consideration. Applications which are complete and responsive may be subjected to a preliminary evaluation by a peer review group to determine if the application is of sufficient technical and scientific merit to warrant further review (triage); the CDC will withdraw from further consideration applications judged to be noncompetitive and promptly notify the principal investigator/program director and the official signing for the applicant organization. Those applications judged to be competitive will be further evaluated by a dual review process. Awards will be made based on priority score ranking by the Injury Research Grants Review Committee (IRGRC), programmatic priorities and needs by the Advisory Committee for Injury Prevention and Control, and the availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. The first review will be a peer review to be conducted on all applications. Factors to be considered will include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The specific aims of the research project, i.e., the broad long-term objectives, the intended accomplishment of the specific research proposal, and the hypothesis to be tested;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The background of the proposal, i.e., the basis for the present proposal, the critical evaluation of existing knowledge, and specific identification of the injury control knowledge gaps which the proposal is intended to fill;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The significance and originality from a scientific or technical standpoint of the specific aims of the proposed research, including the adequacy of the theoretical and conceptual framework for the research;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. For competitive renewal and supplemental applications, the progress made during the prior project period. For new applications, (optional) the progress of preliminary studies pertinent to the application;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The adequacy of the proposed research design, approaches, and methodology to carry out the research, including quality assurance procedures, plan for data management, and statistical analysis plan;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The extent to which the evaluation plan will allow for the measurement of progress toward the achievement of the stated objectives;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Qualifications, adequacy, and appropriateness of personnel to accomplish the proposed activities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The degree of commitment and cooperation of other interested parties (as evidenced by letters detailing the nature and extent of the involvement);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The reasonableness of the proposed budget to the proposed research and demonstration program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Adequacy of existing and proposed facilities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The second review will be conducted by the Advisory Committee for Injury Prevention and Control. The factors to be considered will include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The results of the peer review;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK tax High among the budget hopes of many a corporate treasurer must be a lower burden of unrelieved advance corporation tax (ACT). According to the London Business School, this is growing at the alarming rate of over Pounds 400m a year. The severity of the UK recession means many companies are generating an ever larger proportion of their profits overseas. Since they have not enough mainstream UK tax liabilities to offset the levy on dividends, the effective tax rate on their profits has increased even as recession deepened. A decision by the chancellor to attack this anomaly would unravel the distortions it has created in corporate investment and borrowing. But it should be welcome to investors too. Not only could dividend payments be increased without fiscal penalty; the lower effective tax rate would also increase net income and thus companies' market value. Unfortunately this looks like too arcane a measure for a budget designed to grab the ordinary voter's attention. It also sits ill with official concern about excessive dividends in recession, while Mr Lamont will doubtless have noted that the present regime encourages investment at home rather than overseas. Other changes would have more targeted stimulatory effect. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, for example, is homing in on the uniform business rate, from which enterprise zones like Canary Wharf will shortly lose exemption. If the chancellor does pass up the ACT opportunity, however, last year's fall in UK profits will raise the taxed cost of dividends for many companies in 1992, thus putting yet more pressure on payouts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, Feb 15 TASS -- Some 20,000 violations of  nuclear safety were registered in 1993 by the Russian state  inspection for nuclear and radiation safety.    The inspection visited 14,500 Russian enterprises using  nuclear materials or radioactive substances. The extreme  measure of enterprise halt was used 78 times, Inspection  Chairman Yuriy Vishnevskiy told a news conference here today.    As for nine nuclear power plants with 29 power units, there  were no accidents related to melting of the reactor active zone  and discharge of considerable amount of radioactive substances  into the atmosphere, same as big fires with the exception of  several spontaneous fires and smoking up.    A total of 38 percent of accidents at nuclear power plants  happened through the fault of personnel, a considerable amount  of violations is related to malfunction of equipment and system  elements.    A major reason for nuclear safety violations is the lack of  money. The nuclear branch was the only Russian one that  preserved its output in 1993, but it fails to receive payment  for electricity consumption. In the words of Vishnevskiy, the  Russian Ministry of Finance did not allocate a single ruble in  1993 to raise safety of nuclear power plants. The 1994 planned  allocations of 114 billion rubles will hardly be received as  well.    Another problem is the lack of corresponding legislation.  Russia is the world's only state that does not have laws on the  use of nuclear energy and state policy on treatment of  radioactive waste. Draft documents were kept by the former  Supreme Soviet for 18 months, but no decision were taken.    Due to the absence of legislative acts, the inspectors  cannot  invoke efficient economic sanctions against violators of nuclear  safety. Today's fine for violation of nuclear safety rules by  an individual is 100 rubles (six cents).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["vwd/DPA"-attributed report: "Carl Bildt Speaks of </F> European Inland Sea"]    [Text] Bonn, 27 June 1994 -- In Bonn on Monday [27 June],  Sweden's Prime Minister Carl Bildt, Schleswig-Holstein Minister  President Heide Simonis, and Mecklenburg Western Pomerania  Minister President Berndt Seite predicted a great future for the  Baltic Sea area as an economic region. Bild said that, within  the next 10-15 years, the area would become one of the most  important and dynamic regions in Europe.    In Bildt's view, it will now be important to develop the  Baltic Sea into the "European Union's Inland Sea." In this  connection he was also banking on the Federal Government and its  upcoming EU presidency and the land governments of  Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg Western Pomerania.    Seite and Simonis pointed out that the Baltic Sea area has  been given a new perspective through the forthcoming EU  accession of Sweden, Norway, and Finland, and the political  changes and reforms in northeast and Central Europe. Seite:  "The Baltic Sea has become a sea of opportunities." The  countries on the shores of the Baltic Sea need future-oriented  technologies. He, therefore, asked the Schleswig-Holstein  minister president to participate in the Transrapid project.    Mrs. Simonis expects from the German EU presidency that the  north would be integrated into the European Union more strongly,  too, and that not "everything is pumped into the south of Europe  -- the bacon belt," as has been the case so far.    The Swedish Government head also expressed his optimism in  Bonn that his country's accession to the European Union would be  supported in the upcoming referendum. With the exception of the  former communists, all Swedish parties gave a clear signal to  vote "yes." He was quite sure that the Swedes would vote in  favor, Bildt said, adding that he also assumed that the  referendums in Norway and Finland would yield a positive result,  too.    For the prime minister, who signed the treaty with the  European Union along with the government heads of the other  Nordic EU candidates at the EU summit in Corfu, it is now of  particular importance to initiate the process for Polish  membership. "As far as this question is concerned, we are  pinning high hopes on the German EU presidency, due to begin on  1 July." The same applies to paving the way for Estonia,  Latvia, and Lithuania for future EU membership.    He described the search for a new president of the EU  Commission as the European Union's most important personnel  decision for the next 10 years. "All three men that have been  in the contest so far are very good candidates," he said. Bildt  said he was having difficulties noticing differences on basic EU  issues between them.    In a lecture he gave later in Bonn, Bildt, whose schedule  also included a meeting with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl,  pleaded for integrating Russia more closely into Baltic  cooperation. World War II will really be over only when the  last Russian Forces had withdrawn from the Baltic states. He  welcomed the European Union's partnership agreement with Russia.  He appealed to the Baltic countries to be generous toward their  Russian inhabitants.</p>

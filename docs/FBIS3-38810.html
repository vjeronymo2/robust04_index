			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial report] Helsinki Suomen Yleisradio Network in  Finnish at 1209 GMT on 7 February carries a 36-minute live  broadcast of a news conference given in Helsinki by  President-elect Martti Ahtisaari.    Answering a question on whether he will make official visits  to the Nordic countries before visiting Russia, Ahtisaari  replies that he wants to visit neighboring countries as soon as  possible, but naturally this also depends on the hosts. Asked  whether there is a chance for Paavo Vayrynen of the Center to  become foreign minister again, Ahtisaari rules out this option.  He says that he wants to follow closely the progress of the  talks on European Union membership.    The first round of elections eliminated the traditional  political elite, Ahtisaari says. The election expressed  people's desire for a more humane economic policy. The message  from women is that much remains to be done about equality. He  will try to find solutions, with the government, to a number of  problems.    Although he has not yet had time to hand in his Social  Democratic Party membership card, Ahtisaari says his  relationship with the party will be the same as with the other  parties. Answering a Norwegian journalist, Ahtisaari says he  hopes Sweden and Norway will enter the European Union at the  same time as Finland; it is important that all are in it  together. As regards steps to combat unemployment, Athisaari  says he will not divulge what he intends to discuss with Prime  Minister Aho.    On the issue of Sarajevo, Ahtisaari notes that it is  essential to identify the "murderers" responsible for the recent  shelling of Sarajevo. His message to the various parties in the  conflict is to seriously seek peace; no party is free of blame,  all of them have committed atrocities. Finland should  concentrate on peacekeeping, not peace enforcement.    Returning to the European Union issue, Ahtisaari says that  since the government decided to consult the people in a  referendum, the result of that referendum should also be binding.    The first round of the election eliminated politicians with  the longest experience, Ahtisaari said. Elsabeth Rehn worked in  parliament and served as minister for four years; he himself had  largely worked abroad. The people now expect a more open  political climate.    The broadcast concludes at 1245 GMT, when Ahtisaari was due  to start answering questions by foreign reporters.</p>

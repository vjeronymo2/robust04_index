			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / DTI attempt to recover Clowes millions absurd, court is told THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry's attempt to recover Pounds 19.8m from Mr Peter Clowes, the jailed former head of the collapsed Barlow Clowes investment empire, and his wife Pamela involved 'a degree of unreality bordering on absurdity', defence counsel told a High Court judge yesterday. The DTI was inviting the judge to shut his eyes against commercial reality, Mr Philip Engelman, for Mr Clowes, said. Mr Clowes, who is serving a 10-year sentence for theft and fraud, faces an application for summary judgment - without a full hearing of the issues - for the return of Pounds 19.8m of the money lost by investors. The DTI had told vice-chancellor Sir Donald Nicholls that Mr Clowes and his wife were jointly liable for the millions missing from Barlow Clowes and Partners. The shortfall was discovered following the compulsory winding-up in July 1988 of Barlow Clowes Gilt Managers, which had taken over the management of investors' funds in gilt-edged securities. Mr Engelman said that nowhere had the DTI attempted to explain how the shortfall came about. If the court looked at the matter there was no shortfall in terms of the construction of the contracts with investors. There were too many unexplained issues in the case. It was unsuitable for a summary judgment and a full trial of the issues should be held, he said. The DTI claim is one of many against Mr Clowes, who cheated thousands of small investors of an estimated Pounds 113m by falsely promising to invest in government gilt-edged securities. He spent the money on a yacht, an executive jet, expensive cars and various business enterprises. Only Pounds 1.9m of a Pounds 115m investment fund was found to have been invested in government stock. The hearing continues today.</p>

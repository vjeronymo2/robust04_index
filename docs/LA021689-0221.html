			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DETAINEES END HUNGER STRIKE AFTER S. AFRICA PROMISES MANY RELEASES  </P> <P> Political detainees ended a mass hunger strike today after the South African  government, fearing a situation "too ghastly to contemplate," indicated that it  will free most of the 1,000 prisoners held without trial, their lawyers said.  </P> <P> "We have decided to suspend our hunger strike," more than 300 strikers in  Johannesburg's main prison, Diepkloof, and in city hospitals said in a  statement issued through lawyers.  </P> <P> Some of the prisoners had been starving themselves for 24 days and were risking  serious health problems.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the Johannesburg prisoners said Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok  indicated during intensive talks this week that he will reconsider the cases of  each detainee around the country and will release many of them.  </P> <P> "We have received indications from the minister that perhaps the majority of  them will be released," lawyer Kathleen Satchwell told a news conference.  </P> <P> The apparent compromise solution avoided grave suffering to prisoners and  headed off a major political crisis for Pretoria. Neither side claimed a total  victory.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fall Short of Demands  </P> <P> The reported undertakings by Vlok fell short of demands by the hunger strikers  that they should be released immediately and unconditionally and for an end to  detention without trial.  </P> <P> "It will not advance our cause to say they have lost and we have won, (but) we  are glad we have got to where we have got," said Anglican Archbishop Desmond  Tutu, who issued a statement in Cape Town after the meeting that appealed to  the hunger strikers to suspend their protest.  </P> <P> "Mr. Vlok told the church leaders that he agreed with them that the death of a  hunger striker would have consequences 'too ghastly to contemplate.' "  </P> <P> However, the strikers in Johannesburg, who took food at 7 a.m., said in a  statement that they do not feel their action has been fruitless.  </P> <P> "On the contrary, an important victory has been won. We have succeeded in our  principal objective -- to highlight the desperate plight of detainees and to  protest arbitrary detention," they said in a statement.  </P> <P> "This is a victory for negotiation," a spokesman for Vlok, who asked not to be  named, said in Cape Town. He acknowledged that the hunger strike hastened a  review of detainees' cases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fast Began Jan. 23  </P> <P> The first group of strikers began their fast Jan. 23. They said they had no  alternative because, under emergency laws, Vlok could hold them indefinitely  without bringing them to court or even giving a reason for continuing to jail  them.  </P> <P> It was not clear whether more than 100 detainees at Port Elizabeth's St. Albans  prison, who stopped eating about 10 days ago, had ended their protest. Lawyers  representing them were due to meet Vlok later today.  </P> <P> Churchmen who saw Vlok, including heads of the country's Roman Catholic,  Reformed, Methodist and Anglican churches, said they will watch to ensure that  he honors his assurances to free a substantial number within two weeks.  </P> <P> The six-member church delegation that met with Vlok included the Rev. Allan  Boesak, who had fasted since Monday in solidarity with the hunger strikers. He  said he is suspending his fast for two weeks because of the prospect of  widespread releases.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> POINDEXTER'S REQUEST FOR INQUIRY REJECTED  </P> <P> The judge in the Iran-Contra trial of John M. Poindexter rejected a renewed  defense request to conduct a further examination of whether the former national  security adviser's prosecution was improperly influenced by his immunized  congressional testimony. U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene held that  Poindexter's lawyers had again failed to demonstrate that independent counsel  Lawrence E. Walsh had relied on any of Poindexter's immunized testimony. Walsh  was prohibited by law from using evidence derived from Poindexter's testimony  to the select House and Senate Iran-Contra panels. Poindexter was convicted on  all five felony charges lodged against him.  </P></p>

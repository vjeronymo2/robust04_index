			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Tsutomu Hata will make his  parliamentary debut as prime minister next week with a  relatively high public rating but surrounded by increasingly  hostile opposition forces determined to topple his minority  government.    The Hata coalition itself already appears to be in disarray  with rifts emerging within two of its partners -- the Japan New  Party (JNP) headed by Hata's predecessor in the premiership  Morihiro Hosokawa and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP).    Another headache for the Hata cabinet, inaugurated in late  April, is a controversial remark on Japan's wartime actions by  Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano which angered its Asian  neighbors still harboring memories of Japanese aggression before  and during World War II.    Political sources said Nagano, a former chief of staff of  the  Ground Self-Defense Force, will likely be forced to resign only  a few days after he was installed in the post.    Nagano, who participated in the invasion of China as an  Imperial Army soldier, told the MAINICHI SHIMBUN newspaper this  week that the 1937 Nanjing massacre, in which China says more  than 300,000 Chinese civilians were killed, is a "fabrication."  He also challenged Hosokawa's statement that Japan waged "a war  of aggression and a wrong war," saying Japan fought the war to  liberate Asian countries from their Western colonizers.    His remark immediately sparked sharp and bitter reactions  from China, South and North Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and other  Asian countries.    Hata, now touring Europe, also criticized Nagano, saying the  remarks were "inappropriate" and Japan's wartime aggression  inflicted "unbearable pain and sorrow on many people."    The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the country's No 2  opposition party, has calLed on Hata to sack Nagano. The  Japanese Communist Party and Komeito, a coalition partner, have  also demanded his dismissal.    The prime minister will deliver a policy speech to both  houses of the Diet next Tuesday, and will answer questions from  both ruling and opposition legislators Thursday and Friday as  well as May 16.    The prime minister is taking the helm at a time when Japan  faces such major issues as a trade row with the United States,  tax reform and the suspected North Korean development of nuclear  weapons.    But the most immediate task for his cabinet is the  parliamentary passage of the overdue national budget for fiscal  1994 which began April 1. Speculation is mounting that the  cabinet will be forced to resign en masse or dissolve the House  of Representatives for a snap general election after the budget,  badly needed to rev up an economy in the doldrums, has been  cleared through the Diet.    The major opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), ousted  from power by Hosokawa last August after steering the nation for  38 years straight, is poised to join hands in Diet business with  the SDP, which bolted the Hata coalition to become the No. 2  opposition force.    With the withdrawal of the SDP, the largest power group in  the former coalition in terms of number of Diet members, the  Hata camp's strength in the lower chamber has been reduced to  182, far short of the 256 majority in the 511-member house.    Since both the LDP and the SDP have pledged to cooperate  with  Hata in passing the national budget, no major political upset is  predicted before its clearance, but Diet business thereafter  will be tough going for the Hata administration, political  commentators concurred.    Political sources said Hosokawa's JNP, from which three  lawmakers have already deserted, will see a further desertion  this week -- possibly more than 10 of its 37 members -- as  dissatisfaction mounts over its leadership's inclination toward  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, the core power  blocs in the coalition.    Similar disgruntlement is also swirling among members of the  DSP, whose head Keigo Ouchi masterminded a plan to form a  parliamentary group -- the plan which eventually drove the SDP,  antagonistic to some of the political initiatives of Shinseito  and Komeito, out of the coalition, the sources said.    Despite the political waves, the Hata cabinet maintains a  high public popularity, although the rating is considerably  lower than that of the Hosokawa government when it was  inaugurated.    A KYODO NEWS SERVICE poll conducted this week gave the Hata  cabinet a 51.6 percent public approval rating, 24.1 percentage  points less than the Hosokawa administration at its inception.    Important economic figures to be released next week include  the international balance of payments for April and fiscal 1993  (Monday).    The Economic Planning Agency will release a monthly economic  report Tuesday. [passage omitted]</p>

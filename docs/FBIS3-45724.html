You had better ask Patten himself. But, I feel that he himself  is putting pressure on Hong Kong's media by making such remarks  now, and I hope he himself will show respect for the freedom of  the press. Judging from his actual performance, he has put  pressure on Hong Kong's press circles in various ways."    Zhang's remarks were made in answer to a reporter's question  before he attended the opening ceremony of the "Exhibition of  Exquisite Chinese Works of Art," which is being co-sponsored by  Hong Kong's Tsi Ku Chai Company Limited and the Hong Kong and  Shenzhen Boya Art Company and is being held in the China  Cultural Relics Gallery yesterday.    Zhang Junsheng said: "Some people are now shouting loudly  for democracy with all their might. In fact, what democracy can  be obtained here under colonial rule? Actually, there is no  democracy here, so why do they shout loudly for democracy? Hong  Kong can only enjoy real and substantive democracy after 1997."</p>

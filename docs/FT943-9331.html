			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Pinault's plan to take over Fnac hits snag Mr Francois Pinault, the French entrepreneur, yesterday hit a snag in his plans to take control of Fnac, the retailing group, when Compagnie Generale des Eaux, one of the existing shareholders, delayed a decision on exercising its pre-emptive rights over the shares. Artemis, the company that controls Mr Pinault's family interests, last month struck a deal with Altus Finance, a subsidiary of the troubled Credit Lyonnais banking group, to buy the latter's 64.6 per cent shareholding in Fnac for just under FFr2bn (Dollars 370m) However, Generale des Eaux, the utility and media group that last year joined forces with Altus to acquire Fnac from the ailing GMF insurance company, has pre-emptive rights over the holding. Under the terms of the deal, Generale des Eaux has a month to decide whether to exercise those rights. Generale des Eaux yesterday said Altus had agreed that it could postpone its decision for another week. Generale des Eaux, which was originally expected not to exercise its pre-emptive rights, refused to comment on whether it was now considering doing so. Mr Pinault, who has in recent years emerged as one of France's most aggressive businessmen by building up the powerful Pinault-Printemps retailing empire, must also secure the French finance ministry's agreement to complete his attempted takeover of Fnac, which dominates the French music and books market.</p>

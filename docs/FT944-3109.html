			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Taiwan shifts China focus Taiwan yesterday announced a cabinet reshuffle in which the most significant move was seen as shifting emphasis from politics to economics in delicate relations with China. The moves were also seen as an effort by President Lee Teng-hui to strengthen his position in advance of presidential elections slated for early 1996 and subtly to raise Taiwan's level of representation at international economic meetings. The last big cabinet reshuffle took place in early 1993. Mr Vincent Siew, economic planning minister, will head the Mainland Affairs Council, the agency which shapes China policy. Mr Siew has advocated opening direct shipping and air links with China, long banned by the ruling Nationalist party but supported by Taiwanese business interests. His successor as chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development will be Mr Hsu Li-teh, who will remain deputy premier. Mr Hsu will represent Taiwan at next year's Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. President Lee is barred by China's objections from attending the annual trade summit of the region's leaders. China views Taiwan as a rebel-held province and thwarts its attempts to join international organisations. On Tuesday, Mr Siew said Taiwan should consider setting up 'offshore' shipping centres through which direct sea trade with China could be conducted. 'We should actively review the current indirect trade and investment policy and make some appropriate relaxations. . . under conditions of national security, we should consider setting up a shipping centre outside national boundaries,' he said. All cross-strait trade must now by law be routed through a third location such as Hong Kong. Earlier, similar proposals have suggested that one of Taiwan's harbours be designated as the centre for direct shipping with China. However, Mr Siew cautioned yesterday against reading too much into his appointment. 'I will not only focus on economic issues and there will be no major policy change. . . don't expect too much from me,' he was quoted as saying.</p>

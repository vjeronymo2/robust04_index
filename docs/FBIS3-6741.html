			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Anticommunist Fascist </F> Maniac's Colors, Which Have Been Exposed More Clearly"]    [Text] According to broadcast reports from Seoul, puppet  traitor Kim Yong-sam and Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the opposition  Democratic Party, held talks at Chongwadae [presidential office]  on 10 March. During the talks, they reportedly discussed the  revision of the National Security Law, the suppression of human  rights, the visit to the North by Chairman Yi Ki-taek, and the  reopening of the Uruguay Round negotiations. It was reported  puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam flatly said they were impossible.    This clearly shows his colors as a vicious fascist maniac,  an  anticommunist fanatic, and a national betrayer. This also is a  vicious challenge to and a mockery of the South Korean people  who demand that the Uruguay Round negotiations be reopened.    When the Democratic Party chairman demanded that the  National  Security Law be revised, puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam stubbornly  insisted that it was impossible to abolish the National Security  Law, while stating that someone else's ambition to communize  South Korea had not changed.    The puppet traitor said that he could not abolish the  National Security Law in a vicious attempt to maintain the  vicious antireunification fascist law, pursue North-South  confrontation, further step up his civilian fascist  dictatorship, and, thus, brutally suppress the South Korean  people's righteous struggle for independence, democracy, and  reunification.    As everyone knows, the National Security Law is a legacy of  the era of the military fascist dictatorship that made  anticommunism, North-South confrontation, and a fascist  terrorist rule their undertakings. It is a vicious  antinational, antireunification law that declares the fellow  countrymen the enemy, negates reunification, blocks dialogue,  and opposes improved North-South relations and an unprecedented  vicious fascist law promulgated to suppress democratic forces  for reunification, viciously trample people's democratic and  human rights, and justify terrorist acts against and murders of  political opponents. Therefore, South Korean people, human  rights organizations of the world, and Amnesty International  have strongly demanded that the National Security Law be  abolished in South Korea. Moreover, even high-ranking U.S.  authorities repeatedly confirmed that abolishing the National  Security Law is the U.S. Government's official position and  demanded that it be abolished.    Abolishing the notorious National Security Law in South  Korea  is the era's demand, which can no longer be delayed.  Nevertheless, traitor Kim Yong-sam persistently opposed the  abolition of the National Security Law. This again shows the  bastard is a fascist tyrant and a vicious divisionist.    Puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam stated the North's ambition to  achieve reunification under communist terms is what prevents the  abolition of the National Security Law. This is a shameless act  of deceiving reality and is idle talk.    The reunification we advocate is a reunification under a  confederal system based on great national unity. It is traitor  Kim Yong-sam and his cohorts who oppose reunifying the country  based on the principle of coexistence that neither side swallows  or is swallowed by the other.    The Kim Yong-sam clique, which had inspired North-South  confrontation and frantically prepared for war to harm its  fellow countrymen and even babbled about an international  cooperation system, made those remarks. This is preposterous.    Puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam flatly rejected the visit to  Pyongyang by Democratic Party Chairman Yi Ki-taek, saying that  it would not be good for him to visit the North. This is part  of his criminal maneuvers to block national reconciliation and  unity and inspire North-South confrontation.    During his New Year news conference, the Democratic Party  chairman expressed worry about current North-South relations and  expressed his intention to visit Pyongyang to help improve  deadlocked North-South relations. At that time, we acknowledged  this was a patriotic idea that anyone who worries about the  destiny of the country and the nation should have and supported  and welcomed it.    The government of our Republic proposed bilateral or  multilateral negotiations among leading politicians in the North  and South out of an earnest desire to promote great national  unity and reunify the fatherland after transcending differences  in ideas, ideology, and systems and has made sincere efforts to  implement this proposal. For leading politicians of the North  and South to gather and jointly probe ways to end the tense  confrontation within the nation and open a new phase in peace in  the country and its peaceful reunification is not  disadvantageous, but beneficial to the fatherland's  reunification.    Nevertheless, traitor Kim Yong-sam opposed the visit to the  North by the Democratic Party chairman. This is designed to  block multipronged North-South dialogue, monopolize North-South  dialogue, and use it as a means to promote North-South  confrontation just like the former dictators.    Puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam babbled it is impossible to  reopen the Uruguay Round negotiations. This is intended to open  the South Korean rice market at all costs. This is an act that  can only be committed by the vicious toadyist nation-seller and  top-class colonial running dog who does not hesitate to do what  his masters ask him to do, regardless of the destiny of the 6  million South Korean farmers and tens of millions of South  Korean people.    All facts show traitor Kim Yong-sam is an unprecedented  fascist tyrant, antireunification element, and treacherous  traitor. Traitor Kim Yong-sam, who pursues fascism, perpetual  division, and treachery more frantically as time goes by, will  not be able to escape from the people's harsh punishment.  Traitor Kim Yong-sam must squarely see the growing  antigovernment sentiment in South Korea and act with discretion  and resign from power without delay before being subjected to  the stern judgment of history.</p>

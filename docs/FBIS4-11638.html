			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Deputy Prime Minister Michel al-Murr in Beirut </F> on 30 March--recorded]    [Excerpt] The ministerial committee is in charge of  studying the issue of information in general and Legislative  Decree No. 104 in particular -- which the Government has pledged  to amend and redraft for the Chamber of Deputies -- and is to  present it at the next Cabinet session. At yesterday's session,  the Cabinet asked the ministerial committee to meet again to  prepare a new draft law on the audio and visual media.    Following discussions, the committee prepared a specific  program for amending Legislative Decree No. 4, and these  amendments will be presented to the cabinet at its next session,  which I believe will be held next Wednesday [6 April], so it can  make the appropriate decision and refer the draft amendments to  the Chamber of Deputies.    Regarding the law on audio and visual media, which is being  redrafted, the committee reviewed it in light of all recent  developments. We again heard the views of the ministers. There  was a general discussion of this issue and it became evident  that it is necessary to completely redraft the entire law in a  way that ensures the citizen's rights and protects public  freedoms and the homeland's higher interests. Therefore, we  have begun to prepare a new draft law. I believe that we will  able to make progress at the next session in light of all the  data that will be at the disposal of the committee at next  week's session. [passage omitted]</p>

But in March It  Will Be Possible to Sustain Oneself With This Money No More Than  One Week"]    [Text] The Ministry of Labor [Mintrud] of the Russian  Federation has prepared draft documents for raising the minimum  wage, and also the rate for the first grade of the unified  tariff schedule, from 1 March.    It is proposed to increase the minimum wage from 14,620  rubles to 20,500 rubles. And Mintrud considers it expedient to  establish the rate for the first grade at a level of 21,000.    The main question is: Will the new minimum wage, if it is  adopted in this form, improve the position of those who are  inadequately provided for? In order to answer, let us recall  that, according to data of the Russia's Goskomstat [State  Committee for Statistics], the subsistence minimum, which is  calculated according to what just barely makes ends meet, was  58,000 for the able bodied Russian in January. In March,  according to my calculations, this minimum, in line with the  rise in prices, will increase to 78,000 rubles. Thus the new  minimum wage will be about a quarter of the subsistence minimum.  Moreover, if one takes not the whole subsistence minimum, but  only the most meager collection of food products necessary for  survival (39,400 in January, 53,000 in March), then the new  minimum wage in March will be enough for a very meager diet for  only 12 days. The question is: How to live through the remaining  18 days?    Incidentally, this is not the first year in Russia that  the minimum wage has been completely separated from reality.  This is nothing new. What is surprising is that the gap between  the minimum wage and the subsistence minimum, despite widely  circulated statements of Mintrud, is not being reduced but  increased. From 1 December of last year, when, by an edict of  the president of the Russian Federation [RF], the minimum  remuneration for labor was increased to 14,620 rubles, prices  rose--in December by 13 percent and in January by 21.3 percent;  and in February, according to preliminary estimates, they will  rise by 16 to 18 percent. THUS FOR THE THREE MONTHS PRICES WILL  GO UP 1.59 TO 1.62 TIMES, BUT MINTRUD IS PROPOSING TO INCREASE  THE MINIMUM WAGE BY ONLY 1.4 TIMES--that is, to still further  separate it from real requirements.    I remind you: The amount of the minimum wage is the  determinant of the level of most socially guaranteed  payments--benefits, stipends, etc. Is further lowering of the  standard of living admissible, when today 52.6 million Russians  (according to January data) had an average per capita income  below the subsistence minimum, and for 26.3 million citizens (or  one out of every five!) this income was less than the value of  the collection of food products necessary for survival. In other  words, 26 MILLION RUSSIANS ARE LIVING HALF STARVED.  Does Minister of Labor Gennadiy Melikyan understand what the  threat to the country is of further "pressure" on people who  have already been pushed to the limit?    It is true that, with respect to the budget sphere, Mintrud  is nevertheless proposing to establish supplementary increases  to the rates for the first, second, third and fourth grades in  order to at least to some degree raise the miserly wage. But  even with the supplementary increases, the new March wage for  these workers will fall substantially short of the "products  minimum."    This miserly "handout" will be extended to many "budget  workers"--secretaries, typists, cashiers, draftsmen,  bookkeepers, file clerks, clerks, workers in photo labs, records  managers, workers in copying and duplicating offices, nurses  aids, hospital attendants, and other workers whose positions and  categories fall into grades 2 through 4. Mintrud has set for  them payments (together with supplementary increases) of less  than 45,000 rubles a month.    Will it be possible to survive more or less decently on a  wage of 35,000 to 45,000? In a number of regions, evidently,  these amounts will permit people to keep themselves "afloat,"  for example, in the Ulyanovsk, Belgorod, Tula, Orlovo, Smolensk,  Voronezh, and Penza oblasts, where the subsistence minimum, if  one believes Russia's Goskomstat, did not exceed 30,000 rubles  in January. But in most territories, the humiliating amounts  that are conventionally called "a wage" are only heating up the  social atmosphere in society.    In my opinion, the practice of approving a single minimum  wage and rate for the first grade for the entire country is in  principle mistaken. This can only be an accounting indicator.  Each region should have its own minimum wage, linked in  specified proportions to the local subsistence minimum,  gradually approaching it so that in one and a half to two years  they will be equal.    Simultaneously with the proposals for the minimum wage,  Mintrud has finally prepared and sent to the White House a draft  law on the subsistence minimum in the Russian Federation. It is  stipulated in the draft that the government should determine the  relationships between the amount of the minimum wage and of  workers' pensions, and the size of the subsistence minimum of  the corresponding social-demographic groups of the population.    Let us assume that in 1994 the minimum wage will be 50  to 60 percent of the subsistence minimum, in 1995--80 percent,  and that in 1996 the minimum wage will equal the subsistence  minimum. These figures are not in the draft; the relationships  must still be determined if the law is adopted.    The emphasis in the draft is also on extending to those who  are inadequately provided for specifically targeted social  assistance in kind or in value form (through the resources of  the subjects of the Federation).    But what seems absolutely unacceptable is the item in the  draft stipulating that Mintrud of the RF will approve the size  of the subsistence minimum. Not the government, not the State  Duma, but precisely that department that has been the object of  serious complaints in the area of social policy. This is a risky  experiment.</p>

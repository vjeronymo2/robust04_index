			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Junior Ministers Reshuffle Mr John Major yesterday announced the second reshuffle of junior ministers within a week to fill the gap left by the resignation on Sunday of Lord Caithness as a transport minister, Philip Stephens writes. Limiting the latest changes to the government's frontbench team in the House of Lords, Mr Major promoted Lord Strathclyde to minister of state at the Department of Trade and Industry. Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish was given the role of parliamentary undersecretary for transport, taking the portfolio from Lord Caithness. Lord Arran is given a similar post at the environment department. He swaps his previous post at the Northern Ireland Office with Baroness Denton.</p>

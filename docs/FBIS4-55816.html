			<p>BFN     [Text] A joint statement issued by the Joint Command of  the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council  [HVO] points out that the work of the Joint Command so far is  characterized by a high degree of accord on the most significant  matters on which the successful establishment of peace between  Bosniaks and Croats depends.    Members of the Joint Command completely concur in  assessments  that armed conflicts between the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and  the Croatian Defense Council are not in the interest of Bosniaks  and Croats and that significant results have already been  achieved in implementing the Washington agreement, but that the  basic problem lies in the fact that [word indistinct] of the  Army of Bosnia- Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council in  central Bosnia and Herzegovina have the character of armed  conflicts of the formations. There are identical assessments  regarding the need to begin work on bringing the forces of the  Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council onto  positions that would mean a real peace between Bosniaks and  Croats. This would be achieved by deploying units in the  barracks, training grounds, and the like.    Members of the Joint Command are also in agreement about  adopting measures that would improve the situation in Mostar, as  well measures to establish free movement along all roads under  the control of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian  Defense Council. The greatest attention will be devoted to the  measures of protecting roads from all forms of threat,  particularly robbery [word indistinct].    All activities of the Joint Command, in conformity with the  [word indistinct] built and coordinated assessments, will be  performed with a view to having the most complete peace possible  between Bosniaks and Croats, especially to prevent distrust and  suspicion about the political will for implementing the  agreements in practice. The readiness to implement the measures  ensuing from the plan of activity of the Joint Command will be  the best indicator of the degree [word indistinct] of the  political will.    This is stated in the joint statement by the members of the  Joint Command of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian  Defense Council signed by Brigadier General Fikret Muslimovic  and Army General Ante Roso.</p>

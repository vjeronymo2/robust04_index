			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN IN ABORTION FUROR IMPROVING  </P> <P> A woman who underwent an abortion while in a coma in a desperate attempt to  improve her chances of recovering from a car accident is now able to talk and  recognizes family members, a published report said Friday.  </P> <P> Nancy Klein, 32, whose family fought all the way to the Supreme Court to gain  permission for the abortion, is doing "amazingly well" and is slowly regaining  her memory, the New York Times quoted family members and doctors as saying.  </P> <P> A pregnant Klein lapsed into a coma after suffering brain damage in a car  accident on Long Island on Dec. 13, 1988.  </P> <P> Doctors determined an abortion would greatly improve her chances of recovery.  But abortion foes fought to gain guardianship over her in a bid to stop the  operation.  </P> <P> Anti-abortion activists took the matter all the way to the Court of Appeals,  the state's highest court, which sided with Klein's husband, Martin, and ruled  doctors could perform the operation. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the  case.  </P> <P> After the Feb. 11, 1989, abortion, Nancy Klein was transferred to the Center  for Head Injuries at the Robert Wood Johnson Jr. Rehabilitation Institute in  Edison, N.J.  </P> <P> "She's doing amazingly well," said Caroline McCagg, medical director of the  center. "She's made slow, constant progress. It's incredible."  </P></p>

Altogether 4,641 enterprises from all parts of China  invested  a total of 15 billion yuan in this city, China's largest  economic center, last year.    According to economists here, the surge of domestic  investments in Shanghai can be characterized by the enthusiasm  in the development of the New Pudong Area and the interest in  service trade and transforming the old urban districts.    The New Pudong Area is a newly-established economic zone  that  is expected to lead in the transformation of Shanghai's  industrial and financial sectors.    A survey shows that over 1,700 enterprises with a combined  investment of 10 billion yuan from outside Shanghai settled in  Pudong in 1993.    Regarding it as a new corridor to the market of the Pacific  region, Anhui Province, which was hit by natural disasters over  the past two years, still has invested large funds in Pudong.  Many of the projects have now begun to make profits.    Among the 350 securities companies in Shanghai, 176 were  founded by investors from outside Shanghai. The intensifying  interest in real estate has brought 60 new projects to Pudong,  with a total construction area of 1.5 million square meters.    Shanghai's nine urban districts have used domestic  investment  of more than 300 million yuan respectively, to transform old  buildings and improve infrastructure facilities.    The business volume of enterprises from outside Shanghai  topped 20.6 billion yuan in 1993, and they delivered 300 million  yuan to the government in taxation last year.</p>

The group was called the  Southern Luzon Commission (SLC) which covered 15 provinces, 12  cities, and at least 140 municipalities.    With the dismantling of the big rebel organization, its  three  regional party committees and six armed guerrilla fronts have to  report directly to the 16-man national communist party central  committee headed by self-exiled CPP Chairman Jose Ma. Sison. The  dismantling of the SLC was revealed to newsmen by Brig. Gen.  Regino Lacson, Southern Luzon Command (Solcom) officer-in-charge.    In a report to Defense Secretary Renato de Villa, AFP [Armed  Forces of the Philippines] Chief of Staff Gen. Lisandro Abadia,  and Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, commanding general of the Army,  Lacson said that the dismantling of the big rebel organization  came about as a result of military-orchestrated events and  tactical campaigns in the Southern Tagalog Region, and the Bicol  Region.    The campaigns, he said, left a big void in the rebel  organization's leadership caused by mass defections and death in  encounters of top NDF leaders, NPA field commanders and armed  regulars.    The Solcom chief reported that four armed terrorist groups  --  the Apolonio Mendoza Agbay, and the "A-A" and "Daba" companies  of the mobile regional guerrilla unit (MRGU) and the urban  guerrilla command of the SLC -- were finally crushed by military  intelligence operatives and field troops who waged relentless  search-pursue-and-destroy operations.    In Bicol, the NPA's Regional Operational Command (ROC), the  Regional Educational and Cultural Committee, the Front Mass  Action Committee, and the Revolutionary Agrarian Staff of the  Camarines Sur West Guerrilla Front and the Regional NDF United  Front Commission had been disbanded and dissolved, he said.    Also dissolved were the Caltex Military Sector of the  Quezon-Bicol Zone Front Committee and the Front Guerrilla Unit  "Aguila" in Masbate, he said.    The Quezon-Bicol Zone Front Committee, which used to have  four district committees under it -- the Quirino, Onofre de  Mesa, Mercedes and Guijo Committee -- now operates only in  Camarines Norte, Lacson added.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which is taking control of 224 insolvent  savings institutions, announced that it is temporarily halting S&amp;L rescues.  S&amp;L regulators rescued or propped up 223 institutions last year, mostly by  issuing promissory notes and pledging to cover losses. The FDIC, a commercial  bank regulator, will spend the next month taking control of the remaining  failed S&amp;L under orders from President Bush. The FDIC said it was calling a  halt to assistance transactions until it can evaluate the institutions. After  that, it will only resolve cases that can be supported by the S&amp;L insurance  fund's cash flow.  </P></p>

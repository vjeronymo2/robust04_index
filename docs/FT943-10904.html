			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Move by Tesco awaited Speculators continued to drive ahead shares in William Low, the Scottish supermarket group, on growing expectations that a counter-bid from Tesco to last week's Pounds 210m offer from J. Sainsbury is imminent. Low shares raced up 17 to 340p with turnover at 1.6m. Many analysts believe Tesco will return to the fray at 350p a share - 125p a share more than its original offer three weeks ago. Sainsbury has offered 305p a share. Sector analysts expressed some concern about the implications of the suggested bid prices for Wm Low. According to NatWest Securities, a Tesco bid at 350p (financed equally by cash and equity) would be earnings dilutive by 0.89 per cent in 1994-95, becoming enhancing by 2.67 per cent the year after. Significantly, at 380p, the dilution to Tesco's earnings increases to more than 1 per cent, while Sainsbury's are enhanced by 1.52 per cent, suggesting that Sainsbury's staying power at higher levels may be greater than Tesco's. But Mr Jeremy Allun-Jones at Lehman Brothers said: 'Such short term considerations may not count for much if the prize is to be number two in Scotland.' Tesco advanced 5 to 236 1/2 p, while Sainsbury appreciated 4 1/2 to 412p.</p>

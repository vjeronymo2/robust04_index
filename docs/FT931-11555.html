			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Debenture holders approve L&amp;P plan LONDON &amp; PROVINCIAL, the troubled property group, yesterday won approval for its plan to repay Pounds 135m of debentures at less than their face value, the first time in recent memory that holders of secured bonds have accepted such a loss. At a meeting called for the purpose, holders of 92 per cent of the bonds by value agreed to accept the company's offer of Pounds 95 for every Pounds 100 of stock held. They will also receive accrued interest amounting to 430p for every Pounds 100 of stock. The overwhelming support for the offer, with none of the 67 bond holders voting against, reflected a general belief that the offer was generous in the circumstances. Property securing the bonds has halved in value since the summer of 1990, and the company warned investors at the end of last year that it would not be able to meet interest payments. Citibank, banker to the Randsworth group, the parent of London &amp; Provincial which is in receivership, has provided the cash to repay bond holders, the company said. The deal will increase the bank's exposure to the group as a whole by Pounds 109m to some Pounds 333m. At the beginning of January, Citibank announced its intention to make an offer for the property group's shares through an investment subsidiary, though no bid has yet been made.</p>

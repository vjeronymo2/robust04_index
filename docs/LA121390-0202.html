			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: NEW LIFE UNFOLDS FOR TEACHER TURNED ARTIST  </P> <P> Because it has given her a sense of tranquility, Barbara Pearl has cleverly  renamed each of her creations in origami, the Oriental art of paper folding, "a  Peace of Paper."  </P> <P> Her interest came after a somewhat disillusioning career in teaching  mathematics to junior high school students in four states, when she sought  another avenue to happiness.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to give up hope with teaching," the Temple University graduate  said. "I just changed the format."  </P> <P> Pearl felt classrooms were overcrowded, children didn't want to learn and  neither parents nor the administration gave teachers much support.  </P> <P> "There are people in the (school) systems working toward revamping different  areas, but the stress on me was too difficult, and I didn't feel like making  more sacrifices," she said.  </P> <P> The Newport Beach woman found that origami used many of the same geometric  principles she used in teaching mathematics to her students.  </P> <P> "Paper folding brings lines, angles, ratios and proportions into play, giving  it a sense of mathematics," she said, noting she still was teaching  mathematics, only in a different form.  </P> <P> But what it did for Pearl, who studied under origami masters in New York, was  to provide her with a new career in a cottage business in which she  demonstrates origami at birthday and anniversary parties and teaches the art.  </P> <P> "One of these days I plan to make a video on origami for a cable television  show," said Pearl, who has been folding paper into various figures and designs  for a decade. "It's a visual art and needs to be demonstrated.  </P> <P> Pearl has been exhibiting her work each month at libraries in Orange County and  is booked six months in advance.  </P> <P> "People have asked to buy some of my work, but I don't sell any of my work,"  she said. "They are too precious to me to sell. I prefer others to make their  own."  </P> <P> Included in her exhibits are figures of horses, snakes, birds and elephants.  </P> <P> Pearl said American interest in origami has grown in the past decade, after the  founding of the national association of the Friends of the Origami Center of  America in 1980.  </P> <P> The New York-based center boasts a membership of 1,500.  </P> <P> "Learning an art form from another culture is beneficial," said Pearl, who  often gives talks and demonstrations to senior citizens and schoolchildren.  </P> <P> During those sessions, Pearl points out that paper folding is exciting but at  the same time "is also very meditative. It gives you a sense of serenity. You  enjoy the journey as well as the destination."  </P> <P> Although origami has its roots in Asia, Pearl changes the name when she gives  instruction to adults and children at her local Jewish Temple.  </P> <P> Then she calls it Jewish Paper Folding.  </P></p>

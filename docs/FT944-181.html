			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Chinese offshore output dips Crude oil and natural gas output from China's onshore oilfields will fall short of projections this year but rebound slightly in 1995, according to figures released yesterday by the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), the country's top oil producer. China became a net oil importer in 1993 and has struggled to maintain production levels for its maturing fields as imports have increased sharply to meet soaring energy needs. Onshore crude production in 1994 will stand at 139.4m tonnes and natural gas at 15.9bn cubic metres. 0.6 per cent and 3.2 per cent above state-set targets respectively, CNPC said. The 1994 output is below CNPC's January projections of 140m tonnes of crude and 16bn cu m of natural gas.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Gornostayev under the rubric "Problem": </F> "Full-Fledged Membership Is a Necessity. Russia Has Filed a  Petition To Join the Executive Committee of the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees"]    [Text] In recent years the refugee problem which has  alarmed the world for decades has directly affected Russia, too.  A stream of victims of interethnic conflicts in the post-Soviet  space and victims of national discrimination in the former  republics of the Soviet Union has rushed to Russia.    This was perhaps the main reason the Russian Federation  filed  a petition to be admitted as a member of the Executive Committee  of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. This UN structure was  created as early as 1951 when a number of countries developed  and signed the UN Convention on Refugee Status. Russia also  signed this convention in May of last year, thus assuming the  requisite obligations. If the UN approves the Russian  petition--and at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian  Federation they assure us that this will most likely be the  case--the observer status which Russia has at present will be  converted into full-fledged membership. This will not impose any  additional financial obligations on the state because the budget  of the Executive Committee is formed on a voluntary basis.    Two laws actually apply in Russia at present--"On Refugees"  and "On Forced Resettlers." This is why it is important to  determine who is who. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia  believes that otherwise it will be very difficult to take  measures aimed at solving their problems. It is necessary to  solve three problems in order to settle the refugee crisis.    First, we should make every effort to try and extinguish  conflicts on the territory of the former USSR which constitute  the ground zero of human waves sweeping toward Russia, and solve  the problem of discrimination against the Russian-speaking  population in the former Soviet republics, primarily in the  Baltic countries by signing relevant agreements with them.  Incidentally, they are now doing this at Smolenskaya Square  quite intensively.    The second problem is to set up a living for refugees and  forced resettlers; this is handled by the Federal Migration  Service (FMS) which was created in 1992. However, given the  tremendous number of people seeking assistance from the FMS, it  has not been in a position to fine-tune its operation in a  civilized manner over this short period of time. This is why it  is very important for Russia to become a member of the Executive  Committee of the UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees]. The Administrations of the High Commissioner which  have been created in Moscow, Georgia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan  are already helping to solve problems associated with migration.  Obtaining membership in the UNHCR Executive Committee will help  Russia to use the potential of this organization to the fullest  extent. As early as the meetings of the Conference on Security  and Cooperation in Europe in Rome and the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council in Brussels late last year, the head of the  foreign policy establishment of Russia Andrey Kozyrev proposed  to make the institution of the High Commissioner for Refugees  more effective and to reinforce it. These Russian initiatives  were laid down in the Declaration on Aggressive Nationalism,  whose text was also proposed by Moscow.    Cooperation between the Russian Federation and the UNHCR has  already produced favorable results: On 13 January of this year a  communique resolving the issue of the return of resettlers from  Georgia and Abkhazia was signed during Russian-Abkhazian  negotiations with the cooperation of the Administration of the  High Commissioner.    The third task is to prepare and begin actions to resolve  the  problems of foreigners from faraway foreign countries who are  staying in Russian territory illegally. So far, no procedure at  all has been developed for them. As we were told at the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to some estimates we have  0.5 million of them. There are many refugees from Afghanistan,  Angola, and Somalia. The Kurds account for a significant  proportion. There are also natives of Ethiopia, China, and Sri  Lanka. All of them cannot be ignored: After all, according to  the 1951 convention, a person is under its protection from the  moment of filing a petition to be granted refugee status.    Having become a member of the UNHCR Executive Committee,  Russia will be able to influence the enhancement of its role in  the world system in resolving emergency situations: famine,  natural cataclysms, military conflicts, and so on. The structure  of the UNHCR should continuously be the focus for solving the  problems of refugees, and should coordinate work on their  reception and provisioning which is also done by various  organizations such as the International Red Cross, the  International Children's Fund, the UN Food and Agriculture  Organization, and a number of nongovernmental institutions.</p>

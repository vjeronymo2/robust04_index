			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Low-cost drug set to challenge Zantac Zantac, Glaxo's ulcer medication which is the biggest selling drug in the US, is facing a new challenge following an application by a generic drug company to produce a low-cost version of the product there. The latest assault on the dominant position of Zantac, which had sales in the US of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) last year and worldwide sales of Dollars 3.5bn, comes as Glaxo is battling in the courts to uphold a US patent on the product which has eight years left to run. Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, confirmed yesterday that its Geneva Pharmaceuticals subsidiary had filed an application with the US Food and Drug Administration last month to produce a version of Zantac, known as Form 1. This version of the ulcer drug, ranitidine hydrochloride, is thought never have to been produced commercially. Glaxo markets a later version of the drug, known as Form 2. Geneva hopes to make its anti-ulcer drug available by the end of 1995, when Glaxo's US patent on Form 1 expires. Ciba would not say what it expected to charge for the product, but added: 'It'll certainly be cheaper than Zantac.' The two versions of the drug are identical in their effects on patients, according to both Glaxo and Ciba. Form 2, though, is easier to produce, and was adopted by Glaxo as the preferred version in the early 1980s. The UK company questioned yesterday whether a Form 1 product could be produced commercially, and whether it could be manufactured without some elements of Form 2 Zantac also being produced, potentially infringing its patent. Ciba said it was confident it could make the drug. Glaxo also challenged an attempt by Geneva to have its version of the drug approved using a speeded-up approval process applied by the FDA for drugs which were converting from prescription to over-the-counter status. The procedure does not involve time-consuming and expensive trials. Ciba said it expected no obstacles to a quick approval process. Geneva had been involved in two precedents in the US of so-called polymorphs - different versions of the same drug - qualifying for rapid approval, it said. Last summer, Glaxo won a court victory to protect its US patent on Form 2, which expires in 2002. An appeal against this ruling is due to be heard on April 11. Glaxo shares closed down 21 at 662p in London.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Foreign chips take 21.9% of Japan's market The foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market rose to a record 21.9 per cent in the second quarter of 1994. This surpassed the 20 per cent target set in the second US-Japan semiconductor trade agreement, signed in 1991, for the third consecutive quarter. The increase in market share is 'a very welcome development,' said Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. 'Both the Japanese and US industries are to be commended.' However, neither the Japanese nor US industries 'can afford to be complacent,' he warned. 'This is a trade agreement that works,' said the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group representing US chip makers. Japanese industry officials, however, reiterated their position that market share is only one of several measures of market access. The controversial chip pact has become a model for US bilateral agreements with Japan. It was the first such agreement to incorporate 'numerical indicators' of market access, specifically a 20 per cent foreign market share target, to be achieved by the end of 1992 and 'continued, steady progress' throughout the rest of the deal's five-year period which expires in 1996. Japan attempted in July to terminate the semiconductor agreement, the SIA said. During a mid-term review of the agreement that took place in Washington in July, the Japanese government called for the semiconductor agreement to be set aside. US trade officials flatly rejected the call. 'We hope that Japan's effort to terminate prematurely the agreement is not an indication of a lack of commitment to continue to improve market access,' the SIA said. The US wants quantitative measures of market access to be incorporated in agreements that it is attempting to negotiate with Japan on insurance, cars and government procurement. Japan has so far rejected the US demands and negotiations continue under a US threat of trade sanctions.</p>

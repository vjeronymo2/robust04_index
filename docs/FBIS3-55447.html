			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Jan 8, BNS -- President Lennart Meri wants  to have larger powers than what the Estonian Constitution  provides grounds for, said Vello Saatpalu, the head of the  parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission.    Saatpalu was commenting to BNS on the president's refusal to  approve the nominations of the new ministers of finance and  economics.    He called Meri's decision regrettable.    "Our country is on the route towards such a surrogate system  of state government, where it will be soon no more clear if it  is a parliamentary, presidential, or some third kind of a  country," Saatpalu said.    He said the "customs" being introduced by the president had  already long caused his bewilderment.    "Customs like this are at variance with the Estonian  Constitution. I have pointed President Meri's attention to this  already before. Several ambassadors of foreign countries have  turned to me, because they find themselves unable to draw up the  protocol for contacts with Estonia. They cannot understand what  are the power limits of our president," he said.    He said Meri's way of acting with respect to the signing of  agreements with other countries was "fully incomprehensible."    "Estonia belongs to the group of countries of the so-called  Austrian line," he said. These are parliamentary countries, such  as Germany, Austria, Iceland and Greece. The presidents of those  countries never sign foreign agreements; this is being done by  the prime ministers. President Meri, contrary to the spirit of  our constitution, has signed agreements with France and Turkey,"  the head of the parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission said.    He said such conduct by the president might lead to problems  with Russia in the future, when Estonia would have to sign an  interstate treaty.    "What becomes if we told Russia that the treaty will be  signed from the Estonian side by the prime minister? This would  be absolutely impossible," Saatpalu said. He added that  Germany's President Richard Weizsacker "would never do anything  like this."    "Weizsacker would never sign any treaty, for instance, with  Boris Yeltsin. But our president wants to do it himself," he  said.    Saatpalu said the constitutional crisis in Estonia was  expected not to affect the country's position, when the NATO  Council meeting on Jan. 10-11 in Brussels starts discussing the  issue of possible membership of the Baltics in the alliance.    He added that the crisis after all was Estonia's internal  problem.</p>

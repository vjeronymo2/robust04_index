			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: H&amp;C shares fall on statement Shares in Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the plantations, chemicals and commodities company, yesterday fell 4 per cent in a buoyant market as the group sought to rein in expectations for 1993 profits. Mr Bill Turcan, finance director, said a substantial fall in pig and palm oil prices since the interim results meant that many forecasts may have been too high. He stressed that H&amp;C was still on track for a 'useful improvement' in the full year. The shares closed 9p down at 195p after a trading statement which the company insisted was not a profits warning. It was, said Mr Turcan, an attempt to inform the market as a whole, rather than analysts and institutions individually. This was in line with the best practice guidelines encouraged by the Stock Exchange, he said. Analysts welcomed the statement and suggested the share price fall might have been unwarranted. Forecasts for pre-tax profits were marked down from about Pounds 105m to between Pounds 95m and Pounds 100m, against Pounds 85m last year. 'One hopes other companies will not be put off from making this sort of announcement after what happened to Harrisons &amp; Crosfield,' said Mr Andrew Mitchell, investment analyst with Smith New Court. H&amp;C's statement warned that the decline in pig prices would wipe Pounds 6m off profits in the food and agriculture division. The group would seek to allay some of the volatility in pig prices through longer term contracts with retailers. However, that would be difficult to achieve while prices were low. The plantations division had suffered from lower than expected palm oil prices. This meant that profits would be close to the Pounds 12.4m achieved in the first half, instead of about Pounds 16m expected by the market. On a brighter note, H&amp;C said its chemicals division was expected to return profits 'significantly ahead' of 1992. Timber was also expected to improve substantially. Debt and gearing were expected to be unchanged from last year's Pounds 250m and 51 per cent respectively. See Lex</p>

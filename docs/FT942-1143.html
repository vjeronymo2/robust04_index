			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Bulls back off at metal exchange - Week in the Markets London's commodity markets appeared to be heading for an up-beat end to the week yesterday morning with aluminium, coffee and cocoa prices registering significant gains. But the mood changed after lunch as the bulls went into retreat. Aluminium's rise, which took the three months delivery position at the London Metal Exchange to a 39-month high of Dollars 1,505 a tonne, was encouraged by news of a big fall in exchange warehouse stocks - the third in a row - which traders saw as confirmation that the voluntary output reductions announced following the greement reached by leading producing countries in January were beginning to bite. As the metal topped the Dollars 1,500 mark, however, concerns were raised about the possibility that more remunerative prices might encourage companies to reverse some of the cuts. 'An awful lot of producers who have cut back must now be wondering if they should think about re-starting some of those pot-lines,' Mr Anthony Bird, of industry specialists Anthony Bird and Associates, told the Reuters news agency. That helped to undermine sentiment and by the close the three months price was back to Dollars 1,490.50 a tonne, up just Dollars 3 on the day and Dollars 20 on the week. The copper market had already begun drawing in its horns after its spike on Thursday to a fresh 21-month high of Dollars 2,507 a tonne for three months delivery. Renewed profit-taking trimmed more off the gains after an early rally yesterday and the three months price closed at Dollars 2,467.50 a tonne, down Dollars 16 on the day but still Dollars 20 up on balance. The selling was influenced by a smaller than expected LME stocks fall, traders said, and by improved availability of metal for immediate delivery. 'Copper will get back above Dollars 2,500 and aluminium above Dollars 1,500, once the reactions are out of the way,' one trader told Reuters, however. 'When that happens we will see the others being bought also.' The London Commodity Exchange robusta coffee ended a see-sawing week near its lows after a strong early rise yesterday was surrendered during the afternoon. The rally, which lifted the September futures price by Dollars 85 to Dollars 2,325 a tonne, had been prompted by a warning of a possible frost in Brazilian growing areas at the weekend. But traders quickly came to the conclusion that the rise had been overdone, if not unjustified, and the price subsided to end at Dollars 2,255 a tonne, up Dollars 15 on the day but Dollars 79 down on the week. 'It's been a tale of rumour and counter-rumour today,' a dealer told Reuters. 'There was a period of shortcovering earlier, then when the forecasts were seen as not so bad there was light general selling.' 'It seems it's going to be cold (in Brazil) and there's a possibility of frost,' said another, 'but it could be a case of buy the rumour, sell the confirmation.' Cocoa futures followed a similar pattern, and for the similar reasons. the September LCE price bounced to Pounds 991 a tonne before closing Pounds 11 down at Pounds 965. That took the fall on the week to Pounds 71. At London's International Petroleum Exchange Brent blend crude oil futures traded uncertainly in its new, higher range, ending the week a few cents lower. But traders remained optimistic that fundamentals remained positive and that the upward trend was intact.  ------------------------------------------------ (As at Thursday's close)                             tonnes  ------------------------------------------------ Aluminium            -13,675  to  2,634,750 Aluminium alloy         -140  to     30,280 Copper                  -475  to    356,900 Lead                    -300  to    360,350 Nickel                   -30  to    132,072 Zinc                  +4,800  to  1,197,125 Tin                     +785  to     30,805  ------------------------------------------------</p>

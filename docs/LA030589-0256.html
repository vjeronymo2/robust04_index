			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TAKEOFF DELAYED;  </P> <P> NEW AIRPORT PARKING FACILITY OPENS AFTER BALKY TICKET MACHINE STALLS CEREMONY  </P> <P> On a stage on the top level of the new John Wayne Airport southwest parking  structure, dignitaries stood around a yellow machine Saturday and watched as  the button marked "Take Ticket" was pushed.  </P> <P> But the group, which had gathered for the dedication of the first completed  building of the ambitious airport expansion program, waited in vain.  </P> <P> Robert Matranga of Bomel Construction Co., the builder, pressed the button a  few more times, each time a little more frantically. Still nothing.  </P> <P> "Oh, well," John Wayne Airport Manager George A. Rebella joked, "another  typical airport power failure."  </P> <P> With that reference to a power failure affecting a runway last month, and to a  series of construction snafus that have bogged down the airport's $310-million  expansion, airport and county officials officially dedicated the 1,476-space  parking structure designed to take John Wayne Airport into the future.  </P> <P> County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes the airport, called  the structure "another milestone in John Wayne Airport's history."  </P> <P> "This is another of our efforts to bring Orange County's air transport service  into the 20th Century," Riley said.  </P> <P> The four-level structure was scheduled to open for short-term parking at 8 p.m.  Saturday, and be available for parking daily from 6 a.m. to midnight. Shuttle  service will take people to the terminals every 10 to 15 minutes.  </P> <P> A new 337,000-foot terminal has been scheduled to open by April, 1990. But the  entire project, which will also add a total of 8,400 new parking spaces, has  been plagued by problems.  </P> <P> After months of controversy about alleged design errors and cost overruns, the  Orange County Grand Jury began an investigation in December and concluded a  month later that the new passenger terminal was 4 months behind schedule and  probably would not open on time.  </P> <P> On Saturday, however, officials were optimistic.  </P> <P> "I'm glad we were able to open (the garage) on time, like we expect to open the  terminal building on time," said Richard Begley, project director for  Irvine-based HPV Inc., the firm managing the expansion program. "Even though  it's running into a few little glitches here and there, it's running on time.  </P> <P> "This is the first evidence to the public that this project is getting  somewhere, and it is," Begley said.  </P> <P> The event featured an exhibit of antique cars, model planes and bicycles; a  fashion show featuring women's wear from the last 100 years, and music from the  International Youth Choir.  </P></p>

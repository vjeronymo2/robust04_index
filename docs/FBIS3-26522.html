The job  assignment rate hit a record high and the job-awaiting rate  dropped to a new low in many years. By the end of last year,  more than 29,000 people were provided jobs, the job assignment  rate being 92.36 percent, an increase of 4.27 percent over the  previous year, overfulfilling the job assignment target set by  the provincial government. Last year the job-awaiting rate in  cities and towns dropped to 2.9 percent, ranking in the  forefront of the country.    Qiu Baichuan, chief of the provincial employment service  bureau, said during an interview with our reporter that last  year's good achievements in job assignments was mainly due to  the establishment of the socialist market economic structure,  which effectively promoted the carrying out of labor system  reform and provided a policy guarantee and a relaxed environment  for employment. Last year the province's national economy  remained at a two-digit development rate, thus providing many  job opportunities and positions for job-awaiting people and job  seekers. In addition, the development of market economy greatly  changed people's employment concept. Last year the number of  people who obtained jobs in collective, individual, and private  enterprises accounted for 80.41 percent of the total number of  people who got employment.</p>

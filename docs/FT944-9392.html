			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Angola forces sign truce to end civil war Angola's government and Unita rebel forces yesterday signed a truce aimed at halting nearly two decades of civil war. According to the United Nations the agreement, due to take effect today, is expected to remain in force until November 22, after which a permanent ceasefire is to come into force. The truce was signed as southern African leaders met in Zambia in an urgent attempt to keep Angola's faltering peace accord on track after a last-minute postponement of the signing of a formal peace accord, painstakingly negotiated by United Nations mediators over 11 months. Mr Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's deputy president, had warned Angolan leaders that regional countries would take action - widely seen as including military intervention - should the latest Angolan peace bid crumble. Under the truce, which represents only part of the formal peace plan and was signed by top generals of the government and Unita, fighting will halt at 8pm today. A formal peace accord is due to be signed on Sunday. The truce will remain in effect until the ceasefire called for in the peace accord takes effect at midnight November 22. The signing of a formal accord had been delayed because Angola's Unita rebels refused to sign while government forces were intensifying the war. The government and Unita initialled the formal pact two weeks ago, but since then Angolan government army troops overran Unita's stronghold of Huambo in central Angola. The Angola war has severely tested the capacity of the southern African states, which originally came together to help overthow white minority rule in Rhodesia and South Africa, to act as guarantors of a peace settlement based on democracy. If such a regional security pact grouping can succeed in southern Africa, it could set an example of conflict resolution in other troubled areas of the continent. Angola is no different from other African states where an upsurge of violence has frequently preceded peace agreements. However the MPLA government may have turned the tables on Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of Unita. Since he rejected his 1992 election defeat, he has tried to win an ascendancy on the battlefield hoping it would be reflected in the composition of the government emerging from the Lusaka peace talks. The MPLA, however, seems to have based its strategy on two more astute assumptions. The first was that it could take Huambo. The second was that international opinion would come down on its side. When Mr Savimbi resorted to war after his election defeat he lost most of his friends in western capitals. The MPLA has played a devious game, breaking the spirit of the Lusaka talks, but Unita's cries of foul play have won little sympathy. No one underestimates the capacity of Mr Savimbi further to disrupt the peace process. Even if the signing goes ahead on Sunday formidable obstacles remain - not least the integration of two rival forces into a national army. But regional and international developments are putting him under intense pressure. The prize is peace in a region where the wars for independence began in the early 1960s. Even the unpredictable Mr Savimbi must realise knows that sooner or later he has to settle his differences at the conference table and abide by the result.</p>

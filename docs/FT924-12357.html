			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Leyland DAF may cut production PRODUCTION at Leyland DAF's Birmingham van manufacturing plant is expected to be halted for up to two weeks because of a continuing slump in the UK's light commercial vehicles market. Some 2,000 workers building DAF 200/400 vans, once known as Freight Rover Sherpas, will be told later this week whether they will be joining market leader Ford in production cuts. Ford's Southampton plant, which makes Transit vans, is at a standstill this week because of the sales decline. Mr David Gill, Leyland DAF's managing director, marketing and sales, emphasised at the Birmingham motor show yesterday that a final decision had yet to be taken. It is expected that, if production cuts do go ahead, assembly line workers will be redeployed to other tasks in the plant rather than sent home. The Anglo-Dutch company has come under pressure to make the cuts although it increased its volume sales by 5 per cent this year, in a UK van market down a further 5 per cent compared with 1991. The industry faces a market that has fallen by about 40 per cent compared with record 1989 levels. Leyland DAF exports about 40 per cent of its van output, but that no longer appears sufficient for the company to maintain full-time single-shift production. An annual review of the UK motor industry to be presented at the show today by Albert E. Sharp, Birmingham stockbrokers, takes an optimistic view of export prospects for the UK vehicles industry as a result of sterling's devaluation. The UK's balance-of-trade deficit on motor products is likely to be transformed from deficit to up to a Pounds 10bn surplus, the review argues.</p>

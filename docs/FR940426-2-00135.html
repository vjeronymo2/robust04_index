			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many public transit agencies pointed out that even under the current guidance, cost is only one factor that grantees may consider in determining whether or not to privatize service. The participation of private operators ``to the maximum extent feasible'' may also depend on the quality, reliability, or the specialized nature of the service they provide. Several grantees stated that, based on their own specific local needs, even if the requirements to use the fully allocated cost methodology and other elements of the current guidance are rescinded, they will continue to seek proposals for transit service from private providers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the complexity and difficulty of applying the fully allocated cost methodology and its dubious value as an analytical tool, FTA concludes that grantees should no longer be required to use it when comparing public and private costs of operating a particular service. Instead, recipients should use any reasonable and generally accepted accounting method they find appropriate under their local circumstances. FTA believes that recision of this element will relieve local officials of an undue administrative burden while increasing their flexibility to determine whether service is ``to be operated by public or private mass transportation companies as determined by local needs,'' consistent with section 2(b) of the FT Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Local Institutional Barriers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1984 Policy Statement and the circulars provide that FTA will not recognize, as acceptable limitations on private enterprise participation, local institutional and policy constraints such as local labor agreements or local laws or policy that call for direct operation of mass transit service. In the Notice, FTA noted the view of many grantees that this position unduly restricts the prerogatives of local officials and impedes their ability to consider a broad range of transit options. Moreover, the successful negotiation of collective bargaining agreements often requires that transit officials be accorded a maximum degree of bargaining flexibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters representing the private sector objected to FTA's proposed recision of this policy. One argued that this proposal, if adopted, would further entrench institutional barriers, resulting in a stifled marketplace, steadily declining ridership, and steadily increasing costs for services. Another noted that Federal financial assistance necessarily comes with overriding Federal conditions, such as ADA mandates or environmental quality requirements. Generally speaking, these commenters maintained that breaking down institutional barriers is a necessary precondition to enabling competition to develop new and more efficient means to deliver transit services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters for the public sector supported FTA's proposal to recognize that there can be legitimate institutional barriers to privatization. These commenters stated that FTA's use of the grant program to override state constitutional prohibitions, state/local laws and referenda, rulings of state regulatory bodies, and local collective bargaining agreements has had the net effect of depriving local transportation leaders of the flexibility to determine to what extent privatization is in the best interest of their local community. Another commenter asserted that this aspect of FTA's private enterprise guidance, and its often vigorous implementation, has encouraged grantees to renege on or contravene the terms of collective bargaining agreements concluded under section 13(c) of the FT Act, which mandates that grantees afford certain protections to transit workers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One grantee noted that as a result of a recent State Supreme Court ruling, the contracting out of bus routes is subject to negotiation and binding arbitration with its labor union. Given that fixed route service is at the core of the collective bargaining unit's work function, the grantee stated, the union's concurrence in any decision to privatize existing fixed route bus service is unlikely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another grantee stated that it was adversely affected by this failure to recognize institutional barriers when, in 1989 and 1990, FTA refused to make two section 9 grant awards because local requirements in section 13(c) agreements required the successful proposer to take on the employees of the outgoing private operators. FTA held that this successor employer clause was unacceptable under the FT Act because the provision limited the ability of proposers to submit competitive bids. The issue was resolved only when Congress adopted special legislation allowing the particular grantee's use of the successor clause. Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1991, Public Law 501&hyph;516, section 335, and Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1993, Public Law 102&hyph;388, section 342. A review of FTA files reveals several similar instances in which grantees were threatened with suspension or withdrawal of FTA funds because of the existence of local institutional barriers to private sector participation in their mass transit programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter for the private sector noted that the congressional action mentioned above was limited in applicability to one particular grantee and argued that one can therefore infer congressional approval of the overall existing policy. FTA finds that argument entirely speculative. Congress has never specifically approved this or any other aspect of the current private enterprise policy. Congress' intervention in that case is instead consistent with its pattern since 1984 of allowing FTA discretion in defining and implementing the private sector provisions, but of curtailing the agency's action when it threatened local officials' wide discretion in determining the feasibility of using private operators. FTA believes, moreover, that in view of such legal and collective bargaining impediments, the requirement that a grantee ignore institutional barriers to private sector involvement is not reasonable. It sometimes places grantees in the untenable position of being required to violate State or local laws, court rulings, or the terms of their own statutorily mandated collective bargaining agreements in order to receive funds under the FT Act, which states that such funds may be used to provide service ``to be operated by public or private mass transportation companies, as determined by local needs.'' 49 U.S.C. app. 1601(b)(3). Accordingly, this aspect of the guidance is an unacceptable restraint on a grantee's statutory responsibility to determine what level of private sector involvement is feasible based on particular local factors. FTA further notes that, like other elements of the current policy, the institutional barriers provision does not rest on specific statutory authority, but instead was adopted for policy reasons, without prior notice and comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

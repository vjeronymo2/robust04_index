			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["The U.S. Urged To Choose Package Solution"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of  the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) [SKNDF]  released a letter on May 18 exposing the nuclear clamour of the  U.S. imperialists and its followers, according to the  Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation.    The letter consists of "1. Escalation of `Nuclear Issue'", "  2. Fabrication of `Nuclear Suspicion'" and "3. Recipe for  Solution to Nuclear Issue on the Korean Peninsula."    Noting that "the nuclear issue" of the North of Korea is an  offspring of the premediated and systematic anti-DPRK nuclear  clamor raised by the United States to stifle the North, the  letter says such criminal moves have been escalated through the  stages of the rumor about "nuclear development sign," the rumor  about "nuclear development" and the rumor about "possession of  nuclear weapons."    The rumor about "nuclear development sign" invented by the  United States boils down to the allegation that "a large-scale  research complex surrounded by anti-aircraft guns was found in  Yongbyon, which is classified as nuclear facilities designed to  manufacture nuclear bombs," "a 30 mw reactor is in operation,  which seems to be for military use as there is no power cable  there," "a newly-built long building is guessed to be  reprocessing facility" and "the new puddles on the shores of the  River Kuryong are surmised to be traces of high explosion test."    Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic  Energy Agency, told a press conference in Beijing that the  nuclear inspection proved the nuclear facilities of the North  are used for peaceful purpose and that they "have found no  reliable evidence of nuclear arms development" in the North.    Failing to deceive the world people with the rumor about  "nuclear development sign," the United States summoned IAEA  inspectors to Washington to frame another plot, the rumor about  "nuclear arms development." It spread the rumor that it "found  out that North Korea reprocessed nuclear fuel in [words  indistinct] and early 1992" and instigated IAEA officials to  suddenly insist on "inconsistencies in principle" between the  DPRK's initial report and the result of the IAEA's measurement  in the quantity of plutonium extracted from fuel rods.    With the rumors about "nuclear development sign" and  "nuclear  arms development" ineffective, the United States resumed the  once suspended Team Spirit nuclear war exercises and egged the  IAEA on to try to force the North to accept "special inspection"  of its military sites. Then, it began spreading another false  report that the North "has produced nuclear weapons and hid  them." In an attempt to justify the false report, the United  States, availing itself of the name of Russia's KGB and the  British intelligence agency, alleged that the North  "manufactured small nuclear bombs and concealed them in a silo."    The United States is now trying to justify the rumor about  "the North's possession of nuclear weapons" spread by itself.    The letter says the U.S. and South Korean rulers have left  no  stone unturned in their efforts to accuse the North of "nuclear  arms development."    "The nuclear suspicion" against the North was fabricated and  spread by the U.S. intelligence authorities. It started in July  1989 when a false information that "the North's nuclear arms  development facilities were snapped" by a U.S. paper THE  WASHINGTON POST. In a bid to give objectivity and credibility  to it, the U.S. intelligence authorities opened to the public in  September 1989 a photograph allegedly taken by the French  orbiting observatory spot.    Nuclear experts, however, said the picture taken by the  intelligence satellite lacks clearness for distinguishing the  shapes, holding that the capability of the satellite was  exaggerated.    Director of the U.S. CIA James Woolsey is now alleging "the  North not only has enough plutonium for manufacturing a nuclear  bomb but also will have plutonium enough to produce an A-bomb at  intervals of four or six weeks by next year when it has a 25 mw  reactor far bigger than the existing one."    Informations concocted by intelligence services are  reproduced on an enlarged scale by government mouthpieces.    As regards the North's "nuclear issue," government  mouthpieces of South Korea and the West described the 5 mw  experimental conversion reactor in the North as "a 30 mw  reactor" (South Korean CHOSON ILBO and HANKUK ILBO), the two  commercial reactors now under construction as "completed  reactors for the production of plutonium" (TONG-A ILBO) and the  radiochemical laboratory under construction as " reprocessing  facility in operation" (the U.S. ABC and Japanese ASAHI SHIMBUN.)  <H5>  Distorted Reports Are Added to Exaggerated Reports. </H5>   When the result of the first nuclear inspection proving that  the North's nuclear facilities were peaceful ones was published  at a meeting of the board of governors of the IAEA in June 1992,  the South Korean ambassador in charge of atomic energy  cooperation told reporters "the suspicion was proved." Then,  nearly all the venal papers of South Korea and no small number  of foreign media flashed the false news that "the North's  nuclear facilities have been proved to be for the production of  nuclear weapons and to be reprocessing facilities."    THE WASHINGTON POST carried a groundless report that North  Korea was "moving the reprocessing facilities in Yongbyon with  trucks," while TONG-A ILBO said North Korea was "operating  uranium-enriching facilities."    Today the Heritage Foundation of the United States, the  technical information centre of Tokai University of Japan, the  Defense Development Institute of South Korea and other  unprincipled institutes and pretended scholars are inventing  various presumptions to spread "nuclear suspicion," branding all  the peaceful nuclear facilities of the North as military ones.    They are now spreading various rumors -- the graphite  reactor  is for the production of nuclear bombs because it can turn out  more plutonium than other reactors.    While circulating such rumors, the U.S. authorities have  appeared on the stage to make "the North's nuclear issue" a  serious, pending political issue.    The U.S. authorities formed a high-level policy mediation  team, a permanent organization for consulting and adjusting the  positions of departments in the administration to deal with "the  nuclear issue of the North" on the governmental level by closely  combining diplomacy with military.    Meanwhile, the United States uses the South Korean and  Japanese authorities as its lackeys in politicizing "the nuclear  issue of the North." It summoned No Tae-u to Washington in July  and September 1991 and ordered him to deal with "the nuclear  issue" as a pending issue in inter-Korean relations. The South  Korea-U.S. summit talks in Seoul in July 1993 and in Washington  in November 1993 Clinton decided with Kim Yong-sam, to further  strengthen "close cooperation and cooperation system between  South Korea and the United States."    The United States dispatched secret envoys to Tokyo in March  and May, 1991, to urge Japan to take a joint action with South  Korea and the United States in the negotiations for diplomatic  relations with the North and restrain from economic assistance  until the North received nuclear inspection. At the summit  between Bill Clinton and Morihiro Hosokawa in February last,  they came to an agreement that resolute measures including  sanctions are necessary unless the North accepts nuclear  inspection."    Under the manipulation of the United States, the South  Korean  and Japanese authorities have acted a shock brigade in the  nuclear clamour.    The United States has enlarged "the nuclear issue of the  North" as an international issue by mobilizing its allies with  the "cooperation system" of the U.S., Japan and South Korea as  the axis and international organizations under its influence.    After bringing "the nuclear issue of the North" to the  United  Nations by abusing the IAEA, it had an unreasonable "resolution"  demanding nuclear inspection of the North adopted at the 48th UN  General Assembly session in November last year. And it invented  "a presidential statement" of the UN Security Council on March  31, 1994, demanding the "completion of inspections." It  intensified pressure upon Pyongyang, setting a deadline and  threatening many- sided "sanctions" against it.    "The nuclear issue" fabricated by Washington is "a means of  stifling socialism of the North by collective sanctions as the  "strategy of peaceful transition" is impossible to destroy it"  and "nuclear inspection" is "preliminaries for detecting the  North's military facilities to disarm, incapacitate and open it  under the pax-Americana order."    The United States must not try to use the fictitious  "nuclear  issue of the North" for destroying the North's socialism,  selling arms to South Korea and maintaining its troops and  nuclear weapons in South Korea but choose package solution for  resolving the Korean nuclear problem and normalizing ties with  the DPRK as it announced to the world in the DPRK-USA joint  statement.</p>

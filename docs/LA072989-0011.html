			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MURRAY NOT FOUND IN THIS GOOD BOOKIE  </P> <P> Gee, the pulpit's still warm. Jim Murray must have just left.  </P> <P> Why not throw a few bucks Oregon's way? Because of some long-ago ignored edict?  Do we, the people, bury our heads in the sand and wish away gambling?  </P> <P> I have a cousin who happens to be a Catholic priest. Each year, he and I wager  on who will finish higher in the standings, the Angels or Chicago White Sox.  </P> <P> Is he a sinner now, morally inept? Does Father Murray proclaim himself more  righteous than my cousin?  </P> <P> My point is, gambling is a victim-less "crime." There are quite a few of us who  are able to function every day and keep betting in its place.  </P> <P> Why should Oregonians gamble and see their monetary losses driven out of the  state to Nevada. This way, it all stays home and the losses help the state  colleges.  </P> <P> I excuse the vicar of The Times for calling me a low life.  </P> <P> GREG MURPHY  </P> <P> Pacoima  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> AVOIDING THE VIET SYNDROME: A NEW FALLACY;  </P> <P> ADVOCATES OF SUDDEN, MASSIVE FORCE CLAIM THE REASON FOR VIETNAM TRAUMA WAS THE  GRADUAL WAY THE WAR WAS FOUGHT.  </P> <P> When Secretary of State James A. Baker III told Congress that any assault on  Iraq would be carried out "suddenly, massively and decisively," he was issuing  the Bush Administration's final verdict on the lessons of Vietnam. The United  States does not intend to lose another war because the politicians forced the  soldiers to fight with one hand tied behind their backs.  </P> <P> Giving the generals what they want may, however, force the United States to  "win" self-inflicted wars that need never have been fought at all, and whose  ruinous human costs have not been spelled out to a fearful public. That is the  danger in the gulf, and it is diminished only marginally by Saddam Hussein's  decision to release his foreign hostages. That is good news, but it says  nothing about his willingness to get out of Kuwait by Jan. 15. At the same  time, it snaps one of the few thin emotional threads that has bound the U.S.  public to President Bush's policy of brinkmanship.  </P> <P> Once Desert Shield was increased to 400,000 troops, with no prospect of  rotation, the alarming logic of the new doctrine of massive force became  apparent. Logistics began to drive policy. Conventional wisdom is that such a  large force risks destabilizing Saudi Arabia; reducing the numbers would mean a  loss of face; just being there may oblige them to fight -- and soon, before  March 17, the start of Ramadan. (This parody of cultural sensitivity to Islam  is perhaps the most ludicrous aspect of the whole affair. Has it really not  occurred to Washington that the still-smoking rubble of an Arab nation,  humiliated by the infidel, would transform the holy month into a time of  anti-American rage and vengeance for millions of Muslims?)  </P> <P> The fallacy of the new military doctrine is in the premise that the basic  reason for public trauma over Vietnam was the way the war was fought, with a  slow hemorrhaging of American lives. This implies that the problem can be  addressed by a change in military strategy. This narrow reading ignores the  larger lesson of Vietnam, which is that war is politically untenable if it  lacks public support. Any war fought for dubious or ungraspable motives has the  same potential for grief, alienation and division -- and this time public  sympathy is already at levels it did not fall to in Vietnam until 1968.  </P> <P> This time around, anti-war sentiment would not make the cruel mistake of  blaming the soldiers and the veterans. In these four months of waiting, the  troops in the desert have entered our living rooms with a greater electronic  immediacy than their counterparts in Vietnam. Even if the Pentagon managed to  keep the media away from front-line combat, we know these kids already -- those  beardless pilots, straight out of "Top Gun," who speak of victory with all the  nervous bravado of youth; that stolid Marine whose wife ended their satellite  linkup on one breakfast TV show by wishing him "Semper Fi, babe." At least  three out of 10 of the dead would be blacks and Latinos.  </P> <P> And the manner and number of their deaths would be sickening. As a culture, we  have devised many ways of concealing the realities of modern war. We strike  bold postures, naming our aircraft Avenger and Apache, our missiles Hellfire  and Patriot. In brisk bureaucratese, we speak of "smart weapons" and of  "getting the job done." Official casualty predictions for a gulf war are  classified, but the Pentagon has acknowledged that enough blood supplies are in  place to treat 4,000 casualties a day. That's a much heavier casualty rate than  at Iwo Jima. The most pessimistic defense analysts think 30,000 Americans could  die in a single month of desert combat -- close to the battlefield toll of the  entire Korean War.  </P> <P> In this war, the dead might be the lucky ones. "Things are going to happen to  people that we have never seen before," one weapons designer told the  Minneapolis Star-Tribune. Field hospitals are good at digging out shrapnel and  amputating limbs, but they have no clue how to deal with the arcane and  nightmarish injuries that new hi-tech weaponry would inflict on armored vehicle  crews in the desert: things like "blast lung" or "metal fume fever," the  results -- often externally invisible -- of heat, light and shock waves and  vaporized metal. Governments choose not to publicize this kind of information,  writes weapons expert Donald Kennedy in the Army journal Armor, "for fear of  its effects on their armed forces."  </P> <P> In correcting the mistakes of the last war, military thinkers often set in  motion the mistakes of the next one. And while the generals may have put the  Vietnam Syndrome behind them, the Iraq Syndrome may be only just beginning.  </P></p>

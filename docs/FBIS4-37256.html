			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has stated the following: In  a desperate and treacherous criminal act, aircraft belonging to  the traitorous rebels carried out an aggressive raid on the  power generating station in the city of Mocha at 1415 yesterday.  Preliminary reports indicate that this criminal action damaged  the station, martyred 17 citizens, including children, women,  and elderly people, and wounded 33 others. This raid is part of  a series of criminal actions carried out by this traitorous gang  against economic and civilian installations and targets in our  country that began with the firing of Scud missiles at  defenseless civilians in Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, Zinjibar,  and al-Rahidah, and includes the shelling of vital installations  in Aden, led by the Aden refinery and the power generating  station in al-Hiswah. These attacks express this gang's  profound enmity toward the people and their achievements, as  well as its hostile desire to destroy the homeland and implement  the scheme designed to fragment its unity.    The source added that these hideous criminal acts carried  out  by the rebellious gang against economic targets and  installations and residential areas in the cities take place at  a time when many vital installations and targets in Aden, where  this criminal gang is entrenched, lie within range of our  valiant Armed Forces' artillery. Our Armed Forces, however, are  greatly concerned to preserve and protect these installations  from this traitorous clique because they are the property of the  homeland and the people, and also because the Armed Forces are  complying with the leadership's strict instructions not to  inflict any harm on these developmental achievements, which are  the people's wealth and the fruit of their efforts and hard work.</p>

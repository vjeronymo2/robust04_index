			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Cook warning over Daf plants THE constituencies of at least 19 government ministers would be among those to suffer knock-on effects from the closure or running down of Leyland Daf plants in Britain, Labour alleges today. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, says a dossier of Leyland Daf's suppliers he has obtained shows that 6,000 companies - one in every 150 - would be hit if Leyland Daf 'went under'. 'If any Conservative MP thought that Leyland Daf was not their problem, this shows they had better think again,' he said.</p>

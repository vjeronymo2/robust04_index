			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Rome RAI Due Television Network in  Italian at 2045 GMT on 31 January carries 37-minute interview  with Achille Occhetto, secretary of the Democratic Party of the  Left [PDS], by RAI television director Gianni Minoli, on the  program "Mixer."    On a possible government coalition with Mino Martinazzoli's  Italian Popular Party, Occhetto says: "I think our aim should be  two broad groupings, the right and the left. The newly formed  Progressive Alliance [the left coalition] must win and have the  majority. We cannot make the usual center-left mess, albeit a  cleaner one." He adds: "I think in this election campaign, we  have very clearly slammed the door in his face [Mino  Martinazzoli's]."    On the problems of keeping the left's broad coalition  together, Occhetto says: "The thing is that the various forces  of the left -- each one with its own characteristics -- are  trying to unite and confront the risk of a new and an old right.  This is something important: getting together to win the great  match for the government of this country."    On the diverging economic strategies within the coalition of  the left, which includes the hardliners of Fausto Bertinotti's  Communist Renewal Party, he says: "We set off from different  positions, but I must say that, after frank discussions, our  opinions are now more alike. This, I think, is what a real  dialogue within the left should lead to. As for those points on  which there is no agreement, we shall tell the Italians which  ones they are before the elections." Asked whether the presence  of Fausto Bertinotti, the leader of Communist Renewal Party, in  the coalition may be a problem, Occhetto says: "No problem at  all."    On the scheduled and later postponed meeting with NATO's  secretary general, Occhetto says: "Unfortunately he is very ill.  We shall meet another time." He adds: "I wanted to tell him  that we must all react to the situation in Bosnia. We can no  longer go on like this. We must intervene. We must also  strengthen all the world's ruling bodies to settle disputes and  tackle tragic issues, such as drugs and north-south relations."    On his meeting with the U.S. ambassador in Italy, he says:  "It was a very pleasant and interesting meeting. He wanted to  know our opinions on the economy." He adds: "I think I  reassured him very much on one point: that we want to change and  renew, but we want to continue the restructuring program started  by Ciampi."    Answering another question on the different people within  the  coalition of the left, Occhetto says: "Have you ever seen the  American Democratic Party? There are very strange Trotskyites  and crazy reformists within it. What about the Labor Party in  England? Everywhere in modern Europe the left is very varied."  He adds: "The day after tomorrow we shall publish the election  program, not the government program, and you will find that on  these issues we have worked miracles in seeking a common  position."    On Berlusconi's accusations that the Democratic Party of the  Left will follow a policy of high spending, he says: "I'd like  to tell Mr. Berlusconi that we are not the party of taxes. We  want to cut taxes for families and businesses. But we want  those who have never paid taxes to start doing so."    Asked whether Leoluca Orlando, the leader of the Network;  Ottaviano Del Turco, leader of the Italian Socialist Party;  Ferdinando Adornato, leader of the Democratic Alliance; and  Fausto Bertinotti, leader of Communist Refoundation, will really  take part in the coalition of the left, he says: "Yes, I can  guarantee that."    Asked whether the decision taken by Giorgio La Malfa,  secretary of the Italian Republican Party, to join the center  instead of the coalition of the left is a blow to his plans for  the elections, Ochetto says: "Actually it is a blow for him."    On Mario Segni, leader of the Pact for Italy, Occhetto says:  "He has the reputation of being someone who constantly changes  his mind. I must say that his ideas are very clear on one point:  he wants to be prime minister."    Asked many times whether he is a candidate for the post of  prime minister, Occhetto never gives a clear and straight  answer. He says: "The only sure thing is that I do have other  things on my mind and not just the idea of being prime minister.  This unfortunate thing may happen; it would be a task,  something I would have to do, a service."    On the candidates of the left to the post of prime minister  after Ciampi's decision to abandon politics, Occhetto says:  "Ciampi has said he is above all parties. As prime minister, he  took the right decision. I still think that he is a reserve for  democracy in Italy."    On the PDS's much talked-about control of the new RAI,  Occhetto says: "I would rather be a politician like Berlusconi.  He sits comfortably at home, sends a tape around, and he ends  up on all national channels, public and private, on the same  day."    On the number of PDS politicians involved in the Bribesville  scandal, he says: "Bribesville means something very precise:  public and private billions of lire given to parties in return  for some favors. In this respect we have nobody [under  investigation]."    On Bettino Craxi, former leader of the Italian Socialist  Party, and television mogul Silvio Berlusconi, Occhetto says:  "Craxi has said that Berlusconi is filling a gap. It is true,  he is filling the gap left by Craxi. Berlusconi is nothing more  than raw and pure craxism." He adds: "Berlusconi is now saying:  I am the new man. No, you are Bettino Craxi."    On Berlusconi's power in the media and the election  campaign,  Occhetto says: "Last night I watched a film [on one of  Berlusconi's channels]. During the film I was interrupted five  times by a `Forza Italia' [advertisement for Berlusconi's  party]. I asked myself: Who is paying for that election  campaign? If I wanted to broadcast only one of those  advertisements, I would have to stop paying [PDS] employees for  one year -- not only those who work at the headquarters, but  also those who work in the branches all over Italy."    Asked on what he would do in case of victory in the March  elections, Occhetto concludes: "If I won the elections, the  first thing I would do would be to start a 100-day program to  tackle the problem of unemployment with training contracts and  support contracts for all those who are now in a difficult  situation."</p>
